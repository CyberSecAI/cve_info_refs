X.Org Security advisory, August 10, 2011
libXfont LZW decompression heap corruption
CVE ID: CVE-2011-2895

libXfont contains a compress / LZW decompresser implementation based
on the original BSD compress code.  A specially crafted LZW stream can
cause a buffer overflow in an application using libXfont that is used
to open untrusted font files, such as the X server (often run with
elevated privileges) when a client adds a local directory to the font
path.   Successful exploitation may possibly lead to a local privilege
escalation.

Further details are given in the original bug report at:
    <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=725760>

Affected versions
- -----------------

libXfont up to, and including, 1.4.3
X11R7.6 (latest release of the full window system) includes libXfont 1.4.3

Fix
- ---

This issue has been fixed with git commit
  d11ee5886e9d9ec610051a206b135a4cdc1e09a0

<http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/lib/libXfont/commit/?id=d11ee5886e9d9ec610051a206b135a4cdc1e09a0>

A fix of this vulnerability is included in libXfont 1.4.4

The X.Org Foundation thanks Tomas Hoger of the Red Hat Security Response Team
for bringing this issue to our attention and supplying the fix.

libXfont provides the core of the legacy X11 font system, handling the
index files (fonts.dir, fonts.alias, fonts.scale), the various font file
formats, and rasterizing them.   It is used by the X servers, the
X Font Server (xfs), and some font utilities (bdftopcf for instance),
but should not be used by normal X11 clients.  X11 clients access fonts
via either the new API's in libXft, or the legacy API's in libX11.

The major change in this release is a fix for:

    LZW decompress: fix for CVE-2011-2895

    Specially crafted LZW stream can crash an application using libXfont
    that is used to open untrusted font files.  With X server, this may
    allow privilege escalation when exploited

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=727624#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2011-08-02 16:00:47 UTC  ``` BSD compress implemented an LZW compressor and decompressor.  This decompressor implementation did not correctly handle compressed streams that contain code words that were not yet added to the decompression table.  LZW decompression has a special case (a KwKwK string) when code word may match the first free entry in the decompression table.  The implementation used in BSD compress allow code words not only matching, but also exceeding the first free entry.  It seems this compress implementation first appeared in BSD around 1985, and was later used in various other code base, such as ncompress and gzip.  Other components that contain affected code will be listed below.  Following page list the version of the code as was used in 4.3BSD:  <http://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=4.3BSD-Reno/src/usr.bin/compress/compress.c>  Relevant code appears in the decompress() routine:  	/* 	 * Special case for KwKwK string. 	 */ 	if ( code >= free_ent ) {             *stackp++ = finchar; 	    code = oldcode; 	}  This allows creating a loop in the decompression table, which leads to an "infinite" loop:  	/* 	 * Generate output characters in reverse order 	 */ #ifdef SIGNED_COMPARE_SLOW 	while ( ((unsigned long)code) >= ((unsigned long)256) ) { #else 	while ( code >= 256 ) { #endif 	    *stackp++ = tab_suffixof(code); 	    code = tab_prefixof(code); 	}  where tab_prefixof is:    unsigned short codetab [HSIZE];   #define codetabof(i)	codetab[i]   #define tab_prefixof(i)	codetabof(i)  This overflows de_stack "buffer" (part of the htab[]):    count_int htab [HSIZE];   # define tab_suffixof(i)	((char_type *)(htab))[i]   # define de_stack		((char_type *)&tab_suffixof(1<<BITS))  Depending on the relative htab[] and codetab[] positions, de_stack overflow may overwrite codetab[] entries, which may break infinite loop and let program continue its execution with possibly corrupted memory.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=727624#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2011-08-02 18:13:21 UTC  ``` Following projects embed this BSD compress code and have fixed this issue already, either by aborting compression when code > free_ent is encountered, or by protecting against de_stack overflow in the while loop.  ncompress - code > free_ent check <http://ncompress.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=ncompress/ncompress;a=blob;f=compress.c;h=c16e1239#l1167>  gzip - code > free_ent check <http://git.savannah.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=gzip.git;a=blob;f=unlzw.c;h=63f941c6#l297>  libarchive - code > free_ent check <http://code.google.com/p/libarchive/source/browse/trunk/libarchive/archive_read_support_filter_compress.c?r=3195#375>  busybox's libarchive - code > free_ent check <http://git.busybox.net/busybox/tree/archival/libarchive/decompress_uncompress.c?id=833d4e7f#n220>  OpenBSD compress - stack overflow check <http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/usr.bin/compress/zopen.c#rev1.17> It seems this fix never made it to other BSDs as FreeBSD or NetBSD.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=727624#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2011-08-02 16:00:47 UTC  ``` BSD compress implemented an LZW compressor and decompressor.  This decompressor implementation did not correctly handle compressed streams that contain code words that were not yet added to the decompression table.  LZW decompression has a special case (a KwKwK string) when code word may match the first free entry in the decompression table.  The implementation used in BSD compress allow code words not only matching, but also exceeding the first free entry.  It seems this compress implementation first appeared in BSD around 1985, and was later used in various other code base, such as ncompress and gzip.  Other components that contain affected code will be listed below.  Following page list the version of the code as was used in 4.3BSD:  <http://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=4.3BSD-Reno/src/usr.bin/compress/compress.c>  Relevant code appears in the decompress() routine:  	/* 	 * Special case for KwKwK string. 	 */ 	if ( code >= free_ent ) {             *stackp++ = finchar; 	    code = oldcode; 	}  This allows creating a loop in the decompression table, which leads to an "infinite" loop:  	/* 	 * Generate output characters in reverse order 	 */ #ifdef SIGNED_COMPARE_SLOW 	while ( ((unsigned long)code) >= ((unsigned long)256) ) { #else 	while ( code >= 256 ) { #endif 	    *stackp++ = tab_suffixof(code); 	    code = tab_prefixof(code); 	}  where tab_prefixof is:    unsigned short codetab [HSIZE];   #define codetabof(i)	codetab[i]   #define tab_prefixof(i)	codetabof(i)  This overflows de_stack "buffer" (part of the htab[]):    count_int htab [HSIZE];   # define tab_suffixof(i)	((char_type *)(htab))[i]   # define de_stack		((char_type *)&tab_suffixof(1<<BITS))  Depending on the relative htab[] and codetab[] positions, de_stack overflow may overwrite codetab[] entries, which may break infinite loop and let program continue its execution with possibly corrupted memory.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=727624#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2011-08-02 18:13:21 UTC  ``` Following projects embed this BSD compress code and have fixed this issue already, either by aborting compression when code > free_ent is encountered, or by protecting against de_stack overflow in the while loop.  ncompress - code > free_ent check <http://ncompress.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=ncompress/ncompress;a=blob;f=compress.c;h=c16e1239#l1167>  gzip - code > free_ent check <http://git.savannah.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=gzip.git;a=blob;f=unlzw.c;h=63f941c6#l297>  libarchive - code > free_ent check <http://code.google.com/p/libarchive/source/browse/trunk/libarchive/archive_read_support_filter_compress.c?r=3195#375>  busybox's libarchive - code > free_ent check <http://git.busybox.net/busybox/tree/archival/libarchive/decompress_uncompress.c?id=833d4e7f#n220>  OpenBSD compress - stack overflow check <http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/usr.bin/compress/zopen.c#rev1.17> It seems this fix never made it to other BSDs as FreeBSD or NetBSD.

Subject: LZW decompression issues

Hi!

We've recently came across an issue in commonly re-used LZW
decompression implementations - original BSD compress and GIF reader
written by David Koblas.  Due to an insufficient input checking, invalid
LZW stream can create a loop in the decompression table, leading to the
decompression stack buffer overflow.

Following bugzillas list various code bases that were checked for the
issue and if they are affected or not:
<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2011-2895>
<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2011-2896>

Many code bases are unaffected as the problem was fixed in the past,
so this is probably like N-th re-discovery of the issue.  Some previous
fixes were called security (CVE-2006-1168), some were not.  The problem
may not be security relevant, or have much security impact in all
currently affected code bases, though please mail the list if you come
across any other affected code base that is not already mentioned and
that may be worth fixing.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

NetBSD Security Advisory 2011-007
=================================
Topic: LZW decoding loop on manipulated compressed files
Version: NetBSD-current: source prior to Aug 17th, 2011
NetBSD 5.0.\*: affected
NetBSD 5.0: affected
NetBSD 5.1: affected
NetBSD 4.0.\*: affected
NetBSD 4.0: affected
Severity: Denial of Service, possible Information Leak
Fixed: NetBSD-current: Aug 16th, 2011
NetBSD-5-0 branch: Aug 19th, 2011
(5.0.3 will include the fix)
NetBSD-5-1 branch: Aug 19th, 2011
(5.1.1 will include the fix)
NetBSD-5 branch: Aug 19th, 2011
NetBSD-4-0 branch: Aug 19th, 2011
NetBSD-4 branch: Aug 19th, 2011
Please note that NetBSD releases prior to 4.0 are no longer supported.
It is recommended that all users upgrade to a supported release.
Abstract
========
A highly compressable input file could overflow the uncompression stack
in libXfont. Also, specially crafted compressed files could cause gzip(1)
and compress(1) to go into an endless loop or overflow their uncompression
stack.
This vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2011-2895.
Technical Details
=================
There are two different issues termed "lzw uncompress issue".
The first one is libXfont and the corresponding copy in XFree86's server.
It contains a broken size definition of the uncompression stack.
If you create a highly compressable input file (e.g. from /dev/zero)
and pipe it through compress(1), the result can trivially overflow
the decompression stack.
For gzip(1) and compress(1), there was an issue with the input validation.
If the LZW input stream was manipulated to contain code words larger
than the current free entry, the decompressor would access uninitialised
memory. Depending on the content of this region, it is possible that
the output processing would loop or overflow the output stack.
While freetype and freetype2 have the same input validation issue, they
are protected by the use of memset(3) on some internal tables.
Both libarchive and GNU gzip contain the necessary input validation to
avoid the problem.
Solutions and Workarounds
=========================
Via download:
+++++++++++++
Download base.tgz and xbase.tgz from
http://nyftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD-daily////binary/sets/
or a mirror, with version being eg netbsd-4, date being a build version,
and arch being the appropriate architecture.
Install the downloaded files via eg
# cd /
# tar xzpf /path/to/base.tgz
# tar xzpf /path/to/xbase.tgz
If you have been running any X11 server or client binaries on your
machine, you will have to restart them now, or to reboot the machine
in order to ensure all bits of vulnerable code have been purged from
memory.
Via building:
+++++++++++++
Patch, recompile, and reinstall the library and binaries.

netbsd-4-0 src/usr.bin/gzip/zuncompress.c 1.6.16.1
netbsd-4 src/usr.bin/gzip/zuncompress.c 1.6.6.1
The following instructions briefly summarize how to update and
recompile the involved library and binaries. Replace:
VERSION with the fixed version from the appropriate CVS branch
(from the above table)
FILE with the name of the file from the above table
For libXfont:
depending on your architecture and release version you will be using
XFree86 or Xorg. NetBSD-4 only has XFree, in later versions check by running
ls -l /usr/X11R?/man/man5/xorg.conf.5; its presence implies Xorg.
# cd
# cvs update -r VERSION FILE
For compress and gzip, each:
# cd
# cvs update -r VERSION FILE
Then build and install:
# cd src
# ./build.sh -x -u  distribution
# ./build.sh install=/

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=725760#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2011-07-26 13:41:27 UTC  ``` libXfont contains a compress / LZW decompressor implementation.  This implementation does not correctly handle compressed streams that contain code words that were not yet added to the decompression table.  LZW decompression has a special case (a KwKwK string) when code word matches the first free entry in the decompression table.  The implementation used in libXfont allow code words not only matching, but also exceeding the first free entry.  Relevant code appears in BufCompressedFill() in src/fontfile/decompress.c:          /*          * Special case for KwKwK string.          */         if ( code >= file->free_ent ) {             *stackp++ = finchar;             code = oldcode;         }  <http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/lib/libXfont/tree/src/fontfile/decompress.c?id=f29f1d68d7eca96e45ba3758686be07993d82e03#n249>  This allows creating a loop in the decompression table, which leads to an "infinite" loop:          /*          * Generate output characters in reverse order          */         while ( code >= 256 )         {             *stackp++ = file->tab_suffix[code];             code = file->tab_prefix[code];         }  <http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/lib/libXfont/tree/src/fontfile/decompress.c?id=f29f1d68d7eca96e45ba3758686be07993d82e03#n257>  and heap-based buffer overflow (CompressedFile's de_stack[]):          char_type       de_stack[STACK_SIZE];         char_type       *tab_suffix;         unsigned short  *tab_prefix;     } CompressedFile;  <http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/lib/libXfont/tree/src/fontfile/decompress.c?id=f29f1d68d7eca96e45ba3758686be07993d82e03#n121>   Once stackp is incremented to point to after de_stack[] buffer end, tab_suffix and tab_prefix pointers are corrupted, which may lead to arbitrary memory corruption.  libXfont is used by X server and can parse arbitrary user-supplied font file.  Successful exploitation may possibly lead to a local privilege escalation.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=725760#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2011-07-26 13:48:07 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=725760#c0)) > libXfont contains a compress / LZW decompressor implementation.  LZW decompression implementations in libXfont, ncompress and gzip all seem to be based on the same implementation.  ncompress and gzip already contain a check for code > free_ent and abort decompression in such case.  Other code bases derived from the same source (such as GIF parsers in mozilla/libpr0n and gd) check for stack[] overflow in the while loop.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=725760#c3)  Tomas Hoger    2011-08-04 14:07:23 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 516719](attachment.cgi?id=516719&action=diff "My proposed patch - variant 1") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=516719&action=edit "My proposed patch - variant 1") My proposed patch - variant 1  Checks code values, similar to ncompress/gzip.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=725760#c4)  Tomas Hoger    2011-08-04 14:08:05 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 516721](attachment.cgi?id=516721&action=diff "My proposed patch - variant 2") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=516721&action=edit "My proposed patch - variant 2") My proposed patch - variant 2  de_stack overflow check in the while loop, similar to what OpenBSD compress does.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=725760#c5)  Tomas Hoger    2011-08-04 18:00:34 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 516759](attachment.cgi?id=516759&action=diff "Updated proposed patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=516759&action=edit "Updated proposed patch") Updated proposed patch   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=725760#c8)  Tomas Hoger    2011-08-10 18:14:05 UTC  ``` Making this public.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=725760#c9)  Tomas Hoger    2011-08-11 06:05:03 UTC  ``` libXfont fixed upstream in version 1.4.4:  <http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/xorg-announce/2011-August/001721.html> <http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/xorg-announce/2011-August/001722.html> <http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/lib/libXfont/commit/?id=d11ee5886e9d9ec610051a206b135a4cdc1e09a0>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=725760#c10)  Tomas Hoger    2011-08-11 06:18:52 UTC  ``` Created libXfont tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 729870](show_bug.cgi?id=729870 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2011-2895 libXfont: LZW decompression heap corruption / infinite loop [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=725760#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-08-11 21:36:16 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2011:1154 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-1154.html>   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=725760#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-08-11 21:56:42 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4  Via RHSA-2011:1155 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-1155.html>   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=725760#c13)  Tomas Hoger    2011-09-27 14:10:01 UTC  ``` An improved fix was committed to upstream git repository.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=727800#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2011-08-03 09:22:38 UTC  ``` GIF image file format readers in various open source projects are based on the GIF decoder implementation written by David Koblas.  This implementation contains a bug in the LZW decompressor, causing it to in correctly handle compressed streams that contain code words that were not yet added to the decompression table.  LZW decompression has a special case (a KwKwK string) when code word may match the first free entry in the decompression table.  The implementation used in this GIF reading code allows code words not only matching, but also exceeding the first free entry.  This problem is identical to a bug found in BSD compress ([CVE-2011-2895](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-2895), [bug #727624](show_bug.cgi?id=727624 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2011-2895 BSD compress LZW decoder buffer overflow")), but given the unclear relationship between BSD compress and GIF decoder code bases, separate CVE is used here.  Several projects refer to pbmplus as the source form where GIF reading code was taken:  <http://www.acme.com/software/pbmplus/>  In pbmplus version of the code, the flaw can be found in LWZReadByte():          if (code >= max_code) {             *sp++ = firstcode;             code = oldcode;         }  This allows creating a loop in the decompression table, which leads to an "infinite" loop:          while (code >= clear_code) {             *sp++ = table[1][code];             if (code == table[0][code])                 pm_error("circular table entry BIG ERROR");             code = table[0][code];         }  where:    #define MAX_LWZ_BITS        12   static int  table[2][(1<< MAX_LWZ_BITS)];   static int  stack[(1<<(MAX_LWZ_BITS))*2], *sp;   sp = stack;  This results in stack[] buffer overflow.  If table[][] is located above stack[], stack[] overflow may further modify decoding table and break infinite loop.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=727800#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2011-08-03 09:25:13 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 516471](attachment.cgi?id=516471 "giftoppm.c") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=516471&action=edit "giftoppm.c") giftoppm.c  Local copy of the giftoppm.c, extracted from pbmplus_10dec1991.tar.gz, available from: <http://www.acme.com/software/pbmplus/>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=727800#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2011-08-03 09:26:41 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 516472](attachment.cgi?id=516472 "Test case") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=516472&action=edit "Test case") Test case  From [bug #714118](show_bug.cgi?id=714118), already public via <http://cups.org/str.php?L3867>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=727800#c4)  Tomas Hoger    2011-08-03 10:09:02 UTC  ``` As noted above, this GIF reader code is used in several open source projects.
