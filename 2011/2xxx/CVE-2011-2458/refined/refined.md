      "Bypass cross-domain policy",
      "Arbitrary web script injection",
      "Sensitive information disclosure"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user, denial of service, bypassing security restrictions, and information disclosure.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Enticing a user to open a specially crafted SWF file."
     ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to create and host a malicious SWF file, and then convince the user to open the crafted SWF file through a web browser or other application that uses the Flash Player.",
