Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-2496:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way the Linux kernel handles memory mapping (`mmap`) and remapping (`mremap`). Specifically:

*   **`mremap()` Expansion:**  The `mremap()` system call, when used to expand a memory mapping, could lead to a condition where the page offset (`vm_pgoff`) within the mapping could wrap around due to an integer overflow. This happens when expanding a non-wrapping mapping.
*   **Automatic Stack Expansion:** The automatic expansion of the stack can also cause `vm_pgoff` wrapping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** The core weakness is the lack of proper checks during `mremap()` and stack expansion when calculating the new `vm_pgoff`. This allows the page offset to wrap around, leading to incorrect memory mapping calculations.
*   **Improper Validation:** The kernel failed to validate that expanding an existing mapping through mremap would not lead to the wrap around.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Kernel Panic/BUG_ON()**: The most immediate impact of this overflow was a kernel panic due to the `vma_prio_tree` code being confused by the wrapped `vm_pgoff`, resulting in a `BUG_ON()` condition.
*  **Memory corruption:** Although not explicitly stated in the provided text, memory corruption is a likely result of this integer overflow.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **`mremap()` System Call:** An attacker could trigger the vulnerability by using `mremap()` to expand a memory mapping in a way that causes the page offset to overflow.
*   **Stack Manipulation**: Manipulating the stack can also cause the wrapping conditions.
*   **System Call Fuzzing**: The bug was discovered using a system call fuzzer which highlights that this is a possible attack vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to make `mremap()` system calls:** The attacker needs the ability to execute the `mremap()` syscall, which is normally available to any user.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** While not required for the initial crash, the ability to execute arbitrary code on the system would allow an attacker to make targeted `mremap` calls to trigger the vulnerability more reliably for exploitation.
*   **User Space**: The attacker can trigger this bug from user space.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was initially reported by Robert Swiecki.
*   The fix involves adding checks to avoid the overflow during `mremap` and stack expansions and prevent the wrapping condition.
*   Patches for `mremap` and stack expansion were created to fix the issue.
*   The vulnerability affects Linux kernels before the fixes were applied.
*   Red Hat assigned CVE-2011-2496 to this vulnerability.
* Red Hat released errata for MRG for RHEL-6, RHEL 6 and RHEL 5 to fix this issue.
