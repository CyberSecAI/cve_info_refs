- **Root cause of vulnerability:**  Improper sanitization of administrator-entered values in the Cisco VCS administrative interfaces. This allows a malicious administrator to inject arbitrary commands.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Command injection vulnerability. Input values are not properly sanitized, allowing for the execution of arbitrary commands on the underlying system.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful attack can result in the execution of arbitrary commands on the system, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data breaches, or denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:**  The vulnerability is exploited through the administrative web interface of the Cisco VCS.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  The attacker must be an authenticated administrator on the Cisco VCS system.

This document provides more detail than the CVE description by explaining the root cause, impact, and attack vectors. It also notes that while the vulnerability allows command execution, it's under the restricted 'nobody' account, limiting the direct impact.
