Introduction

Introduction

These release notes describe the features and capabilities included in the Cisco TelePresence Video
Communication Server (Cisco VCS) software version X7.0.3.

Upgrading to VCS X7.0.n

CAUTION: If you are upgrading a cluster, you must follow the directions in the X7.0.n “Cluster
Creation and Maintenance” Cisco VCS deployment guide (document D14367), otherwise the cluster
will not synchronize.

There is a software dependency between VCS X7.n and TMS 12.6 or later. If you are running Cisco
TelePresence Management Suite (Cisco TMS) with Provisioning or FindMe, or your Cisco VCSs are
clustered and you want to upgrade your Cisco VCS to X7.0 or later, you must also upgrade Cisco
TMS to TMS 12.6 or later, see the table below.

Note: If you are running TMS 12.5 you must upgrade it to 12.6 or later before upgrading to VCS X7.n.

Note: You should backup your system before upgrading. If you later need to downgrade to an earlier
release you will have to restore a backup made against that previous release (see “Upgrading from
X6.1 to X7” for more information about backing up X6.1 systems).

It is vital that you upgrade the Cisco VCS and Cisco TMS correctly – instructions for the upgrade are
documented in the ”Updating to” section of this document.

Upgrading a non-clustered Cisco VCS to X7.0.n from X5.0 or earlier

If you are currently running VCS X5.0 or earlier you must first upgrade to X5.2 and then upgrade from
X5.2 to X7.0.n.

You can only upgrade directly to X7.0.n if you have version X5.1 or later.

Device authentication

Upgrades from release X5.2 or earlier to X7.0.n

If device authentication is not enabled when the Cisco VCS is upgraded to X7.0.n, the upgrade
process will configure all zones and subzones (except the default zone) on the Cisco VCS with
authentication set to ‘Treat as authenticated’. This ensures that:

  CPL continues to work as expected

  Caller ID can be set to the FindMe ID for calls originating from endpoints specified in a FindMe

  The provisioning request is challenged by the provisioning server

Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server X7.0.3 Software Release Notes

Page 5 of 31

Introduction

If you are upgrading from X6.n to X7.0.n your existing authentication configuration will not be changed.

Note that if TMS Agent (rather than the Cisco VCS) challenges for authentication of provisioning data,
the initial presence publication by Movi (if running Movi version 4.1 or earlier) will fail; to publish Movi
presence, users must manually set their presence status after logging in.

Cisco VCS Starter Pack Express

If you have a Cisco VCS Starter Pack Express and you want to provision devices then you must set
the Default Zone to “Check credentials” (or “Treat as authenticated”). This is because the starter pack
provisioning server that runs on the Cisco VCS checks, but does not challenge for, credentials.

Cisco VCS upgrades where authentication is already enabled

If device authentication is enabled when the Cisco VCS is upgraded to X7.0.n, the upgrade process
will configure the Cisco VCS with authentication set to ‘Check credentials’. This means that:

  CPL continues to work as expected

  Caller ID can be set to the FindMe ID for calls originating from endpoints specified in a FindMe

  The provisioning request is challenged by the Cisco VCS

Recommendations

Device authentication

You should review your whole network and consider whether authentication should be enabled for all
endpoints and enable authentication where possible.

CPL modifications

In CPL, the ‘origin’ field is a short-hand for ‘authenticated-origin’. You are recommended to update
your CPL to make it explicit whether the CPL is looking at the authenticated or unauthenticated origin.
If CPL is required to look at the unauthenticated origin (e.g. when checking non-authenticated callers)
the CPL must use “unauthenticated-origin”. To check the authenticated origin (only available for
authenticated or “treat as authenticated” devices) the CPL should use “authenticated-origin”. Note
that:

  authenticated-origin is available for endpoints where ‘Check credentials’ succeeded, and for

endpoints where they are registered to a ‘Treat as authenticated’ subzone

  unauthenticated-origin is available for all endpoints, whether authenticated or unauthenticated

Upgrading from X6.1 to X7.n

Important note for Cisco VCS units delivered with X6.1 pre-installed

As with upgrading from any Cisco VCS release, you should first backup your system before
upgrading. However, if your system was delivered with X6.1 pre-installed, you must make some
configuration changes before using the backup process.

You do not need to use the procedure below if you do not have X6.1 installed or your installation of
X6.1 is the result of an upgrade from a previous release.

To ensure that all of your data is backed up:

1.  Log in to the Cisco VCS as root user.

2.  Enter the following commands:

a.  mkdir /tandberg/persistent/oti

b.  mkdir /tandberg/persistent/management

3.  Exit the root account.

You can now log into the web user interface and backup your system as normal via Maintenance >
Backup and restore, and then upgrade the Cisco VCS using the X7.0.n “Cluster Creation and
Maintenance” Cisco VCS deployment guide, or by following the “Updating to X7.0.n” instructions in
this document.

New features in X7

New features in X7

X7.0.3

This is a maintenance release.

X7.0.2

This is a maintenance release.

X7.0.1

This is a maintenance release.

X7.0

Device authentication using an Active Directory Service for Movi
endpoints configurable via web interface

The ability to authenticate devices via a direct connection between the Cisco VCS and an Active
Directory Service (ADS) can now be configured via the web interface.

Shared cluster licenses

Call licenses are now shared across the entire Cisco VCS cluster.

Traversal and non-traversal call license option keys are still installed on each individual peer and are
subject to per-peer limits, but the licenses are available to all peers in the cluster. Note that any other
option keys (FindMe, for example) must still be installed identically on each cluster peer, as before.

Note that if a Cisco VCS peer loses its connection to the cluster, the shareable licenses installed on
that peer will remain available to the rest of the cluster peers for two weeks from the time the cluster
lost contact with the peer.

Microsoft Edge Server support via B2BUA for Microsoft OCS/Lync

Support for Microsoft Edge Server communications has been added via the introduction of a back-to-
back user agent (B2BUA) application. The B2BUA provides interworking between Microsoft ICE (used
when MOC / Lync clients communicate through the Edge Server) and media for communications with
standard video endpoints. The B2BUA also provides call hold, call transfer and Multiway support for
calls with OCS/Lync clients, and can share FindMe presence information with OCS/Lync.

The B2BUA replaces the deprecated “Microsoft Office Communication Server” zone profile. After
upgrade, any OCS zones, if enabled, will still work as in previous software versions. However, users
are recommended to migrate to the new B2BUA functionality by following the Microsoft OCS 2007,
Lync 2010 and Cisco VCS deployment guide (document reference D14269).

Presence User Agent

You can now configure the Default published status for registered endpoints to be either Online or
Offline. This is the presentity status published by the Presence User Agent for registered endpoints
when they are not "In-Call".

Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server X7.0.3 Software Release Notes

New features in X7

Enhanced SIP registration expiry controls

New SIP registration settings on the SIP page (VCS configuration > Protocols > SIP >
Configuration) allow you to configure how the Cisco VCS calculates the expiry period for SIP
registration requests. These settings enable the system to balance the load of registration and re-
registration requests. They can be configured separately for standard and Outbound registration
connections.

These settings supersede the previous Registration expire delta setting.

Improved diagnostics

A range of tools have been introduced to improve troubleshooting.

Diagnostic logging

Additional diagnostic tools have been introduced under a new Maintenance > Diagnostics menu
structure:

  There is a Diagnostic logging tool (Maintenance > Diagnostics > Diagnostic logging) that

can be used to assist in troubleshooting system issues. It allows you to generate a diagnostic log
of system activity over a period of time, and then to download the log so that it can be sent to your
Cisco customer support representative.

  You can configure log levels for specific Network Log and Support Log modules. Note that

these are advanced logging configuration options and should only be changed on the advice of
Cisco customer support.

  The existing System snapshot and Incident reporting options have been moved under the new

Maintenance > Diagnostics menu structure.

  The System snapshot tool can now generate three types of snapshot: system status, system

logs or a full snapshot.

Network utilities

The following network utility tools have been introduced under Maintenance > Tools > Network
utilities:
  Ping: allows you to check that a particular host system is contactable from the Cisco VCS and

that your network is correctly configured to reach it.

  Traceroute: allows you to discover the route taken by a network packet sent from the Cisco VCS

to a particular destination host system.

  DNS lookup: allows you to check which domain name server (DNS server) is responding to a

request for a particular hostname.

Alarms (warnings)

  Warnings are now referred to as alarms.

  The alarm icon in the menu bar indicates the current number of unacknowledged alarms.

  The Alarms page indicates when an alarm was last raised and the number of times it has

occurred since the last restart.



In a clustered Cisco VCS system the Alarms page shows all of the alarms raised by any of the
cluster peers. Only those alarms that have been raised by the "current" peer can be
acknowledged.

GRUU (Globally Routable User Agent URI) support

The Cisco VCS has implemented the Public GRUU element of RFC 5627: Obtaining and Using
Globally Routable User Agent URIs (GRUUs) in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).

Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server X7.0.3 Software Release Notes

Page 9 of 31

New features in X7

A GRUU is a SIP URI that can be used anywhere on the internet to route a request to a specific AOR
instance. Note that the registering domain must be globally routable in order for the Cisco VCS to
support GRUU.

Improved DNS subsystem

  The DNS subsystem within the Cisco VCS has been re-structured and improved to be standards

compliant.



It provides the ability to specify explicit upstream DNS servers for specified domains.

Improved NTP synchronization

The Cisco VCS can now be configured to connect to up to 5 standards-based NTP server addresses.

TMS Agent database credentials included within local authentication
database lookups

If the Cisco VCS is enabled for device provisioning (it has the Device Provisioning option key installed
and therefore has a TMS Agent database), then in addition to any manually created entries, the Cisco
VCS now checks credentials stored within that VCS’s TMS Agent database when the device
authentication database type is set to Local database.

This makes it easier to enable authentication on the Cisco VCS when provisioning is using passwords
originating from TMS.

Other enhancements and usability improvements

  You can now configure up to 200 SIP domains.

  You can now configure up to 10,000 local authentication database credentials.

  Full support of RFC 5806: any SIP diversion headers received in a 302 response are now

maintained in the outgoing INVITE message.



Improved zone status reporting: the zones summary page now shows separate SIP and H.323
connection status information.

  Table sorting indicators: tabular displays now indicate by which column each table is sorted.

  A filter facility has been added to the Subzones list page.
  Chrome web browser is now supported; Internet Explorer 6 is no longer officially supported.

  The administrator no longer has to log out and log back in again after reconfiguring DNS server

addresses.

  There is a new Call signaling routed mode advanced zone profile setting for neighbor zones. It
controls whether the zone always takes the signaling or uses the system-wide Call routed mode
setting.

  There is a new H.323 call signaling port advanced zone profile setting for neighbor zones. It

identifies the call signaling port on the neighbor system to use if Automatically respond to H.323
searches is set to On.

  SSH and SCP clients are no longer available in the VCS operating system.

VCS may crash and report a SIGSEGV fault:
Symptoms: Cisco VCS may crash, and an alarm be raised stating that an
unexpected software error was detected in app with a SIGSEGV fault. A crash
report will also be generated and when this is analyzed a call to
sha1_block_data_order() in libcrypto is seen in the trace back.
Conditions: This was on a Cisco VCS release X7.0.1
Workaround: There is no workaround at this time.

No presence PUBLISH generated by PUA in SIP->H323 interworked call in
VCS cluster:
Symptoms: sometimes in-call presence is not published by PUA for H.323
calls.
Conditions: H.323 endpoint must register to a cluster peer and the call must
come in through another peer in the cluster. (If the call arrives on the same peer
to which the endpoint is registered, the in-call presence will be fine.)
Workaround: dual register endpoints as SIP and H.323.

The VCS fails to listen on call signaling ports:
Symptoms: The VCS fails to listen on call signaling ports after a reboot / restart
/ upgrade.
Conditions: The issue is due to a race condition as ports are assigned during
bootup. It occurs rarely.
Workaround: It could potentially be cleared by a restart.

The CPU load of the VCS increases dramatically in X7 when
%localdomains% is used in pattern matching.
Symptoms: The VCS has a high CPU load, reducing responsiveness.
Conditions: The issue is due to the increase in the number of local domains
permitted in X7, and the way in which the %localdomains% keyword is expanded
in pattern matching.
Workaround: Explicitly list domains rather than use %localdomains%.

The Cisco VCS now uses Apache 2.2.21, which addresses these security
advisories.

116841

CSCtr84963  Possible loss of grace period for call licenses (in cluster configuration):

If a cluster peer loses contact with its cluster, the remaining peers can continue to
use the non-contactable peer’s licenses for a 2-week grace period. But, if another
peer within the cluster is restarted during that period, that restarted peer will not
be able to make use of the non-contactable peer’s licenses for the remainder of
the grace period.
This issue is resolved; grace periods are now observed if a peer is restarted.

118282

CSCts05797  VCS SIP/H323 interworking does not adhere to change in SIP payload type

after hold/resume: interworked calls can lose video after a hold/resume if there is
a change in the SIP payload type.
VCS now manages correctly a change in the payload type.

118308

CSCts15739  Cisco VCS challenges B2BUA SUBSCRIBE for authentication when Default

Zone is set to “Check credentials”:
When a Cisco VCS is set up with the Default Zone set to “Check credentials” and
the X7.0 B2BUA feature is also set up on the same VCS, any SUBSCRIBE
messages sent from the B2BUA will result in a 407 Proxy Authentication Required
response from the VCS. Eventually the B2BUA gives up sending SUBSCRIBE
messages and this results in failed subscription states for B2BUA/Lync users.
This does not affect customers still using OCS Relay (rather than the B2BUA).
This issue is resolved; subscribe messages now include a P-Asserted-Identity
header.

118340

CSCtt14099  Duo Video fails from an H.323 endpoint: Duo Video from an H.323 endpoint

can fail when using BFCP and interworking with SIP.
This issue is now resolved.

VCS rejects outgoing call from specific device registered on it
Requests to FindMe from an H.323 device which has a large number of aliases
associated with it will fail. This is especially relevant to large MCUs and MPSs.
This issue is now resolved.

119052

CSCts60535  Encryption status under call summary is shown as none: active calls always

show the encryption status as none. When the call is completed the call history

CSCtr32396  VCS Command Injection Vulnerability

Symptoms: administrator entered values within the administrative interfaces
of the Cisco VCS may not be properly sanitized. This could allow a malicious
administrator to cause arbitrary commands to be executed on the underlying
system.
Conditions: a device is running an affected version of Cisco VCS.
Workaround: restrict access to the administrative interfaces to trusted users
only.
Further Problem Description: while this issue may allow an authenticated,
remote attacker to cause arbitrary commands to be executed. Any
successful command execution is performed under the restricted 'nobody'
account, restricting the direct impact of this issue.
Malicious values that are entered via the command line interface may not be
immediately executed, and instead the malicious actions may be performed
the next time an administrator accesses a page containing the malicious
value via the administrative web interface.

releases of Cisco VCS were vulnerable to CVE-2010-4697 and CVE-2006-
7243. Version X7.0 has been upgraded to use php 5.3.5 which has resolved
the issue.

A vulnerability exists in Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server
(VCS) due to improper validation of user-controlled input to the web-based
administrative interface. User-controlled input supplied to the login page via
the HTTP User-Agent header is not properly sanitized for illegal or malicious
content prior to being returned to the user in dynamically generated web
content. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to perform reflected
cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
Billy Hoffman from Zoompf, Inc. discovered this vulnerability and Ben
Feinstein from Dell SecureWorks reported it to Cisco. Cisco greatly
appreciates the opportunity to work with researchers on security
vulnerabilities and welcome the opportunity to review and assist in product
reports.
Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server Software versions earlier
than X7.0 are affected. This vulnerability has been corrected in Cisco
TelePresence Video Communication Server Software version X7.0.

External policy: when editing a policy service under the VCS configuration
> Dial plan > Policy services web page it is not possible to change the
password used for remote authentication. The password can however be
changed via the CLI interface or by deleting and then recreating the whole
policy service with the new password. This issue has now been resolved.

Truncated SNMP object value: the SNMP sysObjectID scalar MIB object
value was being returned truncated by the Cisco VCS. Instead of returning
1.3.6.1.4.1.5596.130.6.4.1 it actually returned 1. This meant that if Cisco
TMS was configured to find devices using SNMP (the default configuration) it
would not discover the Cisco VCS. This issue has now been resolved.

Incorrect responses to attempts to communicate with the Cisco VCS on
ports in range 4369–4380: the issue where the Cisco VCS incorrectly
responded with an ISAKMP message if a device attempted to connect to a
VCS port in the range 4369–4380 has been resolved.

Internal server error when unregistering and blocking an alias: resolved
the issue where use of the Unregister and block button on the Registration
details page when using a Registration Policy of Deny List caused an
internal server error.

TURN server port configuration: if the port of the TURN server is changed
while the TURN server is running, then the TURN server must be restarted
before the port change takes effect. This can be achieved by turning TURN
services Off and then On again from the TURN configuration page.

Out of date call and registration status: call and registration status displays
can be out of date if the status changes mid-call or mid-registration. Some of the
call/registration status information that is displayed is only updated when the call
ends.

Active:
Symptom: when a policy service is created or modified its status defaults to
Active. It can remain as Active for 30 seconds - long enough to convince the user
that it really is active, even if it subsequently fails.
Workaround: after creating or modifying a policy service, wait 30 seconds and
then refresh the policy services page.

Seconds since last refresh and Seconds to expiry do not update on the web
interface: the Seconds since last refresh and Seconds to expiry fields on the
Registration details web page do not get updated if a manual refresh of the web
page is performed.

Cisco VCS Starter Pack Express and remote authentication of login
account credentials requires lower case usernames: when setting up user
(FindMe) accounts you must enter the account usernames in lower case. If
usernames are created with mixed or upper case the user will not be able to log
in to the Cisco VCS. Note that passwords are case sensitive.
This issue applies only if you have a Cisco VCS Starter Pack Express and are
using remote (LDAP) authentication of login account credentials.

During normal operation the system temp alarm got raised on the VCS but
didn't clear:
The user might see the following in the /var/log/messages:
hwstatus: Event="Application Crash" Detail="Traceback (most recent call last):,
File '/bin/hwstatus.py'

SIP DNS zone defaults to UDP: searches made through DNS zones use UDP
for A record lookups. They do this even if UDP is disabled at the SIP protocol
level (on the SIP page). However, if SIP UDP is disabled, the call will not
connect.
This scenario is more likely to occur in new installations of X7 software which has
SIP UDP disabled by default.
The workaround is to enable SIP UDP.

88239

CSCtr80189

Viewing web pages with IE8 in compatibility mode: there are display
problems with the Cisco VCS web interface when viewing web pages with IE8 in
compatibility mode. The workaround is to switch off IE8 compatibility mode.

CSCtr77658

Cisco VCS sends SIP INFO for content channel without stream ID: when
interworking calls from H.323 to SIP, Fast Update Requests do not contain a
stream ID.

SSH configuration allows for port forwarding:
Symptoms: SSH configuration allows port forwarding to be enabled.
Conditions: none.
Workaround: ensure that SSH access to VCS is only available to trusted users.

version 2 score. The Base and Temporal CVSS scores as of the time of
evaluation are 1.4/1.3:

1&version=2&vector=AV:L/AC:L/Au:M/C:N/I:P/A:N/E:F/RL:U/RC:C
No CVE ID has been assigned to this issue.
Additional information on Cisco's security vulnerability policy can be found at the
following URL:
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/products_security_vulnerability_policy.html

VCS allows port overlap for disabled protocols in multi traversal zones:
Symptom: some messages will not traverse the traversal zone.
Conditions: two (or more) traversal zones are configured with identical port
numbers for a disabled protocol (such as SIP).
Workaround: configure unique port numbers for each traversal zone and
protocol (H323, SIP), even if the protocol is disabled.

“transferfindmeaccounts” script fails: the “transferfindmeaccounts” script fails
to complete successfully. This script is required if you need to change the
Cluster name of your Cisco VCS and you are using FindMe (with or without
Cisco TMS).
There is no workaround for this problem; do not change the Cluster name if you
are using FindMe.

dialedDigits returned in RRJ does not indicate the actual alias which is a
duplicate:
Conditions: a Cisco TelePresence VCS configured as a H323 gatekeeper
returns an RRJ when a H323 endpoint attempts to register with an alias already
registered to the gatekeeper. Returning the RRJ due to duplicateAlias is correct
but the dialedDigits value returned is the first terminalAlias, not the actual
duplicate alias.
Workaround: verify on the VCS which aliases are registered to the gatekeeper to
determine where the duplicate alias resides.

Cisco VCS Starter Pack Express  and B2BUA – FindMe users are not
registered to Microsoft/OCS/Lync in a timely manner: it can take up to 2
hours for FindMe users to be registered to Microsoft OCS/Lync. Note that this
issue only occurs if the B2BUA is enabled on a Cisco VCS Starter Pack Express.

System snapshot requests can time out on web interface: the system
snapshot process can take several minutes to complete. During this time the web
interface can time out. Therefore even though the snapshot file will have been
successfully generated, the web interface will not provide the user with the option
to save the snapshot file.
Workaround: the snapshot file can be downloaded from the VCS unit via another
tool such as scp.

Phantom B2BUA calls appearing up in call status: the Call status page
(Status > Calls > Calls) can show phantom calls through the B2BUA. These are
typically calls that were never established. Such calls remain visible on the Call
status page until the Cisco VCS is next restarted.

B2BUA does not disconnect a call on 408 (Request Timeout) responses /
does not support session timers (RFC 4028)
Symptoms: if a call is not properly cleared up with a BYE (either from the Cisco
endpoint or the MOC/Lync client) then it is not cleared from the Cisco VCS. It
remains visible under call status and if the Cisco VCS Expressway is used for
TURN services the TURN session will remain.

Admin accounts not replicated across a cluster:
Symptoms: if a new administrator account is created on a cluster master peer,
that same account is not created on the non-master peers.
Conditions: problem exists from X5.2 and is fixed in X7.1.
Workaround: after creating a new account on master peer, restart each non-

master peer in turn to activate the account. Make sure the non-master peer has
completed its restart before restarting another peer.

"sip:" prefix is not stripped before CPL search:
Symptoms: sip: and/or h323: prefixes to URIs are "unexpectedly" part of the
pattern match in CPL regexs. If deny rules are put in which do not explicitly cope
with sip: or h323: prefixes hackers may be able to make calls that would have
been expected to have been denied.
Conditions: CPL regex rules in place to deny certain URIs, but do not explicitly
include a test that allows a sip: or h.323: prefix.
Workaround: for example, if the deny rule is to deny calls starting with a 9,
instead of using a regex of:
9(.*)
use:
(.*:)?9(.*)

Format string vulnerability in tshell:
Symptoms: a format string vulnerability exists when parsing command line
arguments passed to the tshell binary. This results in a segmentation fault.
Conditions: the only way to pass arguments to tshell is when the user is logged
in as root.
PSIRT Evaluation: the Cisco PSIRT has assigned this bug the following CVSS
version 2 score. The Base and Temporal CVSS scores as of the time of
evaluation are

following URL:
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/products_security_vulnerability_policy.html

NTP occasionally fails after VCS restart
Symptom: alarm indicating NTP unreachable but in actual fact the NTP process
has failed to run up directly after a restart.
Diagnosis: the stopping of the previous NTP process failed complete in time
during the restart and so the socket is still in use when trying to start up the new
NTP process.
Workaround: a restart of the affected system solves this problem.

Starter Pack: after first SUBSCRIBE and NOTIFY from provisioning server,
subsequent NOTIFYs do not get sent to Movi
Symptom: after registration, and first SUBSCRIBE and NOTIFY from
provisioning server, subsequent NOTIFYs (following re-SUBSCRIBEs from Movi
4.3.5 or later) do not get sent to the Movi. Therefore Movi will not pick up any
provisioning changes contained in the NOTIFY.
Scope: in X7.0.n this is limited to Starter Pack deployments ONLY (TMS Agent /
Argon deployments work fine without any problems).
Versions affected: VCS X7.0.n Starter Pack with Movi 4.3.5 or later. This may
affect E20 deployments, further testing is required.
Status: fixed in X7.1.
Mitigations: this problem does not affect call scenarios or the ability to
make/receive calls. After 5 minutes, Movi should re-SUBSCRIBE after the initial
SUBSCRIBE. Because it already has an existing registration, it will receive a new
NOTIFY and pick up relevant updates. In E20 deployments the timeout will be 60
minutes instead of 5 minutes.

Need to disable automatic DST timezone change for Russia from autumn
2011:
Symptoms: DST changes are wrong in some parts of Russia from autumn 2011.
Conditions: DST set to Russian area in an area where they have changed

Summary

timezone rules.
Workaround: use a different timezone (for example Arabian GMT+4).
Additional Information: effective from autumn 2011, Russia has reduced the
number of timezones it uses. As part of this Russia is also changing the way it
handles DST in some areas as a way of converging areas together; the changed
areas will stay with summer timezone the whole year.
The changed areas will no longer adhere to the automatic DST change rules
installed in the VCS.

The SIP Standard registration refresh minimum setting
introduced in VCS X7.0 has a default value of 45 seconds.
Devices that request a value lower than the Standard
registration refresh minimum setting will result in the
registration being rejected with a 423 Interval Too Brief
response.
Any SIP devices, such as the Cisco TelePresence Content
Server, that do not retry their registration request after
receiving a 423 response will fail to register.
The workaround is to set the Standard registration
refresh minimum setting on the Cisco VCS to 30
seconds.

Updating to X7.0.n

Updating to X7.0.n

CAUTION: If you are upgrading a cluster, you must follow the directions in the X7.0.n “Cluster
Creation and Maintenance” Cisco VCS deployment guide (document D14367), otherwise the cluster
will not synchronize.

Prerequisites and software dependencies

Cisco VCS and Cisco TMS software dependency

There is a software dependency between VCS X7.n and TMS 12.6 or later. If you are running
Cisco TMS with Provisioning or FindMe, or your Cisco VCSs are clustered and you want to
upgrade your Cisco VCS to X7.n or later, you must also upgrade Cisco TMS to TMS 12.6 or
later.

The X7.0.n “Cluster creation and maintenance” deployment guide (document D14367) contains full
instructions on how to upgrade to VCS X7.0.n and TMS 12.6 or later. Please use these instructions
accompanied by the TMS upgrade procedures found in the relevant Cisco TMS Installation and
Getting Started Guide.

If you are running TMS 12.5 you must upgrade it to 12.6 or later before upgrading to VCS X7.n.

You must use the procedures in the preceding documents if you use any of the following
features:

  Clustering, or

  Device provisioning, or

  FindMe (with Cisco TMS managing Cisco VCS)

For other Cisco VCS deployments you may follow the Basic Cisco VCS X7.0.n upgrade procedure
below.

Note that if you are running a single Cisco VCS with FindMe (without clustering or Cisco TMS) you
can follow the Basic Cisco VCS X7.0.n upgrade procedure below. Note, if you configure FindMe on a
single VCS with no replication to TMS and at a later date you include this Cisco VCS in a cluster you
will have to re-enter your FindMe accounts as they will be overwritten by Cisco TMS. To avoid this
problem you are recommended to use Cisco TMS 12.6 or later and Cisco VCS X7.0.n and replicate
your Cisco VCS FindMe accounts with Cisco TMS.

Basic Cisco VCS X7.0.n upgrade procedure

Follow this procedure for upgrading Cisco VCS to X7.0.n, only if all of the following apply:

  The Cisco VCS is not part of a cluster, and

  Provisioning is not in use, and

  Cisco TMS is not managing the Cisco VCS

  Cisco VCS is currently X5.1.1 or later

Note: It is recommended that if FindMe™ is used that it is replicated with Cisco TMS. This allows a
standalone Cisco VCS to be clustered in the future and the FindMe™ data kept. (If the FindMe™ data
is not replicated with Cisco TMS, if the Cisco VCS is ever clustered the FindMe™ data from the Cisco
VCS will be lost).

This procedure upgrades the Cisco VCS:

1.  Backup the Cisco VCS.

Note: You should backup your system before upgrading. If you later need to downgrade to an
earlier release you will have to restore a backup made against that previous release.

Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server X7.0.3 Software Release Notes

Page 23 of 31

Important note for Cisco VCS units delivered with X6.1 pre-installed

If your system was delivered with X6.1 pre-installed, you must make some configuration changes
before using the backup process. You do not need to follow these additional steps if you do not
have X6.1 installed or your installation of X6.1 is the result of an upgrade from a previous release.
To ensure that all of your data is backed up:

Updating to X7.0.n

a.  Log in to the Cisco VCS as root user.

b.  Enter the following commands:

i.  mkdir /tandberg/persistent/oti

ii.  mkdir /tandberg/persistent/management

c.  Exit the root account.

2.  Enable maintenance mode.

Log in to the Cisco VCS as admin (SSH, telnet or serial), and at a command prompt, type:

xConfiguration SystemUnit Maintenance Mode: On

3.  Wait for all calls to clear and registrations to timeout.

•

•

If necessary, manually remove any calls that do not clear automatically (Status > Calls, click
Select all and then click Disconnect).

If necessary, manually remove any registrations that do not clear automatically (Status >
Registrations > By device, click Select all and then click Unregister).

4.  Upgrade and restart the Cisco VCS (Maintenance > Upgrade).

Note: The web browser interface may timeout during the restart process, after the progress bar
has reached the end. (This may happen if the Cisco VCS initiates a disk file system check – which
it does approximately once every 30 restarts.)

The upgrade is now complete and all Cisco VCS configuration should be as expected.

Upgrading from older releases



It is not possible to upgrade from releases prior to X5.1 to X7.0.n. You must first upgrade to X5.2
and then to X7.0.n. See the X5.2 release note, document reference D50582, for details.

AES encryption support

The Cisco VCS uses one of the following software files for X4.0 or later software, where x<y_y_y>
represents the software version (for example x7_0_0 represents X7.0).

Software

Software file properties

s42700x<y_y_y>

Hardware shutdown procedure

The Cisco VCS uses a hard drive for storing logs and TMS Agent data. You are recommended to shut
down the Cisco VCS prior to it being unplugged to ensure a clean shutdown process. This can be
done from the web interface.

Network support

The Cisco VCS is an H.323 and SIP compliant device and is designed to be connected to an 802.3 IP
network.

The first (or with dual network interface option, the first two) 802.3 Ethernet ports are used which are
labeled LAN 1 (and LAN 2); the remaining two are currently unused. The Ethernet interfaces on the
Cisco VCS support both manual configuration and auto speed and duplex detection for 1000Mbit Full
Duplex, 100Mbit Full or Half Duplex or 10Mbit Full or Half Duplex.

It is recommended that speed and duplex setting should be set to auto unless the Ethernet switch that
the Cisco VCS is connected to does not support auto-negotiation, if manually configured, ensure that
full duplex is configured.

Restricting access to ISDN gateways (toll-fraud
prevention)

Cisco VCS Expressway users should take appropriate action to restrict unauthorized access to ISDN
gateway resources.

See the Basic Configuration – Cisco VCS Expressway with Cisco VCS Control deployment guide for
information about how to do this.
