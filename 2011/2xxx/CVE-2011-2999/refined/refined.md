  "CVE-2011-2999": {
    "description": "Boris Zbarsky discovered that incorrect handling of the window.location object could lead to bypasses of the same-origin policy.",
    "root_cause": "A frame named \"location\" could shadow the window.location object unless a script in a page grabbed a reference to the true object before the frame was created. Some plugins use the value of window.location to determine the page origin. This could fool the plugin into granting plugin content access to another site or the local file system in violation of the Same Origin Policy.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Incorrect handling of the window.location object",
      "Same-origin policy bypass"
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious website could bypass the Same Origin Policy, potentially gaining unauthorized access to another site or the local file system by using a frame named \"location\" to shadow the real `window.location` object and trick plugins.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "A website opens a frame named \"location\" before the page script access the window.location property. This allows the attacker to shadow the window.location object.",
	"A plugin relying on window.location is used on the page"
      ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to host a malicious webpage that can load an iframe with a name 'location' and convince the user to interact with the page, or load the page in the context of a plugin.",
     "notes": "This vulnerability is a circumvention of the fix for MFSA 2010-10, highlighting that named frames could shadow window.location, and the fix involves ensuring that the 'location' object is resolved before named frames during javascript execution."
