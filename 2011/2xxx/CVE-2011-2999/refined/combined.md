## Bugzilla Field Descriptions

Alias
A short, unique name assigned to a bug in order to assist with looking it up and referring to it in other places in Bugzilla.Assignee
This is the person in charge of resolving the bug. Every time this field changes, the status changes to NEW to make it easy to see which new bugs have appeared on a person's list.Blocks
This bug must be resolved before the bugs listed in this field can be resolved.Bug ID
The numeric id of a bug, unique within this entire installation of Bugzilla.CC
Users who may not have a direct role to play on this bug, but who are interested in its progress.Changed
When this bug was last updated.Classification
Bugs are categorised into Classifications, Products and Components. classifications is the top-level categorization.Comment
Bugs have comments added to them by Bugzilla users. You can search for some text in those comments.Comment Tag
Comments can have arbitrary tags added to them to help with filtering as well as mark comments as spam or abusive.Component
Components are second-level categories; each belongs to a particular Product. Select a Product to narrow down this list.Creation date
When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform
This is the hardware platform against which the bug was reported (ARM, ARM64, x86, x86\_64, etc).Priority

| **--** | No decision |
| **P1** | Fix in the current release cycle |
| **P2** | Fix in the next release cycle or the following (nightly + 1 or nightly + 2) |
| **P3** | Backlog |
| **P4** | Do not use. This priority is for the Web Platform Test bot. |
| **P5** | Will not fix, but will accept a patch |

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product

The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also
This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

                 CVE-2011-3000

Several vulnerabilities have been found in Iceweasel, a web browser
based on Firefox:

CVE-2011-2372

   Mariusz Mlynski discovered that websites could open a download
   dialog - which has "open" as the default action -, while a user
   presses the ENTER key.

CVE-2011-2995

   Benjamin Smedberg, Bob Clary and Jesse Ruderman discovered crashes
   in the rendering engine, which could lead to the execution of
   arbitrary code.

CVE-2011-2998

   Mark Kaplan discovered an integer underflow in the javascript
   engine, which could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2011-2999

   Boris Zbarsky discovered that incorrect handling of the
   window.location object could lead to bypasses of the same-origin
   policy.

CVE-2011-3000

   Ian Graham discovered that multiple Location headers might lead to
   CRLF injection.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.9.0.19-14 of the xulrunner source package. This update also
marks the compromised DigiNotar root certs as revoked rather then
untrusted.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed
inversion 3.5.16-10. This update also marks the compromised DigiNotar
root certs as revoked rather then untrusted.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.0-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your iceweasel packages.

# BMO/UserGuide/Whiteboard

From MozillaWiki

[Jump to navigation](#mw-head)
[Jump to search](#searchInput)

Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information. This wiki page is dedicated to collect a comprehensive list of whiteboard tags used in the Mozilla project.

## Contents

* [1 Whiteboard considered harmful](#Whiteboard_considered_harmful)
* [2 Contributor mentoring](#Contributor_mentoring)

## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)
  + my guess: Tablet Contribution Program?

As indicated in the Lenny (oldstable) release notes, security support for
the Icedove packages in the oldstable needed to be stopped before the end
of the regular Lenny security maintenance life cycle.
You are strongly encouraged to upgrade to stable or switch to a different
mail client.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.0.11-1+squeeze5.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in

| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner

Debian Security Advisory DSA-2312-1                   security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                        Moritz Muehlenhoff

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : iceape
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-2372 CVE-2011-2995 CVE-2011-2998 CVE-2011-2999
                 CVE-2011-3000

Several vulnerabilities have been found in the Iceape internet suite,
an unbranded version of Seamonkey:

CVE-2011-2372

   Mariusz Mlynski discovered that websites could open a download
   dialog - which has "open" as the default action -, while a user
   presses the ENTER key.

CVE-2011-2995

   Benjamin Smedberg, Bob Clary and Jesse Ruderman discovered crashes
   in the rendering engine, which could lead to the execution of
   arbitrary code.

CVE-2011-2998

   Mark Kaplan discovered an integer underflow in the javascript
   engine, which could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2011-2999

   Boris Zbarsky discovered that incorrect handling of the
   window.location object could lead to bypasses of the same-origin
   policy.

CVE-2011-3000

   Ian Graham discovered that multiple Location headers might lead to
   CRLF injection.

The oldstable distribution (lenny) is not affected. The iceape package
only provides the XPCOM code.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.11-8. This update also marks the compromised DigiNotar
root certs as revoked rather then untrusted.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.14-8.

We recommend that you upgrade your iceape packages.

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2011-38

## XSS via plugins and shadowed window.location object

Announced
September 27, 2011
Reporter
Boris Zbarsky
Impact
High
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox 3.6.23
* Firefox 6
* SeaMonkey 2.3
* Thunderbird 3.1.15
* Thunderbird 6

### Description

Mozilla developer **Boris Zbarsky** reported that a frame
named "location" could shadow the `window.location` object unless a
script in a page grabbed a reference to the true object before the frame
was created. Because some plugins use the value of window.location to determine
the page origin this could fool the plugin into granting the plugin content
access to another site or the local file system in violation of the Same Origin
Policy. This flaw allows circumvention of the fix added for
[MFSA 2010-10](/security/announce/2010/mfsa2010-10.html).

| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=665548#c0)• 14 years ago |
|  | |

location is a non-configurable property, so if you look up window.location before there is a <frame name="location"> you will always get the right window.location after that. But if you look it up for the first time \_after\_ such a frame exists, you will get the Window for the frame.
Effectively, the fix for [bug 541530](/show_bug.cgi?id=541530 "VERIFIED FIXED - Restore paranoid location object protecting code") can be circumvented by this means.

Mounir, you want to look into fixing this? I think it should be as simple as reordering the location specific code in nsWindowSH::NewResolve().Assignee: nobody → mounir.lamouri

function onhashchange() {

Does the patch affect to that behavior?

It looks like the testcase was not yet checked in to m-c/aurora/beta so we could possibly get away with waiting for the next 3.6.x release. But it's a simple patch (moves a block earlier in the file) and we haven't gone to beta yet. I'd be happier putting this in 3.6.20Flags: in-testsuite?

FYI, This will delay the beta.
If we check in and go to build "now," QA will likely not get builds until tomorrow. Our contract resources are time shifted 9 or 10 hours (in Europe) so we would have to have builds in the next six or seven hours for them to test. This means that we'd need to run automation tomorrow in MV and then have staff locally run the manual tests that contractors normally run, as well as test new snippets for betatest (and snippets must be generated for .19 and .18 both given the unique nature of .19).
This likely means a Wednesday Beta, assuming nothing goes wrong.

openSUSE Security Update: MozillaThunderbird: Update to Mozilla Thunderbird 3.1.14
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Announcement ID: openSUSE-SU-2011:1076-2
Rating: important
References: #720264
Affected Products:
openSUSE 11.4
openSUSE 11.3
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that contains security fixes can now be
installed. It includes two new package versions.
Description:
Mozilla Thunderbird was updated to version 3.1.14, fixing
various bugs and security issues.
MFSA 2011-36: Mozilla developers identified and fixed
several memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in
Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these
bugs showed evidence of memory corruption under certain
circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary
code.
In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in
the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is
disabled, but are potentially a risk in browser or
browser-like contexts in those products.
Benjamin Smedberg, Bob Clary, and Jesse Ruderman reported
memory safety problems that affected Firefox 3.6 and
Firefox 6. (CVE-2011-2995)
Bob Clary, Andrew McCreight, Andreas Gal, Gary Kwong, Igor
Bukanov, Jason Orendorff, Jesse Ruderman, and Marcia Knous
reported memory safety problems that affected Firefox 6,
fixed in Firefox 7. (CVE-2011-2997)
MFSA 2011-38: Mozilla developer Boris Zbarsky reported that
a frame named "location" could shadow the window.location
object unless a script in a page grabbed a reference to the
true object before the frame was created. Because some
plugins use the value of window.location to determine the
page origin this could fool the plugin into granting the
plugin content access to another site or the local file
system in violation of the Same Origin Policy. This flaw
allows circumvention of the fix added for MFSA 2010-10.
(CVE-2011-2999)
MFSA 2011-39: Ian Graham of Citrix Online reported that
when multiple Location headers were present in a redirect
response Mozilla behavior differed from other browsers:
Mozilla would use the second Location header while Chrome
and Internet Explorer would use the first. Two copies of
this header with different values could be a symptom of a
CRLF injection attack against a vulnerable server. Most
commonly it is the Location header itself that is
vulnerable to the response splitting and therefore the copy
preferred by Mozilla is more likely to be the malicious
one. It is possible, however, that the first copy was the
injected one depending on the nature of the server
vulnerability.
The Mozilla browser engine has been changed to treat two
copies of this header with different values as an error
condition. The same has been done with the headers
Content-Length and Content-Disposition. (CVE-2011-3000)
MFSA 2011-40: Mariusz Mlynski reported that if you could
convince a user to hold down the Enter key--as part of a
game or test, perhaps--a malicious page could pop up a
download dialog where the held key would then activate the
default Open action. For some file types this would be
merely annoying (the equivalent of a pop-up) but other file
types have powerful scripting capabilities. And this would
provide an avenue for an attacker to exploit a
vulnerability in applications not normally exposed to
potentially hostile internet content.
Mariusz also reported a similar flaw with manual plugin
installation using the PLUGINSPAGE attribute. It was
possible to create an internal error that suppressed a
confirmation dialog, such that holding enter would lead to
the installation of an arbitrary add-on. (This variant did
not affect Firefox 3.6)
Holding enter allows arbitrary code execution due to
Download Manager (CVE-2011-2372)
Holding enter allows arbitrary extension installation
(CVE-2011-3001)
MFSA 2011-42: Security researcher Aki Helin reported a
potentially exploitable crash in the YARR regular
expression library used by JavaScript. (CVE-2011-3232)
MFSA 2011-44: sczimmer reported that Firefox crashed when
loading a particular .ogg file. This was due to a
use-after-free condition and could potentially be exploited
to install malware. (CVE-2011-3005)
This vulnerability does not affect Firefox 3.6 or earlier.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
