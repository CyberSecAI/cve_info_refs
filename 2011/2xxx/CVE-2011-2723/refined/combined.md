| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=726552#c0)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2011-07-29 01:26:39 UTC  ``` Currently skb_gro_header_slow unconditionally resets frag0 and frag0_len.  However, when we can't pull on the skb this leaves the GRO fields in an inconsistent state.  This patch fixes this by only resetting those fields after the pskb_may_pull test.  Upstream commit: <http://git.kernel.org/linus/17dd759c67f21e34f2156abcf415e1f60605a188>  Acknowledgements: Red Hat would like to thank Brent Meshier for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=726552#c4)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2011-07-29 01:40:47 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect the versions of Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 as it did not backport the upstream commit a5b1cf28 that introduced this issue. This has been addressed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and Red Hat Enterprise MRG via <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-1386.html>, <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-1350.html>, and <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0010.html>.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=726552#c8)  Vincent Danen    2011-09-20 16:39:18 UTC  ``` External References:  <http://git.kernel.org/linus/17dd759c67f21e34f2156abcf415e1f60605a188>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=726552#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-09-20 17:50:53 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.6.Z - Server Only  Via RHSA-2011:1321 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-1321.html>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=726552#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-10-05 21:47:35 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2011:1350 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-1350.html>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=726552#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-10-20 17:28:32 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2011:1386 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-1386.html>   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=726552#c12)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2011-10-25 03:51:03 UTC  ``` Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 748676](show_bug.cgi?id=748676 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2011-2723 kernel: gro: only reset frag0 when skb can be pulled [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=726552#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-10-26 15:32:40 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    RHEV-H, V2V and Agents for RHEL-5  Via RHSA-2011:1408 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-1408.html>   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=726552#c15)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-01-10 20:15:52 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    MRG for RHEL-6 v.2  Via RHSA-2012:0010 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0010.html>   ``` |  |

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).
