Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-2723:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability lies in the Linux kernel's Generic Receive Offload (GRO) implementation, specifically within the `skb_gro_header_slow` function. The function unconditionally resets `frag0` and `frag0_len` fields within the socket buffer (`skb`) structure. This reset occurs even when the function cannot pull data from the `skb`, leading to an inconsistent state of the GRO fields.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Inconsistent GRO state:** Resetting `frag0` and `frag0_len` without verifying if the data can be pulled from the `skb` creates an inconsistency in the GRO state.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote denial-of-service:** This vulnerability can lead to a remote denial-of-service. The inconsistent GRO state can cause a crash in the kernel.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network:** The vulnerability is triggered via network traffic. An attacker could craft packets that cause the vulnerable code path to be executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Remote Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the vulnerable system.
- **Specific Network Configurations:** The vulnerability is triggered under certain network device configurations.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was introduced by the upstream commit `a5b1cf28`, but was not present in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, which did not backport this commit.
- The fix ensures that `frag0` and `frag0_len` are only reset after successfully pulling data from the `skb`.
- Red Hat acknowledged Brent Meshier for reporting the issue
- Patches were released for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and Red Hat Enterprise MRG.
- The vulnerability was also addressed in Fedora.
