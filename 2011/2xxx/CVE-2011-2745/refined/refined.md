Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-2745:

**Vulnerability:** Arbitrary File Upload

*   **Root Cause:**  The vulnerability arises from insufficient restrictions on file extensions during the upload process within the swfupload extension, specifically when file upload feathers are enabled. The client-side javascript limits the file extensions but can be easily bypassed.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Insecure Client-Side Validation:** The file extension check is performed client-side using JavaScript, which can be easily modified or bypassed.
    *   **Lack of Server-Side Validation:** The server does not properly validate the file extension of uploaded files.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can upload arbitrary files, including malicious PHP scripts, which could lead to:
    *   **Remote Code Execution:**  Executing arbitrary code on the server.
    *   **Complete System Compromise:**  Gaining control of the server.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Modification of JavaScript:** The attacker can use browser tools like Firebug or intercepting proxies to modify the JavaScript code on the client side, allowing them to upload files with extensions not allowed by the original JavaScript code (e.g., .php).
    *   **Direct POST Request:** A direct POST request to the `upload_handler.php` could be crafted to upload files with arbitrary extensions.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Authorized User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user with permissions to use the file upload functionality.
    *   **Knowledge of the Application:** The attacker needs to be aware of how the file upload mechanism works in Chyrp, specifically how the swfupload extension handles file uploads.

**Summary of findings:**

*   The vulnerability is related to an arbitrary file upload issue.
*   The issue stems from the lack of server-side validation on file uploads.
*   Exploitation requires an authenticated user.
*   Successful exploitation allows for arbitrary code execution.
*   The vulnerability was found in Chyrp version <= 2.0
*   The vulnerability is fixed in version 2.1.1
