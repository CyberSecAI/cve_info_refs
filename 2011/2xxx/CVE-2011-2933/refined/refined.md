- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `/admin/media/upload.php` script in WebsiteBaker 2.8.1 and earlier fails to restrict uploaded files with extensions such as `.htaccess, .php4, .php5, .phtml`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Arbitrary file upload vulnerability due to insufficient file extension filtering.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can upload and execute arbitrary PHP code on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can upload malicious PHP files through the vulnerable `/admin/media/upload.php` script.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs a user account with access to the WebsiteBaker admin backend. This access can be gained through brute force attacks or by exploiting Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities on currently logged-in admin users.
