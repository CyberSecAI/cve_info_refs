Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2011-2535:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how the Asterisk IAX2 channel driver handles option control frames. Specifically, a memory address was being transmitted over the network via an IAX2 option control frame. This exposed address could then be accessed by the remote party, leading to a crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Input Validation**: The IAX2 channel driver was not properly validating or sanitizing the data within option control frames before sending it over the network. It was transmitting raw memory addresses that were specific to the sending system.
- **Information Leakage:** The transmission of a memory address over the network constitutes an information leak, as it exposes internal system details to a remote party.
- **Remote Crash Vulnerability:** By attempting to access a memory address that was leaked, the remote party could cause a crash on the affected Asterisk server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability leads to a crash of the Asterisk server, resulting in a denial of service for users relying on the server's functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based**: The attack is performed over the network using the IAX2 protocol.
- **Remote Unauthenticated Sessions:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker, meaning no prior knowledge or credentials are required to perform the attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** An attacker needs to be able to send crafted IAX2 packets to the vulnerable Asterisk server.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to trigger this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix involves changing the default behavior so that only specifically useful data from option control frames are sent. The option that was passing memory addresses is also no longer read from the network.
- The vulnerability affects Asterisk Open Source versions 1.4.x, 1.6.2.x, and all 1.8.x versions, as well as Asterisk Business Edition C.3.
- Patches and corrected versions are available for affected versions.

This information is consistent with the provided security advisories and patch information.
