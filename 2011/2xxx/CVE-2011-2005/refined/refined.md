Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-2005:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability exists in the Ancillary Function Driver (AFD), specifically `afd.sys`, which improperly validates input passed from user mode to the Windows kernel.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper input validation: The AFD driver fails to properly validate data received from user mode before processing it in the kernel. This allows a malicious user-mode application to pass crafted data that can cause unintended behavior.
- Elevation of Privilege: The vulnerability allows an attacker to elevate their privileges by executing arbitrary code in kernel mode.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Complete system control: A successful exploit allows the attacker to gain complete control of the affected system.
- Arbitrary code execution: The attacker can execute arbitrary code in kernel mode, the most privileged context of the operating system.
- System compromise: The attacker can install programs, view, change, or delete data, and create new accounts with full administrative rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access: An attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to the system.
- Malicious application: The attacker would need to run a specially crafted application that triggers the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Valid logon credentials: The attacker must have a valid user account on the target system.
- Local access: The attacker must be able to log on to the system locally.
- Ability to run programs: The attacker must be able to execute a specially crafted program on the target system.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in `afd.sys`, which is a core component for Windows Sockets applications, responsible for managing TCP/IP communications.
- The vulnerability was privately reported to Microsoft through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.
- The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the AFD validates input before passing it from user-mode to the Windows kernel.
- Microsoft rated this vulnerability as "Important" for affected versions of Windows.
- The Microsoft Exploitability Index rating is not specified but the provided document on the index would suggest it should be a 0 or 1.

**Affected Systems:**

- Windows XP Service Pack 3
- Windows XP Professional x64 Edition Service Pack 2
- Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 2
- Windows Server 2003 x64 Edition Service Pack 2
- Windows Server 2003 with SP2 for Itanium-based Systems
