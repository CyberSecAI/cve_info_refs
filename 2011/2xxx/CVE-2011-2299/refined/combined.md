### Overview

The Oracle products and components listed above are affected by multiple vulnerabilities. The impacts of these vulnerabilities include remote execution of arbitrary code, information disclosure, and denial of service.

The [Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2011](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/cpujuly2011-313328.html) addresses 78 vulnerabilities in various Oracle products and components. The advisory provides information about affected components, access, and authorization required for successful exploitation and the impact from the vulnerabilities on data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

Oracle has associated CVE identifiers with the vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update. More detail about one of the vulnerabilities is available in US-CERT Vulnerability Note [VU#](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/103425)[103425](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/103425).

### Impact

The impact of these vulnerabilities varies depending on the product, component, and configuration of the system. Potential consequences include the execution of arbitrary code or commands, information disclosure, and denial of service. Vulnerable components may be available to unauthenticated, remote attackers. An attacker who compromises an Oracle database may be able to access sensitive information.

### Solution

Apply the appropriate patches or upgrade as specified in the [Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2011](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/cpujuly2011-313328.html).
