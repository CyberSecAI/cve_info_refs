## 'Extremely wormable and dangerous'

Mac users running Skype are vulnerable to self-propagating exploits that allow an attacker to gain unfettered system access by sending a specially manipulated attachment in an instant message, a hacker said.

“The long and the short of it is that an attacker needs only to send a victim a message and they can gain remote control of the victim's Mac,” Gordon Maddern of Australian security consultancy Pure Hacking [blogged on Friday](http://www.purehacking.com/blogs/gordon-maddern/skype-0day-vulnerabilitiy-discovered-by-pure-hacking). “It is extremely wormable and dangerous.”

The vulnerability, which Maddern said isn't present in the Windows or Linux versions of the popular VoIP program, was confirmed by Skype spokeswoman Brianna Reynaud, who said a fix will be rolled out next week. Its disclosure comes the same week that researchers [discovered a new crimekit that streamlines the production of Mac-based malware](https://www.theregister.com/2011/05/03/mac_osx_crimeware_kit/). It also comes as new malware surfaced for Apple's OS X that masquerades as a legitimate antivirus program.

Reynaud said there are no reports that the Skype vulnerability is being actively exploited.

Maddern said he stumbled on the critical flaw by accident.

“About a month ago I was chatting on skype to a colleague about a payload for one of our clients,” he wrote. “Completely by accident, my payload executed in my colleagues skype client. So I decided to test another mac and sent the payload to my girlfriend. She wasn't too happy with me as it also left the her skype unusable for several days.”

He then set out to write proof-of-concept attack code that used payloads borrowed from the [Metasploit exploit framework](http://www.metasploit.com/). The result: a Skype exploit that allows him to remotely gain shell access on a targeted Mac. Because it's sent by instant messages, it might be possible to force each infected machines to send the malicious payload to a whole new set of Macs, causing the attack to grow exponentially.

Maddern didn't say what interaction is required on the part of the victim, and he didn't immediately respond to an email seeking clarification. His blog post says he notified Skype of the vulnerability more than a month ago, and that he will withhold specific details until a patch is released to prevent malicious attacks. ®

### Update

According to a [post](http://blogs.skype.com/security/2011/05/security_vulnerability_in_mac.html) on the *Skype Security* blog that was published a few hours after this story went live, a hotfix for the vulnerability was released in mid April.

“As there were no reports of this vulnerability being exploited in the wild, we did not prompt our users to install this update, as there is another update in the pipeline that will be sent out early next week,” Skype's Adrian Asher wrote.

He added:

> This vulnerability, which they blogged about earlier today, is related to a situation when a malicious contact would send a specifically crafted message that could cause Skype for Mac to crash. Note, this message would have to come from someone already in your Skype Contact List, as Skype's default privacy settings will not let you receive messages from people that you have not already authorized, hence the term malicious contact.

*The headline in this article was updated to correct the nature of the vulnerability. It remotely gives shell access.*

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

--- Update:

There has been an update to Skype for Mac OS X. It is recommended that you update. Latest version seems to be 5.1.0.922. It is not clear from the Skype website as to addressing the below issue but updating is a good idea.

![](/diaryimages/SkypeScreenSnapz002.jpg)

According to a Pure Hacking Blog Entry = http : //www.purehacking.com/blogs/gordon-maddern/skype-0day-vulnerabilitiy-discovered-by-pure-hacking and The Register UK = http : //www.theregister.co.uk/2011/05/06/skype\_for\_mac\_critical\_vulnerability/

There is a 0 Day exploit that exists for Skype on MAC. Windows and Linux are unaffected. Some best practices for Skype include setting your messages to only allow from Contacts. This does not protect you from infected contacts but it might help.

Please take measures to protect yourself. We are not aware of this being exploited in the wild and as most of us might use the operating system affected, we are both personally and professionally interested.

### Comments

The patched version is available, although not yet pushed to clients - 5.1.0.922. Use:

Skype -> Check for Updates...

A MAC is a unique identifier for a network device, not the name of a computer.

Put up a nice little writeup about this this morning out at http: //www.h-online.com/security/news/item/Confusion-over-Skype-for-Mac-security-issue-1239842.html. Shows the confusion between the individual that found the exploit and Skype.

Reports are that Microsoft is going to buy Skype. The Apple problem just sorted itself out. LOL
