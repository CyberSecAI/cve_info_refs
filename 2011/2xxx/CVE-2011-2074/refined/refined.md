Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described, which is related to CVE-2011-2074:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a flaw in how Skype for Mac OS X handles specially crafted instant messages with manipulated attachments.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  The primary weakness is the lack of proper input validation or sanitization of incoming messages, allowing malicious code within a crafted attachment to be executed.
- The vulnerability is specific to the Mac OS X version of Skype and does not affect the Windows or Linux versions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can gain remote control of the victim's Mac, including shell access.
- The exploit can cause the victim's Skype client to crash and become unusable.
- The exploit is "extremely wormable," meaning that an infected machine could propagate the malicious payload to its contacts, potentially leading to an exponential spread.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a specially crafted instant message containing a malicious attachment sent through the Skype application.
- The attacker must be in the victim's contact list for the default privacy settings to allow the message through.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be a contact of the victim on Skype, due to default privacy settings.
- The attacker needs the ability to create a specially crafted instant message with a manipulated attachment containing malicious code (e.g. payloads from the Metasploit framework).

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was discovered accidentally by a security researcher while testing payloads for a client.
- A hotfix was released in mid-April by Skype, but it was not automatically pushed to users until the vulnerability became public.
- The vulnerability was initially described as causing a crash, however, it was later clarified to allow remote shell access.
- There were no reports of active exploitation of this vulnerability in the wild at the time of the report.
