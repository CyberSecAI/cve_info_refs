Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2011-2179:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from a lack of input sanitization in Nagios' configuration command expansion feature, specifically when processing the "expand" parameter in `config.cgi`. This allows for the injection of arbitrary code into the output.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS. The lack of input validation allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the configuration command expansion page of Nagios.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Data Modification/Theft:** A successful XSS attack could allow an attacker to modify the content of the Nagios web page or steal confidential data accessible within the same domain.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution (in browser):** By injecting JavaScript, an attacker can execute arbitrary code within the victim's browser session.
- **Other malicious activities:** XSS can be leveraged for a variety of attacks, including session hijacking, defacing the website and redirecting users to malicious websites.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Direct URL Manipulation:** The vulnerability can be triggered by crafting a malicious URL containing the "expand" parameter with a script payload.  For example:
    `<http://www.example.com/nagios/cgi-bin/config.cgi?type=command&expand>=<script>alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))</script>`
    or
    `<http://www.example.com/nagios/cgi-bin/config.cgi?type=command&expand>=<body onload=alert(666)>`
- **User Interaction:** Users can be tricked into clicking on a malicious link that triggers the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Nagios server, or craft a link that directs the victim's browser to do so.
- **Knowledge of Nagios:** Some understanding of Nagios' web interface and how the configuration command expansion works is beneficial.
- **Social Engineering:** In some cases, the attacker may need to trick a user into clicking a malicious link to exploit the vulnerability.
