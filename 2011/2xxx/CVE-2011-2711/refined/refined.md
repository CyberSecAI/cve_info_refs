Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2011-2711:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by insufficient escaping of the file name within the rename hint in cgit, a web interface for Git. Specifically, when a file is renamed, the new filename is not properly sanitized before being displayed in the web interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The lack of proper sanitization allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML code and/or web scripts into the rename hint.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit would lead to the execution of attacker-controlled web scripts or HTML code within the browser of a user viewing the cgit interface.
- This could enable the attacker to perform malicious actions, such as:
    - Cookie theft
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement
    - Redirecting to malicious websites

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker must have push access to the Git repository.
- The attacker exploits the vulnerability by pushing a commit that renames a file to a file with a specially crafted name that includes malicious HTML or JavaScript code.
- Any user viewing the commit history with the malicious rename via cgit will be impacted.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-  The attacker needs to be an authenticated cgit user with push access to the repository.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is considered low severity because it requires the attacker to have push access and depends on other users viewing the content.
- The vulnerability is fixed in a commit to cgit's stable branch
(<http://hjemli.net/git/cgit/commit/?id=bebe89d7>).
- The vulnerability is present in versions of cgit shipped with Fedora 14 and 15 as well as EPEL 5 and 6.
