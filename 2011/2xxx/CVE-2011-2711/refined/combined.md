Better now. This is how I'd phrase it:

----
A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was found in cgit, a fast web
interface for Git, allowing a remote attacker with push access to a
repository to inject arbitrary HTML code. The new file name in rename
hints is not escaped and can be exploited by renaming some file to a
file with specially-crafted file name, thus leading to a permanent XSS.
----

By the way, this is already fixed in current stable [1] (just because
nobody mentioned it yet).

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=725042#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-07-22 16:42:18 UTC  ``` An cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the way cgit, a fast web interface for Git, processed the file name in the rename hint.

I think you are a tad off, here. The vulnerability I discovered actually
is only exploitable *by* a user with push access as it requires to push
a commit that renames any file to a file with a malicious file name.

The description (and the categorization of the vulnerability, which
definitely is a low severity one if it counts as a vulnerability at all)
should be corrected to reflect that.

Subject: CVE Request -- cGit -- XSS flaw in rename hint

Hello Josh, Steve, vendors,

   an cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the way cgit, a fast
web interface for Git, displayed the file name in the rename hint. A
remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted web page, which once
visited by an authenticated Cgit user, with push access to the
repository, would lead to arbitrary web script or HTML code execution.

Could you allocate a CVE id for this?

Thank you && Regards, Jan.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
