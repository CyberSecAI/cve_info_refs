# Tor 0.2.2.35 is released (security patches)

by erinn | December 16, 2011

![](../static/images/lead.png)

**Tor 0.2.2.35 fixes a critical heap-overflow security issue in Tor's

buffers code. Absolutely everybody should upgrade.**

The bug relied on an incorrect calculation when making data continuous

in one of our IO buffers, if the first chunk of the buffer was

misaligned by just the wrong amount. The miscalculation would allow an

attacker to overflow a piece of heap-allocated memory. To mount this

attack, the attacker would need to either open a SOCKS connection to

Tor's SocksPort (usually restricted to localhost), or target a Tor

instance configured to make its connections through a SOCKS proxy

(which Tor does not do by default).

Good security practice requires that all heap-overflow bugs should be

presumed to be exploitable until proven otherwise, so we are treating

this as a potential code execution attack. Please upgrade immediately!

This bug does not affect bufferevents-based builds of Tor. Special

thanks to "Vektor" for reporting this issue to us!

Tor 0.2.2.35 also fixes several bugs in previous versions, including

crash bugs for unusual configurations, and a long-term bug that

would prevent Tor from starting on Windows machines with draconian

AV software.

With this release, we remind everyone that 0.2.0.x has reached its

formal end-of-life. Those Tor versions have many known flaws, and

nobody should be using them. You should upgrade -- ideally to the

0.2.2.x series. If you're using a Linux or BSD and its packages are

obsolete, stop using those packages and upgrade anyway.

The Tor 0.2.1.x series is also approaching its end-of-life: it will no

longer receive support after some time in early 2012.

**Changes in version 0.2.2.35 - 2011-12-16**

**Major bugfixes:**

* Fix a heap overflow bug that could occur when trying to pull

  data into the first chunk of a buffer, when that chunk had

  already had some data drained from it. Fixes CVE-2011-2778;

  bugfix on 0.2.0.16-alpha. Reported by "Vektor".
* Initialize Libevent with the EVENT\_BASE\_FLAG\_NOLOCK flag enabled, so

  that it doesn't attempt to allocate a socketpair. This could cause

  some problems on Windows systems with overzealous firewalls. Fix for

  bug 4457; workaround for Libevent versions 2.0.1-alpha through

  2.0.15-stable.
* If we mark an OR connection for close based on a cell we process,

  don't process any further cells on it. We already avoid further

  reads on marked-for-close connections, but now we also discard the

  cells we'd already read. Fixes bug 4299; bugfix on 0.2.0.10-alpha,

  which was the first version where we might mark a connection for

  close based on processing a cell on it.
* Correctly sanity-check that we don't underflow on a memory

  allocation (and then assert) for hidden service introduction

  point decryption. Bug discovered by Dan Rosenberg. Fixes bug 4410;

  bugfix on 0.2.1.5-alpha.
* Fix a memory leak when we check whether a hidden service

  descriptor has any usable introduction points left. Fixes bug

  4424. Bugfix on 0.2.2.25-alpha.
* Don't crash when we're running as a relay and don't have a GeoIP

  file. Bugfix on 0.2.2.34; fixes bug 4340. This backports a fix

  we've had in the 0.2.3.x branch already.
* When running as a client, do not print a misleading (and plain

  wrong) log message that we're collecting "directory request"

  statistics: clients don't collect statistics. Also don't create a

  useless (because empty) stats file in the stats/ directory. Fixes

  bug 4353; bugfix on 0.2.2.34.

**Minor bugfixes:**

* Detect failure to initialize Libevent. This fix provides better

  detection for future instances of bug 4457.
* Avoid frequent calls to the fairly expensive cull\_wedged\_cpuworkers

  function. This was eating up hideously large amounts of time on some

  busy servers. Fixes bug 4518; bugfix on 0.0.9.8.
* Resolve an integer overflow bug in smartlist\_ensure\_capacity().

  Fixes bug 4230; bugfix on Tor 0.1.0.1-rc. Based on a patch by

  Mansour Moufid.
* Don't warn about unused log\_mutex in log.c when building with

  --disable-threads using a recent GCC. Fixes bug 4437; bugfix on

  0.1.0.6-rc which introduced --disable-threads.
* When configuring, starting, or stopping an NT service, stop

  immediately after the service configuration attempt has succeeded

  or failed. Fixes bug 3963; bugfix on 0.2.0.7-alpha.
* When sending a NETINFO cell, include the original address

  received for the other side, not its canonical address. Found

  by "troll\_un"; fixes bug 4349; bugfix on 0.2.0.10-alpha.
* Fix a typo in a hibernation-related log message. Fixes bug 4331;

  bugfix on 0.2.2.23-alpha; found by "tmpname0901".
* Fix a memory leak in launch\_direct\_bridge\_descriptor\_fetch() that

  occurred when a client tried to fetch a descriptor for a bridge

  in ExcludeNodes. Fixes bug 4383; bugfix on 0.2.2.25-alpha.
* Backport fixes for a pair of compilation warnings on Windows.

  Fixes bug 4521; bugfix on 0.2.2.28-beta and on 0.2.2.29-beta.
* If we had ever tried to call tor\_addr\_to\_str on an address of

  unknown type, we would have done a strdup on an uninitialized

  buffer. Now we won't. Fixes bug 4529; bugfix on 0.2.1.3-alpha.

  Reported by "troll\_un".
* Correctly detect and handle transient lookup failures from

  tor\_addr\_lookup. Fixes bug 4530; bugfix on 0.2.1.5-alpha.

  Reported by "troll\_un".
* Fix null-pointer access that could occur if TLS allocation failed.

  Fixes bug 4531; bugfix on 0.2.0.20-rc. Found by "troll\_un".
* Use tor\_socket\_t type for listener argument to accept(). Fixes bug

  4535; bugfix on 0.2.2.28-beta. Found by "troll\_un".

**Minor features:**

* Add two new config options for directory authorities:

  AuthDirFastGuarantee sets a bandwidth threshold for guaranteeing the

  Fast flag, and AuthDirGuardBWGuarantee sets a bandwidth threshold

  that is always sufficient to satisfy the bandwidth requirement for

  the Guard flag. Now it will be easier for researchers to simulate

  Tor networks with different values. Resolves ticket 4484.
* When Tor ignores a hidden service specified in its configuration,

  include the hidden service's directory in the warning message.

  Previously, we would only tell the user that some hidden service

  was ignored. Bugfix on 0.0.6; fixes bug 4426.
* Update to the December 6 2011 Maxmind GeoLite Country database.

**Packaging changes:**

* Make it easier to automate expert package builds on Windows,

  by removing an absolute path from makensis.exe command.

I went to the Tor Bundle and downloaded and updated but it still says I am not using the latest version. I checked the settings on my Vidalia and it says I am using Tor 2.2.35...did I miss a step?

Unfortunately, all your 'torproject.org' links are NOT accessable i.e. have been blocked.

It says:

Yep. Same here. TOR download is having problems... Interesting and unusual, Do Not install TOR from another source or here until you hear why this happened.

Package        : tor
Vulnerability  : buffer overflow
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-2778

It was discovered that Tor, an online privacy tool, incorrectly computes
buffer sizes in certain cases involving SOCKS connections.  Malicious
parties could use this to cause a heap-based buffer overflow, potentially
allowing execution of arbitrary code.

In Tor's default configuration this issue can only be triggered by
clients that can connect to Tor's socks port, which listens only on
localhost by default.

In non-default configurations where Tor's SocksPort listens not only on
localhost or where Tor was configured to use another socks server for all of
its outgoing connections, Tor is vulnerable to a larger set of malicious
parties.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.2.1.32-1.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.2.2.35-1~squeeze+1.

For the unstable and testing distributions, this problem has been fixed in
version 0.2.2.35-1.

For the experimental distribution, this problem has has fixed in
version 0.2.3.10-alpha-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your tor packages.

Please note that the update for stable (squeeze) updates this package
from 0.2.1.31 to 0.2.2.35, a new major release of Tor, as upstream has
announced end-of-life for the 0.2.1.x tree for the near future.  Please
check your Tor runs as expected after the upgrade.
