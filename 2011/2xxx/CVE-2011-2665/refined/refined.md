Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2011-2665 (Note: While the provided text does not explicitly mention this CVE ID, the referenced vulnerability is related to a missing left angle bracket in the SIP contact header, which aligns with the root cause of CVE-2011-2665. The analysis will treat the discovered issue as CVE-2011-2665)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in how the Asterisk SIP channel driver parses the Contact header in SIP messages.
- Specifically, the `get_in_brackets` function in `channels/sip/reqresp_parser.c` is susceptible to a missing left angle bracket ('<').
- The code attempts to extract the content within angle brackets in the Contact header, but if the opening bracket is missing, it leads to a crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Null Pointer Dereference:** When a Contact header is received without the leading '<', the parsing logic does not handle it correctly and results in a null pointer dereference. This occurs because the code assumes the existence of the opening bracket.
- **Input Validation Error:** The parser does not validate the SIP header properly, and does not check for the presence of the opening bracket before attempting to parse the content within the brackets.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A remote attacker can crash an Asterisk server by sending a specially crafted SIP message with a Contact header that is missing the left angle bracket. This will cause a denial of service making the Asterisk server unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Unauthenticated Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely without requiring any authentication or prior access to the system.
- **SIP Message Manipulation:** The attack is carried out by crafting a malicious SIP message that is sent to the Asterisk server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send SIP messages to the Asterisk server.
- No specific privileges or authentication are required. The attacker can be an unauthenticated user.

**Additional Details (from the code diff):**

- The patch modifies the `get_in_brackets` function to properly handle cases where the opening bracket is missing. Instead of dereferencing a potential NULL pointer, it logs a warning and returns an error, preventing the crash.
- Additionally a test case `missing_start_bracket` is introduced in `reqresp_parser_test` to verify that the vulnerability is fixed.

**Summary**

The core vulnerability is an input validation error that leads to a crash due to a null pointer dereference when the SIP parser encounters a Contact header missing the opening angle bracket. This allows unauthenticated remote attackers to perform a denial-of-service attack against vulnerable Asterisk servers by sending a crafted SIP message.
