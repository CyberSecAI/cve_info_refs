- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `TCPUploadServer` in Progea Movicon 11 allows remote users to execute functions on the server without any form of authentication.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Lack of authentication for remote access to the `TCPUploadServer` service. This allows unauthenticated users to execute various functions on the server.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary file deletion, arbitrary program execution, denial of service (crashing the server), information disclosure, creation of folders and desktop shortcuts, drive information retrieval, and OS service pack retrieval.
- **Attack vectors**: Network access to the vulnerable service.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send specially crafted TCP packets to the server on port 10651. They do not need any prior authentication or special privileges.
