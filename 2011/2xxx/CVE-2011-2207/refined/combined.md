| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=710529#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-06-03 15:50:17 UTC  ``` Dirmngr, server/client tool for managing and downloading CRLS, used user land threads implementation (Pth) for wrapping up of system calls, that may potentially block. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause a hang of an end-user application, relying of the proper services of the dirmngr daemon, via a request to verify a specially-crafted certificate.  Upstream bug report: [1] <https://bugs.g10code.com/gnupg/issue1313>  Relevant public PoC file: [2] <https://bugs.g10code.com/gnupg/file324/DTAG_Issuing_CA_i01.der>  Upstream patch: [3] <http://cvs.gnupg.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi?root=Dirmngr&view=rev>  References: [4] <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=627377>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=710529#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-06-03 15:52:36 UTC  ``` This issue affects the version of the dirmngr package, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.  --  This issue affects the version of the dirmngr package, as present within EPEL-5 repository.  This issue affects the versions of the dirmngr package, as shipped with Fedora release of 13, 14, and 15.  Note: Having said the above, please have a look at the following note regarding       the impact too.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=710529#c2)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-06-03 16:02:43 UTC  ``` Issue impact: ============= This seems to be very low security impact issue, if even that.  It is true, that dirmngr --daemon hangs for a bit (was less than a minute in my testing) and that during that time period the server was unresponsive even for pings (dirmngr-client --ping) requests, but after that minute the certificate verification *always* ended with the following connection timeout message (following scenario based on reproducer from [1]):  a) start the dirmngr daemon: # dirmngr -vvv --daemon DIRMNGR_INFO=/var/run/dirmngr/socket:26775:1; export DIRMNGR_INFO;  b) start the certificate verification # time dirmngr-client DTAG_Issuing_CA_i01.der  c) in the meantime try to --ping the dirmngr daemon instance # time dirmngr-client --ping  d) look at the time results # time dirmngr-client DTAG_Issuing_CA_i01.der  dirmngr-client: certificate check failed: Connection timed out  real	0m21.003s user	0m0.000s sys	0m0.001s  # time dirmngr-client --ping dirmngr-client: a dirmngr daemon is up and running  real	0m17.100s user	0m0.001s sys	0m0.000s  But as noted in: [5] <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=627377#5>  "For example the KMail hung when trying to verify a signature which has the certificate in the chain."  so this will need further research.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=710529#c3)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-06-03 16:23:13 UTC  ``` CVE Request / Discussion: [6] <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/06/03/8>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=710529#c4)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2011-06-13 09:11:22 UTC  ``` This is a client side DoS and does not seem like a security issue.  An attacker sends you a signed email. You try to verify the signature with an email client which uses dirmngr. This causes the daemon to hang and causes a denial of service to other local clients who want to use the service of dirmngr as well.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=710529#c5)  Vincent Danen    2011-07-06 21:08:33 UTC  ``` This issue was assigned CVE-2011-2207:  <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2011/q2/621>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=710529#c6)  Doran Moppert    2020-02-11 00:27:40 UTC  ``` Statement:  Red Hat Product Security determined that this flaw was not a security vulnerability. See the Bugzilla link for more details.   ``` |  |

At least dirmngr 1.1.0-1 has a defect that it can hang.
This can cause a denial of service for other users and applications,
as dirmngr is a system service serving several requests.

For example the KMail hung when trying to verify a signature
which has the certificate in the chain that is attached to the
report which has all details:

<https://bugs.g10code.com/gnupg/issue1313>
(dirmngr unresponsive when waiting for some http CRL connect() -> ping and other requests fail)

here is the patch rev 347 that fixes the issue:
<http://cvs.gnupg.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi?root=Dirmngr&view=rev>

<http://files.kolab.org/apt/releases/dists/lenny/unstable/source/>
has the following files that already contain a fixed package
for Lenny:

dirmngr_1.1.0+r347-0kk1.diff.gz  19-May-2011 10:59
dirmngr_1.1.0+r347-0kk1.dsc  19-May-2011 10:59
dirmngr_1.1.0+r347.orig.tar.gz

Best,
Bernhard

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

Subject: dirmngr: special requests can make dirmngr hang,
can be denial of service for email signatures
Date: Fri, 20 May 2011 10:11:09 +0200
```
Package: dirmngr
Version: 1.1.0-1
Severity: important
Tags: patch, security

At least dirmngr 1.1.0-1 has a defect that it can hang.
This can cause a denial of service for other users and applications,
as dirmngr is a system service serving several requests.

For example the KMail hung when trying to verify a signature
which has the certificate in the chain that is attached to the
report which has all details:

<https://bugs.g10code.com/gnupg/issue1313>
(dirmngr unresponsive when waiting for some http CRL connect() -> ping and other requests fail)

here is the patch rev 347 that fixes the issue:
<http://cvs.gnupg.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi?root=Dirmngr&view=rev>

<http://files.kolab.org/apt/releases/dists/lenny/unstable/source/>
has the following files that already contain a fixed package
for Lenny:

dirmngr_1.1.0+r347-0kk1.diff.gz  19-May-2011 10:59
dirmngr_1.1.0+r347-0kk1.dsc  19-May-2011 10:59
dirmngr_1.1.0+r347.orig.tar.gz

Best,
Bernhard
