{
  "CVE-2011-2207": {
    "Description": "dirmngr before 2.1.0 improperly handles certain system calls, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (DOS) via a specially-crafted certificate.",
    "Root cause": "Improper handling of blocking system calls when verifying a certificate.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "The dirmngr daemon uses user-land threads (Pth) to wrap system calls that may block.",
      "The dirmngr does not handle blocking calls properly."
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS) by sending a specially crafted certificate to a dirmngr instance, which causes it to hang, affecting other clients relying on the dirmngr service.",
     "Attack vectors": [
        "A remote attacker can send a specially crafted certificate for verification.",
        "An attacker can send signed emails or files with a malicious certificate."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to send a specially crafted certificate to the dirmngr service, either directly or indirectly (e.g. via email).",
    "Additional Information": [
        "The dirmngr daemon becomes unresponsive for a period during the certificate verification which can affect other clients that relies on the service.",
        "The application(s) that rely on dirmngr (e.g. KMail, gpgsm), may experience a hang or denial of service as a result of the issue.",
        "The issue is triggered during certificate verification. This includes the verification of S/MIME email signatures. "
