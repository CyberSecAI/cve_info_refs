Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2011-2776:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A buffer overflow exists in the syslog logging code of the `super` program.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Buffer Overflow: The vulnerability is a classic buffer overflow, which occurs when a program attempts to write data beyond the allocated memory buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution: Although not explicitly stated, buffer overflows can often be exploited to achieve remote code execution by overwriting critical parts of memory. The advisory mentions that the problem type is "remote," indicating the potential for remote exploitation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Exploitation of the vulnerable syslog logging functionality in the `super` program.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Remote Access: The vulnerability is remotely exploitable. An attacker would need to interact with the vulnerable system through a method that triggers the syslog logging functionality.
- The attacker needs to supply input that triggers the buffer overflow in the syslog logging mechanism of the `super` tool.

**Additional Notes:**
- The default Debian configuration is not affected, suggesting specific configurations could expose the vulnerability.
- The `super` program allows execution of scripts/commands as root, so a successful exploit could lead to full system compromise.
- Fixes were released for oldstable (lenny), stable (squeeze), and unstable (sid) Debian distributions.
