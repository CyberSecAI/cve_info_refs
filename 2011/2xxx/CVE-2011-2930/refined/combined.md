There is a vulnerability in the quote\_table\_name method which could allow malicious users to inject arbitrary SQL into a query. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-YYYY-XXXX.

Versions Affected: All.
Fixed Versions: 3.0.10, 2.3.13, 3.1.0.rc5

Impact
------

The quote\_table\_name method in the ActiveRecord adapaters for Ruby on Rails were initially created solely for the purpose of escaping reserved words encountered in table names. However over time 3rd party libraries, and rails itself, grew to rely on those functions as a way to sanitize potentially malicious user input. As a result these functions need to be hardened to manage malicious input rather than assuming they're being passed benign values generated by rails itself.

All users running an affected release should upgrade immediately.

Releases
--------

The 3.0.10, 2.3.13 and v3.1.0.rc5 releases are available at the normal locations.

Workarounds
-----------

There are no feasible workarounds for this issue.

Patches
-------
To aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided patches for the two supported release series. They are in git-am format and consist of a single changeset.

\* 2-3-sql\_injection.patch - Patch for 2.3 series
\* 3-0-sql\_injection.patch - Patch for 3.0 series
\* 3-1-sql\_injection.patch - Patch for 3.1 series

Please note that only the 2.3.x and 3.0.x series are supported at present. Users of earlier unsupported releases are advised to upgrade as soon as possible.

Subject: Re: CVE request: ruby on rails flaws (4)

Sorry, there is one more flaw that needs a CVE assignment:

Response splitting flaw in 2.3.x (3.0.0 and later not affected).
<http://groups.google.com/group/rubyonrails-security/browse_thread/thread/6ffc93bde0298768>

<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=732156>

Sorry I missed this one earlier, I was looking at the 3.x advisory page and missed this one.

CVE ID         : CVE-2011-2930 CVE-2011-2931 CVE-2011-3186 CVE-2009-4214

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Rails, the Ruby web
application framework. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:

CVE-2009-4214

    A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability had been found in the
    strip_tags function. An attacker may inject non-printable characters
    that certain browsers will then evaluate. This vulnerability only
    affects the oldstable distribution (lenny).

CVE-2011-2930

    A SQL injection vulnerability had been found in the quote_table_name
    method could allow malicious users to inject arbitrary SQL into a
    query.

CVE-2011-2931

    A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability had been found in the
    strip_tags  helper. An parsing error can be exploited by an attacker,
    who can confuse the parser and may inject HTML tags into the output
    document.

CVE-2011-3186

    A newline (CRLF) injection vulnerability had been found in
    response.rb. This vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary
    HTTP headers and conduct HTTP response splitting attacks via the
    Content-Type header.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.1.0-7+lenny1.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.5-1.2+squeeze1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.14.

We recommend that you upgrade your rails packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
