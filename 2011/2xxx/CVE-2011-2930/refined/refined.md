Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2011-2930:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies within the `quote_table_name` method of the ActiveRecord adapters in Ruby on Rails.
- This method was initially intended to escape reserved words in table names. However, it was later used by third-party libraries and Rails itself to sanitize user input, which it was not designed for.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **SQL Injection:** The `quote_table_name` method does not properly sanitize potentially malicious user input. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into database queries.
- The method's purpose expanded beyond its initial design, leading to the assumption that it would receive only benign values generated by Rails, and not malicious user-controlled input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary SQL Execution:** A successful exploit enables an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database.
- **Data Breach/Manipulation:** This could lead to data being stolen, modified, or deleted.
- **Application Compromise:** The attacker could potentially gain control of the application or the underlying system.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious User Input:** Attackers can inject malicious SQL code by manipulating input parameters that are eventually passed to the vulnerable `quote_table_name` method.
- This can be done through web forms, API calls, or any other method that allows user-controlled data to influence database queries.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to influence input:** The attacker needs to be able to provide input that is used in the generation of a SQL query that uses `quote_table_name`.
- **Understanding of SQL and the application's data model:** A successful exploit typically requires the attacker to have some understanding of SQL syntax and the application's database structure.

**Additional Information:**

- **Affected Versions:** All versions of Ruby on Rails prior to the patched versions are affected.
- **Fixed Versions:** The vulnerability is fixed in Ruby on Rails versions 3.0.10, 2.3.13, and 3.1.0.rc5.
- **Workarounds:** There are no feasible workarounds other than upgrading to a patched version.
- Patches were also provided for affected versions.
