Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2011-2719:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the phpMyAdmin application's handling of user-provided input when the Swekey authentication extension is enabled. Specifically, it's due to insufficient sanitization of the query string.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Session Manipulation:** A remote attacker can manipulate PHP superglobal variables, including the `SESSION` variable.
*   **Global Namespace Manipulation:** The attacker can manipulate variables within the global namespace.
*  **Local variable manipulation:** The attacker can manipulate local variables specific to the vulnerable Swekey function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   A remote attacker can potentially manipulate the session and other variables, which could lead to various consequences, including, but not limited to:
    *   Bypassing authentication
    *   Elevating privileges.
    *   Altering application state or behavior.
    *   Possibly executing arbitrary code if combined with other vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely.
*  **HTTP Query String:** The attacker injects malicious input through the query string, which is processed by the Swekey authentication module.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the phpMyAdmin instance.
*  **Swekey Extension Enabled:** The Swekey authentication extension must be enabled on the target phpMyAdmin instance for the vulnerability to be exploitable.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is similar to another vulnerability, PMASA-2011-5, but this vulnerability requires Swekey authentication to be active.
*   The issue is identified as PMASA-2011-12 by the phpMyAdmin team.
*   Patches are available in phpMyAdmin versions 3.3.10.3 and 3.4.3.2.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Frans Pehrson from Xxor AB.
*   CWE IDs associated with the vulnerability include CWE-661 and CWE-473.
