## PMASA-2011-12

**Announcement-ID:** PMASA-2011-12

**Date:** 2011-07-23

**Updated:** 2011-07-25

### Summary

Possible superglobal and local variables manipulation in swekey authentication.

### Description

It was possible to manipulate the PHP superglobals (including SESSION) using some of the Swekey authentication code. Also, variables local to the affected Swekey function were at risk.
This is similar to PMASA-2011-5.

### Severity

We consider this vulnerability to be critical.

### Mitigation factor

The Swekey authentication mechanism must be activated (which is not a requirement in the case of PMASA-2011-5).

### Affected Versions

The 3.4.3.1 and earlier versions are affected.

### Unaffected Versions

Branch 2.11.x is not affected by this.

### Solution

Upgrade to phpMyAdmin 3.3.10.3 or 3.4.3.2 or apply the related patch listed below.

### References

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

Subject: CVE-Request -- phpMyAdmin -- PMASA-2011-11 and PMASA-2011-12

Hello Josh, Steve, vendors,

   the following two doesn't seem to have CVE identifiers yet:
1) <http://www.phpmyadmin.net/home_page/security/PMASA-2011-11.php>

A local file inclusion and arbitrary SQL code execution flaws were
found in the way phpMyAdmin, the MySQL over WWW administration tool,
performed 'export_type' sanitization, when retrieving and verifying
relation schema export options. A local attacker could use this flaw to
obtain security sensitive information or, potentially, execute
arbitrary SQL code with the privileges of the user running the query.

References:

[2] <http://www.phpmyadmin.net/home_page/news.php>
[3] <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=725383>

Upstream patches:

Further flaw exploitation note:
An attacker must be logged in via phpMyAdmin to exploit this problem.

Affected versions:
Versions 3.4.0 to 3.4.3.1 are affected.

2) <http://www.phpmyadmin.net/home_page/security/PMASA-2011-12.php>

A session values manipulation flaw was found in the way phpMyAdmin, the
MySQL over WWW administration tool, performed sanitization of the
user-provided query string, when the Swekey extension based
authentication method was enabled. A remote attacker could use this flaw
to manipulate the PHP session superglobal variable via specially-crafted
query string provided to the Swekey authentication module.

Upstream patches:
[5]
<http://phpmyadmin.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin;a=commitdiff;h=e7bb42c002885c2aca7aba4d431b8c63ae4de9b7>

Patches against v3.3 branch:
[7]
<http://phpmyadmin.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin;a=commitdiff;h=f6f6ee3f1171addb166fa18e75a0b56599bf374c>

Affected Versions:
The 3.4.3.1 and earlier versions are affected.
Branch 2.11.x is not affected by this.

3) The other two recent phpMyAdmin issues (addressed in v3.3.10.3,
v3.4.3.2) already have CVE identifiers:
[1] <http://www.phpmyadmin.net/home_page/security/PMASA-2011-10.php>
[2] <http://www.phpmyadmin.net/home_page/security/PMASA-2011-9.php>

Cc-ed phpMyAdmin upstream contact, Herman van Rink, to correct me on
the description of the 1) and 2) flaws, where appropriate.

Josh, Steve, could you please allocate CVE ids for 1) PMASA-2011-11.php
and 2) PMASA-2011-12.php issues?

Thank you && Regards, Jan.
