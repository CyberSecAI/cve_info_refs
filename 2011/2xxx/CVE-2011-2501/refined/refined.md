Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2011-2501:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a regression of a previously fixed issue (CVE-2004-0421) in the libpng library. This means that a fix for a vulnerability was unintentionally removed or altered during the development of libpng version 1.2.23 and later. Specifically, the `png_format_buffer()` function in `pngerror.c` contains an off-by-one error.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Off-by-one error:**  The `png_format_buffer()` function has an off-by-one error. This can lead to writing past the allocated buffer when formatting error messages, leading to memory corruption.
*   **Regression:** The primary issue is that a fix for a previous vulnerability was reverted in later versions of the libpng library.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A carefully crafted PNG image can trigger the vulnerability, leading to a crash of the application using the libpng library.
*   **Memory Corruption:** The off-by-one error in `png_format_buffer()` can corrupt memory, potentially leading to further issues.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Some sources suggest the possibility of arbitrary code execution, though this is not explicitly stated in all sources.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious PNG Image:** The primary attack vector is through the use of specially crafted PNG images. If an application processes a malicious PNG, it will trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Supply Malicious PNG:** The attacker needs the ability to supply a malicious PNG image to an application that uses the vulnerable version of the libpng library. This could be through a web browser, email, or other means where the application processes images.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects libpng versions 1.2.23 and later, including 1.4.x and 1.5.x.
*   The vulnerability was addressed in libpng 1.4.8beta04.
*   Various Linux distributions have released security updates to address the vulnerability in their respective versions of libpng.
*   The original vulnerability, CVE-2004-0421, was also a denial of service vulnerability related to processing malformed PNG images.

In summary, CVE-2011-2501 is a regression vulnerability in libpng that allows attackers to trigger denial-of-service conditions or potentially achieve arbitrary code execution through maliciously crafted PNG images. The core issue is an off-by-one error in the `png_format_buffer()` function, which can lead to memory corruption.
