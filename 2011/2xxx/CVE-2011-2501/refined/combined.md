| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=717084#c0)  Vincent Danen    2011-06-27 22:34:45 UTC  ``` It was reported [1] that the fix for [CVE-2004-0421](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2004-0421) in libpng was inadvertently reverted during the 1.2.23 development cycle.  The original flaw could be used to cause a denial of service via a carefully-crafted PNG image.  This would affect all versions of libpng >=1.2.23, including 1.4.x and 1.5.x.  [1] <http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_name=BANLkTikrnU6FJNQYFvwmt78hwpgKPVRd1Q%40mail.gmail.com&forum_name=png-mng-implement>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=717084#c1)  Vincent Danen    2011-06-27 22:43:19 UTC  ``` Upstream fix is here:  <http://libpng.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=libpng/libpng;a=commitdiff;h=65e6d5a34f49acdb362a0625a706c6b914e670af>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=717084#c4)  Huzaifa S.

I've diffed the tarballs and there is essentially no difference except version numbers and the security fixes we want.  Indeed, the entire reason why upstream is still maintaining 1.2.x is to provide security fixes, so it would be a bit discourteous to them to not use their tarballs ...  RHEL5 and back probably can't be handled that way, unfortunately.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=717084#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-07-28 18:22:52 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2011:1105 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-1105.html>   ``` |  |

Subject: CVE request for libpng regression (CVE-2004-0421)

It looks like CVE-2004-0421 was regressed upstream a few years ago and
was not noticed.

References:
<http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_name=BANLkTikrnU6FJNQYFvwmt78hwpgKPVRd1Q%40mail.gmail.com&forum_name=png-mng-implement>

Could a CVE name be supplied?  I don't know if upstream has requested
one independently or not.

Debian Bug     : #632786 #633871

The PNG library libpng has been affected by several vulnerabilities. The
most critical one is the identified as CVE-2011-2690. Using this
vulnerability, an  attacker is able to overwrite memory with an
arbitrary amount of data controlled by her via a crafted PNG image.

The other vulnerabilities are less critical and allow an attacker to
cause a  crash in the program (denial of service) via a crafted PNG
image.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.27-2+lenny5. Due to a technical limitation in the Debian
archive processing scripts, the updated packages cannot be released
in paralell with the packages for Squeeze. They will appear shortly.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.44-1+squeeze1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.46-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your libpng packages.

# USN-1175-1: libpng vulnerabilities

26 July 2011

Libpng could be made to run programs as your login if it opened a
specially crafted file.

### Reduce your security exposure

## Details

Frank Busse discovered that libpng did not properly handle certain

malformed PNG images. If a user or automated system were tricked into

opening a crafted PNG file, an attacker could cause libpng to crash,

resulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu

10.04 LTS, 10.10, and 11.04. ([CVE-2011-2501](/security/CVE-2011-2501))

It was discovered that libpng did not properly handle certain malformed PNG

images. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a crafted

PNG file, an attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly execute

arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program.

# libpng: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201206-15**

Multiple vulnerabilities in libpng might allow remote attackers to
execute arbitrary code or cause a Denial of Service condition.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-libs/libpng** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.5.10** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.5.10**>= **1.2.49** |

### Background

libpng is a standard library used to process PNG (Portable Network
Graphics) images. It is used by several programs, including web browsers
and potentially server processes.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in libpng:

* The “embedded\_profile\_len()” function in pngwutil.c does not
  check for negative values, resulting in a memory leak (CVE-2009-5063).
* The “png\_format\_buffer()” function in pngerror.c contains an
  off-by-one error (CVE-2011-2501).
* The “png\_rgb\_to\_gray()” function in pngrtran.c contains an
  integer overflow error (CVE-2011-2690).
* The “png\_err()” function in pngerror.c contains a NULL pointer
  dereference error (CVE-2011-2691).
* The “png\_handle\_sCAL()” function in pngrutil.c improperly handles
  malformed sCAL chunks(CVE-2011-2692).
* The “png\_decompress\_chunk()” function in pngrutil.c contains an
  integer overflow error (CVE-2011-3026).
* The “png\_inflate()” function in pngrutil.c contains and out of
  bounds error (CVE-2011-3045).
* The “png\_set\_text\_2()” function in pngset.c contains an error
  which could result in memory corruption (CVE-2011-3048).
* The “png\_formatted\_warning()” function in pngerror.c contains an
  off-by-one error (CVE-2011-3464).

### Impact

An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary
code with the permissions of the user running the vulnerable program,
which could be the root user, or to cause programs linked against the
library to crash.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All libpng 1.5 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/libpng-1.5.10"

```

All libpng 1.2 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/libpng-1.2.49"

```

Packages which depend on this library may need to be recompiled. Tools
such as revdep-rebuild may assist in identifying some of these packages.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
