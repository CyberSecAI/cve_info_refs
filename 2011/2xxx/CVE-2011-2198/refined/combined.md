# CVE-2011-2198

| **Name** | CVE-2011-2198 |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | The "insert-blank-characters" capability in caps.c in gnome-terminal (vte) before 0.28.1 allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (CPU and memory consumption and crash) via a crafted file, as demonstrated by a file containing the string "\033[100000000000000000@". |

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=652124#c0)  Josselin Mouette    2011-06-08 16:12:09 UTC  ``` [ Original report: <http://bugs.debian.org/629688> by âvladzâ ]  When passing a huge value to the "insert-blank-characters" capability (defined in caps.c), gnome-terminal crashes (and maybe other terminals that depend on libvte9).     $ cat -n vte-0.24.3/src/caps.c:   [...]   418          {CSI "%d@", "insert-blank-characters", 0},  To reproduce the crash:   printf "\033[100000000000000000@"  This causes the terminal to consume all available memory. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=652124#c1)  Behdad Esfahbod    2011-06-08 16:31:31 UTC  ``` Anyone feel like looking into this?  Should be safe to limit any numbers read to something small, like 1024? ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=652124#c2)  Behdad Esfahbod    2011-06-08 16:35:55 UTC  ``` Just look for g_value_set_long() in table.c and trie.c.  Doesn't look hard. ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=652124#c3)  Christian Persch    2011-06-08 18:43:40 UTC  ``` /* Insert N characters. */ static void vte_sequence_handler_IC (VteTerminal *terminal, GValueArray *params) {         vte_sequence_handler_multiple(terminal, params, vte_sequence_handler_ic); }  Just introduce a vte_sequence_handler_multiple_limited variant that limits the number to the passed max.  What does xterm do here? ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=652124#c4)  vladz    2011-06-09 12:19:57 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 189541](attachment.cgi?id=189541 "Patch the vte_sequence_handler_IC() function") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=189541&action=edit "Patch the vte_sequence_handler_IC() function") [[review]](review?bug=652124&attachment=189541) Patch the vte_sequence_handler_IC() function ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=652124#c5)  vladz    2011-06-09 12:21:38 UTC  ``` Hi,  Xterm checks the parameter value inside the InsertChar() function, and sets a default value if it's to big.  Where the default (limit variant) depends  on the terminal size:   xterm-261/util.c:   [...]  972 /*  973  * Insert n blanks at the cursor's position, no wraparound  974  */  975 void  976 InsertChar(XtermWidget xw, unsigned n)  977 {  [...]  980     unsigned limit;  {...]  995     limit = (unsigned) (MaxCols(screen) - screen->cur_col);  996  997     if (n > limit)  998         n = limit;  The patch I've attached above does the same thing.  Is this ok for you? ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=652124#c6)  Behdad Esfahbod    2011-06-09 17:30:49 UTC  ``` LGTM.  Have you tested this and works? ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=652124#c7)  Christian Persch    2011-06-09 19:03:30 UTC  ``` I don't think this is the right place for this check. In vte_sequence_handler_IC it's not assured that the params[0] is a GValue with a long. ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=652124#c8)  Christian Persch    2011-06-10 15:37:02 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 189650](attachment.cgi?id=189650 "patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=189650&action=edit "patch") [[review]](review?bug=652124&attachment=189650) patch ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=652124#c9)  Christian Persch    2011-06-14 21:53:50 UTC  ``` Fixed on vte-0-28 and master; 0.28.1 released. ``` |  |

Subject: libvte9: malicious escape sequence causes gnome-terminal to crash
(memory consumption DoS)
Date: Wed, 8 Jun 2011 16:50:24 +0200
```
Package: libvte9
Version: 1:0.24.3-2
Severity: important

When passing a huge value to the "insert-blank-characters" capability
(defined in caps.c), gnome-terminal crashes (and maybe other terminals
that depend on libvte9).

  $ cat -n vte-0.24.3/src/caps.c:
  [...]
  418          {CSI "%d@", "insert-blank-characters", 0},

To reproduce the crash:

  $ printf "\033[100000000000000000@" > /tmp/x
  $ cat /tmp/x

A sub-function calls the "brk()" syscall until process memory is
entirely consumed:

  $ strace -e brk -f gnome-terminal --disable-factory -x cat /tmp/x

Maybe this parameter value should be checked?

I wrote a small patch that checks this value inside the
vte_sequence_handler_multiple() function in the vte-0.24.3/src/vteseq.c
file.  Let me know if you're interested.

Tested on Debian Release 6.0.1, kernel 2.6.32-5-amd64, gnome-terminal
2.30.2-1.

Thanks for the report. I think this has security implications, since
this is a potential remote DoS.

Please send any patches to the upstream bug I opened.

Dear maintainer,

Recently you fixed one or more security problems and as a result you closed
this bug. These problems were not serious enough for a Debian Security
Advisory, so they are now on my radar for fixing in the following suites
through point releases:

lenny (5.0.9)
squeeze (6.0.3)

Please prepare a minimal-changes upload targetting each of these suites,
and submit a debdiff to the Release Team [0] for consideration. They will
offer additional guidance or instruct you to upload your package.

I will happily assist you at any stage if the patch is straightforward and
you need help or lack time. Please keep me in CC at all times so I can
track the progress of this request.

For details of this process and the rationale, please see the original
announcement [1] and my blog post [2].

# Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin - January 2015

## Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin - January 2015

### Description

The Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin announces patches for one or more security vulnerabilities fixed in third party software that is included in Oracle Solaris distributions. Starting January 20, 2015, Third Party Bulletins are released on the same day when Oracle Critical Patch Updates are released. These bulletins will also be updated on the Tuesday closest to the 17th of the following two months after their release (i.e. the two months between the normal quarterly Critical Patch Update publication dates). In addition, Third Party Bulletins may also be updated for vulnerability fixes deemed too critical to wait for the next monthly update.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Third Party Bulletin fixes as soon as possible.**

### Patch Availability

Please see My Oracle Support Note [1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=98620971207196&id=1448883.1)

### Third Party Bulletin Schedule

Third Party Bulletins are released on the Tuesday closest to the 17th day of January, April, July and October. The next four dates are:

* 14 April 2015
* 14 July 2015
* 20 October 2015
* 19 January 2016

Subject: CVE Request -- vte -- Excessive memory and CPU use by processing
 certain character sequences

Hello, Josh, Steve, vendors,

   An memory exhaustion flaw was found in the way VTE, a terminal
emulator widget, processed certain character sequences. A remote
attacker could provide a specially-crafted file, which once opened
in a terminal using the VTE terminal emulator could lead to excessive
memory and CPU consumption (leading to subsequent particular process
termination by OOM killer on some systems).

[3] <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=712148>

Could you allocate a CVE identifier for this?

Thank you & Regards, Jan.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=712148#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-06-09 15:27:55 UTC  ``` An memory exhaustion flaw was found in the way VTE, a terminal emulator widget, processed certain character sequences. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted file, which once opened in a terminal using the VTE terminal emulator could lead to excessive memory and CPU consumption.
