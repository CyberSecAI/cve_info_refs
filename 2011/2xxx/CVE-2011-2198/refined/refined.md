Based on the provided documents, here's a summary of the CVE-2011-2198 vulnerability:

- **Vulnerability:** Memory exhaustion in `gnome-terminal` (VTE) due to processing crafted character sequences.
- **Root Cause:** The "insert-blank-characters" capability in `caps.c` does not properly validate the size parameter. An attacker can provide a large value (e.g., `\033[100000000000000000@`) leading to excessive memory allocation via the `brk()` syscall, high CPU usage, and a denial-of-service (DoS).
- **Attack Vector:** A remote, authenticated user can exploit this vulnerability by providing a crafted file to a terminal using VTE.
- **Impact:**
  - Denial of Service (DoS): The terminal consumes all available memory and CPU, potentially leading to a crash or termination by the OOM killer.
- **Affected Versions:** VTE versions before 0.28.1 are vulnerable.
- **Fix:** Introduced a check/limit on the parameter value passed to the "insert-blank-characters" capability to prevent excessive memory allocation. The fix involves limiting the number of characters inserted based on available terminal size.
