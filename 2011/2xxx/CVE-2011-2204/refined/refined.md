Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-2204:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance**

The provided content clearly references CVE-2011-2204, specifically in the context of Apache Tomcat and its usage in various products, including HP-UX, HP Secure Web Server, and Debian. The vulnerability is consistently described as a password disclosure issue in log files.

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information**

*   **Root Cause:**
    *   When using the `MemoryUserDatabase` (based on `tomcat-users.xml`) and creating users via JMX, an exception during the user creation process may trigger an error message that includes the user's password.
    *   This error message is written both to the JMX client and to the Tomcat logs.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** User passwords are inadvertently exposed in log files and JMX client outputs.
    *   Lack of proper error handling when creating users via JMX.
    *   Passwords not being masked/redacted in log outputs.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Passwords**: Administrators with JMX access or read access to `tomcat-users.xml` can see user passwords.
    *   **Potential Information Disclosure:** Users who can read log files may be able to discover passwords, even if they don't have JMX access.
*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Exploiting JMX interface to create users, which triggers error logging containing passwords.
    *   Directly accessing the server's log files.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **JMX Access:** Requires the attacker to have JMX access to the Tomcat server.
    *   **Log File Access:** Alternatively, the attacker requires the ability to read the log files of the affected system.
    *   **Local Access**: In some cases, as described in the HP security bulletin, access to the log files may be sufficient, which could be obtained locally.
* **Affected Software**
    *  HP-UX Apache running Tomcat Servlet Engine
    *  HP Secure Web Server (SWS) for OpenVMS running CSWS_JAVA
    *  Debian tomcat6
    *  Apple OS X Lion Server with Tomcat
    *  HP XP P9000 Performance Advisor Software
    * Red Hat JBoss Web Server, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Fedora
    * Apache Tomcat 5.5.x and 6.x and 7.0.x

**Additional Notes**

*   The content provides more detail than the basic CVE description, elaborating on the specific scenario that triggers the vulnerability (JMX user creation and error logging)
*   The CVSS score for CVE-2011-2204 is consistently listed as 1.9 (AV:L/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N), showing local access, medium complexity and partial confidentiality impact.
*   Multiple vendors have acknowledged and patched this vulnerability, indicating its wide impact across different products and platforms using Apache Tomcat.
*  Many of the sources list a number of other CVEs as being resolved with the same patch, often related to the same underlying issues around security when using Tomcat.
*   The vulnerability is generally considered "low" or "moderate" in severity by the vendors.
