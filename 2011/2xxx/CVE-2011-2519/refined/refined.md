  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE-ID": "CVE-2011-2519",
    "description": "A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's Xen hypervisor implementation emulated the SAHF instruction. When using a fully-virtualized guest on a host that does not use hardware assisted paging (HAP), such as those running CPUs that do not have support for (or those that have it disabled) Intel Extended Page Tables (EPT) or AMD Virtualization (AMD-V) Rapid Virtualization Indexing (RVI), a privileged guest user could trigger this flaw to cause the hypervisor to crash.",
    "affected_components": [
      "Linux kernel's Xen hypervisor implementation"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a flaw in how the Linux kernel's Xen hypervisor emulates the SAHF instruction on systems without hardware assisted paging (HAP).",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Improper emulation of the SAHF instruction leading to memory corruption."
    ],
    "impact": "A privileged guest user could cause the hypervisor to crash.",
    "attack_vector": "A privileged user within a fully-virtualized Xen guest.",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a privileged user in a fully-virtualized Xen guest. The host must not use hardware-assisted paging (HAP), meaning CPUs without EPT or AMD-V Rapid Virtualization Indexing (RVI) support or where these features are disabled."
