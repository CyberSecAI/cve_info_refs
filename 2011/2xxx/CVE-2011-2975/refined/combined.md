# Welcome to MapServer[Â¶](#welcome-to-mapserver "Link to this heading")

MapServer is an [Open Source](https://opensource.org/) platform for publishing spatial data and
interactive mapping applications to the web. Originally developed in the
mid-1990âs at the University of Minnesota, MapServer is released under an
[MIT-style license](copyright.html#license), and runs on all major platforms
([Windows](download.html#windows), [Linux](download.html#linux), [Mac OS X](download.html#osx)).
MapServer is not a full-featured [GIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system) system, nor does it aspire to
be. See the [Site Gallery](https://github.com/MapServer/MapServer/wiki/MapServer-Site-Gallery)
for live examples of MapServer in action.

The MapServer [Project Steering Committee (PSC)](psc.html#psc), sanctioned by
[OSGeo](https://www.osgeo.org), manages and administers the project which is maintained, improved,

Hi,

One remark: the "missing connection" error was a fault alarm (CONNECTION is not needed with TILEINDEX).  We got those lines into log file at least with Mapserver 5.2 series but it has been corrected later.  Version 6.0 does not produce those. I do not remember what was the situation with 5.4.x and 5.6.x.
Add DEBUG 5 into your layer, let's hope it will generate something useful into into Mapserver log.

Aihe: Re: [mapserver-users] msShapefileOpen(): Unable to access file

Dave,

Strange, it should work.  I'm using mapserver v5.6.3, with a layer def of:

   LAYER # LINE
     NAME 'LINE'
     CONNECTIONTYPE OGR
     STATUS on
     TILEINDEX "G:\GeoData\1_250k\Alberta\AltaLIS\250k_west.shp"
     TYPE LINE
     PROJECTION
       'proj=tmerc'
       'ellps=GRS80'
       'lat_0=0.0'
       'lon_0=-117.0'
       'x_0=500000.0'
       'y_0=-5000000'
       'k=0.9996'
       'units=m'
       'nadgrids=@null'
       'no_defs'
     END
     INCLUDE "AltaLIS_250k_render_inc.map"
   END

and the content of the "location" attribute reported by ogrinfo is :

   LOCATION (String) = G:\GeoData\1_250k\Alberta\AltaLIS\82gpos.dgn

Try adding a PROJECTION object to your LAYER def.  And try using a full
path in the TILEINDEX.

Best Regards,
Brent Fraser
