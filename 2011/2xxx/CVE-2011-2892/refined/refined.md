Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2011-2892:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in two distinct issues within Joomla! 1.6.1 and lower:

1.  **Information Disclosure:** The application does not properly handle requests with specific parameters, leading to the exposure of the full server path.
2.  **Clickjacking:** The application lacks proper protection against being embedded in a frame, allowing for clickjacking attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Information Disclosure:** Specifically, the vulnerability is present in how Joomla! handles the `Itemid` parameter within the `index.php` file. By sending a request with `Itemid[]`, the application reveals the full server path.
2.  **Clickjacking:** The Joomla! administrator interface lacks appropriate headers to prevent it from being embedded in an iframe on a malicious site.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

1.  **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can discover the full server path, which can be used to assist in further attacks, such as directory traversal or file inclusion vulnerabilities.
2.  **Clickjacking:** An attacker can trick a logged-in administrator into performing unintended actions, such as changing settings or creating new administrative users, by overlaying a malicious frame on top of the legitimate Joomla! admin interface.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Information Disclosure:** The attack vector involves sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the `index.php` file with a malformed `Itemid` parameter, e.g., `index.php?Itemid[]=`
2.  **Clickjacking:** The attack vector is to embed the Joomla! administrator interface within an iframe controlled by the attacker. This can be achieved by creating a malicious HTML page with an iframe that loads the Joomla! administrator interface. Then, the attacker would overlay transparent elements that the user is tricked into clicking, which will activate elements within the embedded frame.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

1.  **Information Disclosure:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to a vulnerable Joomla! installation. No authentication or special access is required.
2.  **Clickjacking:** The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious web page with an iframe that can load the Joomla! admin interface, and to lure a logged-in administrator into visiting this page.

**Additional Information:**

*   The provided blog post includes Proof-of-Concept (PoC) URLs for both the Information Disclosure and Clickjacking vulnerabilities, as well as links to the vendor's security announcements.
*   The affected versions of Joomla! are 1.6.1 and lower.

These vulnerabilities are related to CVE-2011-2892, as they were publicly disclosed and addressed by Joomla! around that time.
