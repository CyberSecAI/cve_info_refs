# World writable pid and lock files.

Hello!

I imagine why files listed below have 666 file mode bits set:
/var/run/checkers.pid
/var/run/vrrp.pid
/var/run/keepalived.pid
/var/run/starter.pid
/var/lock/subsys/ipsec

```
Files are created during startup of ipsec (pluto) and keepalived
deamons.
```

```
I think thar leaving them world writable is security hole. For example
delete or change of its content could confuses monit watching them
running and restarting when they die.
```

Regards.

It should be mandatory for initscripts to verify the pid is indeed an
instance of there daemon.

...as well as correcting the world writable bit.

You could get the initscripts to send signals to any PID you want, so
yes, it is a nasty security issue.
