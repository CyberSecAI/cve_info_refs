Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-2964:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `foomatic-rip` filter's improper handling of command-line arguments, specifically those originating from the `FoomaticRIPCommandLine` field within PostScript Printer Description (PPD) files. This improper sanitization allows attackers to inject arbitrary commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Command Injection:** The core issue is a command injection vulnerability. The `foomatic-rip` filter doesn't adequately validate or sanitize the content of the `FoomaticRIPCommandLine` argument from PPD files before executing them.
- **Insecure Handling of PPD Files:** The vulnerability is exposed due to the way `foomatic-rip` processes PPD files, allowing malicious content in the `FoomaticRIPCommandLine` to be executed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The code is executed with the privileges of the `lp` user, which can lead to further compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Specially Crafted PPD Files:** Attackers craft malicious PPD files containing a modified `FoomaticRIPCommandLine` with embedded commands.
- **User Interaction:** A user needs to be enticed into printing a document using a malicious PPD file, usually through the CUPS printing system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Provide PPD File:** An attacker needs the ability to supply the specially crafted PPD file to the user who then attempts printing with it. This can be a remote host which is listed in the printing ACL. Or a local user, for example.
- **No CUPS AppArmor profile:** The Ubuntu security notice mentions that a default installation would isolate the vulnerability with the CUPS AppArmor profile. So without such profile an attacker has more attack surface.

**Additional Technical Details and Context:**

- **Two Implementations:** It was noted that there are two implementations of the `foomatic-rip` filter (one in Perl and one in C) and both are vulnerable to the same kind of issue. Therefore, the vulnerability is present in different versions of `foomatic-filters`, requiring multiple patches.
- **CUPS Server:** The vulnerability can be demonstrated using the CUPS server which reads PPD files. The attack vector involves tricking the system into executing the malicious `FoomaticRIPCommandLine` by printing to a queue that uses the modified PPD file.
- **Patching:** Patches address the improper sanitization in both the Perl and C code versions of the filter, which is reflected in the fix for this CVE that required multiple commits.
