    "cve_id": "CVE-2011-2923",
    "description": "foomatic-rip filter, all versions, used insecurely creates temporary files for storage of PostScript data by rendering the data when the debug mode was enabled. This flaw may be exploited by a local attacker to conduct symlink attacks by overwriting arbitrary files accessible with the privileges of the user running the foomatic-rip universal print filter.",
    "affected_components": [
      "foomatic-rip filter",
       "foomatic-filters package"

    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Insecure temporary file creation",
      "Symlink attack vector",
        "Arbitrary file overwrite"

    "impact": "Local attacker can overwrite arbitrary files with the privileges of the user running the foomatic-rip universal print filter.",
    "attack_vector": "Local",
     "required_capabilities": [
      "Local access",
      "Debug mode enabled"
      ],
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability exists in both the perl and C variants of the foomatic-rip filter. The insecure temporary file creation occurs when the debug mode is enabled. The vulnerability is triggered when PostScript data is rendered during the debug process. The vulnerability is not present in normal operational mode. Temporary files are created under `/tmp`."
