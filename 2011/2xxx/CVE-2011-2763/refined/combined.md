##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

## LifeSize Room appliance authentication bypass and arbitrary code injection vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#213486

Original Release Date: 2011-08-29 | Last Revised: 2011-10-19

---

### Overview

LifeSize Room appliance contains an authentication bypass and arbitrary code injection vulnerability when failing to sanitize input from unauthenticated clients.

### Description

| According to LifeSize's [website](http://www.lifesize.com/Products/Video/LifeSize_Room_Series/Room.aspx) *"LifeSize Room* *combines an immersive, high definition video experience with a rich set of features to deliver a powerful, flexible, and easy-to-use video communication solution."*  The LifeSize Room appliance contains an embedded web interface that allows administrative access to the appliance. This web interface fails to sanitize input from unauthenticated clients leading to an authentication bypass and possibly arbitrary code injection. Using a proxy tool to intercept traffic between the attacker and the LifeSize Room appliance web interface, an unauthenticated attacker makes a request to the gateway.php web page that references the LSRoom\_Remoting.authenticate function. The attacker can modify the Action Message Format (AMF) data in the response from the server, changing the value from "false" to "true" allowing the attacker to bypass the appliance web interface authentication. An additional vulnerability exists when an unauthenticated attacker makes a request to the gateway.php web page that references the LSRoom\_Remoting.doCommand function. Using a proxy tool to intercept traffic between the attacker and the LifeSize Room appliance system web interface, the attacker can modify the AMF data in the original parameter "pref -l /var/system/upgrade/status" in the vulnerable LSRoom\_Remoting.doCommand function to be an arbitrary command that will run with the permission of the webserver.According to the vulnerability reporter LifeSize Room LS\_RM1\_3.5.3 (11) and 4.7.18 is vulnerable, and possibly other versions. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker can bypass the authentication of the administrative web interface and possibly inject arbitrary code in the administrative system web interface. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Update**Logitech has stated that this vulnerability has been addressed in the latest firmware. Depending on the affected LifeSize Room appliance model the fixed versions are: 4.7.19, 4.8.1, and 4.8.6. |
| --- |

| **Restrict network access**Restrict network access to the LifeSize Room appliance administrative interface and other devices using open protocols like HTTP (tcp/80) or HTTPS (tcp/443). |
