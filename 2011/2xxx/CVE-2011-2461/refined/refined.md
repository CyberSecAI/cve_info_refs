Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-2461:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**
   - The provided content directly references CVE-2011-2461, describing it as a vulnerability affecting Adobe Flex SDK and explaining its exploitation. The content from blog.mindedsecurity.com, blog.nibblesec.org, troopers.de, and the github project, all focus on CVE-2011-2461. These sources provide significantly more context and details than the CVE description itself.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The root cause lies in the way Adobe Flex SDK (versions between 3.x and 4.5.1) handles runtime localizations via the *ResourceManager* component.
   - Specifically, the `resourceModuleURLs` property of the `ResourceManager`, which can be controlled by an attacker via a Flash variable, is not properly validated for security domain when the parent SWF file loads a child module.
   - The child module's *SecurityDomain* is set to *SecurityDomain.currentDomain*, which allows a malicious SWF to perform same-origin requests as the vulnerable SWF.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Improper Security Domain Validation:** The core issue is that the Flex SDK does not validate the origin of loaded resource modules, which could be from an external malicious source.
   - **Same Origin Policy (SOP) Bypass:** The lack of security domain validation leads to an "indirect" SOP bypass. Since the loaded SWF inherits the security domain, an attacker can use it to perform same-origin requests.
   - **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Potential:** Attackers can use the vulnerability to trigger requests from the victim's domain, enabling them to potentially steal sensitive data or perform unauthorized actions.
   - **Potential Flash XSS (in older versions of Flash Player):**  Older Flash player versions might be susceptible to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via this method.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Same-Origin Request Forgery (SORF):** Attackers can make arbitrary requests to the vulnerable site.
   - **Data Hijacking:**  The responses to these requests can be returned back to the attacker's malicious SWF. This can expose private information, including anti-CSRF tokens, session cookies, and other user data.
   - **Cross-Site Content Hijacking:** Attackers can hijack the content of other websites via the exploited vulnerability.
   - **Loss of Confidentiality and Integrity:** The attacker can gain access to sensitive user information, and potentially modify the actions of the vulnerable application.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - The attack vector involves tricking a user into visiting a malicious HTML page containing a vulnerable SWF file and a Flash variable named `resourceModuleURLs`.
    -   The attacker sets `resourceModuleURLs` to the location of a malicious SWF file they control.
   - When the vulnerable SWF loads, it loads the attacker's SWF which, due to the security context issue, has permission to make same-origin requests.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - **Ability to Host Malicious SWF:** The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious SWF file.
   - **Ability to Create Malicious Webpage:** The attacker needs to create an HTML page that embeds the vulnerable SWF file and sets the `resourceModuleURLs` parameter to their malicious SWF.
   - **Social Engineering:** The attacker must induce the victim to visit the malicious HTML page.
   - **No direct access to the server:** The attacker doesn't need to be present or have access on the same server as the vulnerable application.

**Additional Details:**
   - The vulnerability is exploitable even with the latest web browsers and Flash plugins if the SWF was compiled with a vulnerable Flex SDK.
   - The fix does not come from an update to the Flash Player plugin, but requires vulnerable SWF applications to be recompiled or patched.
   -  A tool called 'ParrotNG' was developed to help identify vulnerable SWF files, and it is available on github.
   - The blog from mindedsecurity.com states they found a 'considerable portion' of high-profile websites still host vulnerable Flex applications.
   - Adobe released a patch tool in 2011 to fix this vulnerability.

**Summary:**
   CVE-2011-2461 is a vulnerability arising from improper security domain validation in the Adobe Flex SDK when loading resources via the *ResourceManager*. It enables attackers to bypass the same-origin policy, conduct CSRF and SORF attacks, and hijack private data. This vulnerability remains relevant because simply updating Flash Player does not resolve the problem; SWF files must be recompiled using a patched SDK or patched directly. The attacker requires no access to the vulnerable application's server, just the ability to host a malicious website and convince users to visit it.
