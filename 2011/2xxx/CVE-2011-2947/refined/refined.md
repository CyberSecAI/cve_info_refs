Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2011-2947:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from RealPlayer's behavior of allowing local HTML files to run with scripting enabled without providing any warning to the user.
*   The RealPlayer ActiveX control can be scripted from a web browser to load these local HTML files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Zone Scripting:**  The primary issue is the ability to execute scripts from local HTML files within the context of the RealPlayer ActiveX control. This essentially bypasses browser security zones and allows local content to interact with the browser context.
*   **Unrestricted Local HTML Execution:** RealPlayer does not appropriately restrict or warn users about the risks associated with executing local HTML with scripts enabled.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system with the privileges of the current user. This means the attacker can potentially install malware, modify files, steal data, or perform any action that the user could.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Web Pages:** An attacker could host a malicious web page that uses JavaScript to script the RealPlayer ActiveX control, forcing it to load a local malicious HTML file.
*   **Malicious Files:** An attacker could send a user a malicious HTML file via email or other means. When opened through RealPlayer, this HTML can trigger arbitrary code execution.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Create a Malicious Web Page or File:** The attacker must be able to create a web page or an HTML file containing the exploit code.
*   **User Interaction:** The victim needs to interact with the attack vector, either by visiting a malicious website or by opening a crafted malicious HTML file using RealPlayer.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

*   Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected via filter ID '10589'.
