Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2011-2472:

**1. Verification:**

*   The content from `ubuntu.com` and `debian.org` directly mention CVE-2011-2472 in relation to the `oprofile` package.
* The `bugs.debian.org` entry, while primarily focused on CVE-2011-1760, also refers to the issue that led to CVE-2011-2472.
*   The Red Hat bugzilla entry, while associated with CVE-2011-1760 primarily, mentions a related patch that is part of the fix for CVE-2011-2472.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a directory traversal vulnerability in how the `oprofile`'s `opcontrol` utility handles the `--save` argument. The utility does not properly validate the path provided, allowing the user to specify an arbitrary path outside the intended session directory.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Directory Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of sanitization in the `--save` argument, which allows an attacker to traverse directories using `../` sequences and potentially target any location on the filesystem, relative to the current directory

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** A successful exploit allows a local attacker to overwrite any file on the system (with the privileges of the user running `opcontrol`), not just files within the intended `oprofile` session directory.
*   **Privilege Escalation (Indirect):** While not direct privilege escalation, an attacker can overwrite critical system files, potentially leading to privilege escalation by modifying files used by root or other system users.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** The attack requires local access to the system.
*   **`opcontrol` with Sudo:** The vulnerability is most easily exploitable if a user has sudo access to the `opcontrol` utility, as then the overwritten file will be created with root user privileges.
*   **`--save` Option:** The attack vector is the `--save` command-line option of the `opcontrol` utility, when used in conjunction with a crafted path.
*   **Crafted Path**: The crafted path uses "../" sequences to escape the intended session directory and target other files.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** The attacker needs to be a local user on the target system.
*   **`opcontrol` Access:** The attacker requires the ability to execute the `opcontrol` command.
*   **Sudo/Elevated privileges** The attacker will achieve a higher impact if the `opcontrol` command can be executed through sudo or other means of elevated privileges.

**Technical details and descriptions:**

*   The `bugs.debian.org` content details a scenario where a "samples" directory is created, a "current" file containing commands is placed within this directory, the oprofile session directory is set to this samples directory, and then the `opcontrol --save=../../../etc/XXX` command is used to overwrite a file on the system with the contents of "current".
*   The `ubuntu.com` notice states the directory traversal vulnerability when processing the `--save` argument to opcontrol. A local user could exploit this to overwrite arbitrary files with the privileges of the user invoking the program.
*   The provided patches in the `openwall.com` content include the `0002-Ensure-that-save-only-saves-things-in-SESSION_DIR.patch` which enforces that only saves things in SESSION_DIR, indicating that this patch should prevent directory traversals via the `--save` option.

The content provides more detail than the standard CVE description, specifying the exact vulnerable argument and providing an example exploit scenario.
