    "text": "The provided document is a bug report from Mozilla's Bugzilla for Bug 648160, which is related to CVE-2011-2363.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability exists in the code responsible for parsing SVG polygon objects. Specifically, `nsSVGPointList::AppendElement()` doesn't account for user-defined getter methods modifying or destroying the parent object during a repaint. This leads to a dangling pointer.  The `AppendElement` method adds a new `nsIDOMSVGPoint` element from the user without checking if it's a trusted or native object. Later, the object's getters are called at least twice and the second call, during a repaint event, can lead to a crash.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Use-after-free due to a dangling pointer vulnerability within the SVG parsing code.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   Remote code execution vulnerability allows arbitrary code to be executed within the context of the browser.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   The attack vector is a malicious SVG file or a web page with malicious SVG content.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   The attacker needs to be able to trick a user into opening a malicious SVG file or visiting a web page containing malicious SVG content.",
