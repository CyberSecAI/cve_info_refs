Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2011-2505:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Improper handling of the `$_SESSION` superglobal array in the Swekey authentication code of phpMyAdmin. The vulnerability stems from the use of `parse_str($_SERVER['QUERY_STRING'])` without a second argument, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary variables into the `$_SESSION` array through the URL query string.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Arbitrary Session Variable Manipulation:**  The code allows an attacker to create or overwrite any session variable with arbitrary values provided via the query string.
- **Missing Input Sanitization:** The lack of sanitization in handling `$_SERVER['QUERY_STRING']` when used with `parse_str()` is a primary weakness.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Control over Session Data:** An attacker gains full control over the contents of the `$_SESSION` array. This can lead to various attack vectors because other parts of the application rely on this data.
- **Prerequisite to Other Vulnerabilities**: The ability to manipulate the $_SESSION array is a core vulnerability that other exploits build on. For example, this is used to inject code for Remote Code Execution (CVE-2011-2506, CVE-2011-2507) and Local File Inclusion (CVE-2011-2508).

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Query String:** The primary attack vector is through a crafted URL query string to inject malicious data into the `$_SESSION` array.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Network Access:** The attacker only needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable phpMyAdmin instance.
-   **No Prior Authentication:** This vulnerability can be exploited without prior authentication, as it occurs before the authentication process.

**Additional Details:**
-   **Session Persistence:** The vulnerability persists because `session_write_close()` is called *before* `session_id()` changes the session, allowing the manipulated session data to be saved.
-   **Browser Testing Difficulties:** The exploitation process cannot be performed reliably using a browser alone because it involves modifying the existing session and then switching to a new one. Attackers typically have to write scripts to maintain cookies and handle requests correctly.
-   **Multiple Exploits:** This vulnerability has been used as a basis for other, more serious vulnerabilities such as remote code execution (RCE) and local file inclusion (LFI)

**Summary:**

CVE-2011-2505 describes a critical vulnerability in phpMyAdmin that allows for session manipulation by injecting arbitrary data through the URL query string. The lack of sanitization of user input and the subsequent use of `parse_str()` is the core issue.  The ability to manipulate the session leads to a variety of attack vectors, including code execution and file inclusion, making it an extremely serious vulnerability. This vulnerability also serves as the primary prerequisite for a series of other vulnerabilities found in the application.
