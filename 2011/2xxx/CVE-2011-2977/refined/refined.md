Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-2977:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a regression in Bugzilla 3.6 where temporary files created during the upload of attachments are not deleted on Windows systems. This issue was previously fixed in Bugzilla 2.20.5, but reappeared in the 3.6 release. The root cause of the regression is related to changes introduced in bug 556429, which modified how file handles were managed. Although bug 556429 was not directly responsible for the vulnerability itself, it exposed the underlying issue. The core problem is that the file handle for the temporary file was not being explicitly closed, preventing the file from being deleted by the system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Failure to properly manage temporary files after attachment uploads on Windows systems.
- Specifically, the failure to explicitly close the file handle on the temporary file.
- This leads to a vulnerability where temporary files remain on the server's file system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** A user with local access to the server's file system can access temporary files in the Temp\ directory. This is particularly concerning when attachments contain sensitive data, such as in security-related or private bug reports.
- **Potential Data Exposure:** Sensitive data within attachments might be accessible to unauthorized local users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The primary attack vector is local access to the Windows server file system. An attacker needs local filesystem access to the server hosting Bugzilla.
- **File System Navigation:** Once a user has local access, they can navigate to the temporary directory and access the files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access to the Server:** An attacker must have the ability to access the Windows server file system where Bugzilla is hosted.
- **Basic File System Knowledge:** The attacker needs to know where to look for the temporary files.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Bugzilla versions 3.6 and 3.7.1 and later. Versions 3.5.3 and older are not affected.
- Patches were created to address the vulnerability by explicitly closing the file handle in the `Bugzilla/Attachment.pm` module for versions 3.6, 4.0 and 4.2.
- The fix involves ensuring that file handles to temporary files are closed, which ensures the files are purged by the OS.

**Summary:**

The vulnerability lies in the failure to properly delete temporary files created during attachment uploads in Bugzilla on Windows. This is a regression caused by improper file handle management, allowing local users with server file system access to potentially view the contents of those temporary attachment files. The fix involves explicitly closing the file handle to ensure the temporary files are purged.
