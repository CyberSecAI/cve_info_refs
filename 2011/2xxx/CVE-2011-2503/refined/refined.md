    "Description": "A time-of-check time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition was found in the way systemtap runtime tool (staprun) performed module loading. A small time gap between performing module sanity checks and actual, real loading of the module into the kernel, was present.",
    "Root cause": "Time-of-check time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition in staprun module loading.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "TOCTOU race condition"
    ],
    "Impact": "Local privilege escalation. A local user, member of the 'stapusr' group could use this flaw to escalate their privileges.",
