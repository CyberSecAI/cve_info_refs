Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2011-2089:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the `GenVersion.dll` ActiveX control used by ICONICS WebHMI. This occurs because the control does not perform proper bounds checking when handling input passed to the `SetActiveXGUID` method.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stack-based Buffer Overflow:** A static buffer on the stack is overflowed by providing an overly long string to the `SetActiveXGUID` method.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The ActiveX control fails to validate the size of the input before copying it to the stack, resulting in the overflow.
- **ActiveX Control Marked Safe for Scripting:**  The vulnerable ActiveX control is marked safe for scripting which enables the vulnerability to be exploited through web browsers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By overflowing the buffer, an attacker can overwrite the return address and other stack data, leading to arbitrary code execution.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker's code will execute with the privileges of the user currently logged in. This could include local administrative privileges if the user is an administrator.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote via Web Browser:** The primary attack vector involves a user visiting a web page containing malicious JavaScript that exploits the ActiveX control.
- **Social Engineering:** Users are typically lured to visit malicious web pages through various means, such as email phishing, instant messages or links found on the internet.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to craft a malicious web page:** The attacker needs to be able to create a web page that includes the vulnerable ActiveX control and the exploit code written in JavaScript.
- **Knowledge of the vulnerable ActiveX control:** The attacker needs to know the CLSID of the vulnerable control `{CEFF5F48-BD2E-4D10-BAE5-AF729975E223}` and the method `SetActiveXGUID` to trigger the overflow.
- **Understanding of ROP (Return-Oriented Programming):** For some targets (Windows XP SP3), the attacker needs to use ROP to bypass security features and execute shellcode.
- **Web server to host the malicious page:** The attacker needs a web server that will serve the malicious page to the victim.

**Additional Information:**
- The exploit-db content contains a proof-of-concept exploit using ROP for Windows XP SP3.
- The Metasploit module provides a more automated way to exploit this vulnerability, including support for different Windows versions.
- The vulnerability was addressed in version 9.22 releases of GENESIS32, GENESIS64 and BizViz.
