{
  "CVE-2011-2689": {
    "description": "The GFS2 fallocate code chooses a target size for allocating chunks of space. When it can't find resource groups with enough free space, it halves its target. Since this target is in bytes, it may no longer be a multiple of blksize. When gfs couldn't fallocate a bigger chunk than the target, it was using the non-blksize aligned number. This caused a BUG in later code that required blksize aligned offsets.",
    "root_cause": "The GFS2 fallocate code could end up with a target size not aligned to the block size when it couldn't allocate the desired space, leading to use of non-block-aligned values in later code.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Incorrect handling of target size in fallocate leading to non-block-aligned values",
      "Use of non-block-aligned values in code requiring block-aligned offsets"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service (BUG leading to kernel panic/crash).",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "Local unprivileged user"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "Local unprivileged user able to make fallocate() requests to a nearly full GFS2 filesystem"
  }
