      "source": "Multiple Sources",
      "edit_date": "2024-07-02"
    },
    "Vulnerability Details": {
      "Root cause": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input when displaying RPM info. Specifically, the 'pattern name' is not properly sanitized before being included in an RPM info display.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Cross-site scripting (XSS)"
      ],
      "Impact": "A remote attacker could inject arbitrary web script or HTML, potentially leading to malicious actions being performed on the victim's browser, such as cookie theft or redirection to malicious sites.",
      "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exploitable over the network by crafting a malicious pattern name that is then displayed in the RPM info.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to introduce a crafted pattern name into the system, which is then displayed by the vulnerable application. No authentication is required.",
