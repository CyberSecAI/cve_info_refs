Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-2010:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the Microsoft Office IME (Chinese) improperly exposing configuration options that are not intended to run on the secure desktop.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Elevation of Privilege:** The core issue is an elevation of privilege vulnerability.
*   **Improper Access Control:** The Microsoft Office IME (Chinese) exposes configuration options that should not be accessible in the current manner. This allows for unintended interactions and privilege escalation.
*   The vulnerability exists in the way configuration options are exposed. Specifically, these options were not designed to be run on the secure desktop.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to run arbitrary code in kernel mode.
*   **Full System Control:** Attackers gain complete control over the affected system.
*   **Malicious Activities:** Attackers can then install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new accounts with full administrative privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access Required:** An attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to exploit this vulnerability. The vulnerability cannot be exploited remotely or by anonymous users.
*   **MSPY IME Toolbar:** The attacker would need to perform specific actions using the MSPY IME toolbar.
*   **Internet Explorer:** The attack involves launching Internet Explorer with system-level privileges via the MSPY IME toolbar.
*   **Program Execution with System Privileges**: The attacker could then run a program with system-level privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Account:** The attacker needs a valid local user account on the targeted machine.
*   **Interactive Login:** The attacker needs to be able to log on to the system interactively.
*   **Knowledge of Attack Vector:** The attacker needs to know how to exploit the IME toolbar to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Targeted Software:** The attacker needs to target a system with an affected version of the Microsoft Pinyin (MSPY) Input Method Editor (IME) for Simplified Chinese. This vulnerability affects only the Microsoft Pinyin IME 2010.

**Additional Details**

*   The vulnerability affects Microsoft Pinyin IME 2010, particularly on systems running Microsoft Office 2010 and Microsoft Office 2010 Service Pack 1.
*   Older versions of Microsoft Office Pinyin SimpleFast Style 2010 and Microsoft Office Pinyin New Experience Style 2010 are also affected, but Microsoft no longer provides support for them.
*   The fix for this vulnerability involves correcting how the Microsoft Office IME (Chinese) exposes configuration options.
*   The exploitability index for this vulnerability was rated as **Important**.
*   No known workarounds were identified.
