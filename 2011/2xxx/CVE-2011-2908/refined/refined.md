      "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could hijack an authenticated administrator's JMX Console session and invoke operations on mbeans.",
    "attack_vector": "The attack can be performed remotely by exploiting the lack of CSRF protection in the JMX Console.",
     "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker requires the ability to trick an authenticated administrator into visiting a malicious site or executing a malicious link. No prior knowledge of the target system other than that it uses the vulnerable JMX console is necessary.",
    "additional_details": "This vulnerability could allow an attacker to invoke operations on MBeans via the JMX console, meaning the attacker can potentially change settings, or perform other management actions on the application server. This could potentially lead to compromise of the application server or system."
