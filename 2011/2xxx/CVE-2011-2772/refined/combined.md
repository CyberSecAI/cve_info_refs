How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Potential DoS attack by running large images through GD

Bug #784978 reported by

### Bug Description

When resizing images to create icons, etc., gd's imagecreatefrompng, etc., functions are called without checking the image size. This can gobble lots of memory when the images are large, because gd can allocate memory without respecting the php memory limit.

That is a good one. It looks like it is possible to estimate how much memory will be <a href="<http://www.charles-reace.com/blog/2009/11/18/memory-usage-in-php-gd-image-functions/>">required</a> for GD functions, in which case, the decision about resize can be made based on the particular system performance (rather than keeping it fixed). Also there are some suggestions to use gc\_collect\_cycles() after GD calls to free system memory that GP keeps after use.

Thanks Richard, I have verified your patch, it works fine. Good idea to calculate bytes based on the actual bits used in the colour coding.

Check mimetype when bits per pixel not returned by gd ([bug #784978](/bugs/784978))

Sometimes when creating a thumbnail image, getimagesize doesn't return

    a value for bits per pixel on certain gifs. This creates warnings in

    the logs when approximating the required memory consumption, and also

    refuses to create the thumbnail. We can check the mimetype of the

    image when 'bits' is not set, and when it's a gif, just assume the

    maximum value (8 bpp).
