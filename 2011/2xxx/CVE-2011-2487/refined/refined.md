{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to JBoss Web Services using a weak symmetric encryption protocol, PKCS#1 v1.5, when distributing symmetric keys.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use of weak symmetric encryption protocol (PKCS#1 v1.5).",
      "Bleichenbacher chosen-ciphertext attack"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could conduct chosen-ciphertext attacks, leading to the recovery of the entire plain text of the symmetric key. This enables further attacks.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network-based attacks through crafted SOAP requests."
    ],
     "required_capabilities": "Remote attacker with knowledge of the cryptographic weakness of PKCS#1 v1.5 and able to send crafted SOAP requests"
