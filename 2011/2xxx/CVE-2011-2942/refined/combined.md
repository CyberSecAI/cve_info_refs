Message-ID: <4EA52CF0.8060009@redhat.com>
Date: Mon, 24 Oct 2011 17:16:32 +0800
From: Eugene Teo <eugene@...hat.com>

Subject: kernel; CVE-2011-2942 and CVE-2011-3209

CVE-2011-2942; In the br_forward_finish() function, we may call kfree()
on the skb we are forwarding, and so, after it, we should not
dereference skb->dev pointer. With the fix, we save skb->dev before
calling the br_forward_finish() function, so that we can use it
afterwards. It's a regression from a commit that we have backported to
our kernels. It doesn't affect the upstream kernel as the code was
rewritten.

<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/CVE-2011-2942>
<https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-2942.html>

CVE-2011-3209; divide error issue in the clock implementation.

Processing clock_gettime system call reached Divide Error Fault as described below:  1) clock_gettime system call is called with 0xfffffff2, which is clock ID of    the init process whose process ID is 1.    The clock ID is got from clock_getcpuclockid(1,&clock_id).  2) posix_cpu_clock_get() sets cpu_time_count->sched to    task_struct->sched_time of PID#1 and calls sample_to_timespec(). 3) sample_to_timespec() divides cpu_time_count->sched by NSEC_PER_SEC using    div_long_long_rem(). 4) The result of the division becomes bigger than 0xffffffff. 5) Divide Error Fault occurs.  The reason why Divide Error Fault occurs is the huge task_struct->sched_time of PDI#1. When sys_clock_gettime() was called, task_struct->sched_time of PID#1 was 0xfffffe4c5e3c58c2.  The task_struct->sched_time is increased by update_cpu_clock() while handling local timer interrupts as follows.   --- static inline void update_cpu_clock(struct task_struct *p, struct rq *rq, unsigned long long now) {         p->sched_time += now - max(p->timestamp, rq->timestamp_last_tick); } ---  The 'now' argument is got from TSC and if it is nearly zero, p->sched_time becomes very large. It can happen while system booting on which TSC is initialized to zero as follows.  ---   init() "init/main.c"   -> smp_prepare_cpus(max_cpus)      -> synchronize_tsc_bp()         -> write_tsc()            => TSC is initialized to 0 ---  So the summary of the problem is as follows:  1) TSC is initialized to zero during system booting. 2) update_cpu_clock() is called just after 1) then task_struct->sched_time of    PID#1 becomes very large. 3) sys_clock_gettime() is called for clock ID of PID#1. 4) Divide Error Fault occurs.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=732878#c2)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2011-08-24 03:04:40 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Yasuaki Ishimatsu for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=732878#c5)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2011-08-24 03:13:47 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect the Linux kernels as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 6, and Red Hat Enterprise MRG, as they either do not have the sample_to_timespec() function, or have already backported upstream commit f8bd2258, which addresses this issue.
