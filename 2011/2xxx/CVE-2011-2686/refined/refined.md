Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2011-2686:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the Ruby interpreter not properly re-initializing the random number generator (PRNG) when a new process is forked. This occurs in versions of Ruby before 1.8.7-p352. This is a regression, as the issue had previously been fixed in 1.8.6-p114, but reappeared in 1.8.6-p399

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Predictable Random Numbers:** Due to the lack of re-initialization, forked processes could potentially generate the same sequence of "random" numbers.
- **Insufficient Randomness:** The random number generator does not produce cryptographically secure random numbers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Reduced Randomness:** An attacker could more easily predict the generated random numbers, which can undermine security mechanisms that rely on randomness.
- **Information Disclosure:** This is especially concerning if the random numbers are used for security-sensitive purposes, like generating session IDs, tokens, or keys.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** A local attacker could exploit this flaw.
- **Forking Processes:** The attack requires forking a Ruby process multiple times.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs the ability to execute Ruby code on the system.
- **Knowledge of PRNG:** The attacker would need some knowledge on how the PRNG is being used.

**Additional Notes:**

- This issue was addressed in Ruby 1.8.7-p352.
- The vulnerability is related to a previous issue, CVE-2003-0900, indicating a recurring problem with random number generation in forked processes.
- The bug report mentions that a similar issue in the `securerandom.rb` module was assigned CVE-2011-2705, and a separate issue, considered a duplicate of CVE-2011-2686 was assigned CVE-2011-3009.
- Red Hat assigned RHSA-2011:1581 and RHSA-2012:0070 to address this vulnerability in their enterprise products
