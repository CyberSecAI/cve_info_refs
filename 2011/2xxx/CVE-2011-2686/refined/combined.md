# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

Looking at the above patches, there seems to be two issues here, perhaps
it needs two CVE ids to be assigned?

1. <http://svn.ruby-lang.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi?view=revision&revision=31713>

This one pertains to rand returning same values in forked processes.
<http://redmine.ruby-lang.org/issues/show/4338>
This is a regression, as it was fixed in 1.8.6-p114, but re-appeared in
1.8.6-p399.

2. <http://svn.ruby-lang.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi?view=revision&revision=32050>

This is an issue in the securerandom.rb module.
<http://redmine.ruby-lang.org/issues/4579>

Josh,

Can we please assign CVE-2011-2686 to one of the issues and have another
CVE id to the other issue?

Thanks.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=722415#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-07-15 09:51:59 UTC  ``` It was found that Ruby did not properly reinitialize the random number generator, when forking new Ruby process. A local attacker could use this flaw to easier predict random numbers.

(I'm not sure why MITRE assigned [CVE-2011-3009](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-3009) to this as it sounds like this is an exact duplicate of CVE-2011-2686; I've inquired as to what makes this different from [CVE-2011-2686](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-2686)).   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=722415#c16)  Vincent Danen    2011-09-21 15:13:52 UTC  ``` I've not heard anything back from MITRE about the difference, but I've looked at the CVE entry for [CVE-2011-2686](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-2686) and it reads:  Ruby before 1.8.7-p352 does not reset the random seed upon forking, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to predict the values of random numbers by leveraging knowledge of the number sequence obtained in a different child process, a related issue to [CVE-2003-0900](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2003-0900). NOTE: this issue exists because of a regression during Ruby 1.8.6 development.   Which has me a bit more confused.  By the sounds of the description, [CVE-2011-2686](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-2686) was fixed in 1.8.6, but regressed which caused the flaw in 1.8.7 (I have no idea if this is the case).  I suspect we should use [CVE-2011-2686](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-2686) to describe any fixes in 1.8.6 and [CVE-2011-3009](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-3009) to describe any fixes in 1.8.7.   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=722415#c17)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-12-06 12:08:04 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2011:1581 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-1581.html>   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=722415#c22)  Vít Ondruch    2012-01-13 15:21:32 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 555084](attachment.cgi?id=555084&action=diff "RHEL-5.8 patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=555084&action=edit "RHEL-5.8 patch") RHEL-5.8 patch   ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=722415#c23)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-01-30 18:33:34 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2012:0070 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0070.html>   ``` |  |
