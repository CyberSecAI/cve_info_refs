How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## [Version 2.1.9 Released](/blog/index.php?/archives/4-Version-2.1.9-Released.html)

Posted by [Administrator](https://www.visiwave.com/blog/index.php?/authors/1-Administrator) on Friday, May 20. 2011

A new release of VisiWave Site Survey is now available.

Those that hold a license to versions before 2.1 can upgrade to version 2.1 for a small fee. See the bottom of the Purchase page on our website for details. To try out the new version, download the eval version and install it over-top of your current version. You can then either purchase upgrade codes or re-install your previous version.

New features in v2.1.9:

* Out-of-Date GPS Locations

  In cases where the quality of the GPS signal was

  steadily decreasing, VisiWave might use a very out-of-

  date GPS position.

  (Fixed in v2.1.9)

  * Support for Intel 5300 Internal Wireless Adapter

    The Intel 5300 wireless adapter--and possibly some other

    adapters--can take up to 6.5 seconds to complete a scan.

    VisiWave now allows for these much longer scans to

    complete under Windows Vista and 7. It is not

    recommended to use this adapter under Windows XP.

    (Fixed in v2.1.9)

    * Report File Vulnerability

      Survey report files (.VWR) could be crafted in a way that

      could crash VisiWave Report and open the possibility of

      arbitrary code execution. Thanks go to StratSec

      (http://www.stratsec.net/) for pointing out this issue.

      (Fixed in v2.1.9)

      * Support for Version 3.0 Survey Files

        This version allows you to read in survey files edited

        under version 3.0 of VisiWave.

        (Added in v2.1.9)

			'Description'    => %q{
				This module exploits a vulnerability found in VisiWave's Site Survey Report application.
				When processing .VWR files, VisiWaveReport.exe attempts to match a valid pointer based on the 'Type'
				property (valid ones include 'Properties', 'TitlePage', 'Details', 'Graph', 'Table', 'Text',
				'Image'), but if a match isn't found, the function that's supposed to handle this routine
				ends up returning the input as a pointer, and later used in a CALL DWORD PTR [EDX+10]
				instruction.  This allows attackers to overwrite it with any arbitrary value, and results code
				execution.  A patch is available at visiwave.com; the fix is done by XORing the return value as
				null if no match is found, and then it is validated before use.

				NOTE: During installation, the application will register two file handle's, VWS and VWR and allows a
				victim user to 'double click' the malicious VWR file and execute code.  This module was also built
				to bypass ASLR and DEP.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
