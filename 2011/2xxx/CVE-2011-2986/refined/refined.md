Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-2986:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Firefox handles cross-origin image data when using Windows D2D (Direct2D) hardware acceleration with canvas elements.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-origin data theft:** When using Windows D2D hardware acceleration, image data from one domain could be inserted into a canvas and read by a different domain.
- **Improper synchronization and snapshotting**: The core issue lies in how D2D surfaces are flushed and how draw operations are queued and executed. Specifically, changes to the source canvas (A) are not being properly reflected in the destination canvas (B), causing it to display the updated content from A when it should show a snapshot of the original state of A.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information leakage:** Attackers can potentially bypass same-origin policies, allowing them to extract data from a canvas element belonging to a different domain. This could expose sensitive information if it were present in the canvas.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious website: An attacker could host a web page that leverages this vulnerability to extract data from canvas elements on other websites the user might be visiting.
- The attacker would need to be able to insert content into a canvas element and also have control of a separate canvas on which to read the potentially leaked data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to serve JavaScript code to the victim's browser.
- The attacker must have control over a malicious webpage and also needs the victim to visit this webpage while having a vulnerable version of Firefox.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was specific to Windows platforms when using D2D hardware acceleration.
- The vulnerability was triggered when drawing the content of one canvas to another canvas.
- The exploit does not require any user interaction.
- The fix involved flushing dependent surfaces when a surface that was used as a source changes. It also involved using the Snapshot API when drawing one Azure surface to another.

The provided data also includes bug reports, mailing list discussions, and security advisories that helped identify and fix this vulnerability. The patch was reviewed by multiple Mozilla developers.
