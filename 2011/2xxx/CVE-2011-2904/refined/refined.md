Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2011-2904:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `acknow.php` page of Zabbix, where the "backurl" parameter is not properly sanitized before being returned to the user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Improper sanitization of the `backurl` parameter allows an attacker to inject arbitrary web script or HTML.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can perform a reflected XSS attack by manipulating the `backurl` parameter. This could lead to:
  - Execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the victim's browser
  - Potential session hijacking
  - Defacement of the webpage
  - Phishing attacks

**Attack Vectors:**
- A remote attacker can inject malicious script via the `backurl` parameter in a crafted URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with a malicious `backurl` parameter and trick a user into visiting this crafted URL. The attacker is remote and does not need any specific privileges on the server.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Zabbix versions prior to 1.8.6
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.8.6
- The `$_REQUEST['backurl']` parameter, after being URL decoded, is directly used in a redirect `jsRedirect($url->getUrl());` without proper sanitization, allowing for injection of HTML or javascript.
- A Proof of Concept (PoC) involves replacing the `backurl` parameter with `<script>alert('XSS');</script>`.
