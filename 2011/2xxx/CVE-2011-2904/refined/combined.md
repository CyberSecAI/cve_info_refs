| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=729162#c0)  Vincent Danen    2011-08-08 21:35:13 UTC  ``` A vulnerability was reported [1],[2] in Zabbix where input passed to the "backurl" parameter in acknow.php is improperly sanitized before being returned to the user.  This could be used to facilitate a cross-site scripting attack.  This flaw is fixed in Zabbix 1.8.6 [3].  [1] <http://secunia.com/advisories/45502> [2] <https://support.zabbix.com/browse/ZBX-3835> [3] <http://www.zabbix.com/rn1.8.6.php>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=729162#c1)  Vincent Danen    2011-08-08 21:36:49 UTC  ``` Created zabbix tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 729164](show_bug.cgi?id=729164 "CLOSED ERRATA - zabbix: improper input sanitization leads to XSS [fedora-all]")] Affects: epel-all [[bug 729165](show_bug.cgi?id=729165 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - zabbix: improper input sanitization leads to XSS [epel-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=729162#c2)  Vincent Danen    2011-08-10 17:54:12 UTC  ``` This issue was assigned the name [CVE-2011-2904](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-2904).   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=729162#c3)  Vincent Danen    2011-08-19 21:45:03 UTC  ``` There were more issues corrected in zabbix 1.8.6, noted below:   Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures assigned an identifier [CVE-2011-2904](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-2904) to the following vulnerability:  Name: [CVE-2011-2904](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-2904) URL: <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-2904> Assigned: 20110727 Reference: <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/08/08/2> Reference: <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/08/09/5> Reference: <http://www.zabbix.com/rn1.8.6.php> Reference: [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=729162](show_bug.cgi?id=729162 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2011-2904 CVE-2011-3263 CVE-2011-3264 zabbix: multiple flaws in zabbix < 1.8.6") Reference: <https://support.zabbix.com/browse/ZBX-3835> Reference: <http://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/package-announce/2011-August/063904.html> Reference: <http://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/package-announce/2011-August/063884.html> Reference: <http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/49016> Reference: <http://secunia.com/advisories/45502> Reference: <http://secunia.com/advisories/45677> Reference: <http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/69025>  Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in acknow.php in Zabbix before 1.8.6 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the backurl parameter.   Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures assigned an identifier [CVE-2011-3263](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-3263) to the following vulnerability:  Name: [CVE-2011-3263](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-3263) URL: <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-3263> Assigned: 20110819 Reference: <http://www.zabbix.com/rn1.8.6.php> Reference: <https://support.zabbix.com/browse/ZBX-3794>  zabbix_agentd in Zabbix before 1.8.6 and 1.9.x before 1.9.4 allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) by executing the vfs.file.cksum command for a special device, as demonstrated by the /dev/urandom device.   Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures assigned an identifier [CVE-2011-3264](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-3264) to the following vulnerability:  Name: [CVE-2011-3264](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-3264) URL: <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-3264> Assigned: 20110819 Reference: <http://www.zabbix.com/rn1.8.6.php> Reference: <https://support.zabbix.com/browse/ZBX-3840>  Zabbix before 1.8.6 allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via an invalid srcfld2 parameter to popup.php, which reveals the installation path in an error message.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=729162#c4)  Vincent Danen    2011-08-19 21:45:58 UTC  ``` Looks like we're ok on the Fedora side (1.8.6 in F14/F15, in testing for F16), and EPEL6 has 1.8.6 in testing as well.  I'm unsure whether or not all of these flaws affect EPEL4/5 though; it's at 1.4.6/1.4.7.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=729162#c5)  Volker Fröhlich    2013-01-22 15:58:01 UTC  ``` Only EPEL 5 should be left:  <https://support.zabbix.com/browse/ZBX-3840?focusedCommentId=74131#comment-74131>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=729162#c6)  Volker Fröhlich    2014-01-06 19:33:48 UTC  ``` zabbix 1.4.7 was retired and blocked in EPEL 5, as there is no upstream support for this version. This was the only remaining version potentially or actually prone to this issue, thus closing.  Users are encouraged to update to zabbix20 or later.   ``` |  |

### Description

The acknow.php page is vulnerable to reflected XSS attacks. The following section of code doesn't sanitize data properly:

if(isset($\_REQUEST['saveandreturn']))

{
$url = new CUrl(urldecode($\_REQUEST['backurl']));
jsRedirect($url->getUrl());
exit();
}

The $\_REQUEST['backurl'] parameter can be manipulated to perform the XSS attack. Using a proxy capture the parameters request and replace the backurl parameter with the following: </script><script>alert('XSS');</script> (see attachment for PoC).

Fix: Sanitze the backurl request parameter and don't assume the user is going to leave the <url>.php in place ![](/images/icons/emoticons/wink.png)

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
