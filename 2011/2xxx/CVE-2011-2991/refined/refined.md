    "related": true,
    "information": [
      {
        "vulnerability": "JavaScript crash in Firefox 4 and 5",
        "root_cause": "A bug in the JavaScript JIT compiler related to long prototype chains, causing a crash when accessing properties of objects with deep inheritance hierarchies.",
       "weaknesses": [
          "Memory corruption due to integer overflow when calculating offset during JIT compilation.",
           "Improper handling of long prototype chains in JavaScript JIT compiler."
        ],

        "attack_vectors": [
           "Accessing a property of an object with an extremely long prototype chain via crafted JavaScript code.",
          "Triggering the vulnerability through malicious web content."
        ],
        "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs to be able to serve a web page with malicious JavaScript.",
        "additional_details": "The vulnerability occurs in the `js::mjit::JaegerShot` function of the JavaScript engine, which is related to method JIT. The root cause was an offset stored as the distance between two points in memory. When there are a lot of prototype checks, the offset would overflow and patch memory with garbage values, leading to crashes. The fix increased the size of a data structure by 0-4 bytes."
