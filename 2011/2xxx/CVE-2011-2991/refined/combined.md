How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

If you visit the first crash report
There lots of people have commented that they were on yahoo mail and Firefox crashed!
Not sure what you meant by 'attack vector' please elaborate.

Works for me on Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:6.0a1) Gecko/20110508 Firefox/6.0a1
Also, could you see if the issue occurs if using Firefox in safe mode:

How about with a new, empty testing profile? (Don't install any addons into it)

My guess and reading between the lines: Since Ludovic removed the group core-security when he wrote that comment that means that the bug previously had been marked as a security hole. Only a very limited number of people can view such bugs, but Ludovic states that he can't see how this crash could ever be used to take control over the browser and removed the restriction.

Regarding the crash reports, indeed, the comments tab of <https://crash-stats.mozilla.com/report/index/bp-fcaf835d-74d6-4bf8-b743-ebc2b2110506> shows a lot of Yahoo mail related comments.

I disagree. Obviously you wouldn't attack someone by sending them to Yahoo and hope for a crash, but if Yahoo code crashes reasonably reliably then the crashing script could be isolated and reduced to a potential attack case.
The real question is whether this signature looks exploitable since the question about whether it can be caused by remote web content has been answered. Crashing in JITted code is scary in general. It might be a "safe" crash, might even be likely to be safe, but given the type of crash we need to put the burden of proof on the JS developers to prove it's safe rather than assume it is.
We need to be able to reproduce this to be able to fix it though. A reduced testcase we can attach to the bug would be great (but I'm not holding my breath).
Vevekanand: you marked this as a "regression" which I assume means it didn't happen to you in earlier versions. Which earlier version? 4.0 I hope because there were far fewer changes between 4.0 and 4.0.1 to investigate than there were between 3.6.x and 4.0.1Group: core-securityStatus: UNCONFIRMED → NEWEver confirmed: trueKeywords: [testcase-wanted](/buglist.cgi?keywords=testcase-wanted&resolution=---)

fwiw I don't remember ever having crashed on Yahoo Mail Beta on my Mac, but I think I've been using Fx5/6 nightlies since I switched to the Yahoo Beta. Will play around with my 4.0.x test profile and see if I can reproduce.
Looking at crash-stats this appears to be a huge spike in 4.0.1 and very little seen in more recent versions (then again, very few users on development builds). Yahoo mail beta mentioned A LOT in the comments, deleting mail mentioned several times.

I have tried a number of different scenarios around deleting mail in the Yahoo beta on both 10.5. and 10.6 using 4.0.1 and I have yet to reproduce the crash.

I am also having trouble reproducing. Could you list any installed extensions? Along the same lines, do you still get the crash when you disable all extensions/plugins?

Oops, these are right there in the crash report! I tried installing ABP and Firebug (enabling Script debugging), and still no crashes on 10.6. I wasn't able to find the extension labeled delicious@vjkarunapg.com.

Yes. I havent seen this happening before. But I am not sure if its happening after updating to 4.0.1 thus I marked it as regression.

I have disabled all the addons and the issue is still reproducible.

Here is my further investigation
1. If you delete fewer messages then it doesnt crash.
2. To make it crash you need to keep on pressing delete button and vary the speed of pressing the delete button as well.
I have disabled all the addons and was still able to crash Firefox. Here is the crash report
<https://crash-stats.mozilla.com/report/index/bp-1d562352-f62e-4c40-a849-620ce2110509>
I have created new profile and was still able to crash Firefox. Here is the crash report.
<https://crash-stats.mozilla.com/report/index/f4f24e02-6ef9-4a13-bbfb-3a8f32110509>
Then I started the Firefox in Safe mode and on first start it automatically crashed. Here is the crash report.
<https://crash-stats.mozilla.com/report/index/9be26227-deb0-4fbb-96db-6b6cb2110509>
But after restarting in safe mode again I wasnt able to reproduce the issue and even after deleting around 100-150 emails Firefox didnt crash.
BTW. I work for Yahoo! Mail and it is difficult to track whats breaking Firefox since I dont get any error message or warning or anything of that sort.
I tried tracking this with Dynatrace on Window but this issue doesnt exist on windows which made it even difficult to trace.
Even if you guys could possibly find any problem with Yahoo! Mail JS I will be glad to fix but I need to know whats causing this.

Vivekanand, I'm trying to understand exactly how to get a crash.
Do you use the mouse and click the Delete button on the screen or do you delete the messages by using the keyboard?
When you are in the Inbox deleting messages, do you delete messages from the list without reading them, or do you open them first so they are readable when deleting them?
When you try to delete a message and get a crash, does the message really get deleted, or is it still in the Inbox when you visit Yahoo next time?

I use keyboard.

I dont let them render. Delete them before rendering. Sometimes they are in the middle of rendering. Sometimes they are in the middle of loading.

Since I delete around 30-40 messages can not figure out one message out of it. The crash happens instantly when I am in the process of pressing the delete button.

[Bug 657523](/show_bug.cgi?id=657523 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - Firefox 4 & 5 crash with new Yahoo! Mail Beta (but 3.6.x doesn't)"), which was marked as a dupe, indicates you need 30-50 emails opened in tabs in order to see this behavior. That may be why I wasn't able to repro in the first pass.

Crashes [@ js::mjit::JaegerShot] are overwhelmingly Mac OS X, with a smattering of Linux; zero Windows crashes with that signature. If [bug 655660](/show_bug.cgi?id=655660 "RESOLVED FIXED - Firefox 4 crashing when I try to delete emails using Yahoo! Mail Beta [@ js::mjit::JaegerShot ]") is a duplicate (sure sounds like it) then it must have a different signature. I did find a bunch with essentially the same signature: [@ js::mjit::JaegerShot(JSContext\*)] but no comments mentioning Yahoo mail -- very unlike the Mac crashes with dozens of people saying they were on yahoo mail beta.
We need crash ID's on Windows from mily to see if [bug 655660](/show_bug.cgi?id=655660 "RESOLVED FIXED - Firefox 4 crashing when I try to delete emails using Yahoo! Mail Beta [@ js::mjit::JaegerShot ]") is really related, but in the meanwhile it looks like our best chance for reproducing this will be on Mac. This stack has 650+ crashes on Mac in a week with small marketshare, vs. only 120 in a week for the variant on Windows with 90% of the market.

We don't have enough information to do anything right now--we were unable to reproduce the crash for local debugging.
We might able to move forward if you could send us a core dump. Note that a core dump contains the contents of all the memory from your browser, which could include sensitive data. See
<https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Remote_debugging#Core_dumps_on_Mac_and_Linux>
for instructions. Let me know if you have questions.

Looks like we have steps to reproduce from [bug 658757](/show_bug.cgi?id=658757 "RESOLVED INVALID - Firefox hang with old nVidia drivers on Kubuntu (Yahoo mail, westernunion)")#c5 where it has been reproduced on Win 7 and Linux (although not indicated in the bug). It might actually be the same bug.

I just tried to reproduce this in the lab on Windows 7, following the STR in the bug in [Comment 31](/show_bug.cgi?id=655660#c31 "RESOLVED FIXED - Firefox 4 crashing when I try to delete emails using Yahoo! Mail Beta [@ js::mjit::JaegerShot ]"). But others have noted that it cannot consistently be reproduced.

If those STR work for some people, some of the time, maybe it always crashes on a certain line of code or a certain operation. Even if we can't reproduce it ourselves (I wasn't able to on Mac just now--I'll try on Windows when I get a chance), if we could gather stats on the crash JS source location, maybe we could find the bug by inspection or add some instrumentation to do further diagnostics. I don't think it's very easy to catch the JS location without a bunch of breakpad heavy lifting, though.

Well, we have no STR (the ones in the other bug worked for neither Marcia nor me), so no ETA for now.
I tried to open one of the minidumps in the other bug (which was for 32-bit Linux), but it didn't have the jitcode memory, so there's nothing to learn there. (Maybe only on Windows do we get the memory around eip?)
We might be able to make some progress if someone could give us a full core dump.

I tried creating a core dump but its not happening. I follow the steps mentioned in the link above but no use.
I have used ulimit -c unlimited and started firefox from console. When it crashes nothing happens and no core dump is created inside /cores folder.
All I get is Firefox crash reporter.
When I start firefox from console I get a message saying 'FBTrace is not installed...'

I have tried again to reproduce this on Mac and Windows 7 but with no luck. I realize there is an important extra step in [Bug 658757 Comment 5](/show_bug.cgi?id=658757#c5 "RESOLVED INVALID - Firefox hang with old nVidia drivers on Kubuntu (Yahoo mail, westernunion)") which involves changing the preview view. But even with that and deleting the emails rapidly I was not able to reproduce.

Hmmm. Maybe you need to disable the crash reporter from that run. You can do that by using the command line:
MOZ\_CRASHREPORTER\_DISABLE=1 normal\_cmdline\_to\_run\_fx
If that works, let me know so I can update the instructions (but certainly feel free to do that yourself if you like.)
> When I start firefox from console I get a message saying 'FBTrace is not
> installed...'
That seems to be a message from Firebug or a Firebug-related plugin. I don't think it's related to not getting a core dump. But now I do wonder if FB is somehow related to the crash.

Is it appropriate to nominate this for aurora? If it fixes a topcrash, it seems like it may be good to take. (Is it low risk? It's not clear to me from looking at the patch \*why\* it fixes a crash, so it's hard for me to evaluate.)

yup, this is really the bug
Requesting approval for aurora.
Benefit: Potentially fixes a large class of method JIT crash bugs, including at least one reproducible Yahoo mail crash bug.
Risk: Increases the size of a data structure by 0-4 bytes. Total browser increase would be measured in KB.

You have to generate code with like |x.y = z| where |y| is not on |x| and |x| has an extremely long prototype chain - probably like 50 objects. Long protos might reveal some interesting stuff. The bug here was that the offset stored a distance between two points in memory, and with enough prototype checks it overflowed ~10 bits and patched garbage.
Anyway, sorry, I think I missed the aurora checkin for this so now it's already there after taking m-c.

We missed the mozilla6 aurora window but the patch looks safe enough for the beta branch and it's still a pretty common crash. Should we take it there?

yup, this is really the bug
We missed the mozilla6 aurora window but the patch looks safe enough for the beta branch. It's still a pretty common crash and the intent of clegnitto's aurora approval was to get it into Firefox 6, not just on some aurora branch sometime. Can we get beta approval?

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2011-31

## Security issues addressed in Thunderbird 6

Announced
August 16, 2011
Impact
Critical
Products
Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Thunderbird 6

Many of the issues listed below are not exploitable through mail
since JavaScript is disabled by default in Thunderbird. These particular issues
may be triggered while viewing RSS feeds and displaying full remote content
rather than the feed summary. Addons that expose browser functionality may also
enable such issues to be exploited.

### Miscellaneous memory safety hazards (rv:4.0)

Impact: Critical

Description: Mozilla identified and fixed several
memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in Thunderbird 5 and other
Mozilla-based products. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption
under certain circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at least
some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

affected Thunderbird 5.

Impact: Critical

Description: **Michael Jordon** of
Context IS reported that an overly long shader program could cause a buffer
overrun and crash in a string class used to store the shader source code.

Description: Security
researcher **regenrecht** reported via TippingPoint's Zero Day
Initiative that a SVG text manipulation routine contained a dangling pointer
vulnerability.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2011-33

## Security issues addressed in SeaMonkey 2.3

Announced
August 16, 2011
Impact
Critical
Products
SeaMonkey
Fixed in

* SeaMonkey 2.3

### Miscellaneous memory safety hazards (rv:4.0)

Impact: Critical

Description: Mozilla identified and fixed several
memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in SeaMonkey 2.2 and other
Mozilla-based products. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption
under certain circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at least
some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

* [CVE-2011-2985](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-2985)

### Unsigned scripts can call script inside signed JAR

Impact: Critical

Description: **Rafael Gieschke**
reported that unsigned JavaScript could call into script inside a signed JAR
thereby inheriting the identity of the site that signed the JAR as well as any
permissions that a user had granted the signed JAR.

References:

* <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=657267>
* [CVE-2011-2993](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-2993)

* [CVE-2011-0084](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-0084)

### Credential leakage using Content Security Policy reports

Impact: High

Description: **Mike Cardwell**
reported that Content Security Policy violation reports failed to strip out
proxy authorization credentials from the list of request headers. **Daniel
Veditz** reported that redirecting to a website with Content Security
Policy resulted in the incorrect resolution of hosts in the constructed
policy.

References:

* [CSP reports leak proxy auth tokens](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=664983)

Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary

For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **defect** | regression, crash, hang, security vulnerability and any other general issue. |
| **enhancement** | new feature, improvement in UI, performance, etc. and any other request for user-facing changes and enhancements in the product; not engineering changes |
| **task** | refactoring, removal, replacement, enabling or disabling of functionality and any other engineering task |

URL
Bugs can have a URL associated with them - for example, a pointer to a web site where the problem is seen.Version
The version field defines the version of the software the bug was found in.Votes
Some bugs can be voted for, and you can limit your search to bugs with more than a certain number of votes. Votes are not used by Mozilla developers to set priorities.Whiteboard

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86\_64) AppleWebKit/534.30 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/12.0.742.124 Safari/534.30
Steps to reproduce:
Connect to a proxyserver & stream a specific ogg file to an HTML5 player. Then I seek to a part that has not yet been loaded.
Actual results:
On firefox 4 this works, on 5 and 6 I get a crossplatform crash (Windows, Linux, Mac), a segfault
Expected results:
No segfault.

Attached file
[a little proxy-server that feeds the video-file slowly](attachment.cgi?id=547095)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=547095&action=edit)

This is a tarball containing a little proxy-server that helped me to reproduce the error.
After starting the proxy-server, let firefox connect to port 8000.
Then browse to www.video.com
A webcam-video will be shown. The proxy-server will feed the data very slowly, which allows you to seek to the end of the video before it is fully loaded.
When you seek to a part that isn't fetched yet, a segfault will occur.
the proxy-server is replying to the request with HTTP/1.1 200 OK and not with 206 Partial content. No filesize will be transmitted. To report the duration of the video to firefox, the "X-Content-Duration:"-header is used. Maybe this is relevant for this issue.

I can reproduce this reliably in a local trunk debug build on Linux64.
Before the crash I see this on the console:
###!!! ASSERTION: Guess must be before range end: 'guess < endOffset', file content/media/ogg/nsOggReader.cpp, line 1252

then I crash with a SEGV in random parts of the code.

[Bug 462960](/show_bug.cgi?id=462960 "RESOLVED FIXED - Implement nsIDOMHTMLMediaElement::GetSeekable()") should prevent this error by ensuring we never try to seek into ranges which are unbuffered in a resource/connection which doesn't support HTTP byte range requests.

Paul, it would be really great if we could get [bug 462960](/show_bug.cgi?id=462960 "RESOLVED FIXED - Implement nsIDOMHTMLMediaElement::GetSeekable()") and its dependencies landed. The changes to the seek algorithm you make in [bug 462960](/show_bug.cgi?id=462960 "RESOLVED FIXED - Implement nsIDOMHTMLMediaElement::GetSeekable()") should prevent this crash happening.

[Bug 462960](/show_bug.cgi?id=462960 "RESOLVED FIXED - Implement nsIDOMHTMLMediaElement::GetSeekable()") changes an existing scriptable API (nsIDOMHTMLMediaElement).
Does our process allow that on mozilla-aurora and -beta ?

Not sure.
If we can't get [bug 462960](/show_bug.cgi?id=462960 "RESOLVED FIXED - Implement nsIDOMHTMLMediaElement::GetSeekable()") on m-a or m-b, we could probably do a simple fix in each of the Ogg/Wave/WebM backend's to not seek into unbuffered ranges if the media isn't reporting that it supports byte range requests.

I suspect that since the patch from [bug 462960](/show_bug.cgi?id=462960 "RESOLVED FIXED - Implement nsIDOMHTMLMediaElement::GetSeekable()") changes guids on interfaces wouldn't be wanted on m-{a,b} because it may affect binary add-ons?
Here's a patch to implement the minimal fix, pretty much what I described in [comment 9](/show_bug.cgi?id=672789#c9 "VERIFIED FIXED - this script reliably crashes Firefox 5 on Linux, Mac and Windows by streaming an ogg file through a proxy"). With this if you try to seek into an unbuffered range, the seek just aborts and playback continues from the previous playback position.Assignee: nobody → chrisStatus: NEW → ASSIGNED

Would you mind renaming this to IsSeekTargetReachable and inverting the result and the test where we use it?

How is this potentially exploitable? It appears we'd read "ogg data" from uninitialized or unowned memory. If it doesn't crash on an access violation (safe) how is that different than someone feeding us a garbage ogg stream (which shouldn't be exploitable or else we've got worse problems!).
The two crash stacks attached to this bug are both null derefs.

>It appears we'd read "ogg data" from uninitialized or unowned memory.
That's not what I'm seeing using a local debug build on Linux64.
I'm not crashing in the ogg decoder, but some time later in arbitrary
parts of the code. I looked at more than a dozen crashes and all of
them appeared to have been caused by arbitrary memory being overwritten.
I'm assuming that the bug in the ogg code caused this to happen and I'm
worried that what was written can be influenced by the stream.
Here's a few of the crash stacks.
(JaegerTrampoline() sounds like a bad place to crash...)

> How is this potentially exploitable?
In this case we're reading data from file and writing it to memory. Due to unsigned integer overflow, in this case we'll end up writing however much we've downloaded from file into our 8KB memory buffer. Chances are we'll have downloaded more than 8KB by this stage, and we'll end up overflowing the bounds of that buffer and stomping memory with whatever was read from file.
This is caused by unsigned values overflowing at nsOggReader.cpp:1100 (aEndOffset==-1 as the stream's length is unknown). Matthew Gregan picked this up in [bug 652721](/show_bug.cgi?id=652721 "VERIFIED FIXED - Minor robustness improvements for Ogg seeking code"). With his patch applied, when we seek in this case, rather than crashing the media is just rendered unplayable (due the playback engine not recovering from a failed seek correctly, it's not an artefact of his patch).
Ideally we should take Matthew's patch in [bug 652721](/show_bug.cgi?id=652721 "VERIFIED FIXED - Minor robustness improvements for Ogg seeking code") on central + branches to fix the crash, and then take Paul's patches in [bug 462960](/show_bug.cgi?id=462960 "RESOLVED FIXED - Implement nsIDOMHTMLMediaElement::GetSeekable()") on central to prevent us trying to seek into unbuffered ranges when the stream isn't seekable. Paul's patches make my patch in this bug unnecessary, so we may as well take his patches instead.

Yes, this is a regression in 5.0. I was unable to reproduce the crash in [Mozilla/4.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.16) Gecko/20110319 Firefox/3.6.16].

Verified this on Linux on 6.0.2, 7.0RC(build2), and 8.0a2 using the steps in [comment #0](/show_bug.cgi?id=672789#c0 "VERIFIED FIXED - this script reliably crashes Firefox 5 on Linux, Mac and Windows by streaming an ogg file through a proxy") and [comment #3](/show_bug.cgi?id=672789#c3 "VERIFIED FIXED - this script reliably crashes Firefox 5 on Linux, Mac and Windows by streaming an ogg file through a proxy"). In Fx5 moving the seek handle beyond what it has loaded crashed the application.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2011-29

## Security issues addressed in Firefox 6

Announced
August 16, 2011
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox
Fixed in

* Firefox 6

### Miscellaneous memory safety hazards (rv:4.0)

Impact: Critical

Description: Mozilla identified and fixed several
memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox 4, Firefox 5 and other
Mozilla-based products. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption
under certain circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at least
some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

References:

**Aral Yaman** reported a WebGL crash which
affected Firefox 4 and Firefox 5.

### Unsigned scripts can call script inside signed JAR

Impact: Critical

Description: **Rafael Gieschke**
reported that unsigned JavaScript could call into script inside a signed JAR
thereby inheriting the identity of the site that signed the JAR as well as any
permissions that a user had granted the signed JAR.

This is a distinct issue
from [MFSA 2008-23](/security/announce/2008/mfsa2008-23.html) and did
not affect Firefox 3.6.

### String crash using WebGL shaders

Impact: Critical

Description: **Michael Jordon** of
Context IS reported that an overly long shader program could cause a buffer
overrun and crash in a string class used to store the shader source code.

References:

* <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=665936> ([CVE-2011-2988](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-2988))

### Heap overflow in ANGLE library

Impact: Critical

Description: **Michael Jordon** of
Context IS reported a potentially exploitable heap overflow in the ANGLE library
used by Mozilla's WebGL implementation.

References:

* <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=665934> ([CVE-2011-2987](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-2987))

### Crash in SVGTextElement.getCharNumAtPosition()

Impact: Critical

Description: Security
researcher **regenrecht** reported via TippingPoint's Zero Day
Initiative that a SVG text manipulation routine contained a dangling pointer
vulnerability.

References:

* <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=648094> ([CVE-2011-0084](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-0084))

### Credential leakage using Content Security Policy reports

Impact: High

Description: **Mike Cardwell**
reported that Content Security Policy violation reports failed to strip out
proxy authorization credentials from the list of request headers. **Daniel
Veditz** reported that redirecting to a website with Content Security
Policy resulted in the incorrect resolution of hosts in the constructed
policy.

* [CSP reports leak proxy auth tokens](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=664983)
* [Incorrect CSP host resolution](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=679588)
* [CVE-2011-2990](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-2990)

### Cross-origin data theft using canvas and Windows D2D

Impact: High

Description: **nasalislarvatus3000**
reported that when using Windows D2D hardware acceleration, image data from one
domain could be inserted into a canvas and read by a different domain.

References:

* <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=655836> ([CVE-2011-2986](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-2986))
