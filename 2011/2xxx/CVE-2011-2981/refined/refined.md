  "cveId": "CVE-2011-2981",
  "description": "The provided data details a privilege escalation vulnerability in the event management code of Mozilla Firefox, Thunderbird and SeaMonkey. This vulnerability allows JavaScript to be run in the incorrect context, including the context of a different website or potentially in a chrome-privileged context.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "The vulnerability arises because the browser doesn't properly manage the JavaScript execution context when using setTimeout and event handlers.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect privilege assignment",
      "Improper handling of JavaScript execution context"
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploit could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code with the privileges of a different website or the browser itself.",
    "attackVectors": [
        "By using setTimeout to call a function that is only available with higher privileges",
        "By exploiting a missing context when converting rval to variant"
    ],
    "requiredCapabilities": "An attacker would need to be able to inject malicious JavaScript code into a web page or otherwise control the execution flow of the script in a vulnerable browser."
  },
  "additionalNotes": [
    "The fix involves ensuring that IsCapabilityEnabled correctly respects the principals pushing the stack, and that nsJSContext::CallEventHandler clamps the principal for this case.",
    "The vulnerability can be triggered by native functions that can be called without a frame or pushed principal.",
    "The issue was addressed in Firefox 3.6.20 and related versions of Thunderbird and SeaMonkey.",
    "The fix for this vulnerability was done in conjunction with fixes for bugs 614151 and 643450."
