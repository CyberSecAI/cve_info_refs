Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-2937:

**Summary:** CVE-2011-2937 is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability found in Roundcube Webmail.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from improper handling of user input in the Roundcube Webmail interface, specifically in how it displays messages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is a reflected XSS issue. This means that a malicious script can be injected into a web page, and when a user views that page, the script is executed in their browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Disclosure of Message Content:** An attacker could craft a malicious email message that, when viewed by a victim using Roundcube Webmail, would execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's session. This could allow the attacker to steal session cookies, access sensitive information (including other emails), or perform actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious Email:** An attacker sends an email containing a specially crafted payload that exploits the XSS vulnerability within the Roundcube webmail client. When the victim views the email, the malicious code is executed within their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Email Sender:** The attacker needs to be able to send an email to the victim.
*   **No special network position is required**:  The attack relies on the user opening the malicious email within the webmail interface, which makes this vulnerability remotely exploitable.

**Additional Details**
*   The vulnerability was fixed in Roundcube version 0.5.4.
*   The specific issue was tracked upstream at `http://trac.roundcube.net/ticket/1488030` and fixed in changeset `http://trac.roundcube.net/changeset/5037`.
*   Red Hat also tracked this issue as bug 731786, 731787, and 731788 and was fixed in version roundcube 0.5.4
*   The vulnerability is related to how Roundcube handles and displays UI messages, allowing the injection of malicious scripts.
*   The vulnerability affects versions of Roundcube prior to 0.5.4.
* The vulnerability is a reflected XSS type.
