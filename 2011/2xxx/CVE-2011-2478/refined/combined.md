## Vulnerability in Google SketchUp Could Allow Remote Code Execution

Published: June 21, 2011

**Version:** 1.0

### Overview

#### Executive Summary

Microsoft is providing notification of the discovery and remediation of a vulnerability affecting Google SketchUp version 7.1 Maintenance Release 2 and earlier. Microsoft discovered and disclosed the vulnerability under coordinated vulnerability disclosure to the affected vendor, Google Inc. Google Inc. has remediated the vulnerability in their software.

A vulnerability exists in the way that SketchUp parses a specially crafted SketchUp (.SKP) file. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability and cause SketchUp to exit unexpectedly and execute arbitrary code. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

Microsoft Vulnerability Research reported this issue to and coordinated with Google to ensure remediation of this issue. The vulnerability has been assigned the entry, CVE-2011-2478, in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list. For more information, including information about updates from Google SketchUp, see [Google SketchUp Release Notes](https://sketchup.google.com/support/bin/static.py?hl=en&page=release_notes.cs&rd=1).

#### Mitigating Factors

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a document that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit the Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.
* The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful, a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* Google SketchUp has an auto-update feature that is enabled by default. Users who have not disabled this feature are automatically updated to a version that is no longer vulnerable to this issue.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What is the scope of this advisory?**

This advisory is part of a coordinated release with affected vendors to inform customers of a security issue that may affect their systems.

**Is this a security vulnerability that requires Microsoft to issue a security update?**

No. This vulnerability has been fixed via an update from the affected third-party vendors. The update remediates the software listed in the table, **Affected Software**.

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability exists in the way that SketchUp handles certain types of invalid edge geometry in a specially crafted .SKP file.

**What might an attacker use this vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. If the user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

Exploitation of this vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted .SKP file with an affected version of Google SketchUp.

In a Web-based attack scenario, a Web site could contain a specially crafted document that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit the Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site and open the specially crafted document, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes them to the attacker's Web site, and then convince them to open the specially crafted document.

In an e-mail attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted document to the user and convincing the user to open the document.

## Suggested Actions

Apply the vendor-supplied updates or upgrade to a version that is not affected by this vulnerability. For more information, including information about updates for Google SketchUp, see [Google SketchUp Release Notes](https://sketchup.google.com/support/bin/static.py?hl=en&page=release_notes.cs&rd=1).

Allow your installation of SketchUp to update itself. Ensure that the auto-update feature, which is enabled by default, has not been disabled.
