- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists in the way that SketchUp handles certain types of invalid edge geometry in a specially crafted .SKP file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper handling of specially crafted .SKP files.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could cause SketchUp to exit unexpectedly and execute arbitrary code, potentially gaining the same user rights as the logged-on user, or complete control of an affected system if the user has administrative rights. This allows the attacker to install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts.
- **Attack vectors**:
  - Web-based attack: An attacker hosts a website containing a malicious .SKP file, tricking the user into visiting the site and opening the file.
  - Email attack: An attacker sends a malicious .SKP file as an attachment and convinces the user to open it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to create a specially crafted .SKP file. They also need to convince the user to either visit a website hosting the file or open the file sent via email or other means.
