The provided content is related to CVE-2011-2155.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The SmarterTools default basic web server is vulnerable to multiple issues.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **XML Injection:** The web server is susceptible to XML injection attacks.
    *  **OS Command Execution:**  The web server allows for the execution of operating system commands.
    *   **LDAP Injection:** The web server has vulnerabilities related to LDAP injection.
    *   **Directory Path Traversal:** Attackers can perform directory path traversal attacks.
    *  **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Multiple instances of stored XSS vulnerabilities exist where user-controlled data is not properly sanitized, allowing injection of malicious JavaScript.
        *   Specific vulnerable parameters include: `ctl00$MPH$txtName_SettingText` in `/Client/frmCustomReport.aspx`, `/Client/frmCustomReports.aspx`, `/Client/frmFavoriteReports.aspx`, and `/Default.aspx`.
    *   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** A reflected XSS vulnerability is found in `/Client/frmFavoriteReport.aspx`.
    *   **Cleartext Password Submission:**  Passwords are submitted over an unencrypted HTTP connection in `/login.aspx`.
    *   **Password Field with Autocomplete Enabled:** The password field in `/login.aspx` has autocomplete enabled which can allow credential theft.
    *   **Cross-domain Referer Leakage:** Sensitive information may be leaked in the Referer header when navigating to external domains from `/Admin/GettingStarted/frmGettingStarted.aspx`.
    *   **Cookie without HttpOnly Flag:** The cookie `loginsettings` lacks the HttpOnly flag, making it vulnerable to client-side attacks.
    *   **Incorrect Content-Type:** The server incorrectly states the content-type as `text/plain` for responses that are HTML in `/Admin/frmViewReports.aspx`, `/Client/frmCustomReport.aspx`, and `/default.aspx`.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Attackers with network access to the SmarterTools application basic web server may be able to run system commands, inject arbitrary data, or download arbitrary files.
    *   XSS vulnerabilities can lead to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript within the browser of users, potentially leading to session token theft, credential theft, and other malicious actions.
    *   The lack of HTTPS and autocomplete on password fields can lead to credential theft.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Network access to the vulnerable SmarterTools basic web server is required.
    *   XSS attacks can be carried out via crafted requests.
    *   Man-in-the-middle attacks can capture clear text passwords.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Network access to the SmarterTools basic web server.
    *   Ability to craft malicious requests, including Javascript payloads to exploit XSS vulnerabilities.
    *   Ability to intercept network traffic to capture clear text passwords.

**Additional Information:**

*   The report highlights that the default web server is intended for immediate use after installation, but is not recommended for production due to these vulnerabilities.
*   The vendor recommends using Microsoft IIS instead of the default web server.
*  The vulnerabilities were reported by David Hoyt of Hoyt LLC Research.
*   The document also points out the potential risk of XSS attacks spreading via web application worms.
* The XSS vulnerabilities use the `ctl00$MPH$txtName_SettingText` parameter and are stored in the application.
* The exploitation of stored XSS may not be accessible to all users.
* The reflected XSS vulnerability redirects after the attack request.
* The report uses a sample payload `<script>alert(1)</script>` to demonstrate XSS.
* The default web server runs on port 9999.
* The vulnerability reports include HTTP request/response details.
