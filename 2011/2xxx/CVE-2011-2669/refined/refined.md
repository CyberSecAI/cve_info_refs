- **Root cause of vulnerability:**  An issue exists in Mozilla Firefox's certificate validation process. Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered when a specially crafted Certificate Authority (CA) certificate is imported.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper validation of CA certificates leads to a denial-of-service.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is performed by tricking the user into importing a specially crafted CA certificate and then accessing a HTTPS site using that certificate
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to create a malicious CA certificate and convince a user to import it. The attack can be initiated over the internet using network packets
