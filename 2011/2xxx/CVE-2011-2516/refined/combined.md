Package        : xml-security-c
Vulnerability  : stack-based buffer overflow
Problem type   : local/remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-2516
Debian bug     : 632973

It has been discovered that xml-security-c, an implementation of the XML
Digital Signature and Encryption specifications, is not properly handling
RSA keys of sizes on the order of 8192 or more bits.  This allows an
attacker to crash applications using this functionality or potentially
execute arbitrary code by tricking an application into verifying a signature
created with a sufficiently long RSA key.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.0-3+lenny3.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.5.1-3+squeeze1.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6.1-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your xml-security-c packages.

#### Description

Hello

I hit a bug when I try to sign a file with a big RSA key.

I'm using xml-security-c compiled from SVN on Ubuntu 11.04 i386.

The bug is inside DSIGAlgorithmHandlerDefault::signToSafeBuffer. The function uses an array "b64Buf" with size 1024. If your signature is too big, the call to "key->signSHA1PKCS1Base64Signature()" might return 1024. After that call, if b64Buf[b64Len-1] is different from "\n" (which is usually the case), the program will do "b64buf[1024] = '\0', which is wrong (it is exactly 1 byte after the end of the buffer). Maybe this could even be considered a security vulnerability.

I wrote a program that can reproduce the bug. If you run it with valgrind, you will see valgrind reporting the error.

Possible solutions:

1: Increase the buffer size

This solution will only allow more keys to be used, but won't solve the real problem.

2: Adapt the buffer size to the key

I'm not sure how exactly this could be done, but maybe it would be easier to pass a pointer to signSHA1PKCS1Base64Signature() and make it it allocate the correct size for you (but then you'd change the library API...).

3: Check for the buffer overflow and return an exception

This doesn't exactly fixes the bug, but it allows people using the library to know what is happening. After checking if "b64Len <= 0", you could check if "b64Len == 1024" and then throw an exception. My recommendation is that you implement this solution right now, and then write a proper fix later.

4: Combinations of solutions 1, 2 and 3

I'll attach a .tar.gz file containing the following files:

* buff\_overflow.cpp: source code for a program that reproduces the bug
* example.xml: file to be signed by the example program
* rsa-private.pem: big rsa private key used to sign the file (8192 bits)
* Makefile: use it to compile buff\_overflow.cpp
* DSIGAlgorithmHandler.patch: patch that does the following changes:
* increases the buffer size to 2048 (solution 1)
* creates a variable to indicate the buffer size
* throws an exception if the bug is about to happen (solution 3)

Valgrind output form running the reproducer on an unpatched machine:

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
