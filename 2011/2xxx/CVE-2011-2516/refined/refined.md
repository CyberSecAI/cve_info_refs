{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The xml-security-c library does not properly handle RSA keys with sizes of 8192 bits or more.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stack-based buffer overflow in DSIGAlgorithmHandlerDefault::signToSafeBuffer."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can crash applications using the vulnerable functionality or potentially execute arbitrary code.",
    "attack_vectors": "By tricking an application into verifying a signature created with a sufficiently long RSA key.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to create an XML signature using an RSA key of 8192 bits or more."
  },
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability is located in the DSIGAlgorithmHandlerDefault::signToSafeBuffer function, where a fixed-size buffer 'b64Buf' of 1024 bytes is used. If the generated signature exceeds this size, a buffer overflow occurs when null terminating the buffer, leading to a crash or potentially arbitrary code execution.",
