Package        : mapserver
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
Debian bug     : none
CVE IDs        : CVE-2011-2703 CVE-2011-2704

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in mapserver, a CGI-based
web framework to publish spatial data and interactive mapping applications.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:

CVE-2011-2703

  Several instances of insufficient escaping of user input, leading to
  SQL injection attacks via OGC filter encoding (in WMS, WFS, and SOS
  filters).

CVE-2011-2704

  Missing length checks in the processing of OGC filter encoding that can
  lead to stack-based buffer overflows and the execution of arbitrary code.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.0.3-3+lenny7.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.6.5-2+squeeze2.

For the testing (squeeze) and unstable (sid) distributions, this problem
will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your mapserver packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

That code is used in support of WFS, WMS-SLD and SOS  specifications.  All versions may be susceptible to SQL injection under certain  circumstances. The extent of the vulnerability depends on the MapServer  version, relational database and mapfile configuration being used. All  users are ** strongly encouraged ** to upgrade to these latest releases.  The 5.6.7 and 4.10.7 releases also address one significant potentially  exploitable buffer overflow (6.0 branch is not vulneralble).

 Re: CVE Request -- MapServer -- SQL injections in OGC filter
 encoding and in WMS time support.]

Alan, Even, thanks for your replies.

Just to clarify this one a bit yet. Two CVE identifiers (one for the
multiple SQL injection flaws, the other for the stack based buffer
overflow issue) seem to be necessary in this case (due different
versions affected):

[1] <http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/mapserver-users/2011-July/069430.html>

Thank you && Regards, Jan.

Hi,

One remark: the "missing connection" error was a fault alarm (CONNECTION is not needed with TILEINDEX).  We got those lines into log file at least with Mapserver 5.2 series but it has been corrected later.  Version 6.0 does not produce those. I do not remember what was the situation with 5.4.x and 5.6.x.
Add DEBUG 5 into your layer, let's hope it will generate something useful into into Mapserver log.

Dave,

Strange, it should work.  I'm using mapserver v5.6.3, with a layer def of:

   LAYER # LINE
     NAME 'LINE'
     CONNECTIONTYPE OGR
     STATUS on
     TILEINDEX "G:\GeoData\1_250k\Alberta\AltaLIS\250k_west.shp"
     TYPE LINE
     PROJECTION
       'proj=tmerc'
       'ellps=GRS80'
       'lat_0=0.0'
       'lon_0=-117.0'
       'x_0=500000.0'
       'y_0=-5000000'
       'k=0.9996'
       'units=m'
       'nadgrids=@null'
       'no_defs'
     END
     INCLUDE "AltaLIS_250k_render_inc.map"
   END

and the content of the "location" attribute reported by ogrinfo is :

   LOCATION (String) = G:\GeoData\1_250k\Alberta\AltaLIS\82gpos.dgn

Try adding a PROJECTION object to your LAYER def.  And try using a full
path in the TILEINDEX.

Best Regards,
Brent Fraser

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
