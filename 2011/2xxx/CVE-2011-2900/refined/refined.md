Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-2900:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a buffer overflow in the `_shttpd_put_dir()`/`put_dir()` function of the shttpd/mongoose/yassl embedded webserver. This function is responsible for creating directories during PUT requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The code copies parts of the provided path into a fixed-size buffer (`buf`) without properly checking if the length of the path segments exceeds the buffer's capacity.
- **Disabled Assert:** The code includes an `assert` statement to check for buffer overflows, but this check is disabled when compiled with the `-DNDEBUG` flag. The content indicates that many users, especially in embedded environments, compile with this flag to reduce binary size, effectively removing the overflow protection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** A successful exploitation of the buffer overflow vulnerability could lead to remote code execution. The attacker could overwrite adjacent memory regions on the stack which could allow them to overwrite the return address and take control of the execution flow.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** If the code is not compiled with `-DNDEBUG`, a large PUT path could still cause a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **PUT Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted PUT request to the server with a long path.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send a crafted HTTP PUT request to the server.
- The server has to have PUT functionality enabled.

**Additional Notes**

- The vulnerability exists in shttpd/mongoose/yassl embedded web servers, all based on the same source code.
- A patch was made available upstream, indicated by the provided google code link.
- The vulnerability was actively exploited in at least one deployed embedded product.
