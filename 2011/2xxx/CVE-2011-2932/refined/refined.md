Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-2932:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the escaping code used by Ruby on Rails, specifically within the `ActiveSupport::Multibyte.verify` method.
*   This escaping code, designed to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, fails to properly handle certain malformed UTF-8 encoded strings when running on Ruby 1.8.x.
*   The issue lies in how Ruby 1.8's regular expression code processes these malformed Unicode strings, leading to an incomplete escaping process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The core weakness is a failure to sanitize input containing malformed UTF-8 strings during HTML escaping, which should translate special characters into HTML entities.
*   **XSS Vulnerability:** This incomplete sanitization creates a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. An attacker can inject malicious code into web pages by exploiting this weakness.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **XSS Attacks:**  Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code within the context of a vulnerable web application user's browser.
*   **Data Theft, Session Hijacking:** This could lead to various malicious outcomes including:
    *   Data theft
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Defacement of the website
    *   Redirection to malicious websites
    *   Other client-side attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malformed UTF-8 Strings:** The attack vector involves crafting a malicious input string containing malformed UTF-8 characters designed to bypass the regular expression used for escaping.
*   **Input Parameters:**  The malformed string is injected via user-controllable parameters that are processed by the vulnerable escaping code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Input Data:** An attacker needs to be able to supply input data that is processed by the vulnerable Ruby on Rails application and the `ActiveSupport::Multibyte.verify` method.
*   **Understanding of the Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerability and how to craft the malformed UTF-8 string to trigger the bypass of the escaping mechanism.
*   **No Elevated Privileges:** Exploitation does not require any elevated privileges on the server.

**Additional Notes:**

*   **Affected Versions:** Ruby on Rails versions 2.0.0 and later running on Ruby 1.8.x are affected. Applications using Ruby 1.9.x are not vulnerable due to changes in how it handles regular expressions.
*   **Fixes:** Patches are available for the 2.3.x and 3.0.x release series in versions 3.0.10, 2.3.13 and 3.1.0.rc5.
*   **Workarounds:** While upgrading is recommended, a temporary workaround involves implementing a `before_filter` to reject requests containing invalid parameters, which will filter out requests containing malformed UTF-8 strings.
