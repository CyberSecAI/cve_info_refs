# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via

There is a vulnerability in the escaping code used by Ruby on Rails, using specially crafted malformed unicode strings an attacker can bypass the escaping code. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-YYYY-XXXX.

Versions Affected: 2.0.0 and later running on Ruby 1.8.x.
Not Affected: Applications running on Ruby 1.9.x
Fixed Versions: 3.0.10, 2.3.13, 3.1.0.rc5

Impact
------
Ruby on Rails has provided a high performance replacement for ERB::Util.h since version 2.0.0. Due to a bug in the Ruby 1.8 Regular Expression code this replacement version will fail to escape certain malformed unicode strings. This malformed output will then be interpreted as HTML by some browsers on some operating systems.

All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the work arounds immediately.

Releases
--------
The 3.0.10, 2.3.13 and v3.1.0.rc5 releases are available at the normal locations.

Workarounds
-----------

It is possible to construct a before\_filter to reject requests which contain invalid parameters, this should only be considered a temporary solution though.

private
 before\_filter :reject\_invalid\_requests

 def reject\_invalid\_requests
 if include\_invalid\_utf8?(params)
 head :bad\_request
 end
 end

def include\_invalid\_utf8?(param)
 param.any? {|k, v| !validate(k, v)}
 end

def validate(\*vars)
 vars.all? do |var|
 case var
 when Hash
 var[:tempfile].respond\_to?(:read) ? true : !include\_invalid\_char?(var)
 when Array
 validate(\*var)
 else
 ActiveSupport::Multibyte.verify(var.to\_s)
 end
 end
 end

Patches
-------
To aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided patches for the two supported release series. They are in git-am format and consist of a single changeset.

\* 2-3-utf\_8.patch - Patch for 2.3 series
\* 3-0-utf\_8.patch - Patch for 3.0 series
\* 3-1-utf\_8.patch - Patch for 3.0 series

Please note that only the 2.3.x and 3.0.x series are supported at present. Users of earlier unsupported releases are advised to upgrade as soon as possible.

Thanks to Akira Matsuda and Falk Köppe for reporting the vulnerability to us and working with us to confirm a fix.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=731435#c0)  Vincent Danen    2011-08-17 16:36:30 UTC  ``` An XSS vulnerability in the escaping code used by Ruby on Rails was reported [1] where, using a specially crafted malformed unicode string, an attacker can bypass the escaping code.  Due to a bug in the Ruby 1.8 regular expression code, the Ruby on Rails replacement for ERB::Util.h will fail to escape certain malformed unicode strings, which could then be interpreted as HTML by some browsers.  This is corrected in upstream 3.0.10, 2.3.13, and 3.1.0rc5 versions and only affects platforms using Ruby 1.8.x (Ruby 1.9.x renders this ineffective).  Patches are available in the advisory [1] and in git [2].  [1] <http://groups.google.com/group/rubyonrails-security/browse_thread/thread/56bffb5923ab1195> [2] <https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/bfc432574d0b141fd7fe759edfe9b6771dd306bd>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=731435#c2)  Vincent Danen    2011-08-17 17:21:14 UTC  ``` This flaw is rubygems-activesupport, not rubygem-rails.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=731435#c3)  Vincent Danen    2011-08-17 17:26:56 UTC  ``` Created rubygem-activesupport tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 731449](show_bug.cgi?id=731449 "CLOSED ERRATA - rubygem-activesupport: XSS vulnerability in escaping function (Ruby on Rails) [fedora-all]")] Affects: epel-5 [[bug 731450](show_bug.cgi?id=731450 "CLOSED ERRATA - rubygem-activesupport: XSS vulnerability in escaping function (Ruby on Rails) [epel-5]")] Affects: epel-6 [[bug 731451](show_bug.cgi?id=731451 "CLOSED EOL - rubygem-activesupport: XSS vulnerability in escaping function (Ruby on Rails) [epel-6]")]   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=731435#c5)  Vincent Danen    2011-08-30 04:22:05 UTC  ``` This issue has been assigned the name CVE-2011-2932:  <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/08/19/11>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=731435#c6)  Huzaifa S.

Sorry, there is one more flaw that needs a CVE assignment:

Response splitting flaw in 2.3.x (3.0.0 and later not affected).

Sorry I missed this one earlier, I was looking at the 3.x advisory page and missed this one.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

  <http://webservsec.blogspot.com/2011/02/ruby-on-rails-vulnerability.html>

Thanks in advance.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
