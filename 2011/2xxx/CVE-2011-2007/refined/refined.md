Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-2007:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by improper input validation when Host Integration Server processes specially crafted network traffic. This lack of proper validation leads to a denial of service condition.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** The core weakness is the failure of Host Integration Server to adequately validate incoming network packets. This allows an attacker to send malicious packets designed to trigger the vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability will cause the affected SNA Server service and all dependent services to stop responding to new requests. This makes the server unavailable to legitimate users. Note that the vulnerability does not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate their user rights.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network-based attack:** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted network packets to a Host Integration Server.
*   **Specific Ports:** The attack targets UDP port 1478, and TCP ports 1477 and 1478.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Remote, anonymous access:** The attacker does not need any form of authentication or special privileges on the target system.
*   **Network connectivity:** The attacker must have network access to send packets to the vulnerable ports on the Host Integration Server.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability affects several versions of Microsoft Host Integration Server: 2004 SP1, 2006 SP1, 2009, and 2010.
*   The vulnerability is present in the way the `snabase.exe`, `snaserver.exe`, `snalink.exe`, or `mngagent.exe` handles certain network traffic.
*   The Microsoft Exploitability Index classified this vulnerability as a "1" which indicates that exploit code is more likely.

**Mitigations:**

*   **Firewall:** The primary mitigation is to block the vulnerable ports (UDP 1478, TCP 1477 and 1478) at the firewall, especially for systems exposed to the Internet. This is recommended as a standard best practice.

**Workarounds:**

*  Blocking the vulnerable ports at the firewall is also given as a workaround, although this does not correct the underlying vulnerability.
