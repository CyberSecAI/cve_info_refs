Hi Huzaifa,

I have generated some patches to address the CVE. However, I have not yet address the <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=624212#19> related to the "echo do_jitconv > $SESSION_DIR/opd_pipe"

I will send the the patches from my local git branch in a moment.

Any feedback would be appreciated.

-Will

Package        : oprofile
Vulnerability  : command injection
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
Debian bug     : 624212
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-1760

OProfile is a performance profiling tool which is configurable by opcontrol, its
control utility. Stephane Chauveau reported several ways to inject arbitrary
commands in the arguments of this utility. If a local unprivileged user is
authorized by sudoers file to run opcontrol as root, this user could use the
flaw to escalate his privileges.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.3-2+lenny1.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.6-1.1+squeeze1.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.6-1.2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.6-1.2.

We recommend that you upgrade your oprofile packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

It appears from the debian bug, that there may be others way to exploit
this issue as well. hence i think we need a revised patch?

Subject: arbitrary command execution via sudo opcontrol
Date: Tue, 26 Apr 2011 16:06:43 +0200
```
Package: oprofile
Version: 0.9.6-1.1

I found a way to execute arbitrary commands when using opcontrol via
sudo. I realize that sudoing shell scripts is a bad idea (the oprofile
FAQ discourages the use of sudo) but sudo is nevertheless a common
advice on internet to provide oprofile to a user without giving him full
root-access.

The problem is in the set_event function where the content of $2 is not
checked.

set_event()
{
  eval "CHOSEN_EVENTS_$1=$2"
}

This error can be exploited by injecting commands via the -e option as
in the following example:

$ sudo opcontrol -e "abcd;/usr/bin/id"
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
No such event "abcd"

This is a different vulnerability than
   <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-0576>

Subject: More ways to execute root commands
Date: Tue, 03 May 2011 03:11:28 +0200
```
I just found 2 more ways to execute arbitrary commands via sudo opcontrol

################# Method 1 ##################

The problem is in the functions do_save_setup() where multiple values
are saved in the shell script /root/.oprofile/daemonrc.

That file is sourced in do_load_setup() by later invocations of opcontrol.

The function do_save_setup() does not sanitize the values and thus
allows do_load_setup() to execute arbitrary commands.

There is even a comment in do_load_setup that indicates that the method
is known to be insecure

Here is a possible method using the --vmlinux option:

(1) create a fake vmlinux file with a 'malformed' name

#  touch "$HOME/abcd;id"

(2) start the oprofile daemon using that vmlinux file. This creates the
daemonrc file

# sudo opcontrol   --vmlinux="$HOME/aaaa;id"

(3) Any invocation of opcontrol will now source the malformed daemonrc
file as root.

# sudo opcontrol   --stop
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
Daemon not running

(4) The daemonrc file can be cleared with

# sudo opcontrol   --no-vmlinux

The same trick can probably be used with the --session-dir and --xen
options.

################# Method 2 ##################

The --save=name option is moving samples/current to samples/name in the
current session directory.

A proper combination of  --session-dir and --save can be used to copy a
file to any location.

The following example shows how to create a file /etc/XXX

(1) Create a 'samples' directory

# mkdir -p /tmp/xxx/samples

(2) Create a file named 'current' in that directory

# echo "my_commands" > /tmp/xxx/samples/current

(3) Set the oprofile session directory to the root of the 'samples'
directory

# sudo opcontrol --session-dir=/tmp/xxx

(4)  Execute --save with a path relative to the 'current' file

#  sudo opcontrol --save=../../../etc/XXX

```

Subject: One more method
Date: Tue, 03 May 2011 11:02:54 +0200
```
I do not have a working example yet but I believe that privileges can
also be escalated with the following method.

The problem is the following command in do_dump_data

  echo do_jitconv > $SESSION_DIR/opd_pipe

SESSION_DIR can be controlled by the --session-dir option so a malicious
user could  very well replace the fifo $SESSION_DIR/opd_pipe by a
symbolic link.

In theory it becomes possible to create an arbitrary file containing the
text "do_jitconv"

I am not a security expert but I am pretty sure that this is enough to
obtain root privileges for example by creating a custom entry in
/etc/ld.so.conf.d/

Generally speaking, allowing sudoers to change the oprofile session
directory without any controls is probably a very bad idea. The feature
is probably needed to avoid disk quota issues so an etc configuration
file listing all possible session directories could be the solution.

```
