Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-2473:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is insufficient sanitization of user-provided input to the `opcontrol` utility in the oprofile package, leading to command injection vulnerabilities. Specifically, the `set_event` function in `opcontrol` used `eval` on unsanitized input, allowing arbitrary command execution.  Additionally, other functions like `do_save_setup`, `do_load_setup`, and the handling of `SESSION_DIR` were also found to have vulnerabilities due to lack of sanitization and checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Command Injection via `set_event`:** The `set_event` function in `opcontrol` used `eval` with unsanitized input from the `-e` option. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands by providing malicious input via `-e` option.
2.  **Command Injection via `do_save_setup` and `do_load_setup`:** The `do_save_setup` function saves values, including paths like vmlinux, to a file (`/root/.oprofile/daemonrc`) without proper sanitization. This file is later sourced by `do_load_setup`, allowing the execution of arbitrary commands.
3.  **Arbitrary File Creation via `--save` and `--session-dir`:** By manipulating the `session-dir` option and using the `--save` option an attacker can copy a crafted file to any location.
4.  **Arbitrary File Creation via `opd_pipe` manipulation:** The `do_dump_data` function echoes "do_jitconv" into a pipe (`$SESSION_DIR/opd_pipe`). Because `SESSION_DIR` is user-controlled, this pipe can be replaced by a symbolic link, leading to arbitrary file creation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

The primary impact of these vulnerabilities is local privilege escalation. A local user, if authorized to run `opcontrol` with `sudo`, can leverage the command injection flaws to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges. This can lead to complete system compromise, including data theft, malware installation, and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

The attack vectors involve crafted command-line arguments to the `opcontrol` utility. Specifically, malicious input to the following options were used in the exploits:
* `-e`
* `--vmlinux`
* `--session-dir`
* `--save`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system.
*   **Sudo Permissions:** The attacker must be authorized to execute `opcontrol` with root privileges through `sudo`.  This is a common practice to allow users to profile system performance without full root access, which becomes a major security risk when these vulnerabilities exist.
*   **Knowledge of `opcontrol` vulnerabilities:** The attacker should know how to exploit the `opcontrol` vulnerabilities, which include understanding the command injection flaws in `set_event`, and exploitation possibilities with `do_save_setup` / `do_load_setup`, `SESSION_DIR`, `opd_pipe` and save option.
