The provided content is related to **CVE-2011-2536** and not **CVE-2011-2666**, the provided document is an advisory for the vulnerability described by CVE-2011-2536.

The advisory describes a vulnerability in Asterisk where it may respond differently to SIP requests from invalid users compared to valid users, even when the `alwaysauthreject` option is set.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Inconsistent responses to SIP requests based on whether the user is valid or invalid on the system. This occurs even with `alwaysauthreject` enabled in some versions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Information disclosure: The differing responses leak information about valid SIP users on the Asterisk system.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can enumerate valid SIP users by observing the different responses to SIP requests for valid and invalid usernames.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote unauthenticated sessions. An attacker can send SIP requests to the Asterisk system and observe the responses to determine valid usernames.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker can be unauthenticated and must have the ability to send SIP requests to the target Asterisk system.

**Additional details:**
- Asterisk versions 1.4.x and 1.6.2.x require setting `alwaysauthreject=yes` in `sip.conf` to prevent the information disclosure. Version 1.8.x defaults to `alwaysauthreject=yes`.
- Patches are available for Asterisk Open Source versions 1.4.41.2, 1.6.2.18.2, and 1.8.4.4, and Asterisk Business Edition C.3.7.3
