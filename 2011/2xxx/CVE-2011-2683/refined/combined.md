Subject: Old CVE ids, public, but still "RESERVED"
Date: Friday 24 January 2014
From: Raphael Geissert <geissert@...ian.org>
To: Vulnerability Information Managers <vim@...rition.org>

Hi,

Attached are a list of CVE ids which are still marked as RESERVED
(i.e. no description/links/etc have been set) yet our security tracker
knows about them. The tracker only containing public data, it means
that the ids are not embargoed.

Hopefully these lists can be useful to MITRE to catch up on those, or
to anyone else.
I can generate these and other reports regularly if desired.

Notes:
* The year in the file name corresponds to the year in the CVE id, not
necessarily the year of assignment.
* The lists only contain the CVE id, probably a short description, and
one line of data from our tracker. The full data can be obtained
either by going to
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-YYYY-XXXX> or by
looking up on our text database.

# reseed(8) performs HTTP fetch of data from random.org

Bug #804594 reported by
[Jeffrey Walton](https://launchpad.net/~noloader)
on 2011-07-02

[14](/%2Bhelp-bugs/bug-heat.html)

This bug affects 2 people

| Affects | | Status | Importance | Assigned to | Milestone |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | [reseed (Ubuntu)](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/reseed "No current release for this source package in Ubuntu") | Triaged | Low | Unassigned |  |

### Bug Description

reseed(8) performs an insecure HTTP fetch of data from random.org. The script is automatically executed when installed, and any time the user chooses to execute. In addition, the reseed man pages do not mention the data is retrieved over an insecure channel.

Thank you for taking the time to report this bug and helping to make Ubuntu better. I apologize for not responding sooner. I can confirm this issue and have given it an initial Importance of 'Low', based on the difficulty of properly timing the attack while also requiring MITM access. This can be re-evaluated if necessary.

Since the package referred to in this bug is in universe, it is community maintained. As such, I have forwarded this information to the upstream author (as found in debian/copyright) and the oss-security mailing list:

<http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/07/06/8>

Once a patch is decided upon, if you are able, I suggest posting a debdiff for this issue. When a debdiff is available, a member of the security team will review it and publish the package. Please see the following link for more information: <https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/UpdateProcedures>.

Thanks again!

I'm not sure I see why this is difficult to exploit in a MITM attack or why the timing is difficult.

It would be easy to build a simple tool to MITM people who execute reseed(8) while connected to an open wireless network (e.g., at Starbucks). The automated tool could wait for a call to reseed(8) and when one is detected, automatically mount a MITM attack. This eliminates any difficulty of "timing" the attack and provides the attacker all necessary MITM access. Also, if the attacker can successfully mount a DNS hijacking attack on the random.org domain name, then that would provide an alternative attack avenue that also eliminates those difficulties.

I'm not familiar with the criteria for assigning an importance of 'Low', but I wanted to share this additional information to help you triage this bug.

Subject: Security issue in reseed

A security bug was reported by Jeffrey Walton against reseed in
Ubuntu. You are being emailed as the upstream contact. Please keep
oss-security@...ts.openwall.com[1] CC'd for any updates on this issue.

This issue should be considered public. A CVE is being requested; please
mention this in any changelogs.

Details from the public bug follow:
<https://launchpad.net/bugs/804594>

From the reporter:
"reseed(8) performs an insecure HTTP fetch of data from random.org. The
script is automatically executed when installed, and any time the user
chooses to execute. In addition, the reseed man pages do not mention the
data is retrieved over an insecure channel."

As pointed out by the reporter, from the man page: "It is run once
during the installation of the package only". An attacker could perform
a MITM during package installation or whenever the reseed command is run
to provide predictable data for the random number seed.

Thanks in advance for your cooperation in coordinating a fix for this
issue,

Jamie Strandboge
