Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-2176:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from NetworkManager not properly enforcing PolicyKit's `auth_admin` action element settings when creating ad-hoc wireless networks. Specifically, when the `auth_admin` element was specified in `org.freedesktop.network-manager-settings.system.wifi.share.open` action, NetworkManager did not require authentication by an administrative user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Authorization Enforcement:** NetworkManager failed to properly check for administrative privileges when creating open (passwordless) ad-hoc wireless networks via the specified PolicyKit action. This allowed a non-admin user to potentially create such a network.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Creation of Unsecure Wireless Networks:** A local attacker could exploit this flaw to create an insecure, passwordless ad-hoc wireless network.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** The creation of an open network could potentially be a stepping stone for more advanced attacks, such as man-in-the-middle or eavesdropping on network traffic.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system running NetworkManager.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** The attacker needs to be a local user on the system.
*   **No Administrative Privileges Needed:** The attacker does not need to have administrative privileges to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional details from Red Hat Bugzilla:**

*   The issue is specific to the wireless functionality of NetworkManager, particularly with the actions `org.freedesktop.network-manager-settings.system.wifi.share.protected` and `org.freedesktop.network-manager-settings.system.wifi.share.open`. Other actions like `org.freedesktop.network-manager-settings.system.modify` and `org.freedesktop.network-manager-settings.system.hostname.modify` are not affected.
*   The vulnerability was addressed with commits to the NetworkManager project.
*   Red Hat provided an update (RHSA-2011:0930) to fix this in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

**Summary:**

The vulnerability in NetworkManager allowed a local, non-administrative user to create insecure, passwordless ad-hoc wireless networks by bypassing the intended PolicyKit authorization mechanism. This could potentially be used for further attacks on the network. The vulnerability was addressed with patches from the upstream NetworkManager project and also fixed by Red Hat with an advisory.
