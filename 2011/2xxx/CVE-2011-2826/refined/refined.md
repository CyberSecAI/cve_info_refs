The provided content relates to CVE-2011-2826.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Cross-origin violation with empty origins.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability involves a cross-origin violation that occurs when dealing with empty origins. This suggests that the browser's same-origin policy was not being enforced correctly in cases where an origin was empty.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially bypass the same-origin policy, leading to the ability to access sensitive data or execute actions on behalf of the user within a different origin.

**Attack vectors:** The specific attack vector is not explicitly detailed, but it involves scenarios where the browser encounters a resource with an empty origin. The nature of an empty origin would require further investigation in the Chromium source code to confirm how this could be triggered.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need to be able to serve or manipulate content that leads to the browser encountering a resource with an empty origin. The attacker would likely need to have some control over network traffic or a compromised server.
