{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The Cisco AnyConnect SSL VPN ActiveX and Java clients fail to validate the origin of the downloaded vpndownloader.exe file before executing it.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure origin validation of downloaded executable",
      "ActiveX control vulnerability",
      "Java applet vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker can execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system by convincing a user to view a specially crafted HTML document (e.g., a web page or an HTML email message or attachment).",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Specially crafted HTML document (web page, email, attachment)",
      "Compromised web server hosting the malicious vpndownloader.exe file"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to host a malicious vpndownloader.exe and craft a HTML document to redirect the victim to that resource. No prior authentication or access to the target system is required.",
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability affects both ActiveX and Java versions of the AnyConnect VPN client. Even though Cisco addressed the vulnerability in the Java applet, it does not provide any protection due to security limitations in the Java platform."
