    "Metadata": {
      "CVELink": "https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-2202",
      "Description": "It was reported [1] that PHP is prone to a security bypass, which could allow an attacker to upload and possibly overwrite files in the root directory on a vulnerable site.  PHP uses RFC1867 specifications to fill the $_FILES array from the multipart/form-data forms submitted to the server, where it attempts to remove the path component from the uploaded filename provided.  Due to an off-by-one error, when \"/\" or \"\" are present at the beginning of the request, and if there are no other occurrences of the slash or backslash character in the request, the first character is not removed, meaning that $_FILES['upload_field_name']['name'] may contain something like \"/foo\".  For a file to be overwritten, it must be writable by the user running the PHP script (typically the \"apache\" user).  All versions of PHP are affected by this flaw, and is has been fixed upstream [2].",
        "References": [
        "http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=54939",
        "http://svn.php.net/viewvc?view=revision&revision=312103"
      ]
    },
    "Vulnerability Details": {
      "Root cause": "The rfc1867_post_handler function in main/rfc1867.c in PHP does not properly sanitize filenames in multipart/form-data POST requests when the filename starts with `/` or is empty.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Path Traversal",
        "Off-by-one error"
      ],
      "Impact": "A remote attacker could upload and possibly overwrite files in the root directory on a vulnerable site. On Linux systems, the attacker can overwrite files in /tmp, /var/tmp, /var/cache/mod_proxy, /var/cache/mod_ssl and /var/lib/dav. On Windows systems, the attacker can overwrite files in the system root directory.",
      "Attack vectors": [
        "The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a crafted multipart/form-data POST request with a filename that begins with '/' or is empty."
      ],
       "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send crafted POST requests to a PHP application on the target server. The attacker may be remote."
    },
    "Additional Information": {
        "Mitigations": [
            "The issue was fixed in PHP 5.3.7. Setting the PHP configuration variables `post_max_size` and `max_input_time` can mitigate the impact of the attack.",
                "The `max_input_vars` configuration directive can limit the number of parameters that will be parsed to $_GET, $_POST and $_COOKIE arrays from the HTTP requests."
            ],
        "Affected Versions": "All versions of PHP before 5.3.7, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5, and 6, php53 as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, and PHP as shipped with Fedora release 15 and 16." ,
        "Patched Versions": "PHP 5.3.9",
        "Notes": "This vulnerability was rated as having low impact on RHEL systems, since PHP scripts are typically run under a dedicated web server user (such as the default 'apache' user). It is considered to have a higher impact on Windows systems, where PHP scripts might be run under system user privileges."
