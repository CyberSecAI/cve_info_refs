{
  "CVE-2011-2022": {
    "Description": "The agp_generic_remove_memory function in drivers/char/agp/generic.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.38.5 does not validate a certain start parameter, which allows local users to gain privileges or cause a denial of service (system crash) via a crafted AGPIOC_UNBIND agp_ioctl ioctl call, a different vulnerability than CVE-2011-1745.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Insufficient validation of the `pg_start` parameter in the `agp_generic_remove_memory` function when handling the `AGPIOC_UNBIND` ioctl call.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Integer overflow due to lack of proper bounds checking on the `pg_start` parameter when removing AGP memory.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "A local, unprivileged user could cause a denial of service (system crash) or escalate privileges by exploiting the integer overflow.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local access to the system via a crafted `AGPIOC_UNBIND` `agp_ioctl` call.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local, unprivileged user with the ability to make `agp_ioctl` system calls. Usually this requires membership in the `video` group."
