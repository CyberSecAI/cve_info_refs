The provided content describes vulnerabilities in Chyrp, an open source blogging engine. However, CVE-2011-2780 is not mentioned. The content describes CVE-2011-2743 (XSS) and CVE-2011-2744 (LFI) which are related.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Insufficient input sanitization on parameters passed to administration settings, javascript handler, and index handler pages.
- Insufficient path sanitization on the root 'action' query string parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to inadequate sanitization of user-supplied input.
- Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability due to lack of path sanitization, leading to arbitrary file inclusion.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- XSS: Arbitrary Javascript injection in the context of the user session. Session hijacking of the administrator is possible.
- LFI: Reading arbitrary accessible files on the hosting server filesystem. Potential execution of arbitrary commands or code.

**Attack vectors:**
- XSS: Malicious Javascript injection via vulnerable parameters in web requests.
- LFI: Manipulating the 'action' query string parameter to include arbitrary local files.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to send crafted HTTP requests to the Chyrp web application.
- For XSS, likely requires an administrator to visit a malicious link or interact with a crafted page.
- For LFI, attacker needs to manipulate the `action` parameter, which is exposed in the URL.
