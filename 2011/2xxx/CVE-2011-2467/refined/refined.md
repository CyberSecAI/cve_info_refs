Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2011-2467

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A SQL injection vulnerability exists in the Likewise Security Authority (lsass) local authentication provider. The lsass service uses the SQLite database engine to manage local users and groups.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:**  The vulnerability stems from improper handling of user input when constructing SQL queries, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Local Privilege Escalation:** Successful exploitation allows a local attacker to craft a specific SQL query that leads to gaining elevated privileges on the system. This would allow the attacker to gain root level access.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker needs to have some level of access to the target system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have a user account on the target system to exploit this vulnerability. They do not need to be an administrator or have any special permissions on the system to carry out the attack.

**Affected Versions:**
- Likewise Open 5.4, 6.0, and 6.1
- Likewise Enterprise 6.0
- Ubuntu 10.04 (Lucid Lynx), Ubuntu 10.10 (Maverick Meerkat), and Ubuntu 11.04 (Natty Narwhal) were specifically mentioned.

**Additional Notes**
- Patches were developed by Likewise and integrated into Ubuntu releases.
- A workaround exists to mitigate this by disabling the local provider in the Likewise registry.
- The vulnerability was discovered internally by a Likewise researcher and not publicly reported before patches.
