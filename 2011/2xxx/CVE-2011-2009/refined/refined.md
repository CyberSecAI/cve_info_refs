Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2011-2009:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from Windows Media Center's insecure handling of loading external libraries (DLL files). Specifically, it does not properly restrict the path used when loading these libraries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insecure library loading: Windows Media Center attempts to load DLL files from the same network directory as a legitimate file that the user is opening. This allows for an attacker to place a malicious DLL file in that directory, which will then be loaded and executed by Media Center.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to take complete control of the affected system.
- Attackers can install programs, view, change, or delete data, and create new user accounts with full user rights.
- Impact is greater for users with administrative rights.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network share:** An attacker could place a malicious DLL file and a legitimate file in a network share, UNC path or WebDAV location and trick a user into opening the legitimate file.
- **Email:** An attacker could send a legitimate file via email and trick a user into placing it in a directory containing a malicious DLL and then opening the legitimate file.
- **Untrusted Remote File System Location or WebDAV share:**  User must visit an untrusted remote file system location or WebDAV share and open a legitimate file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to place a malicious DLL in the same directory as a legitimate file.
- Requires social engineering to convince the user to open the legitimate file from a location controlled by the attacker.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability is related to the class of vulnerabilities described in Microsoft Security Advisory 2269637, which addresses how applications load external libraries.
*   The vulnerability was publicly disclosed at the time of the bulletin's release.
*   While proof-of-concept code was available, there were no reports of exploitation in the wild at the time of the bulletin's release.
*   The exploitability index for this vulnerability is rated as "Important" meaning that exploit code could be created and it is an attractive target for attackers.

**Workarounds:**
The document also lists workarounds:
    - Disable loading of libraries from WebDAV and remote network shares.
    - Disable the WebClient service.
    - Block TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall.
