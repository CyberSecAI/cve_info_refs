- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The OTRS (Open Ticket Request System) application had a vulnerability that allowed administrators to read arbitrary local files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is an arbitrary local file read vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker who exploits this vulnerability can potentially gain access to sensitive information stored on the server, including configuration files, credentials, or other local files accessible to the OTRS user.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is likely triggered through a flaw in how OTRS handles file access requests within the application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrative access to the OTRS system to exploit this vulnerability.
