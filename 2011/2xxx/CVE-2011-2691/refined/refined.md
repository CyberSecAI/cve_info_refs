  "CVE-2011-2691": {
    "Description": "The `png_err()` function in pngerror.c contains a NULL pointer dereference error.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `png_err()` function in libpng attempts to dereference a NULL pointer when handling errors, specifically when `PNG_NO_ERROR_TEXT` is defined which causes the error message to be a null pointer",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "NULL Pointer Dereference"
    ],
    "Impact": "A crash (Denial of Service) of the application using the vulnerable libpng library due to a NULL pointer dereference.",
    "Attack vectors": "By processing a specially crafted PNG image that triggers the vulnerable code path within libpng.",
	  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to supply the crafted PNG image to an application which uses the vulnerable libpng library."
