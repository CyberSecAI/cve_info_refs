Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-2695:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies in the ext4 filesystem implementation within the Linux kernel. It arises when writing data to the last block of a sparse file where an extent already exists that includes the block right before the maximum file offset. The issue stems from how the maximum file size is calculated and how extents are handled, particularly with the combination of a 32-bit extent start block and a length of blocks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Incorrect Calculation of Maximum File Size:** The code sets the maximum file size (`s_maxbytes`) based on the on-disk extent format (32-bit), but it doesn't account for the fact that the extent length must be able to represent the range from 0 to the maximum block number.  Because extent length includes block 0, it must be one more than the highest logical block number, which exceeds the 32-bit limit.
*   **Inconsistent Use of `EXT_MAX_BLOCK`:** The constant `EXT_MAX_BLOCK` was used inconsistently in the code as both the maximum logical block number and the length of an extent. This caused issues when calculating or checking the validity of extents, particularly when extending to the maximum file size.
*   **Missing Boundary Checks:** When writing to the last block, insufficient checks were present to ensure that the extent could be created/handled correctly, leading to a kernel panic.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Kernel Panic/Denial of Service:** A local unprivileged user can trigger a kernel panic by exploiting this flaw. This renders the system unusable until it is rebooted.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack requires a local user to create and write to a specially crafted sparse file on an ext4 filesystem.
*   **File System Manipulation:** The attacker must create a sparse file and then write to the last block of that file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Account:** An unprivileged user with the ability to create and modify files on an ext4 filesystem is required.

**Technical Details:**
*   The vulnerability is triggered when writing to the maximum file offset of a sparse file on ext4.
*   The issue is related to the maximum extent size that can be represented by a 32-bit start block and a 16-bit length.
*   The problem manifests differently based on block sizes, being more prevalent with smaller block sizes.
*   The vulnerability can be triggered by using `dd` to create a sparse file and then write to the last block.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The fix involves lowering the maximum file size by one block to ensure that the extent length fits within the 32-bit limit.
*   The constant `EXT_MAX_BLOCK` was renamed to `EXT_MAX_BLOCKS` to more accurately reflect its usage as the number of blocks in an extent.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in the upstream kernel with commit `f17722f917b2f21497deb6edc62fb1683daa08e6`.
*   The fix was backported to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and Red Hat Enterprise MRG.
