Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities in the SmarterTools default web server:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Multiple SmarterTools applications install a basic web server by default to allow immediate use after installation. This default web server is insecure and contains multiple vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **XML Injection:** The web server is vulnerable to XML injection attacks.
*   **Operating System Command Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary operating system commands.
*   **LDAP Injection:** The server is susceptible to LDAP injection attacks.
*   **Directory Path Traversal:** Attackers can perform directory path traversal to access files outside the intended directories.
*   **Denial of Service:** The server is vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks.
*   **SQL Injection:** (from the xss.cx link).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker with network access can:
    *   Run arbitrary system commands.
    *   Inject arbitrary data.
    *   Download arbitrary files.
    *   Potentially take full control of the server by exploiting the OS command execution vulnerability.
    *   Access sensitive data via directory traversal, LDAP, and SQL injections.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Network access to the vulnerable SmarterTools application's basic web server is required.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the vulnerable web server.
*   No specific authentication is mentioned, suggesting the vulnerabilities are likely present and exploitable without authentication in the default installation.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vendor, SmarterTools, recommends using Microsoft IIS instead of the bundled web server for production environments.
*   The identified vulnerabilities include XML injection, OS command execution, LDAP injection, directory traversal, and denial of service, which paints a severe picture of the default web server's security posture.
*  The vulnerabilities were initially discovered in October 2010 and reported publicly on May 18, 2011 by David Hoyt.
* The XSS.cx link also mentions SQL injection
