  "cve": "CVE-2011-2194",
  "advisory": {
    "title": "VLC security update",
    "package": "vlc",
    "vulnerability": "heap-based buffer overflow",
    "problem_type": "local",
    "debian_specific": "no",
    "description": "Rocco Calvi discovered that the XSPF playlist parser of vlc, a multimedia player and streamer, is prone to an integer overflow resulting in a heap-based buffer overflow. This might allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code by tricking a victim into opening a specially crafted file.",
    "affected_versions": "VLC media player 1.1.9 down to 0.8.5",
    "solution": "VLC media player 1.1.10 addresses this issue and introduces further stability fixes.",
    "workarounds": "The user may refrain from opening files from untrusted sources. Alternatively, the playlist plugin (demux/libplaylist_plugin.*) can be removed. This will however prevent use of any of all supported playlist file formats.",
    "impact": "If successful, a malicious third party could crash the player instance. Arbitrary code execution within the context of VLC media player might be possible, though it seems impractical.",
    "attack_vector": "Exploitation of those bugs requires the user to explicitly open specifically crafted malicious files.",
    "root_cause": "Integer overflow in XSPF playlist parser resulting in a heap-based buffer overflow."
