Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2011-2486:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The `nspluginwrapper` utility, which allows 32-bit browser plugins to run in a 64-bit browser environment, failed to forward the `NPNVprivateModeBool` variable from the browser to the plugin. This variable is used to inform the plugin if the browser is running in private browsing mode.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect Variable Handling:** `nspluginwrapper` did not properly implement or forward the `NPNVprivateModeBool` variable when requested by the plugin. Instead of providing the private browsing status, it returned an error.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Privacy Leak:** Plugins, such as the Adobe Flash plugin, would not be aware that the browser was running in private mode. This could lead to the plugin behaving as if it was in normal browsing mode, potentially storing browsing data, tracking user activity, or engaging in other actions that a user would expect to be blocked in private browsing mode, hence leaking private browsing activity.

**Attack Vectors:**

- A user browses the internet using a browser's private browsing mode while using a vulnerable `nspluginwrapper` to load browser plugins.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker does not need any specific capabilities. The vulnerability is present in the way `nspluginwrapper` handles the private browsing mode flag, therefore an attacker will exploit a user simply utilizing a vulnerable system.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was found in `nspluginwrapper` versions in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.
- The fix involved implementing the forwarding of `NPNVprivateModeBool` by `nspluginwrapper`
- Red Hat rated this issue as having a "low" security impact.
