Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-2657:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `LaunchProcess` function of the `LaunchHelp.dll` ActiveX control (ProgID `LaunchHelp.HelpLauncher.1`). This function is intended to launch a process, but it fails to sanitize the first argument, which specifies the path to the command to execute. This lack of sanitization allows for directory traversal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Directory Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of input sanitization, allowing directory traversal characters (e.g., "..") within the path argument of `LaunchProcess`.
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** By exploiting the directory traversal, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the user's system.
- **ActiveX Control Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is specifically located within an ActiveX control, making it exploitable through web browsers and other applications that support ActiveX.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine, which can lead to complete system compromise.
- **Data Breach:** Sensitive data on the compromised system can be accessed, modified, or stolen.
- **Malware Installation:** Attackers can install malware, such as ransomware, spyware, or trojans, on the affected system.
- **System Instability:** Exploitation could lead to system instability or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Browsing:** The most common attack vector is through malicious web pages that exploit the vulnerable ActiveX control. When a user visits such a page, the malicious JavaScript code embedded in the page triggers the vulnerability.
- **Malicious Files:**  Opening a malicious file could also trigger the vulnerability, if the file is crafted to use the vulnerable ActiveX control.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the victim's machine to deliver the malicious web page or file.
- **User Interaction:** The victim needs to interact with the exploit by either visiting the malicious website or opening the malicious file. This is not a zero-click exploit, it requires the user to take some action.
- **ActiveX Enabled:** The victim's web browser must have ActiveX enabled for the exploit to work.
- **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** The attacker must be aware of the vulnerability and how to exploit it, such as using directory traversal in the path argument.
- **Exploit Framework:** Metasploit module is available which greatly simplifies the exploitation process.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in Novell Zenworks Software Packaging.
- The provided exploit code is a Metasploit module.
- The vulnerability was reported to Novell, and a patch was made available.
- User interaction is needed for this exploit. The target user has to visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.
