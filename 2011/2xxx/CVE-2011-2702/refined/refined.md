Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-2702:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a signedness issue in the optimized 32-bit `memcpy(3)` and `memset(3)` routines in glibc and eglibc. These routines were optimized using SSE2/SSSE3 instructions. Specifically, the length argument, which is passed as a signed integer, isn't validated for negative values when used to index into a jump table.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Signed Integer Handling:** The code uses a signed integer (`ecx`) to store the length of the memory operation. The comparison with a static value of 32 does not account for negative numbers.
*   **Unchecked Index:** The length value is used as an index into a jump table without any bounds checking.
*  **Arbitrary Jump Table Control:** The `BRANCH_TO_JMPTBL_ENTRY` macro directly uses the length argument as an index to the jump table and executes the jump using `jmp *%ebx`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By providing a negative length value, an attacker can cause the index calculation to result in an out-of-bounds jump to an arbitrary memory location, leading to code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector involves exploiting applications that use `memcpy(3)` or `memset(3)` with user-controlled length arguments.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Control over Length Parameter:** An attacker must be able to control the length parameter passed to `memcpy(3)` or `memset(3)`.
*  **Vulnerable Application:** The application must be linked with a vulnerable version of eglibc/glibc.
*   **Target System with Intel x86 Architecture:** Specifically, the vulnerable code is present in assembly files for x86 architectures utilizing SSE2 or SSSE3.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability was discovered after being a 0day for approximately 1.5 years.
* The vulnerability affects both `memcpy(3)` and `memset(3)` routines.
* There was at least one known exploit in the wild targeting the `mplayer` application by providing a malicious wmv file.
* The exploit relies on user controlled input length parameter being passed directly to memcpy or memset.
* The vulnerability was introduced as part of performance optimizations.
