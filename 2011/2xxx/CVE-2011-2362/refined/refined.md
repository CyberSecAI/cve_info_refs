{
  "CVE-2011-2362": {
    "Description": "It was found that Firefox could treat two separate cookies as interchangeable if both were for the same domain name but one of those domain names had a trailing \".\" character. This violates the same-origin policy and could possibly lead to data being leaked to the wrong domain.",
    "Root cause": "Firefox did not properly differentiate between domains with and without a trailing dot when handling cookies, violating the same-origin policy.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient cookie isolation",
      "Violation of same-origin policy"
    ],
    "Impact": "Potential leakage of cookie data to unintended third parties.",
    "Attack vectors": "Websites setting cookies with and without trailing dots.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker controls a website that sets cookies for a domain with a trailing dot. The victim visits another site with the same name, but without the trailing dot."
