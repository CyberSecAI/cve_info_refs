      "summary": "The vulnerability is due to the fact that document.cookie allows setting multiple cookies in a single call which is inconsistent with other browsers and documentation, leading to security problems in web applications by allowing external scripts to inject multiple cookies.",
        "details": {
        "root_cause": "The `document.cookie` API allowed setting multiple cookies in a single call, which is inconsistent with other browsers and official documentation.",
        "vulnerabilities": [
          "Inconsistent API behavior allowing multiple cookies to be set in one call.",
            "Potential for external scripts to set multiple cookies, due to lack of proper input validation."
