| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=643051#c0)• 14 years ago |
|  | |

Currently, document.cookie allows setting multiple cookies in a single call.
This is inconsistent with other browsers as well as our documentation:
<https://developer.mozilla.org/en/document.cookie>
"Note that you can only set/update a single cookie at a time using this method."
This can lead to security problems in web applications: When an external script takes untrusted input (e.g. from a URL parameter), that input can contain line breaks, and thus set multiple cookies to the including web site.
Therefore, we should disallow setting multiple cookies using document.cookie.

As a security problem this really arises because of insufficient filtering on the web app side more than a problem in Firefox. But it's clearly a bug and we should fix it.Whiteboard: [sg:low] → [sg:nse]

This failed mochitest-1 persistently, and the followups didn't fix it, so I backed out the original patch and both followups from cedar:

Let's try this again. Currently running this version through a local "make mochitest-1", will push to cedar if that worked.
This version clears the "a" cookie in the test that sets it.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2011-19

## Miscellaneous memory safety hazards (rv:3.0/1.9.2.18)

Announced
June 21, 2011
Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox 3.6.18
* Firefox 5
* SeaMonkey 2.2
* Thunderbird 3.1.11

### Description

Mozilla developers identified and fixed several memory safety bugs
in the browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based
products. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption
under certain circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

### References

Bob Clary, Kevin Brosnan, Nils, Gary Kwong, Jesse Ruderman and
Christian Biesinger reported memory safety problems that were fixed in
clients based on mozilla5 and mozilla-1.9.2 (e.g. Firefox 5 and
Firefox 3.6.18 respectively).

> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.
