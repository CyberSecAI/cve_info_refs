How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=716476#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-06-24 15:26:45 UTC  ``` It was found that systemtap runtime tool (staprun) did not properly enforce the module's path sanity check, when the ad-hoc module instrumentation via user-space probing with user-specified module path was requested. A local user, member of the 'stapusr' group could use this flaw to escalate their privileges.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=716476#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-06-24 15:32:22 UTC  ``` This issue did NOT affect the versions of the systemtap package, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5 as they do not provide support for loading of user-space probing modules from user-specified locations yet.  --  This issue affects the version of the systemtap package, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.  --  This issue affects the versions of the systemtap package, as shipped with Fedora release of 14 and 15.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=716476#c3)  Josh Stone    2011-06-25 05:23:40 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 509874](attachment.cgi?id=509874&action=diff "Don't allow path-based auth for uprobes") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=509874&action=edit "Don't allow path-based auth for uprobes") Don't allow path-based auth for uprobes   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=716476#c8)  Vincent Danen    2011-07-25 21:44:40 UTC  ``` Created systemtap tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 725578](show_bug.cgi?id=725578 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2011-2502 CVE-2011-2503 systemtap various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=716476#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-07-25 21:46:37 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2011:1088 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-1088.html>   ``` |  |
