Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2011-2502

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The systemtap runtime tool (`staprun`) did not properly enforce a module's path sanity check when loading ad-hoc modules for user-space probing, specifically when a user specified the module path.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insufficient security check when loading uprobes kernel module.
- Lack of proper validation of user-specified module paths for user-space probing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Privilege escalation. A local user, who is a member of the `stapusr` group, could exploit this flaw to gain elevated privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access.
- Exploitation through the systemtap runtime tool (`staprun`) by loading a malicious module from a user-specified location.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a local user who is a member of the `stapusr` group.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects systemtap as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, and Fedora releases 14 and 15.
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5 are not affected because they do not support loading user-space probing modules from user-specified locations.
- A patch was created to address the issue by disallowing path-based authorization for uprobes.
- The issue was fixed in systemtap version 1.6.
- Red Hat addressed this issue with RHSA-2011:1088.
