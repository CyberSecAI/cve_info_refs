The content is related to the following vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is related to a broken perf NMI handler on Intel family 15 processors. A patch was introduced in kernel version 2.6.32-119 that exposed a pre-existing issue with how performance monitoring events were handled, specifically with Non-Maskable Interrupts (NMIs).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The weakness lies in the kernel's perf subsystem and its interaction with the hardware performance monitoring unit (PMU) on Intel family 15 processors. The NMI watchdog mechanism was incorrectly triggering due to resource contention.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The primary impact is the generation of many log messages, such as "Uhhuh. NMI received for unknown reason 31 on CPU 0. Do you have a strange power saving mode enabled? Dazed and confused, but trying to continue."  In some cases, it can lead to system lockups. While the system tries to continue functioning, the repeated NMI messages can disrupt normal operation.

**Attack vectors:**
This is not an attack vector, rather an internal kernel issue. However, the symptoms could be triggered by specific workloads or hardware configurations that interact with performance monitoring in certain ways.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
No specific attacker capabilities or positions are needed, as the issue manifests from normal system operation on affected hardware. It is a bug in the kernel itself, rather than something exploitable.

**Additional Details:**

*   The issue was observed on Dell PE 2800, 6850, IBM x3850, and x3950 servers, all using Intel Xeon processors of family 15.
*   The problem is described as a regression introduced in kernel version 2.6.32-119.
*   A temporary fix was to swallow all NMIs. The final fix was included in kernel version 2.6.32-131.0.5.el6.
*   The issue is related to how the kernel perf subsystem interacts with the hardware PMU and the NMI watchdog.
*   The problem was observed with NMI reason codes 21 and 31.
