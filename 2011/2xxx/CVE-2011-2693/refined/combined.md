RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

All we did is expose how broken the perf nmi handler is on a p4 machine.  Sucks.  I poked at this code before and it is convoluted.  Looks like I will have to poke at it again to finally fix it (or I will just revert the patch that exposed this problem and fix it properly in 6.2).

Unfortunately, AMD boxes used it for tsc calculations and forgot to disable it.  As a result the perf subsystem thinks the BIOS is using it and prevents the nmi watchdog from being enabled.  The fix was to remove the obsoleted check on AMD boxes.  It is already included in one of the snap builds.

Is this the same thing or something different? Do you want any output for it? Nothing until Monday, though...I'm enjoying my weekend.  :)  I've currently masked the problem by passing nmi_watchdog=0 on the kernel line. This is a dev box so we can play with it if necessary.

Leam   ```  [Comment 26](show_bug.cgi?id=688547#c26)  Don Zickus    2011-04-11 17:11:31 UTC  ``` Hi Leam,  No, we are alright. We have machines that reproduce the problem.  Find the strange interactions with the hardware PMU is the tricky part.  The fix I posted just swallows all the NMIs for now, until we can find a proper fix in 6.2.  Thanks for the offer though.  Cheers, Don   ```  [Comment 27](show_bug.cgi?id=688547#c27)  Don Zickus    2011-04-13 17:29:36 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 689658](show_bug.cgi?id=689658) has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 30](show_bug.cgi?id=688547#c30)  IBM Bug Proxy    2011-04-18 17:11:07 UTC  ``` ------- Comment From shubgoya.com 2011-04-18 13:08 EDT------- I was able to reproduce this issue with snap3 kernel on x3850.   ```  [Comment 31](show_bug.cgi?id=688547#c31)  Don Zickus    2011-04-18 17:29:02 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 697414](show_bug.cgi?id=697414 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - repeated kernel messages: Dazed and confused, but trying to continue") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 35](show_bug.cgi?id=688547#c35)  IBM Bug Proxy    2011-04-19 20:32:05 UTC  ``` ------- Comment From tpnoonan.com 2011-04-19 16:29 EDT------- Hi Red Hat.

Hi Max,  You can start by opening a new bugzilla and attaching a more complete dmesg log so we can have a better idea of what is going on. :-)  The reason is this bugzilla is closed and developers like myself will not look at it any more.  Thanks, Don   ```  [Comment 47](show_bug.cgi?id=688547#c47)  Mike Neuliep    2012-02-16 18:10:02 UTC  ``` Hello all.  I am able to reproduce this bug on start-up 100% of the time on the IBM x3800 and X3950 servers that use the Intel Xeon CPU family type 15 processors. This happens during boot up and I get this message before the system locks up:  Uhhuh. NMI received for unknown reason 35 on CPU 0. Do you have a strange power saving mode enabled?  This occurs in all the 2.6.32-220.X series of kernels.  Kind of annoying as I am stuck using the 2.6.32-131 kernel for the time being, which works just fine.  The bios on these servers, from what I can tell, does not incorporate any power saving features.   ```  [Comment 48](show_bug.cgi?id=688547#c48)  Don Zickus    2012-02-16 18:18:40 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #47](show_bug.cgi?id=688547#c47)) > Hello all.

Hi Mike,  You will need to open a new bz and if possible attach a console log (or dmesg output if you can login).  cc myself on the bz.  Also add nmi_watchdog=0 on the commandline to see if it disappears.  Cheers, Don   ``` |  |
