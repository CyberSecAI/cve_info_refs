# Tor 0.2.2.34 is released (security patches)

by erinn | October 28, 2011

![](../static/images/lead.png)

**Tor 0.2.2.34 fixes a critical anonymity vulnerability where an attacker

can deanonymize Tor users. Everybody should upgrade.**

The attack relies on four components:

* 1) Clients reuse their TLS cert when talking to different relays, so relays can recognize a user by the identity key in her cert.
* 2) An attacker who knows the client's identity key can probe each guard relay to see if that identity key is connected to that guard relay right now.
* 3) A variety of active attacks in the literature (starting from "Low-Cost Traffic Analysis of Tor" by Murdoch and Danezis in 2005) allow a malicious website to discover the guard relays that a Tor user visiting the website is using.
* 4) Clients typically pick three guards at random, so the set of guards for a given user could well be a unique fingerprint for her. This release fixes components #1 and #2, which is enough to block the attack; the other two remain as open research problems.

Special thanks to "frosty\_un" for reporting the issue to us! (As far as we know, this has nothing to do with any claimed attack currently getting attention in the media.)

**Clients should upgrade so they are no longer recognizable by the TLS certs they present. Relays should upgrade so they no longer allow a remote attacker to probe them to test whether unpatched clients are currently connected to them.**

This release also fixes several vulnerabilities that allow an attacker to enumerate bridge relays. Some bridge enumeration attacks still remain; see for example proposal 188.

<https://torproject.org/download/download-easy>

Changes in version 0.2.2.34 - 2011-10-26

**Privacy/anonymity fixes (clients):**

* Clients and bridges no longer send TLS certificate chains on outgoing OR

  connections. Previously, each client or bridge would use the same cert chain

  for all outgoing OR connections until its IP address changes, which allowed any

  relay that the client or bridge contacted to determine which entry guards it is

  using. Fixes CVE-2011-2768. Bugfix on 0.0.9pre5; found by "frosty\_un".
* If a relay receives a CREATE\_FAST cell on a TLS connection, it no longer

  considers that connection as suitable for satisfying a circuit EXTEND request.

  Now relays can protect clients from the CVE-2011-2768 issue even if the clients

  haven't upgraded yet.
* Directory authorities no longer assign the Guard flag to relays that

  haven't upgraded to the above "refuse EXTEND requests to client connections"

  fix. Now directory authorities can protect clients from the CVE-2011-2768 issue

  even if neither the clients nor the relays have upgraded yet. There's a new

  "GiveGuardFlagTo\_CVE\_2011\_2768\_VulnerableRelays" config option to let us

  transition smoothly, else tomorrow there would be no guard relays.

**Privacy/anonymity fixes (bridge enumeration):**

* Bridge relays now do their directory fetches inside Tor TLS connections,

  like all the other clients do, rather than connecting directly to the DirPort

  like public relays do. Removes another avenue for enumerating bridges. Fixes

  bug 4115; bugfix on 0.2.0.35.
* Bridges relays now build circuits for themselves in a more similar way to

  how clients build them. Removes another avenue for enumerating bridges. Fixes

  bug 4124; bugfix on 0.2.0.3-alpha, when bridges were introduced.
* Bridges now refuse CREATE or CREATE\_FAST cells on OR connections that they

  initiated. Relays could distinguish incoming bridge connections from client

  connections, creating another avenue for enumerating bridges. Fixes

  CVE-2011-2769. Bugfix on 0.2.0.3-alpha. Found by "frosty\_un".

**Major bugfixes:**

* Fix a crash bug when changing node restrictions while a DNS lookup is

  in-progress. Fixes bug 4259; bugfix on 0.2.2.25-alpha. Bugfix by "Tey'".
* Don't launch a useless circuit after failing to use one of a hidden

  service's introduction points. Previously, we would launch a new introduction

  circuit, but not set the hidden service which that circuit was intended to

  connect to, so it would never actually be used. A different piece of code would

  then create a new introduction circuit correctly. Bug reported by katmagic and

  found by Sebastian Hahn. Bugfix on 0.2.1.13-alpha; fixes bug 4212.

**Minor bugfixes:**

* Change an integer overflow check in the OpenBSD\_Malloc code so that GCC is

  less likely to eliminate it as impossible. Patch from Mansour Moufid. Fixes bug

  4059.
* When a hidden service turns an extra service-side introduction circuit into

  a general-purpose circuit, free the rend\_data and intro\_key fields first, so we

  won't leak memory if the circuit is cannibalized for use as another

  service-side introduction circuit. Bugfix on 0.2.1.7-alpha; fixes bug

  4251.
* Bridges now skip DNS self-tests, to act a little more stealthily. Fixes

  bug 4201; bugfix on 0.2.0.3-alpha, which first introduced bridges. Patch by

  "warms0x".
* Fix internal bug-checking logic that was supposed to catch failures in

  digest generation so that it will fail more robustly if we ask for a

  nonexistent algorithm. Found by Coverity Scan. Bugfix on 0.2.2.1-alpha; fixes

  Coverity CID 479.
* Report any failure in init\_keys() calls launched because our IP address has

  changed. Spotted by Coverity Scan. Bugfix on 0.1.1.4-alpha; fixes CID 484.

**Minor bugfixes (log messages and documentation):**

* Remove a confusing dollar sign from the example fingerprint in the man

  page, and also make the example fingerprint a valid one. Fixes bug 4309; bugfix

  on 0.2.1.3-alpha.
* The next version of Windows will be called Windows 8, and it has a major

  version of 6, minor version of 2. Correctly identify that version instead of

  calling it "Very recent version". Resolves ticket 4153; reported by

  funkstar.
* Downgrade log messages about circuit timeout calibration from "notice" to

  "info": they don't require or suggest any human intervention. Patch from Tom

  Lowenthal. Fixes bug 4063; bugfix on 0.2.2.14-alpha.

**Minor features:**

* Turn on directory request statistics by default and include them in

  extra-info descriptors. Don't break if we have no GeoIP database. Backported

  from 0.2.3.1-alpha; implements ticket 3951.
* Update to the October 4 2011 Maxmind GeoLite Country database.

### [I am a total "ungeek". I](#comment-12338)

I am a total "ungeek". I downloaded the upgrade or whatever it is - as I was prompted to do. But now my Firefox says it cannot connect! (it says the "proxy server is refusing connections" - the same message I used to get if I accidentally opened Firefox before connecting the Vidalia.) Instead I have this Aurora that automatically opens. I gather the Aurora is a kind of Firefox. But of course it has none of my bookmarks. And is missing some of my add-ons.

I have a husband who is going to go nuts with this new system! Which he refuses to download for that very reason.

I am 66 and my husband is 72. Two Ph.D.'s but total geezers when it comes to stuff like this!

We have very, very slow internet. So if somehow I'm now acting as a relay person, believe me.... we can't get any slower.

I remain your humble servant and loyal Tor user since discovering you a year or so ago. (It took me forever... till a couple months ago to talk my husband into this...)

I am truly "at sea" here....

### [To a certain degree, you](#comment-12399)

To a certain degree, you could view the lack of addons and other normal features as the point: Tor bundles include a copy of firefox that does not include addons precisely because these addons can spill information making you less anonymous. Similarly, Tor also includes other addons that aid in keeping you anonymous. If you wish to use some of these addons, you can still install them but they may (or may not) comprise your anonymity.

If you wish to still use your addons, you can go to your normal, non-Aurora, version of firefox, click on the "firefox" tab, then on "bookmarks", "show all bookmarks" and use the export function under the "import and backup" button. After exporting your standard bookmarks, you can then import them into Aurora using the import function in the same menu.

It's also worth keeping in mind that Tor is not an absolute solution to anonymity. You must also alter your habits and evaluate how additional software you use may comprise your anonymity.

### [Somebody must have](#comment-12400)

Somebody must have downloaded the Aurora channel of Firefox; these are alpha-quality releases, and most people should be using the Stable channel. Uninstall Aurora (keeping your personal data just in case) and get the Stable version of Firefox (currently 7.0.1) here: <http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/>

Also, Tor does definitely slow down your network connection, so if you aren't absolutely sure you need its anonymizing qualities, you may be better off not using it.

### [No, don't uninstall Aurora](#comment-12452)

No, don't uninstall Aurora and get Firefox instead. That's very bad advice. The browser bundle is configured to Tor standards, it is not just an alpha build straight off the Firefox site. It is not a mistake. The use of the Aurora name is new and is based on possible trademark violations associated with shipping the Firefox name and logo.

### [Is this the first time](#comment-12413)

Is this the first time you've updated since Polipo was removed? That may be the cause of the "cannot connect" message. If so, you can't reuse the old profile because it tries to tell the browser to look for Polipo which you no longer have. So this time, you would need to start with a clean install and import your bookmarks from the old one (In the new browser, click the Bookmarks Tab, then Show All, then Import and Backup, Restore, then Choose File and navigate to your old Tor profile folder and choose the most recent bookmarks backup there). Also copy or redownload your addons. This will make it so that none of the code pointing the browser to Polipo remains.

Youtube allows you to view videos without Flash by going to <https://www.youtube.com/html5> and clicking "Join the HTML5 trial" (it sets a cookie). After that the videos will work until the cookie gets cleared.

Use sparingly, though... videos take a lot of bandwidth from the network. I'd suggest choosing low quality versions when possible.

As for Facebook, it should work fine.

The initial problem was introduced in 0.0.9pre5, released on Nov 9 2004:

"""

- Clients now generate a TLS cert too, in preparation for having

them act more like real nodes.

"""

But the combination of factors required to exploit it probably didn't show up until a) we deployed the entry guard design in 0.1.1.x (May 2006) and b) we started having Tor clients tunnel their directory requests over TLS connections in 0.1.2.x (Apr 2007).

So, "quite old".

Great work, but a scary situation nevertheless. I think there is a tendency (especially with open, peer-reviewed software) to assume that if no serious flaws are discovered in a "reasonable" period of time, such flaws must not exist. Bad assumption, and this should serve as a useful lesson on that point. Vigilence and suspicion seem to be our very best friends.

The captcha is a normal image. When your browser requests a captcha image from a server the requesting IP address can be looked up in a geoip-location database.

For Tor users the requesting IP translates into the location of the exit node. The server, at YouTube for example, may decide to not transmit into that country.

CAPTCHA is a test to decide whether you are a spambot that just floods the comment sections, forums and so on with spam or a genuine user. The test usually involves a picture with a text. Some CAPTCHA providers may not work very well with Tor. So far, only one from what I saw.

Probably not. From what I think, Tor uses UTC time, which is essentially a constant time. It never jumps forward or backwards and is location-neutral. It's often used for coordinating international operations or networks. Most serious computer systems use it as internal timekeeping method.

As long as you configure your plugins & Proxy-Settings the way they have to be, you shouldn't be bound to one specific Browser.

There are too many ways for browser-specific features to screw your privacy. Foxyproxy won't do it either: you need Torbutton.

### [Using Tails 0.8.1 here.](#comment-12503)

Using Tails 0.8.1 here. Tails has a bug tracker, but not a blog, per se. Since Tails directed me here to seek an explanation of the Tor upgtrade urgency, and since this is not truly a "bug", I trust that it is also OK to post this inquiry here. The question is simple, not so certain the answer is the same. The official Tails download is distributed with a signature to verify its integrity. So, when I boot Tails, and Vidalia runs, and I then see an interposed web page warning me of a problem and directing me to a site with instructions to download a program to memory, then run that program, what serves to verify the integrity of that process? Not trying to be a smartass - I decided that the greater risk was to \_not\_ upgrade. But it also did occur to me that rogue web pages complaining of discovered security issues and directing users to legitimate-appearing sites harboring trojans, keyloggers and other assorted funware are hardly unheard of. This did cause me to have at least a slight level of concern as did the fact that one is required to give the process root. I'm not a \*nix expert by any means, but I did not see anything in the terminal script that ran that appeared to verify the legitimacy of the download, and all the protocols appeared to be vanilla http and ftp. Maybe 20 years of running Windows with eyes wide open has made me excessively paranoid, but I thought this was worth asking,,,

Always check signatures on any Tor things you want to install. And if it's not clear whether there are signatures or how to check them, \*that\*'s the problem you should be working to solve. :)

>And if it's not clear whether there are signatures or how to check them, \*that\*'s the problem you should be working to solve. :)

Understood, and here my lack of \*nix geekiness gets in the way, The instructions that I was directed to were to run a series of "apt-get" (2) and "start" (1) commands in a root console window. Those commands appeared to access a standard Debian respositiory and request a scripted download and install sequence using those insecure protocols. So, yes, I am quite clueless about whether any integrity authentication of that process was available, and, if it was, how I would interrrupt the process to use it...

Hi, i'm really a tad bit out of my bounds here.

i've used peerguardian and that's about all i know about this sorta thing.

i've tried to view the tor download or the main forum page (unless this is it?)

but in chrome it just says "invalid server certificate"

i've googled and googled.

how do i get around this?

### [I don't know if anyone else](#comment-12580)

I don't know if anyone else has noticed this, but I am unable to get to any .onion websites using TOR. I am fully able to get to regular websites using TOR, but not any .onion websites.

I am using TOR on Windows 8 Dev. Preview, so that could be party of the problem here.

Is anyone else having this issue? I mean, I cannot even get to Core Onion, the directory website.

I've heard the concern that the real reason Tor is now using pre-beta, barebone Aurora is to gather data on users (which of course defeats the purpose). Anyone care to reflect on that?

### [What? That makes no](#comment-12613)

What? That makes no sense.

See <https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq#TBBBrowserName>

Basically, whoever is trying to spread that FUD fundamentally does not understand what software is in the Tor Browser Bundle.

Package        : tor
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-2768 CVE-2011-2769

It has been discovered by "frosty_un" that a design flaw in Tor, an online
privacy tool, allows malicious relay servers to learn certain information
that they should not be able to learn. Specifically, a relay that a user
connects to directly could learn which other relays that user is
connected to directly. In combination with other attacks, this issue
can lead to deanonymizing the user.  The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project has assigned CVE-2011-2768 to this issue.

In addition to fixing the above mentioned issues, the updates to oldstable
and stable fix a number of less critical issues (CVE-2011-2769). Please
see this posting from the Tor blog for more information:
<https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-02234-released-security-patches>

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.2.1.31-1~lenny+1. Due to technical limitations in the Debian
archive scripts, the update cannot be released synchronously with the
packages for stable. It will be released shortly.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.2.1.31-1.

For the unstable and testing distributions, this problem has been fixed in
version 0.2.2.34-1.

For the experimental distribution, this problem have has fixed in version
0.2.3.6-alpha-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your tor packages.
