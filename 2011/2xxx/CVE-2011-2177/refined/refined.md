Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2011-2177:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is an unspecified security flaw in OpenOffice.org that allows for arbitrary code execution.
*   The vulnerability was initially identified and demonstrated by the InteVyDis security research team.
*   The vulnerability was present in OpenOffice.org as of May 2009 and was still present in v3.3 in June 2011, when the CVE was assigned.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Arbitrary Code Execution: The primary vulnerability is that an attacker can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running OpenOffice.org. This suggests a flaw in how OpenOffice.org processes certain file types or inputs.
*   Lack of Detailed Information: At the time of the reports, there was a lack of detailed information about the specific nature of the flaw, which made it difficult to address.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Arbitrary code execution: An attacker can run any code they want on the victim's machine with the same privileges as the user running OpenOffice.org, leading to a complete compromise of the user's system, including data theft, malware installation, etc.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves opening a specially crafted OpenOffice.org document.
*   The document would need to come from an untrusted source.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to create a malicious document.
*   The attacker needs to get the victim to open the malicious document using OpenOffice.org. This requires social engineering or some other method of delivery.

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability was initially released as part of the VulnDisco 8.8 pack in May 2009, meaning it was a known issue for some time before a CVE was assigned.
*   Red Hat initially decided not to fix the issue due to a lack of specific details about the vulnerability.
*   The Bugzilla entry for this CVE is marked as "CLOSED CANTFIX," indicating that a fix was not implemented.
