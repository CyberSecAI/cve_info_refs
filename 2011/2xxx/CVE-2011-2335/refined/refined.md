Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-2335:

*   **Relevance:** The provided content is related to the effort of tracking down and fixing a double-free vulnerability, potentially related to CVE-2011-2335, in WebCore's CSSSelector object.
*   **Root Cause:** The root cause is a double-free vulnerability in the `CSSSelector` destructor. The destructor could be invoked more than once for the same object, leading to memory corruption.
*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:** Double Free.
*   **Impact:** Memory corruption, potentially leading to crashes or exploitable conditions.
*   **Attack Vector:** Triggering a double free on a CSSSelector object. Specific attack vectors aren't detailed in this patch but would likely involve manipulating CSS and DOM structures in a way that causes the CSSSelector object to be freed twice.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker would need to be able to influence the CSS and DOM of a webpage to trigger the double-free.

The provided patch adds a `CRASH()` call within the `CSSSelector` destructor to detect double frees. This is done by adding a boolean `m_deleted` which defaults to `false`, but is set to `true` when the destructor is called. If the destructor is called and `m_deleted` is already `true`, then the `CRASH()` is called.
