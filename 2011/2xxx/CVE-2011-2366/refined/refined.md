{
  "cveId": "CVE-2011-2366",
  "description": "The vulnerability allows stealing of cross-domain images using WebGL textures. An attacker can load an image from a different domain into a WebGL texture, and then each pixel could be rendered into a canvas element with a shader program, creating an approximation of the image in a form that was readable by the creator of the WebGL texture.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how WebGL handles cross-domain images, allowing pixel data extraction through shader manipulation and timing attacks.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-domain image loading in WebGL without proper origin checks.",
      "Lack of restrictions on shader operations, allowing timing-based data extraction."
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability allows for the potential unauthorized access and stealing of image data from different sites, violating the same-origin policy.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "A malicious website can load a cross-origin image into WebGL.",
      "Crafted shader programs can be used to reconstruct image data through timing analysis."
    ],
     "requiredCapabilities": "The attacker needs to craft a webpage with malicious JavaScript code using WebGL. A victim needs to visit this page."
