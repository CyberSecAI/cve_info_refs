2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please close and restart all running instances of MozillaFirefox after the update.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
"Online Update" module or the "zypper" commandline tool. The package and
patch management stack will detect which updates are required and
automatically perform the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2011-25

## Stealing of cross-domain images using WebGL textures

Announced
June 21, 2011
Reporter
Context IS
Impact
Moderate
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey
Fixed in

* Firefox 5
* SeaMonkey 2.2

### Description

Security research firm **Context IS** discovered that
an image from a different domain could be loaded into a WebGL texture,
and then each pixel could be rendered into a canvas element with a
shader program, creating an approximation of the image in a form that
was readable by the creator of the WebGL texture. This could be used
to steal image data from a different site and is considered a
violation of the same-origin policy.

The WebGL functionality was introduced in the browser engine used
by Firefox 4 and SeaMonkey 2.1; the vulnerability does not affect earlier versions.

User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:2.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0.1
Build Identifier:
The linked conformance test checks that a WebGL canvas isn't given unintialised memory when it is resized. We found that it fails on some configurations on Windows XP and MacOS X. By using a larger canvas is it possible to view graphics data from other web pages, and on MacOS various parts of the desktop as well.
I'm attaching a PoC that loads an iframe onto a texture (by applying a CSS transform/transition to it), then searches for it in graphics memory. An SVG color matrix filter is allied to it to set the red channel to a specific value which we then search for. Although the retrieved image is somewhat scrambled, the PoC could be further developed by encoding position information for each pixel into the color channels and using that information to reconstruct the whole image.
We've tested this with success on Intel and ATI cards on WinXP and Nvidia and Intel cards on some recent Macs.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Get WebGL context
2. Resize canvas
3. Copy WebGL canvas onto 2d canvas
4. read pixels

Removing the colorMask() call makes it not work anymore.
I think I know what's happening. GLContext::ClearSafely is being naive:
void
GLContext::ClearSafely()
{
GLfloat clearColor[4];
GLfloat clearDepth;
GLint clearStencil;
fGetFloatv(LOCAL\_GL\_COLOR\_CLEAR\_VALUE, clearColor);
fGetFloatv(LOCAL\_GL\_DEPTH\_CLEAR\_VALUE, &clearDepth);
fGetIntegerv(LOCAL\_GL\_STENCIL\_CLEAR\_VALUE, &clearStencil);
fClearColor(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);
fClearStencil(0);
fClearDepth(1.0f);
fClear(LOCAL\_GL\_COLOR\_BUFFER\_BIT | LOCAL\_GL\_DEPTH\_BUFFER\_BIT | LOCAL\_GL\_STENCIL\_BUFFER\_BIT);
fClearColor(clearColor[0], clearColor[1], clearColor[2], clearColor[3]);
fClearStencil(clearStencil);
fClearDepth(clearDepth);
}
As you can see, it's making many assumptions, in particular it assumes no masks, so it can be trumped by the testcase's glColorMask() call.
We already check for this kind of issues at 2 different places in our WebGL implementation, see WebGLContext::ForceClearFramebufferWithDefaultValues(). We call that when creating new FBOs and with the default option preserveDrawingBuffer=false we also call that after the backbuffer has been presented to the compositor. However we don't currently call that after the canvas has been resized!
Patch coming.

|  | |

The big discussion we're having now with Jeff and Joe is: should we do:
\* option 1: fix this by just letting WebGLContext::SetDimensions call orceClearFramebufferWithDefaultValues()
\* option 2: actually fix GLContext::ClearSafely()
Option 1 has the benefit that it's a very simple patch and doesn't add complexity to GLContext.
Option 2 has the benefit that it doesn't waste time clearing the buffer \_twice\_, and makes GLContext::ClearSafely() actually safe.
The question is, should the method in GLContext trust GL state? In general they can, but in the case of a GL context backing a WebGL context, state is scriptable and thus can't be trusted. Since it's a webgl-specific problem, maybe it's not a good idea to complexify GLContext in general just for it.

| [Comment 10](/show_bug.cgi?id=659349#c10)• 14 years ago |
|  | |

Looking at other GLContext methods, the code we have there is already very careful about not trusting existing GL state and is mostly just calling glGetIntegerv to query state rather than keeping a copy of state, which answers the design question raised in [comment 9](/show_bug.cgi?id=659349#c9 "VERIFIED FIXED - WebGL allows access to uninitialised graphics memory"). I'll just go for option 2 and just call glGetIntegerv.

rewrite GLContext::ClearSafely
It would be nice if you could document why particular state needs to be set. (e.g. GL\_DITHER)

Jeff: still giving a bit more time to the WebKit guys, but at this point I think that disabling GL\_DITHER is useless. I think the biggest reason was as an optimization, but in the case of a Clear() that shouldn't make a difference, right? Since it's the same small dither pattern repeated all over the framebuffer.

If I remove the GL\_DITHER, that will be in a follow-up though, I don't want to introduce any risk here.

Hey, this makes us pass canvas-test.html on Mac! And looking at the log, it also passes on WinXP where we had added it to the ignore-list. So this test failure was actually very meaningful.

Sure. This bug allows to read back arbitrary uninitialized video memory at least on Mac and on Windows XP, when WebGL is enabled.
When I ran the testcase on a Mac, I saw the contents of other windows and of the desktop being painted on the canvas.
It can't read currently-in-use video memory, but it can read memory that had been used by any other application and had been released since (even if the application is still running).
It's known to happen also on Windows XP. We used to have a WebGL test failing because of that on Windows XP.
So it's really a quite severe flaw.
Moreover the code that this patch adds is not entirely new since it's a simplified version of the code that we already have in WebGL to clear framebuffer objects.
I should also note that although the bug currently is only known to affect WebGL, it's not a bug in the WebGL implementation, see the patch, it's touching only GLContext::ClearSafely().

Thanks for the tip, and you're right, this gets printed when I push, I just hadn't seen it. New try push:

@ Paul Stone:
You knew that this was fixed in Firefox 5, which is going to be released in 5 days from now. Why did you blog about it today?

Speaking about timing, just a few hours after Context's blog post, Microsoft released this:

[Microsoft TechNet - WebGL considered harmful - at 9:21 AM Pacific time today](attachment.cgi?id=539878)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=539878&action=edit)

Microsoft's post says 9:21 AM. Looking at other posts, clearly they use Pacific time.
When exactly was Context's post published?

The MS blog is no surprise, they expressed those same three concerns to us when Vlad first started talking about WebGL a few years ago.

currently says '8 hours ago' and just a minute ago it said '7 hours ago'. That means it went online exactly 8 hours ago, which means 7:10 AM Pacific time (it's currently 15:10 Pacific time).
<http://www.contextis.co.uk/resources/blog/blog.xml> confirms it was published June 16 but doesn't give a time of the day.
So, assuming that (my interpretation of) Google's measurement is correct, there is only 2 hours and 10 minutes between the publication of Context's post, and the publication of the Microsoft TechNet article quoting it.
Please, someone give me an explanation that makes me drop my tinfoil hat.

But they quote this new article by context, that was published just 2 hours before.

now says '23 hours ago' which is not plausible as that would mean it was published at midnight, UK time...
I suppose the timestamp got cleared to 00:00:00, as in <http://www.contextis.co.uk/resources/blog/blog.xml> where it's Thur, 16 Jun 2011 00:00:00 +0000
What, if anything, can/should we say about this affair? Just ignore it? Or just mention, in a way as neutral as possible, that at most a few hours elapsed between Context's blog and Microsoft's article quoting it?

Just run the testcase: if the bug still existed, you would see images from other tabs / other apps / your desktop appearing in the canvas.

# Cross-domain WebGL textures disabled in Firefox 5

### Avatar photo

In Firefox 5, it is no longer possible to use cross-domain elements as the source for WebGL textures. We made this change in response to security concerns around the possibility of cross domain information leakage. Unfortunately, that means that some WebGL-using pages are no longer working. We are working with the WebGL WG on a solution to allow such pages to resume working as soon as possible — read on for details.

### The security rules about cross-domain images

A cross-domain image is an image coming from a different domain than the canvas. A basic rule of Web security is that scripts must not be able to read pixel data from cross-domain images — they can only “blindly” display them. In more concrete terms, imagine that you currently have a session open on your bank’s website, allowing you to download scanned copies of cheques you’ve written. You don’t want scripts loaded in other tabs, from other websites, to be able to read your scanned cheques! Similarly, when you draw a cross-domain image onto a 2D canvas, using drawImage(), the canvas becomes “tainted” so that it’s no longer possible for scripts to read its pixels. This prevents a loophole whereby a canvas would be used as a proxy to read cross-domain images.

### The problem with cross-domain images as WebGL textures

When a cross-domain image was used as a WebGL texture, the WebGL canvas was “tainted” so that reading from it was no longer possible. Theoretically, that eliminated the concern. But a while ago, a researcher wrote to the public WebGL list with a [possible attack](http://www.khronos.org/webgl/public-mailing-list/archives/1010/msg00034.html) that could still allow reading pixels from WebGL textures. The idea was to paint the texture one pixel at a time with a WebGL fragment shader crafted to take an amount of time proportional to its brightness, and then time how long it takes: that would conceivably allow to get an approximation of the original image. Initially this attack seemed difficult to execute practically, but since then further research, including a [proof-of-concept](http://www.contextis.co.uk/resources/blog/webgl/poc/index.html) has been published which shows the attack to be more realistic than initially expected.

### The response

The WebGL spec has been [updated](http://www.khronos.org/registry/webgl/specs/latest/#4.2) to disallow using cross-domain images as WebGL textures, and Mozilla’s implementation in Firefox 5 has been [updated](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=656277) accordingly. A non-normative section has also been added allowing cross-domain images that have [CORS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-Origin_Resource_Sharing) approval. Using CORS in this case is a way for servers to explicitly say when an image is OK to be read by cross-domain scripts. CORS support for WebGL is a high priority for us and will be [implemented](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=662599) very soon.

A [wiki page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/WebGL/Cross-Domain_Textures) explains some more details. Affected scripts will generate a DOM\_SECURITY\_ERR exception and, just before that, a JS warning explaining what happened and linking to that wiki page.

Having to make this change is unfortunate, as it breaks [some existing Web content](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=662570). We initially wanted to wait for the CORS approach to be implemented before we blocked cross-domain textures. Our primary priority has always been the safety of our users, though, and so we decided to fix the security issue immediately in Firefox 5. This timing also accounts for the fact that CORS handling will become increasingly useful only as online content providers roll out support.

## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))

In order to fix [bug 655987](/show_bug.cgi?id=655987 "VERIFIED FIXED - Respond to the WebGL cross-domain image theft vulnerability") i.e. respond to this exploit,
<http://www.contextis.co.uk/resources/blog/webgl/poc/index.html>
We need to prevent using cross-domain images as WebGL textures. We also need to prevent using a canvas/2d as proxy for doing the same thing. Then we may consider relaxing this with CORS.

MDC page:
<https://developer.mozilla.org/en/WebGL/Cross-Domain_Textures>
I'm planning to link to it from a JS warning message.
Sheppy, is there a way to give an "international" link as opposed to an "en" link? In case this page gets localized? Should I bother?

There's no way to do a language-neutral link, but if there are translations, users can select a different language from a menu within the page.
This topic needs version or date information to explain what "currently" and "no longer" refer to. Because it's in MDN, it may be found by readers doing web searches, who will have no context.

Attached patch

[block cross-domain textures, v1](attachment.cgi?id=532407&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=532407&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=656277&attachment=532407)

Here's a first version that seems to be working.
TODO:
\* CORS relaxation
\* Discussion is going on the WebGL list to decide if on illegal cross-domain textures we should throw exceptions (as this patch does) or only generate WebGL errors (which are only JS warnings).
\* adjust the WebGL test suite/mochitest to avoid permaoranges. Will do a tryserver build ASAP. At least the origin-clean-conformance test should be rendered obsolete by these changes.
Also, I have one following worry. I tried a page that tried loading a texture from a <img> with a local relative path as URL, like "picture.jpg". This is working when the page is hosted on http, but when the page URL is itself a local relative path like "page.html", this is rejected unless I set the preference security.fileuri.strict\_origin\_policy=false.Assignee: nobody → bjacobStatus: NEW → ASSIGNED

\* The proof-of-concept attack is no longer working with this patch.
\* Most of the WebGL demos I've tried are still working with this patch. In particular the following are working:
-- Mozilla demos: No Comply; Flight of the Navigator;
-- SpiderGL's demos
-- Google's WebGL Aquarium
\* The following demos are no longer working:
-- Mozilla's 360 Degree Video
-- Cooliris' Photowall (this one was fully expected)

To prevent saved-then-opened-from-file web pages from being able to read everything on your local disk we consider each directory to be the root of a separate domain. Although if picture.jpg is in the same directory as page.html that shouldn't be the issue and I wouldn't expect the pref change to fix it.
Set the pref back to the default when you're done testing.

Attached patch

[block cross-domain textures, ready to be landed, but ONLY land it in case of emergency!](attachment.cgi?id=533787&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=533787&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=656277&attachment=533787)

Ready to land, applies on top of the patch in [bug 657190](/show_bug.cgi?id=657190 "RESOLVED FIXED - webgl/conformance/more/functions/texSubImage2DHTML.html and texImage2DHTML.html (at least) hit the network") which I'm going to land very soon (but can be manually applied without it).
This passes the mochitest on my machinel; tryserver build here:
<http://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=f50e0f5e86eb>
Compared to v1, the changes are:
\* only c++ change: when the image principal is null, consider the origin check to be OK. This mimics what is already being done in Canvas DoDrawImageSecurityCheck. I hit this case with images served from mochi.test:8888
\* disabled a test and half of another test, that are rendered obsolete by the underlying spec change here.
\* edited tests to load images from mochi.test:8888 instead of example.com so that they aren't blocked as cross-domain textures.

Asa, this patch breaks compatibility with a non-negligible amount of web content, more so than we ultimately have to (when the CORS solution is implemented). So we don't necessarily want to land it. Only land if the security flaw at hand here is deemed too severe to stay unpatched.

I've updated <https://developer.mozilla.org/en/WebGL/Cross-Domain_Textures> , hopefully it's more clear now.

This is bad. You have no guarantee that domCanvas is an actual canvas element here; it could be some arbitrary jsobject.
The right way to do this is probably:
nsCOMPtr<nsIContent> maybeDOMCanvas = do\_QueryInterface(imageOrCanvas);
if (maybeDOMCanvas && maybeDOMCanvas->IsHTML(nsGkAtoms::canvas)) {
// Now it's safe to cast.
}
Another question: should these cross-origin draw attempts throw, or just silently do nothing? I'd sort of lean toward the latter, maybe.
I sort of hope this code is not performance-sensitive. :(

This is being discussed on the WebGL list. Not sure what the final decision will be. On the one hand throwing a DOM\_SECURITY\_ERR seems more DOM-ish and helps web developers find quickly where problems are; on the other hand not throwing feels more WebGL-ish (WebGL uses error codes for most kinds of errors) and might break a little less existing content.

It's not really performance-sensitive (though we don't want it to be slower than necessary). The only common case where it starts getting a little performance sensitive is when playing a <video> through WebGL.

Note that in general the 2d canvas context silently ignores erroneous input instead of throwing.
I think we shouldn't throw here, precisely because of existing content. Better to paint wrong than to stop the script completely.

OK, then there is the nontrivial question of whether to
\* generate a WebGL error? which one?
\* fail completely silently?
\* not generate a WebGL error but mark the texture as bad and treat it as a 1x1 black texture, as WebGL does in other cases?
It's still being discussed among WebGL people. I will forward your comments to them. Meanwhile, please don't hold r+ for that: we need something that could conceivably landed if Security wants to, and in real-world tests I found that throwing does not break significantly more content, because it seems that the (relatively few) WebGL apps that rely on cross-domain textures are using try { ... } catch anyways.

I think throwing is a more helpful and consistent semantic here.
Not throwing would makes debugging new content and migration unnecessarily harder.
The few existing content, like picture viewers, that uses cross-domain images are completely useless anyways if all textures they load are black, therefore stopping the script is more useful and ecologically-friendly ;)
Also, consistency is important : texImage2D supports uploading an ImageData object, therefore texImage2D(..., crossDomainImgElement) should behave the same imho as the equivalent call texImage2D(..., canvas\_I\_drawn\_the\_crossDomainImgElement\_to.getImageData()), which will throw a SECURITY\_ERR as per Canvas specification.

> therefore stopping the script is more useful
That \_really\_ depends on the page. There are cases where stopping the script leads to really bad effects...
Benoit, if you're happy shipping the throwing version as a security update to a stable release, fine by me. In other DOM code we wouldn't do that, but you have a better idea of how this object is used than I do.

The amount of web content that this patch breaks either way, is much larger than the difference in web content broken between the two approaches. Therefore, it's not a huge issue. The main thing that prevents me from giving you right away a non-throwing version, is that it's not clear to me whether we'd then want to generate a WebGL error. Generating unexpected WebGL errors can break WebGL scripts in different ways. Again, this conversation is being had at the WebGL WG at the moment.

I was trying to see if this is fixed for Fx6 since the flag "status-firefox6" is set on "fixed", but I couldn't.
Can anyone say what is expected to be seen for the test example in [comment 1](/show_bug.cgi?id=656277#c1 "RESOLVED FIXED - Prevent loading WebGL textures from cross-domain images"), or is there another testcase that can be used to verify the fix? Thanks

AndreiD, this is fixed since Firefox 5. All pages loading cross-domain images without CORS approval as WebGL textures now fail to. For example, in the original proof of concept,
<http://www.contextis.co.uk/resources/blog/webgl/poc/index.html>
as soon as you load a cross-domain image (click the 'Go' button under 'Steal image URL'), you should now only see some noise instead of seeing the actual image. In Firefox 4, before this got fixed, you could see the image or at least an approximation of it.
You need to [log in](/show_bug.cgi?id=656277&GoAheadAndLogIn=1)

This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **defect** | regression, crash, hang, security vulnerability and any other general issue. |
| **enhancement** | new feature, improvement in UI, performance, etc. and any other request for user-facing changes and enhancements in the product; not engineering changes |
| **task** | refactoring, removal, replacement, enabling or disabling of functionality and any other engineering task |

URL
Bugs can have a URL associated with them - for example, a pointer to a web site where the problem is seen.Version
The version field defines the version of the software the bug was found in.Votes
Some bugs can be voted for, and you can limit your search to bugs with more than a certain number of votes. Votes are not used by Mozilla developers to set priorities.Whiteboard
Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information

Proof-of-concept:
<http://www.contextis.co.uk/resources/blog/webgl/poc/index.html>
The proof-of-concept consists in loading a cross-domain image as a WebGL texture, and rendering each pixel using a shader program that takes an amount of time proportional to the R, G, B values of pixels. By timing this, they get an approximation of the image.
The attacker has to make a compromise between image quality and time. The higher the wanted quality, the longer it takes to steal.
The biggest hurdle that an attacker faces is that it's usually hard to know the URLs of sensitive images to steal. If the attacker knows URLs to steal and is able to get users to run WebGL scripts, if some users will stay long enough on his page (between 1 and 30 minutes needed depending on image size/quality), he can steal their images with that technique.

The main proposed response to this is to block loading cross-domain images without CORS approval as WebGL textures. We also need to add a check for IsWriteOnly when loading canvases as WebGL textures, otherwise people could just use a canvas as proxy to load cross-domain images.
Other possible responses include:
\* do nothing (if you think that there is no serious security problem here --- but I think that the proof-of-concept is serious enough).
\* enforce constant-time-per-texel in WebGL shaders that use cross-domain textures (no loops, etc). (Would require serious ANGLE changes to happen first --- outside of our control. Google does not even consider the issue to be serious at the moment, so it doesn't seem that they're rushing to do these ANGLE changes).
I think we should implement the no-cross-domain-textures-without-CORS idea for now, if we want anything to happen soon.

Original blog post is public <http://www.contextis.com/resources/blog/webgl/>
Is there any point in keeping this bug hidden?
I'm dubious this is generically sg:high but it certainly would be for any site that has confidential information embedded in images. I wonder if some of those bank sign-ons that use a personalized image for security use predictable image locations? If so this could be used to defeat that protection against phishing.blocking2.0: --- → -

Given that it was hidden, I mentioned in [comment 1](/show_bug.cgi?id=655987#c1 "VERIFIED FIXED - Respond to the WebGL cross-domain image theft vulnerability") Google'sposition on this matter, which they stated on the \_private\_ WebGL list.

To be clear, it was just expressed by two engineers, not security team AFAIK. The two Google engineers who replied in this thread didn't think that this security issue was worth limiting what content can do with cross-domain images.

I believe the opinion that it's not a matter of concern might actually come from Khronos group? Not 100% sure.
I haven't looked into it myself. I'm more concerned about the disappointingly nebulous claims of "arbitrary code execution" -- I'm try to track down any concrete bugs.

The WebGL team at Google said that at this point they were against the idea of limiting cross-domain textures. I hope to discuss that with them during tomorrow's WebGL phone call.

I'm not concerned about that because they don't have any actual exploit to back their claims there; and their claims about "kernel mode" are meaningless since WebGL shaders have almost nothing to do with the kernel mode part of graphics drivers. When there's a vulnerability in a driver that can be exploited by a crafted shader, that's either a vulnerability in the shader compiler, which is just like any DLL, or that's a vulnerability about accessing illegal video memory (more rare case, only seen on Mac OS 10.5); either way, we respond by blacklisting the OS/driver in question, and we're safe.

We've also seen some system-wide DOS vulnerabilities on Mac, where a crafted shader can freeze the whole graphics system, but have no data at this point about what's happening there. In any case it's just a DOS.

Yeah, I talked to Apple a bit about their DOS issue. Since they own the OS code, and tend to favour a single GPU vendor, they're in good shape to fix themselves up. Since development versions of Safari have WebGL, maybe they already did that.
I reached out to US-CERT to explain the way the blacklisting operates; Chrome does the same thing.
Thanks for driving the texture issue forward.

Limiting textures to same-origin in the absence of CORS seems like a no-brainer to me if any kind of program (including shaders) can read the texture data. (I'm shocked that such a limit wasn't in place already.)
I think it would make sense to support CORS for relaxing the same-origin restriction eventually, but adding CORS support seems like too big a thing to put into a chemspill if this issue gets that status.
I can see why without CORS but with same-origin restriction doing stuff like serving textures from a CDN would be annoying, though.

Indeed, they may be utterly uninterested, but I do know that they have gone a couple rounds on origin headers in general; wouldn't want them to miss all the fun.

There is no chance of getting a CORS solution into Firefox 5. The question now is whether this bug is worth an interim fix that simply blocks cross-origin images (or tainted canvases) used in WebGL. That would make Fx4 permissive, Fx5 restrictive, and Fx6 CORS.
For now marking tracking-firefox5, but if we don't want Fx5 different and then Fx6 different again maybe we don't want that interim solution.

You make this call.
During today's WebGL conference call, I said that while I hoped that we would have time to implement the CORS relaxation before we have to ship the fix (disallowing cross-domain textures), I couldn't make any promises as our security team could decide at any time that we need to ship the fix. Google said they understood what I was saying, and were in the same situation.
So really, security team --- it's your call. Meanwhile I'll just write the patch (tomorrow at the latest) for simply blocking cross-domain textures and tainted canvases, so we can ship it if/when you think we should.

I don't see that this bug is actually a huge short-term deal. I've found a ton of cross-origin image theft bugs that work in near-zero time, with perfect image fidelity. And those were never a big deal, as sensitive cookie authenticated images are not a large part of the web -- and of the tiny number that are, many are served at unpredictable URLs.
Contrast the severity of those earlier bugs with this new bug where the theft takes ages and is unreliable and it's pretty clear we're looking at a low severity issue?

Hmm, that makes me curious. Can you point to bugzilla.mozilla.org bugs?

There are also potentially issues with images on intranets at guessable URLs.
It certainly would be convenient if the security community reached a consensus that cross-origin image data should not be considered sensitive. I don't know how you'd make such a decision though.

I think I forgot to update this bug, but during today's WebGL call, Google's WebGL team said they now consider this to be a 'very severe' issue. They said it was the example of a scanned copy of a cheque on one's bank's website that made them change their minds. They are now pushing for the same solution as we do, i.e. disallow cross-domain textures without CORS.

I don't know about the 'predictable locations' part, and indeed that is the key to exploitability here.
However, it makes me uncomfortable that security depends on the predictability of image URLs.

I just clicked 'View Cheque' on a check in my account at TD Canada, a major Canadian bank.
Resulting URL:
<https://easywebsoc.tdcanadatrust.com/servlet/ca.tdbank.banking.servlet.ChequeFrontImageLoadingServlet?MagicNum=13052494>\*\*\*\*\*
(where the last 5 stars were 5 decimal digits --- I'm obfuscating them here)
The 'MagicNum' here seems to be just the current Unix epoch time in milliseconds. The server seems to refuse to let me download it a second time, but that may be just because my bank charges for he 'View Cheque' service.
I concede that this doesn't look very easy to exploit but I'm no security expert.

Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:7.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/7.0
Is there any way how i could test that this issue was fixed?
I followed the url in this bug and if i click on the buttons steal me, below each image, and i can see the images.
Is that the intended behaviour or should that test fail?
Thanks.

The proof-of-concept,
<http://www.contextis.co.uk/resources/blog/webgl/poc/index.html>
defaults to a same-domain image. That's why "stealing" works. If you load a cross-domain image, it shouldn't work anymore.

| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |

## Bugzilla Field Descriptions

Alias
A short, unique name assigned to a bug in order to assist with looking it up and referring to it in other places in Bugzilla.Assignee
This is the person in charge of resolving the bug. Every time this field changes, the status changes to NEW to make it easy to see which new bugs have appeared on a person's list.Blocks
This bug must be resolved before the bugs listed in this field can be resolved.Bug ID
The numeric id of a bug, unique within this entire installation of Bugzilla.CC
Users who may not have a direct role to play on this bug, but who are interested in its progress.Changed
When this bug was last updated.Classification
Bugs are categorised into Classifications, Products and Components. classifications is the top-level categorization.Comment
Bugs have comments added to them by Bugzilla users. You can search for some text in those comments.Comment Tag
Comments can have arbitrary tags added to them to help with filtering as well as mark comments as spam or abusive.Component
Components are second-level categories; each belongs to a particular Product. Select a Product to narrow down this list.Creation date
When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform
This is the hardware platform against which the bug was reported (ARM, ARM64, x86, x86\_64, etc).Priority

| Priority | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | No decision |
| **P1** | Fix in the current release cycle |
| **P2** | Fix in the next release cycle or the following (nightly + 1 or nightly + 2) |
| **P3** | Backlog |
| **P4** | Do not use. This priority is for the Web Platform Test bot. |
| **P5** | Will not fix, but will accept a patch |

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also
This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **defect** | regression, crash, hang, security vulnerability and any other general issue. |
| **enhancement** | new feature, improvement in UI, performance, etc. and any other request for user-facing changes and enhancements in the product; not engineering changes |
| **task** | refactoring, removal, replacement, enabling or disabling of functionality and any other engineering task |

URL
Bugs can have a URL associated with them - for example, a pointer to a web site where the problem is seen.Version
The version field defines the version of the software the bug was found in.Votes
Some bugs can be voted for, and you can limit your search to bugs with more than a certain number of votes. Votes are not used by Mozilla developers to set priorities.Whiteboard
Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information

Someone pointed out that once you have HTML5->Canvas->WebGL, even though you
can't call readPixels or toDataURL or getImageData because of cross origin
issues you can write a shader that takes longer depending on the color and
then just time draw calls to figure out what's in the texture.

In other words, if you want to prevent security issues you could only do
this on same origin content.

But then you open another can of worms. Once you can put content in a
texture you want to be able to let the user interact with it (like they can
with 3d css) but then you run into the issue that you don't know what the
user's shaders are doing so you have to let JavaScript translate mouse
coordinates which is probably another security issue on top of being a PITA
to implement.
