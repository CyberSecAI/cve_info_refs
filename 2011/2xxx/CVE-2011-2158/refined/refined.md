Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2011-2158:

**Vulnerability Overview:**

The core issue stems from vulnerabilities within the basic web server bundled with multiple SmarterTools applications. This web server is intended for immediate use after installation but is insecure and should not be used in production environments.

**Root Cause:**

The bundled web server in SmarterTools applications has multiple vulnerabilities due to inadequate input validation and insecure configurations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **XML Injection:** The web server is susceptible to XML injection attacks.
*   **OS Command Execution:**  Attackers can potentially execute operating system commands on the server.
*   **LDAP Injection:** The server is vulnerable to LDAP injection attacks.
*   **Directory Path Traversal:** Attackers could use path traversal techniques to access files outside the intended web directory.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The server is vulnerable to DoS attacks.
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  Multiple instances of stored XSS vulnerabilities are present, specifically via the `ctl00$MPH$txtName_SettingText` parameter in various pages such as `/Client/frmCustomReport.aspx`, `/Client/frmCustomReports.aspx`, `/Client/frmFavoriteReports.aspx` and `/Default.aspx`.
*  **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** A reflected XSS vulnerability is found in `/Client/frmFavoriteReport.aspx` using the `ctl00$MPH$txtName_SettingText` parameter.
*   **Cleartext Password Submission:** Passwords are submitted over an unencrypted HTTP connection in `/login.aspx`.
*   **Password Autocomplete Enabled:** The password field in `/login.aspx` has autocomplete enabled, posing a security risk.
*   **Cross-Domain Referer Leakage:**  Sensitive information in the query string can be leaked via the Referer header to third-party domains on `/Admin/GettingStarted/frmGettingStarted.aspx`.
*   **Missing HttpOnly Flag on Cookie:** The `loginsettings` cookie lacks the HttpOnly flag, making it vulnerable to client-side scripting attacks.
*   **Incorrect Content-Type Headers:** Several pages like `/Admin/frmViewReports.aspx`, `/Client/frmCustomReport.aspx`, and `/default.aspx` serve HTML content with a `text/plain` Content-Type header.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities can have a severe impact:

*   **System Compromise:** Attackers could gain control over the server by executing arbitrary OS commands.
*   **Data Manipulation/Theft:** Attackers can inject arbitrary data and potentially steal sensitive information through XML and LDAP injection.
*   **Arbitrary File Access:**  Directory traversal could enable attackers to download arbitrary files.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting Attacks:** The stored XSS vulnerabilities allows attackers to inject malicious JavaScript into the application. This can lead to session hijacking, credential theft, and arbitrary actions performed on behalf of the user. Reflected XSS can cause similar issues if the user clicks a crafted link.
*   **Denial of Service:** DoS attacks can disrupt the availability of the SmarterTools application.
*   **Password Theft:** Passwords submitted in clear text could be intercepted.
*   **Account Compromise:** Stored passwords due to autocomplete could be accessed by attackers with local or remote access to the client's machine.
*   **Information Leakage:**  Sensitive information within the application can be leaked to third party domains via the referrer header.
*   **Cookie Hijacking:** Lack of the HttpOnly flag can expose cookies to client-side scripting attacks.
*   **Browser Misinterpretation:** Incorrect content-type headers can cause browsers to behave unexpectedly or lead to cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** Attackers require network access to the vulnerable SmarterTools web server.
*   **Direct HTTP Requests:** Exploiting vulnerabilities involves sending specially crafted HTTP requests to the server.
*   **User Interaction:** Reflected XSS requires the victim to interact with a malicious URL.
*   **Stored XSS:** Injected XSS payloads are stored within the system and executed when other users access vulnerable pages.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to reach the web server, which is often exposed on port 9999 by default.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameters:** The attacker needs to identify and craft payloads for the vulnerable parameters, such as `ctl00$MPH$txtName_SettingText`, and targeted pages.
*   **Understanding of HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to craft specific HTTP requests and understand the web application's behaviour.
*   **Ability to Inject Scripts:** For XSS, the attacker needs the ability to inject malicious script into the application.
*   **Network Sniffing/MITM:** To capture cleartext passwords, an attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic.

**Additional Notes:**

* The vendor recommends not using the bundled webserver in a production environment and instead use Microsoft IIS.
*  Multiple CVEs including CVE-2011-4750, CVE-2011-2151, CVE-2011-2155, CVE-2011-4751, CVE-2011-2154, CVE-2011-2158 and CVE-2011-4752 are associated with this issue and other vulnerabilities present in this server.
