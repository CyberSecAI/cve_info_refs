Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-2898:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a commit (393e52e) in the Linux kernel that introduced a small information leak in the `af_packet` implementation when delivering VLAN TCI (Tag Control Information) to userspace. Specifically, a padding field was not zeroed before being copied to the user space.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Leak:** The kernel was sending uninitialized memory to userspace due to the missing zeroing of the padding field. This could potentially leak sensitive kernel data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive kernel memory through this information leak. The exact nature of the leaked information is not specified, but it could include potentially privileged or sensitive data.
- The severity of the impact is considered "low".

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is within the `af_packet` networking implementation. A user space process using `af_packet` sockets could trigger the information leak when receiving network packets with VLAN information.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need to have the ability to create and use `af_packet` sockets to receive packets.
- The attacker must be a local user or have the capability to run programs on the target system. The specific capabilities required are not detailed.

**Additional Notes:**
- The issue was introduced in Linux kernel version 2.6.27-rc1.
- This vulnerability was fixed by adding padding and ensuring it was zeroed before being copied to the user.
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5 were not affected, as they did not backport the vulnerable commit.
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG were affected, and patches were released via RHSA-2011:1350 and RHSA-2012:0010 respectively.
