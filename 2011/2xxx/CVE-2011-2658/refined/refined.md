Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the inclusion and use of an outdated ActiveX control, `mscomct2.ocx`, within Novell ZENworks.
*   Although `mscomct2.ocx` was previously "killbitted" (disabled by Microsoft), ZENworks accesses it through an intermediary scriptable control (`ISList.ISAvi`). This allows the vulnerable `mscomct2.ocx` to be accessed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   The primary weakness is the use of the old, vulnerable `mscomct2.ocx` ActiveX control, which has known vulnerabilities.
*   The intermediary control `ISList.ISAvi` being scriptable allows an attacker to indirectly access `mscomct2.ocx`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system.
*   The code execution occurs within the context of the browser.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is remote, involving a user visiting a malicious web page or opening a malicious file.
*   The exploitation is triggered when the user interacts with a malicious page/file that leverages the vulnerable ActiveX control through the intermediary.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to host or deliver a malicious webpage/file to the target user.
*   No specific authentication is required, as the attack relies on the user's browser interaction.
* The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the target, as the attack can be delivered remotely.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was reported to Novell on 2011-05-17 and publicly disclosed on 2011-11-07.
*   A patch was released by Novell to address this issue.
*   Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS users are protected by filter ID 11817.
*   The specific version of the `mscomct2.ocx` control mentioned in the advisory is dated Tue Mar 14 18:39:28 2000, further highlighting its outdated nature.
