## Synopsis

Important: kernel security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2011%3A1212)

## Topic

Updated kernel packages that fix multiple security issues and several bugs
are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

This update fixes the following security issues:

* A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Stream

Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) implementation. A remote attacker
could send a specially-crafted SCTP packet to a target system, resulting in
a denial of service. (CVE-2011-2482, Important)

* A flaw in the Linux kernel's client-side NFS Lock Manager (NLM)

implementation could allow a local, unprivileged user to cause a denial of
service. (CVE-2011-2491, Important)

* Buffer overflow flaws in the Linux kernel's netlink-based wireless

configuration interface implementation could allow a local user, who has
the CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability, to cause a denial of service or escalate
their privileges on systems that have an active wireless interface.
(CVE-2011-2517, Important)

* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's Xen hypervisor

implementation emulated the SAHF instruction. When using a
fully-virtualized guest on a host that does not use hardware assisted
paging (HAP), such as those running CPUs that do not have support for (or
those that have it disabled) Intel Extended Page Tables (EPT) or AMD
Virtualization (AMD-V) Rapid Virtualization Indexing (RVI), a privileged
guest user could trigger this flaw to cause the hypervisor to crash.
(CVE-2011-2519, Moderate)

* An off-by-one flaw was found in the \_\_addr\_ok() macro in the Linux

kernel's Xen hypervisor implementation when running on 64-bit systems. A
privileged guest user could trigger this flaw to cause the hypervisor to
crash. (CVE-2011-2901, Moderate)

* /proc/[PID]/io is world-readable by default. Previously, these files

could be read without any further restrictions. A local, unprivileged user
could read these files, belonging to other, possibly privileged processes
to gather confidential information, such as the length of a password used
in a process. (CVE-2011-2495, Low)

Red Hat would like to thank Vasily Averin for reporting CVE-2011-2491, and
Vasiliy Kulikov of Openwall for reporting CVE-2011-2495.

This update also fixes several bugs. Documentation for these bug fixes will
be available shortly from the Technical Notes document linked to in the
References section.

Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported
patches to correct these issues, and fix the bugs noted in the Technical
Notes. The system must be rebooted for this update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/kb/docs/DOC-11259>

To install kernel packages manually, use "rpm -ivh [package]". Do not
use "rpm -Uvh" as that will remove the running kernel binaries from
your system. You may use "rpm -e" to remove old kernels after
determining that the new kernel functions properly on your system.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=709393#c0)  Vasily Averin    2011-05-31 15:31:26 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 502027](attachment.cgi?id=502027 "dmesg output with NFS/NLM/RPC debug") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=502027&action=edit "dmesg output with NFS/NLM/RPC debug") dmesg output with NFS/NLM/RPC debug  btw. I'm reporting this issue to akpm@ and to Trond Myklebust because other vendors and upstream linux kernel is affected too.  Description of problem: unprivileged user can use flock syscall for NFS share to trigger unlimited resource leak and this could cause node DoS.  Details: flock on NFS calls nlmclnt_lock() function, where nlmclnt_call() executes synchronous RPC task NLMPROC_LOCK. Via several subcalls (call_bind) it successfully connects to NFS server and decodes its reply, however because server did not set up r_port rpcb_getport_done() returns -EACCES, and following rpc subcall call_bind_status() in this case repeats call_bind() after 3 sec timeout.  It isn't a big problem, and this cycle could be broken by signal, however error path of nlmclnt_lock() executes identical asynchronous RPC call to unlock taken lock. Waiting of result of this call is also canceled by signal, however in this case RPC call is asynchronous, it cycles too and never finished.  I would like to ask Trond to recheck my analyze and review my patch with fix of this issue or propose some better and more correct solution.  My idea is to break cycle described above, return -EOPNOTSUPP to nlmclnt_lock(), check it on error path and do not execute NLMPROC_UNLOCK call because we already know that server does not support locking operations.  PS. one more separate issue: NLMPROC_UNLOCK can be cycled in another place: nlmclnt_unlock_callback() restarts RPC task in case of any errors. Therefore we cannot execute NLMPROC_UNLOCK on error path in case of server errors. I did not reproduce this issue, however I believe it's possible.  PPS. Also I've found similar cycles in other nlm callbacks, however I have no ideas is it possible to exploit it. However I would like to ask Trond to review this code too.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): 2.6.32-131.0.15.el6.x86_64 I've reproduced this issue on RHEL5, RHEL6, ubuntu 11.04 and upstream linux kernel 2.6.39.   How reproducible: 100%  Actual results: flock hangs, can be canceled by signal, as result one more rpc task leaks (FYI: sysctl -w sunrpc.rpc_debug=0 dumps status of active RPC taks)   Expected results: no hangs, no leaks  Additional info: dmesg output with NFS/NLM/RPC debug and concept of patch are attached. Because  vendor-sec is no longer in use I'm preparing private report to akpm@ and to Trond Myklebust, probably they can propose some better solution   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=709393#c1)  Vasily Averin    2011-05-31 15:36:57 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 502030](attachment.cgi?id=502030&action=diff "patch for 2.6.39 kernel") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=502030&action=edit "patch for 2.6.39 kernel") patch for 2.6.39 kernel   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=709393#c3)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2011-06-01 01:00:30 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 502142](attachment.cgi?id=502142&action=diff "Proposed patch from Trond") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=502142&action=edit "Proposed patch from Trond") Proposed patch from Trond  How about something like the appended fix?

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

NLM: Don't hang forever on NLM unlock requests

```
If the NLM daemon is killed on the NFS server, we can currently end up
hanging forever on an 'unlock' request, instead of aborting. Basically,
if the rpcbind request fails, or the server keeps returning garbage, we
really want to quit instead of retrying.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=709393#c0)  Vasily Averin    2011-05-31 15:31:26 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 502027](attachment.cgi?id=502027 "dmesg output with NFS/NLM/RPC debug") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=502027&action=edit "dmesg output with NFS/NLM/RPC debug") dmesg output with NFS/NLM/RPC debug  btw. I'm reporting this issue to akpm@ and to Trond Myklebust because other vendors and upstream linux kernel is affected too.  Description of problem: unprivileged user can use flock syscall for NFS share to trigger unlimited resource leak and this could cause node DoS.  Details: flock on NFS calls nlmclnt_lock() function, where nlmclnt_call() executes synchronous RPC task NLMPROC_LOCK. Via several subcalls (call_bind) it successfully connects to NFS server and decodes its reply, however because server did not set up r_port rpcb_getport_done() returns -EACCES, and following rpc subcall call_bind_status() in this case repeats call_bind() after 3 sec timeout.  It isn't a big problem, and this cycle could be broken by signal, however error path of nlmclnt_lock() executes identical asynchronous RPC call to unlock taken lock. Waiting of result of this call is also canceled by signal, however in this case RPC call is asynchronous, it cycles too and never finished.  I would like to ask Trond to recheck my analyze and review my patch with fix of this issue or propose some better and more correct solution.  My idea is to break cycle described above, return -EOPNOTSUPP to nlmclnt_lock(), check it on error path and do not execute NLMPROC_UNLOCK call because we already know that server does not support locking operations.  PS. one more separate issue: NLMPROC_UNLOCK can be cycled in another place: nlmclnt_unlock_callback() restarts RPC task in case of any errors. Therefore we cannot execute NLMPROC_UNLOCK on error path in case of server errors. I did not reproduce this issue, however I believe it's possible.  PPS. Also I've found similar cycles in other nlm callbacks, however I have no ideas is it possible to exploit it. However I would like to ask Trond to review this code too.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): 2.6.32-131.0.15.el6.x86_64 I've reproduced this issue on RHEL5, RHEL6, ubuntu 11.04 and upstream linux kernel 2.6.39.   How reproducible: 100%  Actual results: flock hangs, can be canceled by signal, as result one more rpc task leaks (FYI: sysctl -w sunrpc.rpc_debug=0 dumps status of active RPC taks)   Expected results: no hangs, no leaks  Additional info: dmesg output with NFS/NLM/RPC debug and concept of patch are attached. Because  vendor-sec is no longer in use I'm preparing private report to akpm@ and to Trond Myklebust, probably they can propose some better solution   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=709393#c1)  Vasily Averin    2011-05-31 15:36:57 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 502030](attachment.cgi?id=502030&action=diff "patch for 2.6.39 kernel") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=502030&action=edit "patch for 2.6.39 kernel") patch for 2.6.39 kernel   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=709393#c3)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2011-06-01 01:00:30 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 502142](attachment.cgi?id=502142&action=diff "Proposed patch from Trond") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=502142&action=edit "Proposed patch from Trond") Proposed patch from Trond  How about something like the appended fix?
