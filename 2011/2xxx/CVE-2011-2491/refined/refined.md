{
  "CVE-2011-2491": {
    "description": "A flaw in the Linux kernel's client-side NFS Lock Manager (NLM) implementation could allow a local, unprivileged user to cause a denial of service.",
    "root_cause": "The NLM client implementation in the Linux kernel has a flaw where it can hang indefinitely on an 'unlock' request if the NLM daemon on the NFS server is killed or becomes unresponsive.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "The rpc subcall `call_bind_status()` repeats `call_bind()` after a 3-second timeout when the server returns an error. This can cause the lock request to cycle indefinitely, leading to a resource leak and potential DoS.",
      "The error path of `nlmclnt_lock()` executes an asynchronous RPC call to unlock the acquired lock, which can also cycle indefinitely if the server is not responding correctly.",
       "The `nlmclnt_unlock_callback()` restarts RPC task in case of any errors leading to the same cycling behaviour"
    ],
    "impact": "A local, unprivileged user can cause a denial of service by using the flock system call on an NFS share. This leads to a resource leak of RPC tasks, potentially exhausting resources and causing the system to become unresponsive.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local, unprivileged user can trigger the vulnerability using the `flock` syscall on a NFS share."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "A local, unprivileged user is required to exploit this vulnerability.",
        "additional_details": "The issue was caused when the client's connection to a NFS server was lost and it was retrying connection indefinetly leading to the resource leak. The fix introduced a limit on the number of retries that can be attempted."
