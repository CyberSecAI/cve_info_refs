Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-2484:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the Linux kernel's taskstats subsystem. Specifically, a single process was allowed to register exit handlers (listeners) an unlimited number of times on a single CPU.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unlimited Listener Registration:** The core weakness is that the taskstats code did not limit the number of times a process could register as a listener for exit events on a CPU. This allowed for the creation of a bloated listener chain.
- **Memory Exhaustion:** Repeatedly registering exit handlers led to excessive memory consumption in the kernel as each registration allocates memory for a listener structure.
- **CPU Resource Consumption:** Triggering numerous process exits with a bloated listener chain caused significant CPU consumption due to the overhead of processing these listeners.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial-of-service condition where an unprivileged user can exhaust kernel memory and CPU resources. This could lead to system slowdowns, instability, and potentially unresponsiveness.
- **Slow Process Termination:** The bloated listener chain can significantly slow down process terminations as the kernel has to iterate through all the listeners registered by a process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited locally by an unprivileged user on the system. The user does not require any elevated privileges or special access.
- **Abuse of Taskstats Interface:** The attacker exploits the taskstats interface by sending `TASKSTATS_CMD_ATTR_REGISTER_CPUMASK` commands to register exit handlers repeatedly.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have the ability to execute code on the target system.
- The attacker does not require any specific privileges or special system access beyond a normal user account.
- The attacker needs to interact with the taskstats subsystem, likely through a program that can send the `TASKSTATS_CMD_ATTR_REGISTER_CPUMASK` commands.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was introduced by commit `f9fd8914c1acca0d98b69d831b128d5b52f03c51` in the Linux Kernel.
- The fix involves limiting the number of times a single process can register itself as a listener on a single CPU to one.
- The vulnerability was addressed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6 and MRG via errata updates: RHSA-2011:1386, RHSA-2011:1350 and RHSA-2011:1253 respectively.
- The issue did not affect Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 as the Taskstats interface was not supported.
