Subject: CVE request: kernel: taskstats local DoS

"Currently a single process may register exit handlers unlimited times.
It may lead to a bloated listeners chain and very slow process terminations.
E.g. after 10KK sent TASKSTATS_CMD_ATTR_REGISTER_CPUMASKs ~300 Mb of
kernel memory is stolen for the handlers chain and "time id" shows 2-7
seconds instead of normal 0.003.  It makes it possible to exhaust all
kernel memory and to eat much of CPU time by triggerring numerous exits
on a single CPU.

The patch limits the number of times a single process may register
itself on a single CPU to one."

It makes it possible for unprivileged user eat kernel memory and CPU
without triggering OOM killer.

Was introduced in f9fd8914c1acca0d98b69d831b128d5b52f03c51.

Subject: [PATCH] taskstats: don't allow duplicate entries in listener mode

From: Vasiliy Kulikov <segooon@...il.com>

Currently a single process may register exit handlers unlimited times.
It may lead to a bloated listeners chain and very slow process terminations.
E.g. after 10KK sent TASKSTATS_CMD_ATTR_REGISTER_CPUMASKs ~300 Mb of
kernel memory is stolen for the handlers chain and "time id" shows 2-7
seconds instead of normal 0.003.  It makes it possible to exhaust all
kernel memory and to eat much of CPU time by triggerring numerous exits
on a single CPU.

The patch limits the number of times a single process may register
itself on a single CPU to one.

One little issue is kept unfixed - as taskstats_exit() is called before
exit_files() in do_exit(), the orphaned listener entry (if it was not
explicitly deregistered) is kept until the next someone's exit() and
implicit deregistration in send_cpu_listeners().  So, if a process
registered itself as a listener exits and the next spawned process gets
the same pid, it would inherit taskstats attributes.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).
