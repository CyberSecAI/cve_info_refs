## Releases

* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [oprofile](/security/cves?package=oprofile) - System-wide profiler for Linux systems

## Details

Stephane Chauveau discovered that OProfile did not properly perform input

validation when processing arguments to opcontrol. A local user who is

allowed to run opcontrol with privileges could exploit this to run

arbitrary commands as the privileged user. ([CVE-2011-1760](/security/CVE-2011-1760), [CVE-2011-2471](/security/CVE-2011-2471))

Stephane Chauveau discovered a directory traversal vulnerability in

OProfile when processing the --save argument to opcontrol. A local user

could exploit this to overwrite arbitrary files with the privileges of

the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2011-2472](/security/CVE-2011-2472))

Subject: arbitrary command execution via sudo opcontrol
Date: Tue, 26 Apr 2011 16:06:43 +0200
```
Package: oprofile
Version: 0.9.6-1.1

I found a way to execute arbitrary commands when using opcontrol via
sudo. I realize that sudoing shell scripts is a bad idea (the oprofile
FAQ discourages the use of sudo) but sudo is nevertheless a common
advice on internet to provide oprofile to a user without giving him full
root-access.

The problem is in the set_event function where the content of $2 is not
checked.

set_event()
{
  eval "CHOSEN_EVENTS_$1=$2"
}

This error can be exploited by injecting commands via the -e option as
in the following example:

$ sudo opcontrol -e "abcd;/usr/bin/id"
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
No such event "abcd"

This is a different vulnerability than
   <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-0576>

Subject: More ways to execute root commands
Date: Tue, 03 May 2011 03:11:28 +0200
```
I just found 2 more ways to execute arbitrary commands via sudo opcontrol

################# Method 1 ##################

The problem is in the functions do_save_setup() where multiple values
are saved in the shell script /root/.oprofile/daemonrc.

That file is sourced in do_load_setup() by later invocations of opcontrol.

The function do_save_setup() does not sanitize the values and thus
allows do_load_setup() to execute arbitrary commands.

There is even a comment in do_load_setup that indicates that the method
is known to be insecure

Here is a possible method using the --vmlinux option:

(1) create a fake vmlinux file with a 'malformed' name

#  touch "$HOME/abcd;id"

(2) start the oprofile daemon using that vmlinux file. This creates the
daemonrc file

# sudo opcontrol   --vmlinux="$HOME/aaaa;id"

(3) Any invocation of opcontrol will now source the malformed daemonrc
file as root.

# sudo opcontrol   --stop
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
Daemon not running

(4) The daemonrc file can be cleared with

# sudo opcontrol   --no-vmlinux

The same trick can probably be used with the --session-dir and --xen
options.

################# Method 2 ##################

The --save=name option is moving samples/current to samples/name in the
current session directory.

A proper combination of  --session-dir and --save can be used to copy a
file to any location.

The following example shows how to create a file /etc/XXX

(1) Create a 'samples' directory

# mkdir -p /tmp/xxx/samples

(2) Create a file named 'current' in that directory

# echo "my_commands" > /tmp/xxx/samples/current

(3) Set the oprofile session directory to the root of the 'samples'
directory

# sudo opcontrol --session-dir=/tmp/xxx

(4)  Execute --save with a path relative to the 'current' file

#  sudo opcontrol --save=../../../etc/XXX

```

Subject: One more method
Date: Tue, 03 May 2011 11:02:54 +0200
```
I do not have a working example yet but I believe that privileges can
also be escalated with the following method.

The problem is the following command in do_dump_data

  echo do_jitconv > $SESSION_DIR/opd_pipe

SESSION_DIR can be controlled by the --session-dir option so a malicious
user could  very well replace the fifo $SESSION_DIR/opd_pipe by a
symbolic link.

In theory it becomes possible to create an arbitrary file containing the
text "do_jitconv"

I am not a security expert but I am pretty sure that this is enough to
obtain root privileges for example by creating a custom entry in
/etc/ld.so.conf.d/

Generally speaking, allowing sudoers to change the oprofile session
directory without any controls is probably a very bad idea. The feature
is probably needed to avoid disk quota issues so an etc configuration
file listing all possible session directories could be the solution.

```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=700883#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-04-29 17:56:09 UTC  ``` It was found that oprofile profiling system did not properly sanitize the content of event argument, provided to oprofile profiling control utility (opcontrol). If a local unprivileged user was authorized by sudoers file to run the opcontrol utility, they could use the flaw to escalate their privileges (execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the privileged system user, root). Different vulnerability than [CVE-2006-0576](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-0576).  References: [1] <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=624212>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=700883#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-04-29 17:58:24 UTC  ``` This issue did not affect the version of the oprofile package, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.  This issue affects the versions of the oprofile package, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.  This issue affects the versions of the oprofile package, as shipped with Fedora release of 13 and 14.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=700883#c3)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-04-29 18:16:18 UTC  ``` CVE Request: [2] <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/04/29/3>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=700883#c4)  Huzaifa S.

That file is sourced in do_load_setup() by later invocations of opcontrol.  The function do_save_setup() does not sanitize the values and thus  allows do_load_setup() to execute arbitrary commands.  There is even a comment in do_load_setup that indicates that the method  is known to be insecure  Here is a possible method using the --vmlinux option:  (1) create a fake vmlinux file with a 'malformed' name  #  touch "$HOME/abcd;id"  (2) start the oprofile daemon using that vmlinux file. This creates the  daemonrc file  # sudo opcontrol   --vmlinux="$HOME/aaaa;id"  (3) Any invocation of opcontrol will now source the malformed daemonrc  file as root.  # sudo opcontrol   --stop uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root) Daemon not running  (4) The daemonrc file can be cleared with  # sudo opcontrol   --no-vmlinux  The same trick can probably be used with the --session-dir and --xen  options.  ################# Method 2 ##################  The --save=name option is moving samples/current to samples/name in the  current session directory.  A proper combination of  --session-dir and --save can be used to copy a  file to any location.  The following example shows how to create a file /etc/XXX  (1) Create a 'samples' directory  # mkdir -p /tmp/xxx/samples  (2) Create a file named 'current' in that directory  # echo "my_commands" > /tmp/xxx/samples/current  (3) Set the oprofile session directory to the root of the 'samples'  directory  # sudo opcontrol --session-dir=/tmp/xxx  (4)  Execute --save with a path relative to the 'current' file  #  sudo opcontrol --save=../../../etc/XXX  =============================================================  [4] <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=624212#14>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=700883#c9)  William Cohen    2011-05-16 21:29:10 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 499232](attachment.cgi?id=499232&action=diff "0001-Sanitize-Event-Names.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=499232&action=edit "0001-Sanitize-Event-Names.patch") 0001-Sanitize-Event-Names.patch   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=700883#c10)  William Cohen    2011-05-16 21:30:06 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 499233](attachment.cgi?id=499233&action=diff "0002-Ensure-that-save-only-saves-things-in-SESSION_DIR.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=499233&action=edit "0002-Ensure-that-save-only-saves-things-in-SESSION_DIR.patch") 0002-Ensure-that-save-only-saves-things-in-SESSION_DIR.patch   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=700883#c11)  William Cohen    2011-05-16 21:30:46 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 499234](attachment.cgi?id=499234&action=diff "0003-Avoid-blindly-source-SETUP_FILE-with.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=499234&action=edit "0003-Avoid-blindly-source-SETUP_FILE-with.patch") 0003-Avoid-blindly-source-SETUP_FILE-with.patch   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=700883#c12)  William Cohen    2011-05-16 21:31:19 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 499235](attachment.cgi?id=499235&action=diff "0004-Do-additional-checks-on-user-supplied-arguments.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=499235&action=edit "0004-Do-additional-checks-on-user-supplied-arguments.patch") 0004-Do-additional-checks-on-user-supplied-arguments.patch   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=700883#c16)  Vincent Danen    2011-07-07 22:07:24 UTC  ``` Jamie Strandboge noted that one of the patches reverts a change made in the previous patch.

It appears from the debian bug, that there may be others way to exploit
this issue as well. hence i think we need a revised patch?

Hi Huzaifa,

I have generated some patches to address the CVE. However, I have not yet address the <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=624212#19> related to the "echo do_jitconv > $SESSION_DIR/opd_pipe"

I will send the the patches from my local git branch in a moment.

Any feedback would be appreciated.

-Will

Package        : oprofile
Vulnerability  : command injection
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
Debian bug     : 624212
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-1760

OProfile is a performance profiling tool which is configurable by opcontrol, its
control utility. Stephane Chauveau reported several ways to inject arbitrary
commands in the arguments of this utility. If a local unprivileged user is
authorized by sudoers file to run opcontrol as root, this user could use the
flaw to escalate his privileges.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.3-2+lenny1.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.6-1.1+squeeze1.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.6-1.2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.6-1.2.

We recommend that you upgrade your oprofile packages.
