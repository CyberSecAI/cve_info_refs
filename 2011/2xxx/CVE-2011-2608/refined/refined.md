- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `ovbbccb.exe` service allows a client to specify a local file path containing service registration information. After parsing the information, the service uses `MSVCR80.remove` to delete the file, using a full arbitrary path provided by the client.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Arbitrary file deletion vulnerability due to the service deleting a client-specified file.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can delete any arbitrary file on the same machine or on others (via UNC paths) with SYSTEM privileges.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted "Register" command to the `ovbbccb.exe` service running on port 383, specifying the full path of the file to be deleted.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send data to the `ovbbccb.exe` service on port 383, likely from a network-connected machine. They do not need prior authentication.
