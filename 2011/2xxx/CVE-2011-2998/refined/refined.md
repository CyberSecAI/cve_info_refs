Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-2998:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by an integer underflow within the JavaScript engine (specifically SpiderMonkey v.1.9.2) during regular expression evaluation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Integer Underflow:** The `result->saveStateStackTop` variable underflows, leading to a very large memory allocation attempt. This occurs during the `PushBackTrackState` function.
*   **Memory Corruption:** The large value resulting from the underflow is used in a `memcpy` operation, leading to a memory corruption when it attempts to copy a huge chunk of memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The memory corruption caused by the underflow can lead to arbitrary code execution because the large memcpy overwrites both the stack and heap, and the data to be copied is controllable by the attacker via regular expression and string input.
*   **Crash:** The vulnerability results in a crash of the browser application due to memory corruption.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Page:** An attacker can craft a malicious web page containing a specific regular expression and string input designed to trigger the integer underflow.
*   **JavaScript:** The attack is triggered via JavaScript code within the web page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to serve a web page:** The attacker needs the ability to serve a malicious web page to a user running a vulnerable version of Firefox.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerability:** The attacker needs to know how to trigger the integer underflow in the regular expression engine.

**Technical Details:**

*   The crash occurs in the `memcpy` function when `PushBackTrackState` is called during regular expression processing.
*   The value of  `result->saveStateStackTop` becomes a large negative number due to the underflow, resulting in `memcpy` attempting to copy a very large amount of data.
*   The vulnerability was present in Firefox 3.6.21 (and likely earlier versions) based on the provided information.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in Firefox 3.6.23.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is rated as "critical".
*   The provided information includes a test case and a patch, indicating that this was a well-understood and actively exploited bug.
*   The fix was included in SUSE, Debian and other Linux distributions through a security update.
*   The bug was assigned the alias `CVE-2011-2998` in Bugzilla.
*   The affected product is primarily Firefox. Other Mozilla based products that used the vulnerable javascript engine (like Iceweasel, Icedove and Iceape) were also affected.
