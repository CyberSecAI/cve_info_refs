```
{
  "Root cause": "The Linux kernel driver for the Be file system does not validate the length attribute of a symbolic link read from a data stream. A corrupted Be file system could have a length of 0.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "Improper input validation of the symlink length.",
    "Dereference of a null pointer."
  ],
  "Impact": "Kernel oops, leading to a denial-of-service.",
  "Attack vectors": "A corrupted Be file system containing a symbolic link with a zero length attribute.",
  "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to mount a specially crafted, corrupted Be file system."
