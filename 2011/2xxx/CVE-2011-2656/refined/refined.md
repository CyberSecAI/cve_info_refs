Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-2656:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**
   - The provided content directly references CVE-2011-2656 and states that it is a remote code execution vulnerability in Novell ZENworks Handheld Management. This confirms that the content is relevant to the specified CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The root cause is not explicitly detailed in the provided text, but it mentions that the vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code.  This suggests a flaw in how the application handles remote requests or data, potentially a buffer overflow or injection vulnerability, which can be exploited to execute code.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    - Remote Code Execution: The core weakness is the ability for remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server running ZENworks Handheld Management.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could give an attacker full control over the affected system. This could lead to:
      - Data theft
      - System compromise
      - Denial of service
      - Further attacks on the internal network

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - The attack vector is a remote one, meaning that an attacker does not need to be physically present or have direct access to the server.
   - The attacker exploits a vulnerability in the software to execute code. The specific method is not given, but would involve the sending of a crafted request to the vulnerable software that contains the malicious code.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the server running the vulnerable version of ZENworks Handheld Management. No authentication requirement is detailed, which may mean the vulnerability could be accessed without credentials.
   - They require knowledge of the specific vulnerability and how to exploit it.

**Additional Notes:**
  - The content also mentions the vulnerability was reported by iDefense and discovered by Luigi Auriemma.
  - A fix is available, and it is referenced by a URL. The document explicitly mentions "ZHM 7 Remote Code Execution Vulnerability - see TID 7009489".
  - The content also refers to CVE-2011-2655, suggesting it's related, but no details are given for that CVE.

In summary, the content provides useful information about a remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2011-2656) in ZENworks Handheld Management, stating its impact, attack vectors, and remediation. It confirms the vulnerability is exploitable by remote attackers and could allow arbitrary code execution on the target system.
