Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2011-2185:

*   **Vulnerability:** Insecure temporary file creation.
*   **Affected Software:** Fabric, a Pythonic remote deployment tool.
*   **Root Cause:** The `fabric` tool creates temporary files in an insecure manner when uploading template text files and project files to a remote system. Specifically, the tool uses predictable names in world-readable and world-writable locations (e.g., `/tmp`).
    *   `fabric/contrib/projects.py`: Creates a temporary tar file in `/tmp` with a name based on the current timestamp: `tar_file = "/tmp/fab.%s.tar" % datetime.utcnow().strftime('%Y_%m_%d_%H-%M-%S')`
    *   `fabric/contrib/files.py`: Creates a temporary file in `/tmp` with the same name as the original filename: `temp_destination = '/tmp/' + basename`
*   **Attack Vector:** A local attacker can exploit this flaw by pre-creating the temporary file with a symbolic link.
*   **Impact:** The attacker can perform symlink attacks to:
    *   Upload sensitive information to a remote host that they otherwise would not have access to.
    *   Overwrite arbitrary local system files that the user invoking `fabric` has control over, potentially leading to data loss or system compromise.
*   **Affected Versions:** Fabric versions prior to 1.7.0-2. The Debian bug report indicates that the issue was fixed in version 1.7.0-2. The fix involved using `mkdtemp` for `fabric/contrib/projects.py` and the vulnerable code in `fabric/contrib/files.py` was removed.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be local to the system where `fabric` is being run.
