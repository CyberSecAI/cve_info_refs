Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-2536:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from inconsistent responses by Asterisk to SIP requests based on whether the user is valid or invalid. Specifically, when a request is received for an unregistered user (or a user for which no peer is found), Asterisk may behave differently than it does when a valid user sends an authentication request with a bad password. This discrepancy allows an attacker to discern valid users by observing these subtle differences in server behavior.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The core vulnerability is an information leak, where an attacker can enumerate valid SIP users on the Asterisk system. This is because Asterisk does not respond identically in cases of an invalid user compared to a valid user with bad credentials.
*   **Inconsistent Authentication Responses:** The primary weakness is the generation of different authentication responses or behaviors when dealing with requests for unknown users vs. requests for known users but with incorrect authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **User Enumeration:** An attacker can identify valid user accounts on the Asterisk system.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** Knowing valid usernames can be a preliminary step for further attacks like brute-force password guessing on those accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:** The attack can be carried out remotely by an attacker without any prior authentication to the system.
*   **SIP Requests:** The attack vector consists of sending crafted SIP requests to the Asterisk server.
*   **Observation of Server Responses:** The attacker observes differences in the responses from Asterisk to differentiate between known and unknown users.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Asterisk server.
*   **SIP Knowledge:** A basic understanding of SIP protocol and its authentication mechanisms is required.
*   **Ability to Send SIP Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to generate and transmit SIP requests.
*   **Ability to Analyze Responses:** The attacker must analyze server responses, noting subtle differences.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The patch focuses on ensuring that Asterisk always sends the same authentication rejection response for all users when configured to do so (using the `alwaysauthreject` option). This mitigates the information leak, by preventing the system from disclosing any information based on a user's validity.
*   The fix involves modifying the response headers and status codes used by Asterisk in situations when `alwaysauthreject` is enabled.
*   The vulnerability was present in all versions of Asterisk 1.4.x, 1.6.2.x, 1.8.x, and Business Edition C.3.x until the patched versions.
*   It is imperative that users of Asterisk 1.4 and 1.6.2 set `alwaysauthreject=yes` in `sip.conf`. Asterisk 1.8 defaults to `alwaysauthreject=yes`, but earlier versions required manual configuration to mitigate the issue.
