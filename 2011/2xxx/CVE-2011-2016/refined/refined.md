### Summary of CVE-2011-2016

The provided document is a Microsoft Security Bulletin (MS11-085) addressing a vulnerability identified as CVE-2011-2016.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how Windows Mail and Windows Meeting Space handle the loading of external DLL files. Specifically, they do not properly restrict the path used when loading these libraries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Insecure library loading: Windows Mail and Windows Meeting Space are vulnerable to loading malicious DLL files from untrusted network locations or WebDAV shares.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system.
- Full System Control: An attacker can gain complete control of the affected system, potentially leading to the installation of programs, data theft or modification, and the creation of new user accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Share/WebDAV Attack:**
    1.  The attacker places a malicious DLL file and a legitimate file (e.g., .eml or .wcinv) in a network share or WebDAV location.
    2.  The attacker convinces a user to open the legitimate file from the compromised location.
    3.  When the user opens the legitimate file, Windows Mail or Windows Meeting Space attempts to load the malicious DLL file in the same directory, executing its code.
- **Email Attachment Attack:**
    1.  The attacker sends a legitimate file (e.g., .eml or .wcinv) as an email attachment along with instructions for the user to save it into a directory with a malicious DLL file.
    2.  The user follows the instructions to save and open the file
    3.  When the user opens the legitimate file, Windows Mail or Windows Meeting Space attempts to load the malicious DLL file in the same directory, executing its code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to place a malicious DLL and a legitimate file in a location accessible to the victim user's system or to send them as an email.
- The attacker must convince the victim to open the legitimate file through social engineering or other means.

**Additional Information:**
- **Mitigation:**
    - The SMB protocol is often disabled on perimeter firewalls which reduces some of the potential attack vectors.
    - Users with standard user rights are less impacted than users with admin rights.
    - Windows Mail and Windows Meeting Space are not installed by default on Windows Server 2008.
- **Workarounds:**
    - Disable loading libraries from WebDAV and remote network shares.
    - Disable the WebClient service.
    - Block TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall.
- The vulnerability is related to the class of issues described in Microsoft Security Advisory 2269637 regarding insecure loading of external libraries.
- The severity rating is higher for Windows Vista compared to Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2, since at the time, Microsoft was not aware of any exploitation vectors for those systems. However, Microsoft still recommended applying the update to these systems as a defense-in-depth measure.
- This vulnerability only affects the Windows Mail client on the specified operating systems and no other mail clients.
