# CVE-2011-2200

| **Name** | CVE-2011-2200 |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | The \_dbus\_header\_byteswap function in dbus-marshal-header.c in D-Bus (aka DBus) 1.2.x before 1.2.28, 1.4.x before 1.4.12, and 1.5.x before 1.5.4 does not properly handle a non-native byte order, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (connection loss), obtain potentially sensitive information, or conduct unspecified state-modification attacks via crafted messages. |

```
We experience some problems with dbus. We have a java application, when the
application enters the dbus, the dbus-monitor quits. First we were thinking
that there were problems in the java bindings, but it is not.  I also
noticed the following post on this mailinglist a few years ago:
<http://web.archiveorange.com/archive/v/2mxmYltly6ixKYVh5MJe> that describes
the same problem as we have, but as we are developing on the latest debian
stable 6.0 the issue seems not to be solved, maybe because it is rarely
seen.

I start first the dbus daemon in a private session
then listen with dbus-monitor
as 3th launch the java application.

This causes the dbus-monitor to exit because of the lenghts in the fields
are not corrrect.
The java application sends following data to the dbus layer:

As you can see this is big endian

The dbus-daemon sends the same message to the monitor (who is in little
endian format)

The problem is that the lengths are in little endian but the field indicates
big endian.

This happens only with some method calls, for example the Hello call does
not have the problem. We can reproduce this 100%.

The java application we use has the following code:

import org.freedesktop.dbus.DBusConnection;
import org.freedesktop.dbus.exceptions.DBusException;

public class DbusTester {

        DBusConnection conn;

        public DbusTester(String dbusAddress) throws DBusException {
                conn = DBusConnection.getConnection(dbusAddress);
        }

        public void execute() throws Exception {
                conn.requestBusName("test.service");
                // stay alive for a while
                Thread.sleep(5000);
        }

        public void exit() {
                if (conn != null) conn.disconnect();
        }

        public static void main(String[] args) {
                DbusTester dbusTest = null;
                try {
                        if (args.length == 0) {
                                System.out.println("usage: DbusTest
<dbusAddress>");
                        }
                        dbusTest = new DbusTester(args[0]);
                        dbusTest.execute();
                }
                catch (Exception e) {
                        e.printStackTrace();
                }
                finally {
                        if (dbusTest != null) dbusTest.exit();
                }
        }
}

Subject: CVE Request -- dbus -- Local DoS via messages with non-native byte
 order

Hello, Josh, Steve, vendors,

   It was found that D-BUS message bus service / messaging facility did
not update the byte-order flag of the message properly by swapping the
byte order of incoming messages into their native endiannes. A local,
authenticated user could use this flaw to send a specially-crafted
message to a system service (like Avahi or NetworkManager), using the
system bus, potentially leading to disconnect of such a service from
system bus (denial of service).

Subject: libdbus-1-3: local DoS via messages with non-native byte order
Date: Thu, 9 Jun 2011 19:20:27 +0100
```
Package: libdbus-1-3
Version: 1.4.8-3
Severity: normal
Tags: security
Forwarded: <https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=38120>

lbdbus-1-3, used by dbus-daemon, swaps the byte-order of incoming messages
into native endianness but does not swap the byte-order mark in messages
when swapping their byte order. As a result, if a message in non-native byte
order is sent through dbus-daemon to a system service like Avahi or
NetworkManager, that system service is likely to interpret the message as
invalid and disconnect from the system bus, leading to a local DoS.

This was raised, and promptly forgotten about, in 2007 (!), so it's already
public information. A fix is awaiting review upstream.

Debian Security Team, could you allocate a CVE ID if appropriate, please?
I suspect this is a job for stable-proposed-updates rather than a DSA, though.

Regards,
    S

   * Don't delete jquery.js, no longer installed by recent Doxygen
   * Build-depend on libglib2.0-dev, libdbus-glib-1-dev for better regression
     test coverage (dbus-glib is a circular dependency, but both of these
     dependencies can be dropped if bootstrapping new architectures)

Changes:
 dbus (1.5.4-1) experimental; urgency=low
 .
   * Merge from unstable
   * New(er) upstream version fixing local DoS (Closes: #[629938](bugreport.cgi?bug=629938))
   * Revert some of the changes merged from Ubuntu, which look as though
     they shouldn't be needed on either distribution:
     - there's no need to create/chown messagebus' home directory, the sysvinit
       script and the Upstart job both do that on-demand
   * Revert changes which are useful in Ubuntu but not Debian:
     - move everything except the library back into /usr; Debian doesn't have
       any uses for dbus-daemon in early boot, and if we do later, we'd need to
       get libexpat moved first
       - this gets the locations back into sync with what it says in the
         Xsession hook (Closes: #[630011](bugreport.cgi?bug=630011)) and the init script (Closes: #[629954](bugreport.cgi?bug=629954))
   * Improve comments in postinst explaining why it behaves as it does

I've fixed this upstream and in sid and experimental. Still waiting for a
CVE ID - or should I ask for one elsewhere?

Here is a proposed stable update (either for security or stable updates),
and a test-case (marshal.c). The proposed stable update is also available
on the debian-squeeze branch in git.

The test case requires libdbus-1-dev, libdbus-glib-1-dev and libglib2.0-dev,
and can be run with:

    gcc -otest-marshal marshal.c \
        `pkg-config --cflags --libs dbus-1 dbus-glib-1 glib-2.0`
    ./test-marshal

For it to work, it must be run by a user whose home directory (according
to /etc/passwd, not $HOME) can be written.

Successful output looks like this:

    /demarshal/le: OK
    /demarshal/be: OK
    /demarshal/needed/le: OK
    /demarshal/needed/be: OK

Unsuccessful output on a little-endian architecture looks like this:

    /demarshal/le: OK
    /demarshal/be: **
    ERROR:marshal.c:193:test_endian: assertion failed (get_uint32 (output, OFFSET_BODY_LENGTH, output[0]) == 8): (134217728 == 8)
    Aborted

Big-endian architectures should fail /demarshal/le in a similar way.

(You can also unpack /usr/lib/dbus-1.0/test/test-marshal from dbus-1-dbg of
an appropriate architecture in unstable - it's the same test-case, and
should hopefully work with an older libdbus.)

Regards,
    S

Subject: CVE Request -- dbus -- Local DoS via messages with non-native byte
order
Date: Sun, 12 Jun 2011 15:01:40 +0200
```
Hello, Josh, Steve, vendors,

  It was found that D-BUS message bus service / messaging facility did
not update the byte-order flag of the message properly by swapping the
byte order of incoming messages into their native endiannes. A local,
authenticated user could use this flaw to send a specially-crafted
message to a system service (like Avahi or NetworkManager), using the
system bus, potentially leading to disconnect of such a service from
system bus (denial of service).

Could you allocate a CVE id for this?

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=712676#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-06-12 12:36:10 UTC  ``` It was found that D-BUS message bus service / messaging facility did not update the byte-order flag of the message properly by swapping the byte order of incoming messages into their native endiannes. A local, authenticated user could use this flaw to send a specially-crafted message to a system service (like Avahi or NetworkManager), using the system bus, potentially leading to disconnect of such a service from system bus (denial of service).

Dependencies:  • The version of GLib required for some of the regression tests has   increased to 2.24.  Changes:  • Make dbus-protocol.h compatible with C++11 (fd.o #46147, Marc Mutz)  • Use GLib 2.31.x thread API, with backwards compatibility to 2.24,   fixing compiler warnings and link failure when using 2.32   (fd.o #44413, Debian #665665; Martin Pitt)  • Enumerate data files included in the build rather than using find(1)   (fd.o #33840, Simon McVittie)  • Windows-specific:   · fix duplicate case value when compiling against mingw-w64     (fd.o #47321, Andoni Morales Alastruey)  D-Bus 1.4.18 (2012-02-13) ==  The "snow in Brussels" release  • Allow all configured auth mechanisms, not just one (fd.o #45106,   Pavel Strashkin)  • Improve cmake build system (Ralf Habacker):   · simplify XML parser dependencies (fd.o #41027)   · generate build timestamp (fd.o #41029)   · only create batch files on Windows   · fix option and cache syntax   · add help-options target   · share dbus-arch-deps.h.in with autotools rather than having our     own version (fd.o #41033)  • Build tests successfully with older GLib, as found in e.g. Debian 6   (fd.o #41219, Simon McVittie)  • Build documentation correctly if man2html doesn't support filenames on   its command-line (fd.o #43875, Jack Nagel)  • Unix-specific:   · Avoid a highly unlikely fd leak (fd.o #29881, Simon McVittie)   · Don't close invalid fd -1 if getaddrinfo fails (fd.o #37258, eXeC001er)   · Don't touch ~/.dbus and ~/.dbus-keyrings when running 'make installcheck'     (fd.o #41218, Simon McVittie)  • Windows-specific:   · Find the dbus-daemon executable next to the shared library (fd.o #41558;     Jesper Dam, Ralf Habacker)  D-Bus 1.4.16 (2011-09-21) ==  The "this answerphone fails to answer the phone" release.  • If full test coverage is requested via --enable-tests, strictly require   Python, pygobject and dbus-python, which are required by some tests; if not,   and Python is missing, skip those tests rather than failing   (fd.o #37847, Simon McVittie)  • When using cmake, provide the same version-info API in the installed headers   as for autotools (DBUS_VERSION, etc.) (fd.o #40905, Ralf Habacker)  • Add a regression test for fd.o #38005 (fd.o #39836, Simon McVittie)  • Make "NOCONFIGURE=1 ./autogen.sh" not run configure (Colin Walters)  • Add _DBUS_STATIC_ASSERT and use it to check invariants (fd.o #39636,   Simon McVittie)  • Fix duplicates in authors list (Ralf Habacker)  • Fix broken links from dbus-tutorial.html if $(htmldir) != $(docdir)   (fd.o #39879, Chris Mayo)  • Fix a small memory leak, and a failure to report errors, when updating   a service file entry for activation (fd.o #39230, Simon McVittie)  • Unix-specific:   · Clean up (non-abstract) Unix sockets on bus daemon exit (fd.o #38656;     Brian Cameron, Simon McVittie)   · On systems that use libcap-ng but not systemd, drop supplemental groups     when switching to the daemon user (Red Hat #726953, Steve Grubb)   · Make the cmake build work again on GNU platforms (fd.o #29228,     Simon McVittie)   · Fix compilation on non-C99 systems that have inttypes.h but not stdint.h,     like Solaris (fd.o #40313, Dagobert Michelsen)   · Define CMSG_ALIGN, CMSG_LEN, CMSG_SPACE on Solaris < 10     (fd.o #40235, Simon McVittie)   · Cope with Unixes that don't have LOG_PERROR, like Solaris 10     (fd.o #39987, Simon McVittie)   · Cope with platforms whose vsnprintf violates both POSIX and C99, like     Tru64, IRIX and HP-UX (fd.o #11668, Simon McVittie)  • Windows-specific:   · Fix compilation on MSVC, which doesn't understand "inline" with its     C99 meaning (fd.o #40000; Ralf Habacker, Simon McVittie)   · Fix misuse of GPid in test/dbus-daemon.c (fd.o #40003, Simon McVittie)  D-Bus 1.4.14 (2011-07-29) ==  The "Puny receptacle!" release.  Changes:  • Use DBUS_ERROR_OBJECT_PATH_IN_USE if dbus_connection_try_register_object_path   or dbus_connection_try_register_fallback fails, not ...ADDRESS_IN_USE   (fd.o #38874, Jiří Klimeš)  • Consistently use atomic operations on everything that is ever manipulated   via atomic ops, as was done for changes to DBusConnection's refcount in   1.4.12 (fd.o #38005, Simon McVittie)  • Fix a file descriptor leak when connecting to a TCP socket (fd.o #37258,   Simon McVittie)  • Make "make check" in a clean tree work, by not running tests until   test data has been set up (fd.o #34405, Simon McVittie)  • Fix various typos (fd.o #27227, fd.o #38284; Sascha Silbe, Simon McVittie)  • Documentation (fd.o #36156, Simon McVittie):   · let xsltproc be overridden as usual: ./configure XSLTPROC=myxsltproc   · install more documentation automatically, including man2html output   · put dbus.devhelp in the right place (it must go in ${htmldir})  • Unix-specific:   · look for system services in /lib/dbus-1/system-services in addition to all     the other well-known locations; note that this should always be /lib,     even on platforms where shared libraries on the root FS would go in /lib64,     /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu or similar (fd.o #35229, Lennart Poettering)   · opt-in to fd passing on Solaris (fd.o #33465, Simon McVittie)  • Windows-specific (Ralf Habacker):   · fix use of a mutex for autolaunch server detection   · don't crash on malloc failure in _dbus_printf_string_upper_bound  D-Bus 1.4.12 (2011-06-10) ==  Security (local denial of service):  • Byte-swap foreign-endian messages correctly, preventing a long-standing   local DoS if foreign-endian messages are relayed through the dbus-daemon   (backporters: this is git commit c3223ba6c401ba81df1305851312a47c485e6cd7)   (CVE-2011-2200, fd.o #38120, Debian #629938; Simon McVittie)  New things:  • The constant to use for an infinite timeout now has a name,   DBUS_TIMEOUT_INFINITE. It is numerically equivalent to 0x7fffffff (INT32_MAX)   which can be used for source compatibility with older versions of libdbus.  • If GLib and DBus-GLib are already installed, more tests will be built,   providing better coverage. The new tests can also be installed via       ./configure --enable-installed-tests   for system integration testing, if required. (fd.o #34570, Simon McVittie)  Changes:  • Consistently use atomic operations for the DBusConnection's refcount,   fixing potential threading problems (fd.o #38005, Simon McVittie)  • Don't use -Wl,--gc-sections by default: in practice the size decrease is   small (300KiB on x86-64) and it frequently doesn't work in unusual   toolchains. To optimize for minimum installed size, you should benchmark   various possibilities for CFLAGS and LDFLAGS, and set the best flags for   your particular toolchain at configure time. (fd.o #33466, Simon McVittie)  • Use #!/bin/sh for run-with-tmp-session-bus.sh, making it work on *BSD   (fd.o #35880, Timothy Redaelli)  • Use ln -fs to set up dbus for systemd, which should fix reinstallation   when not using a DESTDIR (fd.o #37870, Simon McVittie)  • Windows-specific changes:   · don't try to build dbus-daemon-launch-helper (fd.o #37838, Mark Brand)  D-Bus 1.4.10 (2011-06-01) ==  The "Ape Ale" release.  Notes for distributors:    This version of D-Bus no longer uses -fPIE by default. Distributions wishing   to harden the dbus-daemon and dbus-launch-helper can re-enable this if their   toolchain supports it reliably, via something like:      ./configure CFLAGS=-fPIE LDFLAGS="-pie -Wl,-z,relro"    or by using distribution-specific wrappers such as Debian's hardening-wrapper.  Changes:    • Don't force -fPIE: distributions and libtool know better than we do whether     it's desirable (fd.o #16621, fd.o #27215; Simon McVittie)   • Allow --disable-gc-sections, in case your toolchain offers the     -ffunction-sections, -fdata-sections and -Wl,--gc-sections options     but they're broken, as seen on Solaris (fd.o #33466, Simon McVittie)   • Install dbus-daemon and dbus-daemon-launch-helper in a more normal way     (fd.o #14512; Simon McVittie, loosely based on a patch from Luca Barbato)   • Ensure that maintainers upload documentation with the right permissions     (fd.o #36130, Simon McVittie)   • Log system-bus activation information to syslog (fd.o #35705,     Colin Walters)   • Log messages dropped due to quotas to syslog (fd.o #35358,     Simon McVittie)   • Make the nonce-tcp transport work on Unix (fd.o #34569, Simon McVittie)   • On Unix, if /var/lib/dbus/machine-id cannot be read, try /etc/machine-id     (fd.o #35228, Lennart Poettering)   • In the regression tests, don't report fds as "leaked" if they were open     on startup (fd.o #35173, Simon McVittie)   • Make dbus-monitor bail out if asked to monitor more than one bus,     rather than silently using the last one (fd.o #26548, Will Thompson)   • Clarify documentation (fd.o #35182, Simon McVittie)   • Clean up minor dead code and some incorrect error handling     (fd.o #33128, fd.o #29881; Simon McVittie)   • Check that compiler options are supported before using them (fd.o #19681,     Simon McVittie)   • Windows:     • Remove obsolete workaround for winioctl.h (fd.o #35083, Ralf Habacker)  D-Bus 1.4.8 (2011-04-08) ==  The "It's like the beginning of a lobster" release.    • Rename configure.in to configure.ac, and update it to modern conventions     (fd.o #32245; Javier Jardón, Simon McVittie)   • Correctly give XDG_DATA_HOME priority over XDG_DATA_DIRS (fd.o #34496,     Anders Kaseorg)   • Prevent X11 autolaunching if $DISPLAY is unset or empty, and add     --disable-x11-autolaunch configure option to prevent it altogether     in embedded environments (fd.o #19997, NB#219964; Simon McVittie)   • Install the documentation, and an index for Devhelp (fd.o #13495,     Debian #454142; Simon McVittie, Matthias Clasen)   • If checks are not disabled, check validity of string-like types and     booleans when sending them (fd.o #16338, NB#223152; Simon McVittie)   • Add UnknownObject, UnknownInterface, UnknownProperty and PropertyReadOnly     errors to dbus-shared.h (fd.o #34527, Lennart Poettering)   • Break up a huge conditional in config-parser so gcov can produce coverage     data (fd.o #10887, Simon McVittie)   • List which parts of the Desktop Entry specification are applicable to     .service files (fd.o #19159, Sven Herzberg)   • Don't suppress service activation if two services have the same Exec=     (fd.o #35750, Colin Walters)   • Windows:     · Avoid the name ELEMENT_TYPE due to namespace-pollution from winioctl.h       (Andre Heinecke)     · Include _dbus_path_is_absolute in libdbus on Windows, fixing compilation       (fd.o #32805, Mark Brand)  D-Bus 1.4.6 (2010-02-17) ==  The "1, 2, miss a few, 99, 100" release.    • Remove unfinished changes intended to support GTest-based tests,     which were mistakenly included in 1.4.4  D-Bus 1.4.4 (2010-02-17) ==    • Switch back to using even micro versions for stable releases; 1.4.1     should have been called 1.4.2, so skip that version number   • Don't leave bad file descriptors being watched when spawning processes,     which could result in a busy-loop (fd.o #32992, NB#200248; possibly     also LP#656134, LP#680444, LP#713157)   • Check for MSG_NOSIGNAL correctly   • Fix failure to detect abstract socket support (fd.o #29895)   • Make _dbus_system_logv actually exit with DBUS_SYSTEM_LOG_FATAL     (fd.o #32262, NB#180486)   • Improve some error code paths (fd.o #29981, fd.o #32264, fd.o #32262,     fd.o #33128, fd.o #33277, fd.o #33126, NB#180486)   • Avoid possible symlink attacks in /tmp during compilation (fd.o #32854)   • Tidy up dead code (fd.o #25306, fd.o #33128, fd.o #34292, NB#180486)   • Improve gcc malloc annotations (fd.o #32710)   • If the system bus is launched via systemd, protect it from the OOM killer   • Documentation improvements (fd.o #11190)   • Avoid readdir_r, which is difficult to use correctly (fd.o #8284,     fd.o #15922, LP#241619)   • Cope with invalid files in session.d, system.d (fd.o #19186,     Debian #230231)   • Don't distribute generated files that embed our builddir (fd.o #30285,     fd.o #34292)   • Raise the system bus's fd limit to be sufficient for its configuration     (fd.o #33474, LP#381063)   • Fix syslog string processing   • Ignore -Waddress   • Remove broken gcov parsing code and --enable-gcov, and replace them     with lcov HTML reports and --enable-compiler-coverage (fd.o #10887)   • Windows:     · avoid live-lock in Windows CE due to unfair condition variables   • OpenBSD:     · support credentials-passing (fd.o #32542)   • Solaris:     · opt-in to thread safety (fd.o #33464)  D-Bus 1.4.1 (20 December 2010) ==   • Fix for CVE-2010-4352: sending messages with excessively-nested variants can    crash the bus. The existing restriction to 64-levels of nesting previously    only applied to the static type signature; now it also applies to dynamic    nesting using variants. Thanks to Rémi Denis-Courmont for discoving this    issue.  • OS X portability fixes, including launchd support.  • Windows autolaunch improvements.  • Various bug fixes.  D-Bus 1.4.0 (6 Sep 2010) ==  - systemd hookup  D-Bus 1.3.1 (23 June 2010) ==  - New standardized PropertiesChanged signal in the properties interface  - Various portability fixes, in particular to Windows platforms  - Support forking bus services, for compatibility  D-Bus 1.3.0 (29 July 2009) ==  - ability for dbus-send to send to any bus (--address)  - file descriptor passing on Unix socket transports  - use of GCC atomic intrinsics for better processor support    (requires -march=i486 or above for x86 compilation)  - thread-safe FD_CLOEXEC setting on recent Linux kernels (2.6.24-27 and up)    and glibc (2.9 for pipe2 and 2.10 for accept4)  - feature negotiation in the bus daemon  ``` |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=38120#c0)  Simon McVittie    2011-06-09 09:51:42 UTC  ``` As described in (at least) these mailing list messages:  <http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/dbus/2007-March/007357.html> <http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/dbus/2011-May/014408.html>  when libdbus byteswaps a message into native order, it doesn't alter byte 0 of the fixed header (the byte order). Normally this is harmless, but if you're going to forward the message to another connection (e.g. you are dbus-daemon), badness occurs.  If someone had opened a bug back in 2007, this might have been fixed by now. Or maybe not.  I believe I've fixed this (the fix that Havoc suggested in 2007 looks obviously-correct), but I'm going to construct a test-case so this doesn't come back. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=38120#c1)  Simon McVittie    2011-06-09 10:38:37 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 47779](attachment.cgi?id=47779 "_dbus_header_byteswap: change the first byte of the  message, not just the struct member") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=47779&action=edit "_dbus_header_byteswap: change the first byte of the  message, not just the struct member") [[review]](page.cgi?id=splinter.html&bug=38120&attachment=47779) _dbus_header_byteswap: change the first byte of the  message, not just the struct member  This has been wrong approximately forever, for instance see: <http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/dbus/2007-March/007357.html> ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=38120#c2)  Simon McVittie    2011-06-09 10:41:12 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 47780](attachment.cgi?id=47780 "Add a test for marshalling and endian-swapping") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=47780&action=edit "Add a test for marshalling and endian-swapping") [[review]](page.cgi?id=splinter.html&bug=38120&attachment=47780) Add a test for marshalling and endian-swapping  This requires the infrastructure from [Bug #34570](show_bug.cgi?id=34570 "RESOLVED FIXED - simple end-to-end integration tests"). ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=38120#c3)  Simon McVittie    2011-06-09 10:42:06 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 47781](attachment.cgi?id=47781 "dbus_message_demarshal_bytes_needed: correct a wrong  assertion") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=47781&action=edit "dbus_message_demarshal_bytes_needed: correct a wrong  assertion") [[review]](page.cgi?id=splinter.html&bug=38120&attachment=47781) dbus_message_demarshal_bytes_needed: correct a wrong  assertion  It's entirely possible for a message to indicate how many bytes we need, without actually being complete.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).

# D-Bus daemon endianness issue

```
The libdbus daemon seems to send malformed messages claiming to be
big-endian but containing little-endian values under certain conditions.

This pseudo-code triggers the bug on my x86 system when the client
library is made to send big-endian messages:

   Connection bus = Bus.Session;
   bus.AddMatch ("type='method_call'");
   Message msg = bus.ReadMessage ();

The fixed part of the message header returned by dbus-daemon at
ReadMessage () is:

"B\1\0\1\27\0\0\0\2\0\0\0\217\0\0\0"

You can see the big-endian flag at the start yet the uint values are
clearly little-endian.

The array of variants keyed by field codes in the header is the same:

"\1\1o\0\25\0\0\0/org/freedesktop/DBus\0\0\0\2\1s\0\24\0\0\0org.freedesktop.DBus\0\0\0\0\3\1s\0\10\0\0\0AddMatch\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\6\1s\0\24\0\0\0org.freedesktop.DBus\0\0\0\0\10\1g\0\1s\0\0\7\1s\0\6\0\0\0:1.196\0\0"

For the benefit of those who don't hack D-Bus, this is the managed
(<http://www.ndesk.org/DBusSharp>) form of this serialized structure:

   struct Header
   {
     public EndianFlag Endianness;
     public MessageType MessageType;
     public HeaderFlag Flags;
     public byte MajorVersion;
     public uint Length;
     public uint Serial;
     public IDictionary<FieldCode,object> Fields;
   }

The message body is also little-endian:

"\22\0\0\0type=\'method_call\'\0"

Adding match rules for signals works fine though, and the signal
messages are provided in the endianness in which they were sent. This is
probably the expected behaviour for the currently broken method_call case.

This is crippling for any dbus-monitor tool that uses network byte order
on a little-endian system. It may also affect interoperability between
platforms.

It may be possible not only to crash others' connections to the bus in
some configurations, but also to use a carefully crafted sequence of
messages to place applications in an unexpected state. Constructing a
message with a spoofed body length large enough to cause the client
library to read the content of the following message comes to mind. The
content of the following message could be parsed as part of the original
message given a byte array signature, providing a way to obtain the full
headers and bodies of arbitrary messages from, say, a forwarding daemon.

```
