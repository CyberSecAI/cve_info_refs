    "description": "The _dbus_header_byteswap function in dbus-marshal-header.c in D-Bus (aka DBus) 1.2.x before 1.2.28, 1.4.x before 1.4.12, and 1.5.x before 1.5.4 does not properly handle a non-native byte order, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (connection loss), obtain potentially sensitive information, or conduct unspecified state-modification attacks via crafted messages.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The `_dbus_header_byteswap` function in `dbus-marshal-header.c` doesn't correctly update the byte-order flag in the message header when swapping byte order of incoming messages.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of non-native byte order in message header byte-swapping"
      ],
      "impact": "A local, authenticated user can send a specially crafted message to a system service via the system bus, causing the service to disconnect (denial of service), potentially obtain sensitive information, or conduct state-modification attacks.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "Sending crafted D-Bus messages with a non-native byte order."
