Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2011-2703:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- Insufficient escaping of user-supplied input when processing OGC filter encodings.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **SQL Injection:** The lack of proper sanitization allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code through OGC filter parameters. This affects WMS, WFS, and SOS filters, which are used in MapServer to query spatial data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to:
    - Access unauthorized data.
    - Modify or delete database records.
    - Potentially execute arbitrary code on the database server (depending on database setup).

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector involves sending crafted requests to the MapServer instance. These requests would contain malicious SQL code embedded within OGC filter parameters in WMS, WFS, or SOS requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the MapServer instance. No special privileges are required beyond being able to reach the vulnerable service.
-  A basic understanding of SQL and OGC filter encoding is needed to craft malicious payloads.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
- Multiple SQL injection flaws exist, affecting different versions of MapServer (4.x, 5.x, and 6.x).
- This vulnerability is present in MapServer instances with OGC protocols enabled, where layers connect to an SQL RDBMS backend, either natively or via OGR.
- The vulnerability is addressed in mapserver version 5.0.3-3+lenny7 for the oldstable distribution (lenny), and version 5.6.5-2+squeeze2 for the stable distribution (squeeze).
