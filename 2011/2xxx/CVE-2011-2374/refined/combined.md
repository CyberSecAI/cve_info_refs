The oldstable distribution (lenny) is not affected. The iceape
package only provides the XPCOM code.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.11-6.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.14-3.

We recommend that you upgrade your iceape packages.

I think the valgrind log shows mainly that the crash is a result of the unbalanced update count that the earlier assertions were reporting.

The interesting parts are:
frame #61-#58, where we enter an update on the inner document and then execute script (which basically means we've lost already, as far as I can tell)
frame #34-#33, where a flush on the inner document chains up to a flush on the outer document (but script could have happily done that on its own)
frame #31, where we enter an update on the outer frame constructor
frame #14, in which we destroy the inner frame that we're in an update in from frame #61

By "lost already" I'm speaking in terms of hitting the "dying in the middle of our own update" assertion, which isn't necessarily the main problem, though.

That said, I guess it's the second assertion (and later) that are more important, since they're the ones that are showing unbalanced update counts.

Based on the crash stack and the nice assertions in [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=645572#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - Crash in xul!nsBlockInFlowLineIterator::nsBlockInFlowLineIterator [@ nsLineBox::IndexOf ] [@ nsLineBox::IndexOf(nsIFrame*) ]"), what happens here is this (with very high probability; I have not verified this in any way, but it's clearly what's happening):
1) BeginUpdate from NodeUtils calls BeginUpdate on the presshell and frame
constructor.
2) Pop off removable script blockers, run mutation event, this blows away the
presshell and creates a new one, with a new frame constructor.
3) EndUpdate from NodeUtils calls EndUpdate on the new presshell and new frame
constructor. Frame constructor asserts and ends up with
mUpdateCount == -1.
4) Restyle processing begins and calls BeginUpdate on the frame constructor;
mUpdateCount == 0.
5) During restyle processing we destroy a text input's frame.
nsTextEditorState::UnbindFromFrame does some stuff inside an update
(probably a possible state change notification?) when it stashes away the
current value. mUpdateCount goes to 1 while inside this update.
6) The editor update ends, mUpdateCount goes to 0, and the frame constructor
rebuilds quotes stuff while the frame tree is in the middle of being
destroyed. Then we lose. I see a crash locally (on Linux) on
nsIFrame::GetNextSibling where |this| is ARENA\_POISON, so it's at least a
safe crash.
Jonas, I think the only reasonably solution here is that when removable script blockers due to auto updates are popped we need to make the corresponding EndUpdate calls. When they're repushed we need to make the corresponding BeginUpdate calls.

|  | |

And in particular, we know that it's an UPDATE\_CONTENT\_MODEL if the script blocker is removable. So all we \_really\_ need to keep track of is the right document, if any... Jonas, how much pain would it be to keep track of removable script blockers as a stack of nsIDocument pointers as opposed to a counter? The counter would just be the stack length, then.
God, I hate mutation events.

Indeed. More importantly, I'm not sure whether that solution is ok for branches, safety-wise. Might be safer to just ignore EndUpdate on the frame constructor when mUpdateCount == 0 instead.

Porting that solution to branches really scares me.

I don't know exactly... is it possible for the changed EndUpdate logic to screw us over in another way, by EndUpdate being ignored when it shouldn't be, for example?

That said, I'd rather get the branch fix on trunk first, let it bake for a while to make sure that it's safe for branches, then port it to branches, back it out from trunk, and land this fix on trunk.
Ideally, it should all happen before the 2.2 cut-off date (April 12th).

We should probably go with asserts(0-99) on branches, as we don't really care how many assertions this test case generates with the branch fix.
It generates no assertions with the trunk fix, as expected.

Trunk fix
Why does testing the total update nesting level against the removable script blocker level make sense?

Because we don't want the mUpdateNestLevel value in nsDocuments to be negative.

OK, but we shouldn't call EndUpdate more times than there were \_content\_ update batches, not total update batches. I think it'd make more sense to explicitly count the UPDATE\_CONTENT\_MODEL nesting level on the document, expose it via a getter, and just EndUpdate that many times.
Another question. Can we have nested removable blockers for different documents? We need to end updates on \_all\_ documents in this situation, not just the one the removable blocker remover is for.... Jonas?
Oh, and the mObserver stuff should be able to go away with the new setup, I think, since we'll now be notifying the sink via the normal path through the document.

So, in a face-to-face chat, we decided to take the branch fix for 5, and land the more comprehensive ("trunk") fix in 6. Here's the simpler fix for 5: <<http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/0a780111aacb>>

We should probably spin the more comprehensive fix into a separate bug....

The patches in [bug 650493](/show_bug.cgi?id=650493 "RESOLVED FIXED - Simplify mutation events and userdata handlers") should provide a better solution than the Trunk fix patch here, right? Could we hold off landing this patch unless it turns out the patches over there won't work for some reason? If so, I'll take this off my review queue.

I think so.
Just to make sure, if you have a build with those patches handy, could you please backout my fix ([comment 30](/show_bug.cgi?id=645572#c30 "RESOLVED FIXED - Crash in xul!nsBlockInFlowLineIterator::nsBlockInFlowLineIterator [@ nsLineBox::IndexOf ] [@ nsLineBox::IndexOf(nsIFrame*) ]")) locally and see what happens with the test case?
If things are looking good, I'd like to add a patch to [bug 650493](/show_bug.cgi?id=650493 "RESOLVED FIXED - Simplify mutation events and userdata handlers") which backs out my patch here, since it's not good for us to keep such a badly looking wallpaper too long in the tree.

Yup, the no assertions or crashes with the patches in [bug 650493](/show_bug.cgi?id=650493 "RESOLVED FIXED - Simplify mutation events and userdata handlers") applied and the patch here backed out. I'll attach a patch there and ask you for review.

We only plan on building future 1.9.2 builds so you don't need to land on 1.9.1 or mozilla2.0 unless you want to for consistency.

Could be bad, if it's crashing because mBrowserChrome is pointing at a deleted object. If we happened to get some readable memory we'd next try to call a function pointer on it.Whiteboard: [sg:critical?]

Justin says he can have a look at the memory management code around nsBarProp, but given the lack of a reproducable testcase that may or may not revile anything here...Assignee: nobody → justin.lebar+bug

I think the crashing JS may be in nsSessionStore.js:
var hidden = WINDOW\_HIDEABLE\_FEATURES.filter(function(aItem) {
return aWindow[aItem] && !aWindow[aItem].visible;
});
...there just aren't too many places where we touch this property, afacit.
Still not sure what the problem is, though.

If this is indeed where we're dying, the fact that the fault is on the visible call indicates that the window probably wasn't destroyed, no? That would be an interesting state of affairs...

[Fix? v1](attachment.cgi?id=527660&action=diff) (obsolete)

— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=642338&attachment=527660)

Looking more closely at the stack trace, this appears to be a use-after-free of nsBarProp::mBrowserChrome, since this frame
0 xul.dll nsBarProp::GetVisibleByFlag dom/base/nsBarProps.cpp:93
corresponds to this code
NS\_ENSURE\_SUCCESS(mBrowserChrome->GetChromeFlags(&chromeFlags),
NS\_ERROR\_FAILURE);
and mBrowserChrome is a raw pointer.
It's not clear to me how we get into the situation where mBrowserChrome is dangling, but it's easy enough to stick a weak reference in there. We could push to m-c and see if this fixes the crash.

This shows a problem :( Need to implement nsISupportsWeakReference
in all the relevant places.
But I guess there aren't too many implementations for nsIDocsShellTreeOwner.
nsDocShellTreeOwner and nsChromeTreeOwner do already implement weakref.
Have you made sure other implementations (if there are any other) implement weakref?
And the stale pointer can be there if the pointer isn't cleared properly.
Are we not calling nsGlobalWindow::SetDocShell() always?

I looked through the results of
hg locate \*.h | xargs grep 'public nsIWebBrowserChrome'
and checked that all the resulting classes implement nsSupportsWeakReference. Are there other classes I need to check?

Actually, would it better to move the members of nsScrollbarsProp to nsBarProp
and then get browserchrome from window's docshell.

Not sure if that was a question. :)
nsScrollbarsProp is the only one which gets a reference to the global window in its constructor, so as it is, I think it makes sense to keep the global window pointers on nsScrollbarsProp rather than move them to nsBarProp.
Is there a good reason not to leave things as they are?

IMO, all the "bars" are properties of nsGlobalWindow and should get data from
there. And nsGlobalWindow does already implement weakref and has
GetWebBrowserChrome(...), so why not just reuse that all.
No need to add assumption that nsIDocShellTreeOwner implementation
must implement also weakref.

Short of testing that window.statusbar is defined (and, somewhat surprisingly, I see nothing which checks this), what do you think needs testing?

perhaps you could add a test which opens two windows, one
with menubar, one without and check that window.menubar.visible has the
correct value.
Same with others, although I don't know if statusbar.visible is ever
true, and I have no idea what personalbar is :)

Okay, added tests.
How do we want to manage landing this? Should I just push to m-c and watch crashstats to see if the problem goes away, or do we want to land on branches immediately to minimize exposure if someone figures out how to exploit this?

Fix? v3
This applies with only trivial modifications to mozilla-aurora and mozilla-2.0, so requesting approval for those branches. I'll post patches for mozilla-1.9.2 and 1.9.1.

The 1.9.2 fix is the same as the previous fixes; it just needs a different patch because of whitespace conflicts in nsGlobalWindow.cpp.

Mozilla isn't planning on shipping a 3.5.20 so you don't actually need to check this in. Maybe the distros will want it though.

This one depends on a pref in firefox.js, so the test only passes on Firefox.
>+ is(w.statusbar.visible, true, "statusbar");
This one is OK because it's in all.js which all apps share.

If not, I'll review a patch to modify the test so it checks the pref before the is() call.

Let's see about that in [bug 653996](/show_bug.cgi?id=653996 "RESOLVED WORKSFORME - [SeaMonkey] mochitests-2: \"test_window_bar.html | locationbar - got false, expected true\", since landing this test").
Unrelated to SeaMonkey decision, a Core test should not rely on a Firefox/application specific preference: this test should be fixed anyway.

To be explicit, is() check is fine in both cases, but its expected value should simply depend on "dom.disable\_window\_open\_feature.location"(!?) preference value.

I don't mind if the powers that be agree to move the preference from firefox.js to all.js, but I don't see the point of duplicating it in our prefs.

1. <http://www.arlovance.com/>
2. sometimes crash.
I haven't been able to reproduce locally on Mac OS X or Windows XP, but the automation has so far crashed on Windows 7 32bit, Fedora 14 32bit and 64bit. I have been able to reproduce locally on Fedora 14 32bit especially when running under gdb. I wasn't able to crash a nightly Linux build however. YMMV.

We really need to capture testcases for this one. Is this a bunch of different crashes at the same site, or are we so screwed up we can crash in such different places. Is it UTF8 conversion or Fonts that are the problem?Keywords: [testcase-wanted](/buglist.cgi?keywords=testcase-wanted&resolution=---)Whiteboard: [sg:critical?]

Is this still an issue on trunk? I don't see how we could hit a crash like this now that [bug 623711](/show_bug.cgi?id=623711 "RESOLVED FIXED - erratic font selection with multiple @font-face rules and bad font resources") has landed. ([Bug 650639](/show_bug.cgi?id=650639 "RESOLVED FIXED - Firefox 6.0a1 Crash [@ nsUserFontSet::ReplaceFontEntry ]") could be a more recent but somewhat similar scenario, but I believe that is now fixed as well.)

My guess is that this is [bug 650639](/show_bug.cgi?id=650639 "RESOLVED FIXED - Firefox 6.0a1 Crash [@ nsUserFontSet::ReplaceFontEntry ]") but I'll see if I can reproduce this with builds prior to that fix to try and confirm this.

Looks like this was fixed by the checkin for [bug 650639](/show_bug.cgi?id=650639 "RESOLVED FIXED - Firefox 6.0a1 Crash [@ nsUserFontSet::ReplaceFontEntry ]"), which landed on 4/27 at 22:14 PDT.
Running on Windows 7 with the 64-bit binary with the startup page set to www.arlovance.com. Page uses typekit, and includes some custom swizzling behavior for FF to hide font loads for 3 seconds (not necessary in FF4 and above).

If I'm understanding correctly, this is a crash signature that you could have gotten from [bug 650639](/show_bug.cgi?id=650639 "RESOLVED FIXED - Firefox 6.0a1 Crash [@ nsUserFontSet::ReplaceFontEntry ]") in debug builds because of the userfont logging code that tries to access the font family name; in builds without logging, you'd see the ReplaceFontEntry crash signature instead.

That makes sense.
I verified that the changeset for [bug 650639](/show_bug.cgi?id=650639 "RESOLVED FIXED - Firefox 6.0a1 Crash [@ nsUserFontSet::ReplaceFontEntry ]") is the precise point at which the fix landed. Using tinderbox builds from:
ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/tinderbox-builds/mozilla-central-win32/
The submit time on the checkin is 1303967711. Comparing with the build just before it, 1303949796, the crash occurs with the build before the checkin but not after.
Mark as a duplicate? Sounds like we need to land the fixes for [bug 650639](/show_bug.cgi?id=650639 "RESOLVED FIXED - Firefox 6.0a1 Crash [@ nsUserFontSet::ReplaceFontEntry ]") (and 623711) on 4.x/Aurora ASAP.

Marking this depend on [bug 650639](/show_bug.cgi?id=650639 "RESOLVED FIXED - Firefox 6.0a1 Crash [@ nsUserFontSet::ReplaceFontEntry ]") since that's where the fix is, but keeping this bug open for its testcase so it gets verified as a security bug when fixed.blocking2.0: --- → -

Is PR\_LOGging enabled in non-debug builds in this module? This patch looks like it applies to the 1.9.2 branch and we don't want to 0-day ourselves by fixing it only in Fx5 if there's a security bug here on branches too.blocking1.9.2: --- → ?

It looks like unless you configure with --disable-logging, the MOZ\_LOGGING symbol will be defined, and this will enable PR\_LOGging here. And trying it with a copy of Fx3.6.17 here confirms that logging in the userfonts module is enabled.
So yes, we probably want to take this on 1.9.2 as well. In any case, I don't see any risk in the patch; it's a clear and simple fix.

firefox security and bug fix update (RHSA-2011-0885)

Original Release Date: July 19, 2011

Last Revised: April 5, 2012

Number: ASA-2011-207

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 2.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

Mozilla Firefox is an open source web browser. XULRunner provides the XUL
Runtime environment for Mozilla Firefox.

A flaw was found in the way Firefox handled malformed JPEG images. A
website containing a malicious JPEG image could cause Firefox to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2011-2377](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-2377.html) to this issue.

Multiple dangling pointer flaws were found in Firefox. A web page
containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or, potentially,
execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Firefox.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names [CVE-2011-0083](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0083.html), [CVE-2011-0085](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0085.html) and [CVE-2011-2363](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-2363.html) to these issues.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names [CVE-2011-2364](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-2364.html), [CVE-2011-2365](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-2365.html), [CVE-2011-2374](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-2374.html), [CVE-2011-2375](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-2375.html) and [CVE-2011-2376](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-2376.html) to these issues.

An integer overflow flaw was found in the way Firefox handled JavaScript
Array objects. A website containing malicious JavaScript could cause
Firefox to execute that JavaScript with the privileges of the user running
Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2011-2371](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-2371.html) to this issue.

A use-after-free flaw was found in the way Firefox handled malformed
JavaScript. A website containing malicious JavaScript could cause Firefox
to execute that JavaScript with the privileges of the user running Firefox.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2011-2373](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-2373.html) to this issue.

It was found that Firefox could treat two separate cookies as
interchangeable if both were for the same domain name but one of those
domain names had a trailing "." character. This violates the same-origin
policy and could possibly lead to data being leaked to the wrong domain.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2011-2362](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-2362.html) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security advisory issued by Red Hat:

## 2. Avaya System Products using a modified version of RHEL with affected packages installed: | Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | Avaya IQ | 4.x, 5.x | None | See Mitigating Factors table below. | | Avaya Message Networking | 5.2 thru 5.2.3 | Low | Upgrade to Message Networking 5.2.4 or later. | | Avaya Messaging Storage Server | 4.0, 5.2 thru 5.2.9 | Low | Upgrade to Messaging Storage Server 5.2.10 or later. | | Avaya Aura® Presence Services | 6.0, 6.1, 6.1.1 | None | Upgrade to Presence Services 6.1.2 or later. See Mitigating Factors table below. | | Avaya Aura® Session Manager | 1.1, 5.x, 6.0.x, 6.1.x | None | Upgrade to Session Manager 6.2 or later. See Mitigating Factors table below. | | Avaya Aura® System Manager | 5.x, 6.x | None | See Mitigating Factors table below. |

**Recommended Actions for System Products:**
Avaya strongly recommends that customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place, risk to Avaya
products and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as an Avaya provided
product update or the recommended Avaya action is applied.
Further restrictions as deemed necessary based on the
customer's security policies may be required during this
interim period, but customers should not modify the System Product
operating system or application unless the change is approved by Avaya.
Making changes that are not approved may void the Avaya product service contract.

### Mitigating Factors:

When determining risk, Avaya takes into account many factors as
outlined by Avaya's
[Security Vulnerability Classification Policy](https://support.avaya.com/css/P8/documents/100066674).
The following table describes factors that mitigate the risk of specific
vulnerabilities for affected Avaya products:

| Vulnerability | Mitigating Factors |
| --- | --- |
| CVE-2011-0083 CVE-2011-0085 CVE-2011-2362 CVE-2011-2363 CVE-2011-2364 CVE-2011-2365 CVE-2011-2371 CVE-2011-2373 CVE-2011-2374 CVE-2011-2375 CVE-2011-2376 CVE-2011-2377 | This is a low risk for Message Networking and Messaging Storage Server as Firefox usage is not standard functionality. There is no risk for IQ, Presence Services, Session Manager and System Manager because Firefox is not installed by default. The xulrunner package is installed and updated per the specific product actions above. |

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be. Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and then follow
that vendor's guidance.

| Product: | Actions: |
| --- | --- |
| Avaya Aura® Application Enablement Services 4.x/5.x | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the AES application. |
| CVLAN | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite (IMS) | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. |
| Avaya Aura® Presence Services | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the PS application. |
| Avaya Aura® System Manager 1.0 | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the SMGR application. |
| Voice Portal | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the Voice Portal application. |

**Recommended Actions for Software-Only Products:**
In the event that the affected package is installed, Avaya recommends that customers follow recommended actions supplied by Red Hat regarding their Enterprise Linux.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2011-19

## Miscellaneous memory safety hazards (rv:3.0/1.9.2.18)

Announced
June 21, 2011
Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox 3.6.18
* Firefox 5
* SeaMonkey 2.2
* Thunderbird 3.1.11

### Description

Mozilla developers identified and fixed several memory safety bugs
in the browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based
products. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption
under certain circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

### References

Bob Clary, Kevin Brosnan, Nils, Gary Kwong, Jesse Ruderman and
Christian Biesinger reported memory safety problems that were fixed in
clients based on mozilla5 and mozilla-1.9.2 (e.g. Firefox 5 and
Firefox 3.6.18 respectively).

[unreduced fragile testcase](attachment.cgi?id=508088)

I tried but somehow failed to get a Windows environment with symbols for a js shell, but nonetheless attaching what I have.
The testcase is extremely fragile but somewhat reproducible. It doesn't seem to affect debug shells. Assuming worse-case [sg:critical?] pending further analysis.

Tested with -m and -j on TM changeset 3f23c7719100. It seems to only occur with both -m and -j but I'm not sure.
This issue (or its variants) seems pretty common on Windows when running jsfunfuzz, but getting a somewhat reliable testcase is an extreme PITA.

Definitely still reproduces on Windows 7 changeset 9459c4b15890. Just keep trying:
$ ./js-opt -m -j testcase.js
and one will crash once in every 5-6 runs of the command.

Is your js shell 32-bit or 64-bit? ./js -j -e "print(jitstats.archIs64BIT)"
Can you reproduce on any platform other than Windows?
Does using a loop (around the entire block of tryItOut calls) make the crash reliable enough to use Lithium?

Nope, but again, I'm not entirely sure, it doesn't blow on Linux and Mac for me no matter how many times I try but the problem might still be there.

This may crash after 1-2 minutes, or it may not. Either way, it's further reduced. The previous earlier unreduced testcase takes 5-6 seconds to crash if it decides to.
Both tested on Windows 7 opt build on TM changeset a1a8cd4accba.

This is a sg:critical bug, with a testcase. That say it needs to be a hardblocker. If this is not reproducible enough, then we can argue about that, but it sounds like this reproduces for Gary, so let's at least give it a shot.Whiteboard: [sg:critical?][softblocker] → [sg:critical?][hardblocker]

I can't reproduce a crash with signature js::TypedArray::operator.
I can crash with either test case if I do many runs, but the crash is in a js.cpp error reporter function. By itself, that would definitely not be sg:critical, but the reason we crash there is that we create a report object with a bad pointer for |tokenptr|. mxr seems to say that |tokenptr| isn't used in the browser, so this wouldn't affect the browser.
Gary, can you still reproduce the original crash signature?

Attached patch

[Patch for shell error reporter crash](attachment.cgi?id=511566&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=511566&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=629858&attachment=511566)

This patch stops the shell crash, which could at least be helpful for fuzzing. I'm not sure of the exact cause of the error yet, but it has something to with having a 0 character in the code. The line-handling code ends up thinking the line is short, but tokenpos data refers to locations after the 0. I'm not sure if the tokenpos is for the right line, or a different line, or what. Not sure it's that important at this point, it's kind of a corner case and it's easy to step on it this way.

With the patch for the error reporter issue, I'm not able to repro this in 1000 runs of the original test case or 10 runs of the longer-running one. This is on Windows 7 with a 32-bit opt shell (TM 9ecbccbaff7b, VS2008, ../configure --enable-debug-symbols). So, unblocking for now.blocking2.0: final+ → .x

Yes, this gets stepped on by the fuzzer on Windows very often, and the patch does immensely help to stop the crash. I'm not sure why I got a crash with another signature, but for the testcases here it seems to stop crashes, so let's get the patch in and fuzz-testing on Windows can resume :)

Yeah, if dmandelin's patch helps it's almost certainly [bug 634444](/show_bug.cgi?id=634444 "RESOLVED FIXED - Long lines with many warnings from javascript.options.strict cause memory spikes when a console or Firebug is in use"), which I've officially decided should be backed out and not included in Firefox 4.0 (see [bug 635235](/show_bug.cgi?id=635235 "RESOLVED FIXED - Incorrect line number in e4x tokens leads to buffer overreads and possible crashes")).

Oh, I didn't realize this was triggering before [bug 634444](/show_bug.cgi?id=634444 "RESOLVED FIXED - Long lines with many warnings from javascript.options.strict cause memory spikes when a console or Firebug is in use") landed. That's not good.
It's possible that the patch for [bug 588648](/show_bug.cgi?id=588648 "RESOLVED FIXED - Don't copy chars when scanning") caused this, though it's strange that it would only start happening in late January, because that patch landed in early December. Gary, can you either back that patch out or revert to just before it landed and see if you can reproduce the problem? Thanks.

There's definitely some occasional weirdness in the parser and/or scanner to do with the 'index' value used in reportCompileErrorNumberVA(). [Bug 635235](/show_bug.cgi?id=635235 "RESOLVED FIXED - Incorrect line number in e4x tokens leads to buffer overreads and possible crashes") (see the e4x\_TCO++ patch) may be the root cause, we should fix that. If that's not the root cause, it would be good to put the above patch in as a defensive measure (with a comment explaining why the extra test is needed).

Patch for shell error reporter crash
Whee, I actually understand the patch's code now! (I didn't when I glanced at this when it was first posted, but with [bug 635235](/show_bug.cgi?id=635235 "RESOLVED FIXED - Incorrect line number in e4x tokens leads to buffer overreads and possible crashes") under my belt I grok it a fair bit more.)
[Bug 634444](/show_bug.cgi?id=634444 "RESOLVED FIXED - Long lines with many warnings from javascript.options.strict cause memory spikes when a console or Firebug is in use") relied on every token's information always being correct, as did previous (now again-current) code, but the getToken state space is large enough more failures-to-set and the like may lurk. So this might be [bug 635235](/show_bug.cgi?id=635235 "RESOLVED FIXED - Incorrect line number in e4x tokens leads to buffer overreads and possible crashes"), or it might be something else. It's impossible to say without a rigorous proof that the E4X failure is the only one in existence, which seems a difficult thing to produce, and arguably isn't worth the time to do so.
Either way, the patch here seems to be a hackaround. Further, given the memory-writing behavior I observed in [bug 635235](/show_bug.cgi?id=635235 "RESOLVED FIXED - Incorrect line number in e4x tokens leads to buffer overreads and possible crashes"), I don't believe this hack would actually protect against all badness of these sorts.
One thing that might help with diagnosing failure-to-initialize-token bugs would be to not rely on overwriting default-initialized values (like the end position's lineno) for special cases. If the end lineno hadn't been set in that case, it would have been a valgrind uninitialized-value copy that would have been easier to see. But that means the simple cases require more cleanup drudge. That seems a hard tradeoff to make either way. Maybe someone else sees another idea for how to make the token-generation stuff more robust to producing faulty tokens?

True. I didn't realize defensive programming was necessary here :/

There's a small circular token buffer (TokenStream::tokens) and old tokens get overwritten all the time, so Valgrind wouldn't warn against uninitialized values without some annotations. We could overwrite with some canary values instead. But as you say, newToken() does a lot of default initialization, which defeats canaries.
One idea is to add a Token sanity checker. It would do things like:
- If |begin| and |end| are on different lines, check it's a token that's allowed to be on multiple lines (eg. strings, xml tokens, nothing else?)
- If |begin| and |end| are on the same line, check that begin < end.
That's all I can think of right now. There's scope for more assertions in other places too, I think.

I've worked this out. I think it shouldn't be a hardblocker because (a) the bug is present in 1.9.1 and 1.9.2, so it's not a regression, and (b) it can only occur in the browser if javascript.options.strict is enabled. (Note that this turns on SpiderMonkey's "strict warnings", which is similar in spirit to ES5's "strict mode" but looks for different things.)
Here's a small reproducer; in the shell, you need to run with |-o strict| to enable strict warnings.
function f(a) {
if (a > 3)
return 644;
}
It doesn't crash for me on Linux but Valgrind complains about overrunning a buffer. (I got the same Valgrind complaint with Gary's original test.) It appears it can only crash the shell on Windows, which is presumably why Gary only just found it even though it's been present for ages. As for why it manifests in js::TypedArray::operator, who knows... memory corruption?
The problem is that TokenStream::reportCompileErrorNumberVA() uses a combination of the current token (from tokens[cursor]) and the current state in TokenStream when reporting the error. In this case, ';' is the current token, and from that we get the index (which is the column number minus one), which is 18. But TokenStream is already on the next line by the time the strict warning is issued, and so the line length is computed as 2 (the '}' plus the newline). We end up copying 2 chars from line 4 into the buffer used for the error, but try to index 18 chars into it. You can see this in the actual warning:
b.js:4: strict warning: function f does not always return a value:
b.js:4: strict warning: }
b.js:4: strict warning: ..................^
The carat is pointing 18 chars into line 4.
The patch I'm about to attach fixes the problem by passing in a JSParseNode, which causes its position to be used instead of the current token's position, and we end up with this warning:
b.js:1: strict warning: function f does not always return a value
which is clearer anyway. There are three other places where ReportBadReturn() is called, so I passed in what seemed like the right JSParseNode to each of them too. I confirmed that Valgrind doesn't complain with Gary's original testcase once this patch is applied.
Though I think it shouldn't be a hardblocker, I'll ask for 2.0 approval once I get r+ because the patch is very small and IMO safe.Assignee: general → nnethercoteStatus: NEW → ASSIGNEDKeywords: [regression](/buglist.cgi?keywords=regression&resolution=---)

Nix the comment, doesn't seem to add much here. This would seem like a place for pass-by-reference -- but for the reference haters around here, alas. ;-)
The name pn is canonical and also canonically unhelpfully informative, for a method whose behavior is not trivially obvious. I don't have a good suggestion for a better name.

Yes, really.
Perhaps we can't test these directly (unless we wrote a shell error reporter that would save the information to the side -- maybe useful, doesn't seem important to do it now), but we could write tests that demonstrating this stuff's Valgrind-safe. r=me if you write some testcases that trigger Valgrind warnings pre-patch and don't post-patch and dump them in a js/src/tests/\*/extensions directory.

Jeff: const refs are not hated, mutable refs are.
OTOH, asserting pn non-null is against house style and seems silly here. The single-file scope imposed by static on ReportBadReturn makes for a small-world codebase, where one can grep for all the calls. Anyway crashing on a near null constant-offset dereference is safe.

Okay.
The assertion for non-null doesn't seem silly to me, because the ReportCompileError method permits a NULL pn to be passed into it. That's what the assertion guards against: RCE trying to be clever when it's not explicitly told where to look. The non-NULL requirement would not be clear to me, knowing that RCE accepts NULL pn, without that assertion.

The assertion only guards by crashing a debug build in a controlled way. But so does a guaranteed NPE. Thus the don't-assert-not-null style rule.
For a real language-level guarantee, I agree a const ref could be used. But we don't use those elsewhere in jsparse.cpp, and nul pn being valid is unusual (you're right that the report-compile-error path is where that comes up).
I suggest consulting with jimb, luke, and jorendorff, and having a plan to use const refs more consistently, rather than injecting them piecemeal, and in this bug.

Quite true. I have no beef with that as long as it doesn't "unduly" hinder readability. The vast majority of the time it doesn't. (The exception I'm thinking of is where the pointer gets passed down half a dozen levels or so before a deref happens, or perhaps where it only \*might\* happen. Again, that's very rare.)

I'm fine with or without them as a general rule, don't need or not-need a plan one way or the other. One just seems appropriate here, in this narrow case, for making the requirement crystal-clear in the lowest-mental-overhead way.
(Why does it feel like we've talked past each other in almost every interaction we've had in the last couple weeks? :-( )

That's why I put it there \*and\* added a comment -- to strongly indicate that it wasn't just random paranoia. But I can remove the assertion.

Thanks for the test case! I was thinking about storing this extra context info somewhere that it's testable anyway (Shaver suggested an extra property in SyntaxError) because I've been making various changes to the scanner lately and am a bit nervous due to the lack of regression testing of error messages.

I think an assertion is the best choice here:
- In cases where a pointer will be dereferenced anyway, it's fine to let the machine's null pointer checking do the work for us --- but in this case the pointer will not be dereferenced if it is null.
- Readers should be able to infer invariants themselves by reading the code --- but ReportCompileErrorNumber permits a null pointer, misleading such efforts.
- One can't create a reference to NULL without dereferencing a NULL pointer, which is undefined, so 'const foo &' is a type-ish way of indicating that an argument must null. But nowhere do we pass JSParseNodes by reference this way.
So while I don't want us to go crazy with assertions either, the alternatives to and arguments against assertions that I'm aware of don't seem to apply here.
Contra Waldo, I would like the assertion to have a brief comment to explain why we can't just pass along RCEN's default behavior --- perhaps "This error is often detected after the token stream has moved to a different line, so without a parse node, RCEN guesses the error position poorly"?
(I probably comment too much, but I do think a reference to bugzilla should be a second choice to a brief, clear, in-place explanation.)

Truly I don't care that much whether there is, or isn't, a comment. Actually I made the suggestion because I thought Brendan would be happier without it, because it's not hugely more informative than /\* require non-null pn \*/ would be, especially in concert with hg annotate. So if it helps, pretend I never said anything about the assertion at all, and just add the couple valgrind-anticipating tests. :-(

I'm sad so much ink was spilled over this. It's true that we use pointers known to be nullable or non-null, with conventions, going back many years and due to C not C++ in large part. A bit more code like that wouldn't break us old-timers, but you who are newer are within your rights to object, and the C++ switch is a big win we shouldn't overlook.
So, I agree with Jeff: use const refs to get the compiler covering your back at compile time. Do not bloat the source with comments and assertions that at best fail hard at runtime.

I'm marking this as [sg:moderate] because it's very similar to [bug 635235](/show_bug.cgi?id=635235 "RESOLVED FIXED - Incorrect line number in e4x tokens leads to buffer overreads and possible crashes") -- in [comment 27](/show_bug.cgi?id=629858#c27 "RESOLVED FIXED - strict warning \"function f does not always return a value\" can cause buffer overreads"), if you make the value returned longer you can cause a read past the end of a buffer of arbitrary length, so it's a privacy risk. Albeit a smaller one than [bug 635235](/show_bug.cgi?id=635235 "RESOLVED FIXED - Incorrect line number in e4x tokens leads to buffer overreads and possible crashes") because you need javascript.options.strict enabled, which is an unusual option.Whiteboard: [sg:critical?] → [sg:moderate]

<http://hg.mozilla.org/tracemonkey/rev/17273c2c0eda>
I ended up removing the assertion. I tried using a ref-to-const but then I would have had to do a cast to get rid of the const-ness when passing 'pn' on, which was ugly, so I didn't use that.
I added a test, but it's not run under Valgrind. The problem was that Valgrind jit-tests get their stderr output printed on the console, so you can see any Valgrind warnings. But SpiderMonkey was also printing a warning, which is console pollution we don't want. Non-valgrind jit-tests don't have stderr printed to the console. In compensation, I made the return value a very long string, which maximizes the likelihood of a crash when the fix isn't present.Whiteboard: [sg:moderate] → [sg:moderate], fixed-in-tracemonkey

Would rather const-ipate harder. But yeah.

We don't want to land this on the branches until we know we can get it into a shipping FF4 update, holding off on the approval requests for now.

2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please close and restart all running instances of MozillaFirefox after the update.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
"Online Update" module or the "zypper" commandline tool. The package and
patch management stack will detect which updates are required and
automatically perform the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

## Details

Multiple memory vulnerabilities were discovered in the browser rendering

engine. An attacker could use these to possibly execute arbitrary code with

the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2011-2364](/security/CVE-2011-2364), [CVE-2011-2365](/security/CVE-2011-2365),

[CVE-2011-2374](/security/CVE-2011-2374), [CVE-2011-2376](/security/CVE-2011-2376))

Martin Barbella discovered that under certain conditions, viewing a XUL

document while JavaScript was disabled caused deleted memory to be

accessed. An attacker could potentially use this to crash Firefox or

execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.

([CVE-2011-2373](/security/CVE-2011-2373))

Jordi Chancel discovered a vulnerability on multipart/x-mixed-replace

images due to memory corruption. An attacker could potentially use this to

crash Firefox or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user

invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2011-2377](/security/CVE-2011-2377))

Chris Rohlf and Yan Ivnitskiy discovered an integer overflow vulnerability

in JavaScript Arrays. An attacker could potentially use this to execute

arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.

([CVE-2011-2371](/security/CVE-2011-2371))

Multiple use-after-free vulnerabilities were discovered. An attacker could

potentially use these to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the

user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2011-0083](/security/CVE-2011-0083), [CVE-2011-0085](/security/CVE-2011-0085), [CVE-2011-2363](/security/CVE-2011-2363))

David Chan discovered that cookies did not honor same-origin conventions.

This could potentially lead to cookie data being leaked to a third party.

([CVE-2011-2362](/security/CVE-2011-2362))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 10.10

* [firefox](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox)
  -
  [3.6.18+build2+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.10.10.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox/3.6.18%2Bbuild2%2Bnobinonly-0ubuntu0.10.10.1)
* [xulrunner-1.9.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/xulrunner-1.9.2)
  -
  [1.9.2.18+build2+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.10.10.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/xulrunner-1.9.2/1.9.2.18%2Bbuild2%2Bnobinonly-0ubuntu0.10.10.1)

##### Ubuntu 10.04

* [firefox](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox)
  -
  [3.6.18+build2+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.10.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox/3.6.18%2Bbuild2%2Bnobinonly-0ubuntu0.10.04.1)
* [xulrunner-1.9.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/xulrunner-1.9.2)
  -
  [1.9.2.18+build2+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.10.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/xulrunner-1.9.2/1.9.2.18%2Bbuild2%2Bnobinonly-0ubuntu0.10.04.1)

After a standard system update you need to restart Firefox and any

applications which use Xulrunner to make all the necessary changes.

| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=643051#c0)• 14 years ago |
|  | |

Currently, document.cookie allows setting multiple cookies in a single call.
This is inconsistent with other browsers as well as our documentation:
<https://developer.mozilla.org/en/document.cookie>
"Note that you can only set/update a single cookie at a time using this method."
This can lead to security problems in web applications: When an external script takes untrusted input (e.g. from a URL parameter), that input can contain line breaks, and thus set multiple cookies to the including web site.
Therefore, we should disallow setting multiple cookies using document.cookie.

As a security problem this really arises because of insufficient filtering on the web app side more than a problem in Firefox. But it's clearly a bug and we should fix it.Whiteboard: [sg:low] → [sg:nse]

This failed mochitest-1 persistently, and the followups didn't fix it, so I backed out the original patch and both followups from cedar:

Let's try this again. Currently running this version through a local "make mochitest-1", will push to cedar if that worked.
This version clears the "a" cookie in the test that sets it.

User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0
Build Identifier:
Description:
The attached testcase triggers following assertion on debug builds:
###!!! ASSERTION: This is unsafe! Fix the caller!
A stack back trace at the time of the assertion is attached. Additionally exploitable looking crashes have been observed on Linux, Windows and Mac.
The reduced test case needs a few reloads to crash the browser (especially on windows). The likelihood of crashes can be increased by loading the testcase in several tabs and iframes. Regardless of the crashes, the assertion seem to happen for every reload.
Affected Versions:
Firefox 4.0
Trunk
Testcase:
The testcase is attached as an HTML file. It will crash the browser on opening after several reloads.
Testcase Notes:
gc() triggers garbage collection. It requires Jesse's quitter extension (<https://www.squarefree.com/extensions/quitter.xpi>).
Stack Backtrace:
The stack during the first assertion on Linux is attached.
VulnDev reference : vd11007
reported by nils of vulndev ltd.
Reproducible: Always

Can't reproduce the crash (with quitter.xpi) on 1.9.2 nor
with modified testcase (with domFuzzLite.xpi)
But the assertion is there, and that is serious enough and
fixing the cause for that could hopefully fix the crash too.

As far as I see, we shouldn't have script blocker in stack when
calling AdoptNode.
On trunk the problem doesn't happen because we use nsUserDataCaller
script runner.
I doubt the patch helps with the crash (which I can't reproduce) though.

Fixes the assertion
Checked with Jonas and he feels more comfortable with taking this than not. This patch prevents us from getting into uncharted territory where exploitable things \*could\* be possible, though we do not at this point know of any specific ways where an actual exploit would happen.

I can't reproduce the problem on 192, and the patch doesn't apply cleanly.
But I'll update the patch for 192 anyway.

We have [Bug 639648](/show_bug.cgi?id=639648 "RESOLVED FIXED - crash due to stack exhaustion in BindToTree with setUserData") on 1.9.2...does that mean we don't need this? Or do they both need to come in?

seamonkey security update (RHSA-2011-0888)

Original Release Date: July 11, 2011

Last Revised: July 11, 2011

Number: ASA-2011-201

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 1.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

SeaMonkey is an open source web browser, email and newsgroup client, IRC
chat client, and HTML editor.

A flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey handled malformed JPEG images. A
website containing a malicious JPEG image could cause SeaMonkey to crash
or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
running SeaMonkey. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2011-2377](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-2377.html) to this issue.

Multiple dangling pointer flaws were found in SeaMonkey. A web page
containing malicious content could cause SeaMonkey to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
SeaMonkey. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names [CVE-2011-0083](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0083.html), [CVE-2011-0085](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0085.html) and [CVE-2011-2363](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-2363.html) to these issues.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could cause SeaMonkey to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
SeaMonkey. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names [CVE-2011-2364](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-2364.html), [CVE-2011-2365](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-2365.html), [CVE-2011-2374](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-2374.html), [CVE-2011-2375](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-2375.html) and [CVE-2011-2376](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-2376.html) to these issues.

An integer overflow flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey handled JavaScript
Array objects. A website containing malicious JavaScript could cause
SeaMonkey to execute that JavaScript with the privileges of the user
running SeaMonkey. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2011-2371](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-2371.html) to this issue.

A use-after-free flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey handled malformed
JavaScript. A website containing malicious JavaScript could cause SeaMonkey
to execute that JavaScript with the privileges of the user running
SeaMonkey. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2011-2373](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-2373.html) to this issue.

It was found that SeaMonkey could treat two separate cookies as
interchangeable if both were for the same domain name but one of those
domain names had a trailing "." character. This violates the same-origin
policy and could possibly lead to data being leaked to the wrong domain.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2011-2362](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-2362.html) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security advisory issued by Red Hat:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0888.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products using a modified version of RHEL4 with affected components/packages installed: | Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | Avaya Message Networking | 3.1 | Low | Upgrade to MN 5.2 or later. |

**Recommended Actions for System Products:**
Avaya strongly recommends that customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place, risk to Avaya
products and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as an Avaya provided
product update or the recommended Avaya action is applied.
Further restrictions as deemed necessary based on the
customer's security policies may be required during this
interim period, but customers should not modify the System Product
operating system or application unless the change is approved by Avaya.
Making changes that are not approved may void the Avaya product service contract.

### Mitigating Factors:

When determining risk, Avaya takes into account many factors as
outlined by Avaya's
[Security Vulnerability Classification Policy](https://support.avaya.com/css/P8/documents/100066674).
The following table describes factors that mitigate the risk of specific
vulnerabilities for affected Avaya products:

| Vulnerability | Mitigating Factors |
| --- | --- |
| CVE-2011-0083 CVE-2011-0085 CVE-2011-2362 CVE-2011-2363 CVE-2011-2364 CVE-2011-2365 CVE-2011-2371 CVE-2011-2373 CVE-2011-2374 CVE-2011-2375 CVE-2011-2376 CVE-2011-2377 | Low risk as no critical system applications or processes would be affected and would require non-standard user interaction. |

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be. Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and then follow
that vendor's guidance.

| Product: | Actions: |
| --- | --- |
| Avaya Aura® Application Enablement Services 4.x/5.x | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the AES application. |
| CVLAN | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite (IMS) | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. |
| Avaya Aura® Presence Services | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the PS application. |
| Avaya Aura® System Manager 1.0 | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the SMGR application. |
| Voice Portal | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the Voice Portal application. |

**Recommended Actions for Software-Only Products:**
In the event that the affected package is installed, Avaya recommends that customers follow recommended actions supplied by Red Hat regarding their Enterprise Linux.

[website](http://support.avaya.com) and through your Avaya

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Reading through the W3C specs, I translate the above fragment as follows:
The script element (belonging to an iframe document) is getting an h1 element (from the parent document) appended to it. The script, in attempting to append the h1, might be adopting the parent node or importing it.
In the user data callback, d is o62, the script element. There, the h1 element is told to append the script element which is the h1 element's parent (or should be, at some point).
What makes this surprising to me is that the first append operation (h1 as child of script) didn't throw WRONG\_DOCUMENT\_ERR. They're supposedly created by different documents.
Nils: out of curiousity, what is the "o" argument for your user data handler?

Alex: "o" is 5 = NODE\_ADOPTED.
Interestingly the user data handler is only called once.

> They're supposedly created by different documents.
That part of the spec got changed. Inserting into a different document auto-adopts.
Peter, want to take a look?

Stepping through in the debugger, script thinks h1 is its child, and h1 thinks script is its child.

The fundamental problem is that the check done IsAllowedAsChild can be invalidated by userdata handlers running off of adoptNode.
This affects both nsINode::ReplaceOrInsertBefore and nsINode::doInsertChildAt (even though the latter usually doesn't do an IsAllowedAsChild check.
Jonas, this should be doable with a mutation guard, but what should the expected mutation count for the adopt be? Just 0, so if the node was in the DOM somewhere we'd still recompute stuff?

Yeah, I guess a mutation guard expecting 0 mutations is the best we can safely do.
For trunk, [bug 650493](/show_bug.cgi?id=650493 "RESOLVED FIXED - Simplify mutation events and userdata handlers") should fix this.

Can we write a testcase that demonstrates this in a scarier-looking way than a stack exhaustion crash?

I'm not sure. insPos also becomes invalid, but we may protect against that well enough.... As in, get misbehavior but possibly not crashes.

Jonas, can you give us a risk assessment for the patch and understanding of side effects and test cases for side effects?

The risk is very low. We run the exact same code in many other locations in the same function to deal with exactly the same situation. All the patch does is add the same code in a situation that we had previously missed.
The main downside is that we will be slightly slower in some cases. However these cases are fairly rare (auto-adopting a node which is in another document, not just created another document) or really really rare (pages using userdata handlers or mutation listeners which make other DOM modifications). And the perf regression is small even when it happens. So it's not something that I think we need to worry about.

OK. The "reporter's testcase" does not crash for me in latest Aurora build.
