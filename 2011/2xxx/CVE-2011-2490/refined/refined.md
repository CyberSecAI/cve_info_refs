Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2011-2490:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `opielogin` program in OPIE (One-Time Passwords in Everything) fails to check the return value of the `setuid()` system call.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Return Value Check:** The code does not verify if the `setuid()` call was successful. If `setuid()` fails for some reason, the program may continue to run with elevated privileges, potentially leading to a privilege escalation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Easy Root Compromise:** If the `setuid()` call fails, a user could potentially gain root privileges by exploiting the unchecked condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability by using `opielogin`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a local user on a system running a vulnerable version of `opielogin`. They do not need initial root access.
