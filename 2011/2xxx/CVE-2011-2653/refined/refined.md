Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2011-2653:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the `rtrlet` component of Novell ZENworks Asset Management. This component listens on TCP port 8080.
- The root cause is the improper sanitization of file paths during unauthenticated file uploads.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Directory Traversal:** The lack of proper sanitization allows attackers to use directory traversal techniques (e.g., `../`) to navigate the file system and place files in arbitrary locations.
- **Arbitrary File Upload:** The vulnerability allows for arbitrary file uploads without authentication.
- **Null Byte Injection:** Attackers can insert a null byte into the filename to manipulate the file extension, allowing for the execution of the uploaded file with arbitrary extensions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system.
- **SYSTEM Context:** The code executes with SYSTEM privileges, granting the attacker complete control over the compromised system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** The vulnerability is exploitable over a network through TCP port 8080.
- **Unauthenticated:** No authentication is required for exploitation, making it easier for attackers to gain access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the target system.
- **No Special Privileges:** The attacker does not require any special privileges or credentials to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerability:**  The attacker must be aware of the vulnerability to craft an appropriate exploit.

**Additional Notes:**
- Novell has released an update to address this vulnerability.
- Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS provides protection via filter ID '11916'.
- The vulnerability was reported anonymously to the vendor on 2011-07-25 with a coordinated public release on 2011-12-07
- The CVSS score is 9.7, indicating a critical severity.
