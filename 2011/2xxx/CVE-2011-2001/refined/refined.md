    {
      "source": "docs.microsoft.com_b38d59a4_20250124_231956.html",
      "vulnerabilityDetails": {
        "rootCause": "The vulnerability exists because Internet Explorer accesses a virtual function table after it has been corrupted.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Virtual function table corruption"
        ],
        "impact": "Successful exploitation allows for remote code execution within the context of the logged-on user. An attacker could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user, potentially leading to full control of an affected system if the user has administrative privileges.",
         "attackVectors": [
          "An attacker could host a specially crafted web page designed to exploit the vulnerability and convince a user to view it through Internet Explorer.",
           "An attacker could embed a malicious ActiveX control in an application or Microsoft Office document that uses the IE rendering engine.",
          "Compromised websites or those accepting user-provided content could also be used to deliver malicious content."
        ],
        "requiredCapabilities": "The attacker needs to convince a user to view the malicious content. This could be done through phishing emails, instant messenger messages, or by compromising a legitimate website.",
        "additionalNotes": "The vulnerability is addressed by modifying how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory. The security bulletin also includes details about mitigating factors, such as the Enhanced Security Configuration in Windows Server. Several workarounds are suggested, such as setting the Internet security zone to 'High' to block ActiveX controls and Active Scripting."
