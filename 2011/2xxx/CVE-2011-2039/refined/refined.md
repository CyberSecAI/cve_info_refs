Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-2039:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the Cisco AnyConnect SSL VPN ActiveX and Java clients. Both versions fail to validate the origin of the `vpndownloader.exe` file before executing it. This means that the clients download and execute the file without verifying if it comes from a trusted source.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of origin validation:** The core issue is that the ActiveX and Java components do not properly check the source of the downloaded executable, `vpndownloader.exe`.
*   **Arbitrary code execution:** This lack of validation allows an attacker to replace the legitimate `vpndownloader.exe` with a malicious one.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary code execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the victim's system.
*   **System compromise:** Successful exploitation can lead to a complete compromise of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web-based attack:** The vulnerability is exploited by convincing a user to visit a specially crafted webpage. This can be done by directing them to a malicious site or embedding it in a compromised website.
*   **HTML email:** An attacker can also distribute the malicious code via an HTML email message or attachment.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote, unauthenticated access:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated on the VPN server, and they can exploit the vulnerability remotely.
*   **Social engineering:** The attacker needs to convince the user to visit a malicious webpage or open a malicious HTML email.
*   **Crafted HTML document:** The attacker needs the ability to create a malicious HTML document which can either be hosted online or sent via email.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability affects both ActiveX and Java versions of the AnyConnect client.
*   The Java applet version does not protect the client systems due to security limitations in the Java platform.
*   Windows Mobile version of AnyConnect is also vulnerable, but no fix is planned.
*   Cisco released a fix in AnyConnect ActiveX version 2.3.185, and recommends using 2.5.3041 or later 2.5.x or 3.0.1047 or later 3.0.x versions
*   CERT provides workarounds including: disabling the ActiveX control, removing vulnerable Java applets, blacklisting vulnerable Java versions, removing Cisco certificates from trusted Java publishers, and using the stand-alone AnyConnect client.
