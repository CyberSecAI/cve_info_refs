Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2011-2220:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of size check within the `NFREngine.exe` application when parsing `<RECORD>` tags. Specifically, when the application encounters a `<RECORD>` element in the data, it processes strings without verifying their size before copying them to a memory location using `memcpy`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap-based Buffer Overflow:** The absence of size validation when copying strings to the memory buffer leads to a buffer overflow. An attacker can send a specially crafted `<RECORD>` tag containing an excessively long string, causing the `memcpy` operation to write beyond the boundaries of the allocated buffer on the stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By overflowing the buffer, an attacker can overwrite critical parts of the stack, including the return address. This allows them to redirect the execution flow and execute arbitrary code on the target system.
- **System Level Access:** The code execution occurs in the context of the SYSTEM account, meaning the attacker gains full control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Attack:** The attack vector is remote, meaning that an attacker does not need physical access to the machine.
- **Over HTTPS on TCP Port 3035:** The vulnerable `NFREngine.exe` component communicates with the Agent component over HTTPS on TCP port 3035. This is the communication channel used to deliver the malicious payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the vulnerable system.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability does not require any prior authentication to exploit, making it highly accessible to attackers.

**Additional Notes:**
- Novell issued an update to address this vulnerability.
- Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers were protected via a specific filter (ID '11279').
- The Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) assigned the ID ZDI-11-227 and ZDI-CAN-1250 to this vulnerability.
