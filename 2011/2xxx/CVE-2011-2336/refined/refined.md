{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The CompositeAnimation class in WebCore was not correctly clearing lists in AnimationControllerPrivate when a transition was interrupted and replaced. Specifically, when a new transition was created, the existing transition was replaced, but the lists in `AnimationControllerPrivate` that track hardware animations were not cleared. This caused issues when transitions were interrupted, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect management of animation state",
      "Lack of proper resource cleanup when replacing transitions"
    ],
    "impact": "The impact of the issue is not explicitly stated, but it is implied that it could lead to incorrect rendering or behavior in interrupted transitions",
    "attack_vectors": "The content does not describe a direct attack vector, it seems to be triggered by the way CSS transitions are handled. Therefore, any webpage that uses CSS transitions and where these transitions can be interrupted could potentially trigger the bug. ",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker would need to create a web page that uses CSS transitions and can trigger an interrupt of the animation. The specific scenario is described in the added test case `transitions/3d/interrupted-transition.html`."
  },
  "fixes": [
    "The fix involves modifying `CompositeAnimation::updateTransitions` to notify `AnimationControllerPrivate` that a transition has been removed. Specifically, the line `animationController()->animationWillBeRemoved(implAnim);` was added before removing the transition from the list `m_transitions`."

  "cve_id": "CVE-2011-2336"
