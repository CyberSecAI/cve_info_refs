Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-2660:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies within the `modify_resolvconf_suse` script used by the `vpnc` package.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The script is vulnerable to command injection.
- The vulnerability stems from improper handling of specially crafted DNS domains.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote attackers can inject arbitrary commands into the system.
- This could lead to a variety of malicious activities depending on the injected commands and the privileges of the user running `vpnc`.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is carried out remotely through manipulated DNS domains.
- An attacker would need to control or influence the DNS server providing responses to the VPN client.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have control or influence over the DNS server being used by the victimâ€™s VPN client.
- The attacker does not require prior authentication to exploit this vulnerability; exploitation occurs through the DNS resolution process during VPN connection.

**Summary:**
The vulnerability in `modify_resolvconf_suse` allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands by injecting them via specially crafted DNS domain responses during the VPN connection establishment phase. This is a command injection vulnerability in the `vpnc` software.
