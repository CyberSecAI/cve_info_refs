Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-2743:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Insufficient input sanitization of parameters passed to pages related to administration settings, the javascript handler and the index handler in the Chyrp blogging engine.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Due to the lack of proper input sanitization, an attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code.
- Local File Inclusion (LFI): Vulnerable due to insufficient path sanitization on the 'action' query string parameter, allowing inclusion of arbitrary local files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- XSS: Successful exploitation could lead to the hijacking of an administrator's session, potentially allowing an attacker to gain full control of the affected Chyrp blog.
- LFI: Exploitation could allow an attacker to read arbitrary accessible files from the hosting server's file system and potentially execute arbitrary commands or code.

**Attack Vectors:**
- XSS: By injecting malicious javascript code via vulnerable parameters.
- LFI: By manipulating the 'action' query string parameter to specify paths to local files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft requests containing malicious code or file paths, targeting the vulnerable Chyrp application. This can potentially be done through social engineering or by tricking a user into following a malicious link.
