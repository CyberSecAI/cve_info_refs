Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-2917:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper sanitization of the `zorder` parameter in the Mambo CMS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The `zorder` parameter, when submitted to `administrator/index2.php` is not sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Data Manipulation/Disclosure:** By exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability, an attacker can manipulate or disclose arbitrary data from the backend database. This could lead to unauthorized access, data modification, or data theft.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to `administrator/index2.php`, where the `zorder` parameter is manipulated to include SQL injection payloads.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the Mambo CMS web server.
*   **Knowledge of vulnerable parameter:** The attacker must be able to identify that the `zorder` parameter in  `administrator/index2.php` is vulnerable to SQL injection.
*   **Craft SQL injection payload:** The attacker must craft a malicious SQL query to be injected through the vulnerable parameter.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerable code exists in the `administrator/index2.php` file.
*   The `zorder` parameter is the injection point.
*   A proof of concept (POC) URL is provided that demonstrates the vulnerability: `http://localhost/mambo/administrator/index2.php?limit=10&order[]=11&boxchecked=0&toggle=on&search=sqli&task=&limitstart=0&cid[]=on&zorder=-1OR (SELECT 9999 FROM(SELECT COUNT(*),CONCAT(CHAR(58,98,112,101,58),(SELECT (CASE WHEN (9999=9999) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)),CHAR(58,110,100,107,58),FLOOR(RAND(0)*2))x FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.CHARACTER_SETS GROUP BY x)a)&filter_authorid=62&hidemainmenu=0&option=com_typedcontent`
*   The affected versions are Mambo CMS 4.6.5 and lower.
*   There is no official patch available since the vendor has discontinued development.
