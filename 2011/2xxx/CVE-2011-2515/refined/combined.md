### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.
Needs triage

Seconded. Had I known that Purl would take off I would have added it to the original *CVE* JSON specification I wrote.

The following yum commit changes the default behavior of _checkSignatures() when using local packages:  -------------------- commit 290933489b1aaeb1017d10fb59ccf3231e309115 Author: Seth Vidal <skvidal> Date:   Thu Sep 30 16:28:30 2010 -0400      add localpkg_gpgcheck option to [main] so users can set whether or not     to gpgcheck pkgs in local files          documents it too --------------------  Using a trivial reproducer,  -------------------- #!/usr/bin/python import yum import sys from yum.packages import YumLocalPackage yb = yum.YumBase() po = YumLocalPackage(ts=yb.rpmdb.readOnlyTS(), filename=sys.argv[1]) try:     yb._checkSignatures([po], None) except yum.Errors.YumGPGCheckError, e:     print "The package %s IS NOT okay" % po.name else:     print "The package %s IS okay" % po.name --------------------  You can tests by saving the snippet as test.py, and then doing "python ./test.py /path/to/an/unsigned.rpm"  You can see that releases prior to this change report the argv[1] as unsigned, and therefor requiring the untrusted-package PolicyKit authorization, and releases after this commit report argv[1] as signed, and therefor requiring the lesser trusted-package authorization.  NOTE: a user can update trusted packages without a password on all recent Fedora releases. I don't think this bug can be used to install new local packages as part of an upgrade, as UpdatePackages and UpdateSystem do not use YumLocalPackage.  It would be very easy to convince somebody that a local rpm package was signed (and thus trusted) and that is was safe to install with a little social engineering.  Richard.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=717566#c5)  seth vidal    2011-06-29 19:18:44 UTC  ``` It's not an API change it is a behavior change, however.  We intentionally made the default behavior for local rpms to allow unsigned.  I believe we discussed, briefly, making the config for fedora be localpkg_gpgcheck=1 but I'm not sure what was decided with that or not.  I don't see this as a security bug at all.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=717566#c6)  James Antill    2011-06-29 19:27:12 UTC  ```  I know we'd discussed the default in relation to the cli ... and after a bit of thought it seemed pretty obvious that the default should be false, for the cli.   We probably didn't think much of any GUI using those code paths, or what the right default might be for them. But then the patch was posted to the devel list (like all patches), and had more than just a simple ACK reponse. And it was specifically mentioned in the rpm changelog entry when it went into rawhide. And that was 9 months ago ... so we also hadn't realized people were unaware of it.   We can look at adding something, if you need it, to allow people to change the default for the GUI and CLI separately.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=717566#c7)  Peter Robinson    2011-06-29 19:50:56 UTC  ``` People. Please review the bug. The bug I reported was the text in the diaglog box is wrong (see the attachment). The dialog text states "Authentication is required to install a signed package" where as the package was not signed. I believe the text should read "Authentication is required to install a UNSIGNED package"   The fact that I need to authenticate to install a non signed package I believe is correct, its just the wording in the dialog box (and possibly the detection of the fact that its signed or not) is incorrect.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=717566#c8)  Richard Hughes    2011-06-29 20:20:36 UTC  ``` >James Antill <james.antill> changed: >           What    |Removed                     |Added >---------------------------------------------------------------------------- >          Component|yum                         |PackageKit >         AssignedTo|skvidal         |richard  Really? Are you joking with me? YUM changes the default for functionality another component relies on which causes a security bug in another component?   The core problem is that the behavior changed. If you wanted to make that change in yum, at least some co-ordination between you guys and the principal user in Fedora (PackageKit) is the very least you have to do.  (In reply to [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=717566#c5)) > It's not an API change it is a behavior change, however.  PackageKit uses the API of yum. The API call that used to work, no longer works. PackageKit used that API to make a security decision.  > I believe we discussed, briefly  Nobody even mentioned it to me. Do I have to look at every commit to yum ensuring something isn't going to break PackageKit?  If there's no such guarantee of API ("behavior", whatever) stability between minor releases then maybe PackageKit shouldn't be using yum at all.   > I don't see this as a security bug at all.  It is. It's a security bug that allows users to install unsigned packages with all the indications so that they think the package is signed. If the admin has setup PolicyKit so that users in the wheel group can install signed packages without a password (not-uncommon in single user machines) then with the yum "behavior" change means any unsigned rpm can now be installed without a password.  (In reply to [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=717566#c7)) > The bug I reported was the text in the diaglog > box is wrong (see the attachment).  No, the dialog is correct, as yum is telling PackageKit that the package is signed, when it's really unsigned. Reverting the commit in yum means you get the correct "unsigned" dialog from PackageKit for unsigned packages.  Richard.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=717566#c9)  James Antill    2011-06-29 22:06:43 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #8](show_bug.cgi?id=717566#c8))  > (In reply to [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=717566#c5)) > > It's not an API change it is a behavior change, however. >  > PackageKit uses the API of yum. The API call that used to work, no longer > works. PackageKit used that API to make a security decision.  The public API is, and has been since 2007, documented as:          Take a package object and attempt to verify GPG signature if required          Returns (result, error_string) where result is:             - 0 - GPG signature verifies ok or verification is not required.             - 1 - GPG verification failed but installation of the right GPG key                   might help.             - 2 - Fatal GPG verification error, give up.  ...it's hard to see how you can read this as "0 == package has a signature and it verifies".  That API calls another API which is, and has been since 2004, documented as:      """Takes a transaction set and a package, check it's sigs,      return 0 if they are all fine     return 1 if the gpg key can't be found     return 2 if the header is in someway damaged     return 3 if the key is not trusted      return 4 if the pkg is not gpg or pgp signed"""  ...which appears to be the behaviour PK actually wanted ... why you decided to use the first API instead of the second API, I couldn't say. However the change we did is obviously within the bounds for what the first API is documented to do.  > The core problem is that the behavior changed. If you wanted to make that > change in yum, at least some co-ordination between you guys and the principal > user in Fedora (PackageKit) is the very least you have to do.  The behaviour changed within spec. Saying "PK is the principal user" is no doubt true from your POV, but the pulp people have a different POV as do the anaconda people as do etc. etc. etc. The assumption that we should check all behaviour changes against all the code that uses them is ... unique.  > It is. It's a security bug that allows users to install unsigned packages with > all the indications so that they think the package is signed.  I'm sure Seth meant that it's not a security bug from the yum point of view, we specifically wanted "yum install foo.rpm" to install foo.rpm without the user having to disable all gpg checking. How big of a security problem it is for gpk/etc. is debatable, but it does look like it might be at least a minor one.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=717566#c12)  Richard Hughes    2011-06-30 07:07:19 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #9](show_bug.cgi?id=717566#c9)) > (In reply to [comment #8](show_bug.cgi?id=717566#c8)) > The public API is, and has been since 2007, documented as: >         Take a package object and attempt to verify GPG signature if required  You've hit the nail on the head. PackageKit explicitly sets yumbase.conf.gpgcheck=1 so that the correct signature *is* required. With the change, I have to set yumbase.conf.localpkg_gpgcheck=1 for the same behavior.  the condition for the "if required" has changed in the yum API.  > The behaviour changed within spec. Saying "PK is the principal user" is no > doubt true from your POV, but the pulp people have a different POV as do the > anaconda people as do etc. etc. etc. The assumption that we should check all > behaviour changes against all the code that uses them is ... unique.  PackageKit is the only software the uses yum that is running on every Fedora install by default. Anaconda is a one-shot thing, and pulp installed manually.  > I'm sure Seth meant that it's not a security bug from the yum point of view, we > specifically wanted "yum install foo.rpm" to install foo.rpm without the user > having to disable all gpg checking.  Sure, and from the yum CLI, as root, that probably makes sense. But if somebody had emailed me with a "heads up, you probably should be using this method rather than that method" or "if you want to use that, you'll need to set yumbase.conf.localpkg_gpgcheck=1 in your next release" then we wouldn't be where we're at now.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=717566#c13)  Richard Hughes    2011-06-30 14:20:00 UTC  ``` James, Seth: Is yum-3.2.29 already pushed to RHEL5, RHEL6, F15 and F16?

Hi Richard.  It would need a CVE, but this is a pretty low impact vulnerability.  I've come up with a preliminary CVSSv2 score of 1.5/AV:L/AC:M/Au:S/C:N/I:P/A:N (I believe Au:S is correct as you would have to authenticate with PackageKit in order to get the package installed regardless of its signed state).  RHEL5 currently has 3.2.22-33.el5 so we should be safe there (assuming this was introduced in 3.2.29) but the concern about backports is valid.  We have to ensure that if this functionality gets backported in RHEL5 that we also fix PackageKit at the same time to accommodate the change.  As I understand it, the basic problem here is that yum changed what PackageKit was relying on, and the end result is that a user can install an unsigned package without a GPG check, but be told by PackageKit that it is in fact signed (and trusted).  It still requires a user to download said unsigned package manually (or from a rogue repo that is already setup) and also requires authentication to install the package.  Does that pretty much sum up the problem?  I do not believe we would ASYNC PackageKit in this case, so perhaps we can obtain a slot in 6.2 to get this corrected there?  If there are no disagreements to the above, I'll move this to an SRT bug and note the appropriate affects, give it a CVE name, etc.  I do not think we need to embargo this at all, we can certainly make it public and get it fixed in Fedora right away.   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=717566#c17)  Richard Hughes    2011-06-30 18:36:54 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #16](show_bug.cgi?id=717566#c16)) > As I understand it, the basic problem here is that yum changed what PackageKit > was relying on, and the end result is that a user can install an unsigned > package without a GPG check, but be told by PackageKit that it is in fact > signed (and trusted).

By default, users still have to authenticate to install software, but quite a few users will have manually turned off this check for signed (trusted) software.  > I do not believe we would ASYNC PackageKit in this case, so perhaps we can > obtain a slot in 6.2 to get this corrected there?  Sounds good to me.  > If there are no disagreements to the above, I'll move this to an SRT bug and > note the appropriate affects, give it a CVE name, etc.  I do not think we need > to embargo this at all, we can certainly make it public and get it fixed in > Fedora right away.
