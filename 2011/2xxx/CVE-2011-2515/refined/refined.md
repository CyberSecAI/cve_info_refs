Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2011-2515:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A behavior change in the `yum` package manager altered how it handles local (non-repository) RPM packages. Specifically, the default behavior for checking the signatures of these local packages was changed to allow unsigned packages to be treated as signed.
- PackageKit, a software management tool, relied on the previous behavior of `yum` to determine if a package was signed and thus trusted. The change in `yum` caused PackageKit to incorrectly report unsigned packages as signed, leading to a potential security risk.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Signature Verification:** PackageKit was not correctly determining if local packages were signed due to the change in `yum`'s behavior.
- **Trust Misrepresentation:** PackageKit was incorrectly displaying prompts indicating that an unsigned package was signed, which could mislead users into installing untrusted software.
- **Policy Bypass:** In some configurations where users could install signed packages without password authentication, this vulnerability allowed unsigned packages to be installed without authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Installation of Untrusted Packages:** Attackers could convince a user that a malicious, unsigned package was signed and safe to install through social engineering, misleading the user by means of the dialogue box shown to install.
- **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** If a malicious, unsigned package is installed, it could lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user installing it.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Package Installation:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user attempts to install a local RPM package (i.e. not one from a configured repository).
- **Social Engineering:** An attacker would need to convince a user that an unsigned package is actually a trusted package, often by misrepresenting its origins.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User Access:** The attacker must have a way to get the user to install the malicious RPM package.
- **Social Engineering Skills:** The attacker would need to convince the user to install an unsigned, and potentially malicious, RPM package while making them think that it is signed and trusted.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was caused by a change in yum's behavior with regard to signature verification of local packages, where it was now not enabled by default. This behavior changed with commit `290933489b1aaeb1017d10fb59ccf3231e309115`.
- The issue was addressed by setting `yumbase.conf.localpkg_gpgcheck=1` in PackageKit so it would require signature verification as originally expected.
- The vulnerability was initially classified as low severity.
- It was acknowledged that a configuration where users in the 'wheel' group are allowed to install signed packages without authentication could be leveraged.
- It was noted that the yum API documentation did not clearly convey the change in behavior of checking local packages for signatures.
- This CVE affects multiple distros such as Red Hat, Ubuntu and Debian.
