The provided content relates to CVE-2011-2329.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the improper validation of SOAP requests in Eucalyptus. Specifically, it seems that the issue was related to how Eucalyptus handles XML data within the requests. The fix involved a patch named "xml-security.patch" which included modifications to `c14n.c`, focusing on canonicalization and data source handling and a patch to rampart timestamp token.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper validation of SOAP requests.
- Lack of proper canonicalization handling of XML data sources.
- Incorrect time comparison when checking validity of timestamp tokens

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to submit arbitrary commands to the Eucalyptus SOAP interface, executing these commands within the context of an authenticated user. This could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, or denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending specially crafted SOAP requests to the Eucalyptus SOAP interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to send network requests to the Eucalyptus SOAP interface. No authentication is required initially, but the attacker could run commands in the context of a valid authenticated user.

**Additional notes:**
- The fix included changes to `src/omxmlsec/c14n/c14n.c` and `src/util/rampart_timestamp_token.c` within the rampart package.
- `c14n.c` was updated to handle AXIOM_DATA_SOURCE nodes.
- `rampart_timestamp_token.c` was updated to fix a timestamp comparison issue.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Juraj Somorovsky, Jorg Schwenk, Meiko Jensen and Xiaofeng Lou.
