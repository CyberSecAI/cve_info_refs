# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=718152#c0)  Petr Matousek    2011-07-01 08:39:31 UTC  ``` In both trigger_scan and sched_scan operations, we were checking for the SSID length before assigning the value correctly.  Since the memory was just kzalloc'ed, the check was always failing and SSID with over 32 characters were allowed to go through.  This is causing a buffer overflow when copying the actual SSID to the proper place.  Upstream fixes: <http://git.kernel.org/linus/208c72f4fe44fe09577e7975ba0e7fa0278f3d03> <http://git.kernel.org/linus/57a27e1d6a3bb9ad4efeebd3a8c71156d6207536>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=718152#c4)  Petr Matousek    2011-07-20 21:26:20 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect the versions of Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 as it did not provide support for the Linux wireless LAN (802.11) configuration API.

A few months later, commit 73f34f99 backported the updated socket memory accounting which would have required the missing chunk.  This resulted in the memory of the chunks on the reassmbly and lobby queue not being reclaimed when migrating a socket. Also the queues are assumed to be purged later on.   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=714867#c22)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2011-08-19 02:07:01 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect the Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 as it did not backport the upstream commit 3ab224be6d6. It did not affect the Linux kernels as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, and Red Hat Enterprise MRG as they have backported the upstream commit ea2bc483ff5 that Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 did not.

## Synopsis

Important: kernel security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2011%3A1212)

## Topic

Updated kernel packages that fix multiple security issues and several bugs
are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

This update fixes the following security issues:

* A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Stream

Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) implementation. A remote attacker
could send a specially-crafted SCTP packet to a target system, resulting in
a denial of service. (CVE-2011-2482, Important)

* A flaw in the Linux kernel's client-side NFS Lock Manager (NLM)

implementation could allow a local, unprivileged user to cause a denial of
service. (CVE-2011-2491, Important)

* Buffer overflow flaws in the Linux kernel's netlink-based wireless

configuration interface implementation could allow a local user, who has
the CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability, to cause a denial of service or escalate
their privileges on systems that have an active wireless interface.
(CVE-2011-2517, Important)

* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's Xen hypervisor

implementation emulated the SAHF instruction. When using a
fully-virtualized guest on a host that does not use hardware assisted
paging (HAP), such as those running CPUs that do not have support for (or
those that have it disabled) Intel Extended Page Tables (EPT) or AMD
Virtualization (AMD-V) Rapid Virtualization Indexing (RVI), a privileged
guest user could trigger this flaw to cause the hypervisor to crash.
(CVE-2011-2519, Moderate)

* An off-by-one flaw was found in the \_\_addr\_ok() macro in the Linux

kernel's Xen hypervisor implementation when running on 64-bit systems. A
privileged guest user could trigger this flaw to cause the hypervisor to
crash. (CVE-2011-2901, Moderate)

* /proc/[PID]/io is world-readable by default. Previously, these files

could be read without any further restrictions. A local, unprivileged user
could read these files, belonging to other, possibly privileged processes
to gather confidential information, such as the length of a password used
in a process. (CVE-2011-2495, Low)

Red Hat would like to thank Vasily Averin for reporting CVE-2011-2491, and
Vasiliy Kulikov of Openwall for reporting CVE-2011-2495.

This update also fixes several bugs. Documentation for these bug fixes will
be available shortly from the Technical Notes document linked to in the
References section.

Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported
patches to correct these issues, and fix the bugs noted in the Technical
Notes. The system must be rebooted for this update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/kb/docs/DOC-11259>

To install kernel packages manually, use "rpm -ivh [package]". Do not
use "rpm -Uvh" as that will remove the running kernel binaries from
your system. You may use "rpm -e" to remove old kernels after
determining that the new kernel functions properly on your system.

proc: restrict access to /proc/PID/io

```
/proc/PID/io may be used for gathering private information.  E.g.  for
openssh and vsftpd daemons wchars/rchars may be used to learn the
precise password length.  Restrict it to processes being able to ptrace
the target process.

ptrace_may_access() is needed to prevent keeping open file descriptor of
"io" file, executing setuid binary and gathering io information of the
setuid'ed process.
