Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-2495:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the fact that the `/proc/PID/io` files were world-readable by default in the Linux kernel. This allowed any local, unprivileged user to read these files for any process and potentially gather private information about those processes. Specifically, the read and write character counts (`rchars/wchars`) in the `/proc/PID/io` files could be used to determine the exact length of passwords used in other processes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Leakage:** The primary vulnerability was the exposure of potentially sensitive I/O statistics.
*   **Insufficient Access Control:** The lack of proper access controls for `/proc/PID/io` files allowed unauthorized users to obtain process data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Password Length Disclosure:** Attackers could determine the exact length of passwords used in vulnerable processes such as `openssh` and `vsftpd`, which are used for sensitive data transfer over the network.
*   **Confidential Information Disclosure:** An unprivileged local user could gather confidential information from other processes via the `/proc/PID/io` interface.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** An attacker would need local access to a system to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **File Reading:** The attacker would read the `/proc/PID/io` files of target processes to obtain the I/O statistics.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Account:** The attacker would need a local user account to access the file system and read the `/proc/PID/io` files.
*   **No Elevated Privileges Required:** The attacker did not need root or elevated privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Target process running:** The target process must be running for the attacker to be able to read its `/proc/PID/io` file.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability was present because there was no access restriction placed on reading the `/proc/PID/io` files by any local user.
*   The fix involved restricting the access to the `/proc/PID/io` files to only users that can `ptrace` the target process.
