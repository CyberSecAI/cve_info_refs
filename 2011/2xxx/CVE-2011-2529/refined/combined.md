Package        : asterisk
Vulnerability  : multiple denial of service
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-2529 CVE-2011-2535
Debian Bug     : 631445 631446 631448

Paul Belanger reported a vulnerability in Asterisk identified as AST-2011-008
(CVE-2011-2529) through which an unauthenticated attacker may crash an Asterisk
server remotely. A package containing a null char causes the SIP header parser
to alter unrelated memory structures.

Jared Mauch reported a vulnerability in Asterisk identified as AST-2011-009
through which an unauthenticated attacker may crash an Asterisk server remotely.
If a user sends a package with a Contact header with a missing left angle
bracket (<) the server will crash. A possible workaround is to disable chan_sip.

The vulnerability identified as AST-2011-010 (CVE-2011-2535) reported about an
input validation error in the IAX2 channel driver. An unauthenticated attacker
may crash an Asterisk server remotely by sending a crafted option control frame.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.21.2~dfsg-3+lenny3.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6.2.9-2+squeeze3.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:1.8.4.3-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:1.8.4.3-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your asterisk packages.

| Product | Asterisk |
| Summary | Remote Crash Vulnerability in SIP channel driver |
| Nature of Advisory | Remote attacker can crash an Asterisk server |
| Susceptibility | Remote Unauthenticated Sessions |
| Severity | Critical |
| Exploits Known | Yes |
| Reported On | 06/15/2011 |
| Reported By | Paul Belanger pabelanger@digium.com |
| Posted On | 06/20/2011 |
| Last Updated On | June 16, 2011 |
| Advisory Contact | Kinsey Moore kmoore@digium.com |
| CVE Name | CVE-2011-2529 |

Ã‚

| Description | If a remote user sends a SIP packet containing a null, Asterisk assumes available data extends past the null to the end of the packet when the buffer is actually truncated when copied. Ã‚Â This causes SIP header parsing to modify data past the end of the buffer altering unrelated memory structures. Ã‚Â This vulnerability does not affect TCP/TLS connections. |

Ã‚

| Resolution | Asterisk now uses the correct length when dealing with SIP packets containing nulls. Ã‚Â Available workarounds are to disable chan\_sip or to upgrade. |
