    "description": "Information Disclosure vulnerability in the 802.11 stack, as used in FreeBSD before 8.2 and NetBSD when using certain non-x86 architectures. A signedness error in the IEEE80211_IOC_CHANINFO ioctl allows a local unprivileged user to cause the kernel to copy large amounts of kernel memory back to the user, disclosing potentially sensitive information.",
