Comments can have arbitrary tags added to them to help with filtering as well as mark comments as spam or abusive.Component
Components are second-level categories; each belongs to a particular Product. Select a Product to narrow down this list.Creation date
When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform

| **P2** | Fix in the next release cycle or the following (nightly + 1 or nightly + 2) |
| **P3** | Backlog |
| **P4** | Do not use. This priority is for the Web Platform Test bot. |
| **P5** | Will not fix, but will accept a patch |

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also
This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **defect** | regression, crash, hang, security vulnerability and any other general issue. |
| **enhancement** | new feature, improvement in UI, performance, etc. and any other request for user-facing changes and enhancements in the product; not engineering changes |
| **task** | refactoring, removal, replacement, enabling or disabling of functionality and any other engineering task |

URL
Bugs can have a URL associated with them - for example, a pointer to a web site where the problem is seen.Version
The version field defines the version of the software the bug was found in.Votes
Some bugs can be voted for, and you can limit your search to bugs with more than a certain number of votes. Votes are not used by Mozilla developers to set priorities.Whiteboard

User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:2.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0.1
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:2.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0.1
It is possible for unsigned scripts to call functions inside signed scripts on the same host and thus possibly execute code using expanded privileges. Possibly a regression from Firefox 3.6.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to <http://ebenda.org/2011/signed.call/>
2. click link
Actual Results:
Function a() inside signed jar is executed from unsinged page.
Expected Results:
Exception is raised.
Like Firefox 3.6.17 does: "Fehler: <<http://ebenda.org>> wurde die Erlaubnis für das Lesen der Eigenschaft Window.a verweigert.
Quelldatei: javascript:alert(window.frames[0].a('netscape.security.PrivilegeManager.enablePrivilege(\'UniversalXPConnect\');Components.classes[\'@mozilla.org/xre/app-info;1\'].getService(Components.interfaces.nsIXULRuntime).OS'));
Zeile: 1"
If privileges were granted to signer of the signed jar permanently before executing the attack, no confirmation dialog will occur.

Confirming in 4.0.1, this is a regression from Firefox 3.6 and before (caused by Compartments?). For some reason the permission dialog has an empty string for the site name. Haven't checked to see if this is an artifact of this testcase or if that got broken in 4.0.1 in general. The dialog says
A script from "" is requesting enhanced abilities that are UNSAFE
and could be used to compromise your machine or data:
Same thing on Aurora (Fx5)
Sort of confirming on 6.0a1 -- the site and jarred site are same-origin, but the enablePrivilege testcase doesn't work. Trying to inject an alert() into the jar: frame also fails with the same error, but you can still get at least simple code run in the frame.E.g. in the testcase you can't do
javascript:window.frames[0].a('alert(1)');void(0);
but you can
javascript:alert(window.frames[0].a('3+4'));void(0);
and get the answer '7' as computed inside the jar: frame.
Since we haven't fixed [bug 546848](/show_bug.cgi?id=546848 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - Remove support for enablePrivilege") yet even if we can't inject an enablePrivilege call we could still inject code into a context that is doing privileged stuff.
Calling this sg:critical because it's not too far-fetched that you could convince users to click on the dialog based on a site that the user already expects to do so, but in practical terms there may be few such sites to abuse.Status: UNCONFIRMED → NEWblocking2.0: --- → ?

The site string in the permission dialog is empty because I don't have an organizationName in my certificate as StartSSL™ Verified (Class 2) certificates do not inlcude organizationName. If organizationName is missing, Firefox uses the empty string (same in version 3.6 and every version before, I think).

This is a regression of MFSA 2008-23 (<http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2008/mfsa2008-23.html>), originally fixed in Firefox 2.0.0.15

This is fundamentally the same thing as the document.domain thing. The two pages are in the same compartment, so no security check is done at the boundary...
That said, why are they in the same compartment, exactly? They have different (unequal) principals all along... Blake?

Ah, because the compartment maps keys off the principal's URI only, not off the principal itself. I believe this was even discussed at the time, and dismissed for some reasons that seemed spurious...

> Why didn't the tests for the old bug catch this regression?
Because there weren't any. At the time we had no infrastructure for testing it, and when the infrastructure was created no one went back and created tests based on it. See all the dependencies of [bug 424488](/show_bug.cgi?id=424488 "RESOLVED FIXED - Need test infrastructure for testing signed jars") that are "in-testsuite?".

Proposed fix v1
This bit:
>+ // If either principal has no URI, it's the saved principal from
>+ // preferences; in that case, test true.
should only happen in the mCert != null case to keep the old code flow. It also needs to return true, which your changed version does not (which is why happening only when mCert is important: otherwise you'd return true when aOther is the system principal). I really wish we actually had tests for the capability preference stuff; they would have caught this....
That all applies to Equals. In the EqualsWithoutDomain() case, I think we can just skip this step because we shouldn't be calling EqualsWithoutDomain() on principals from prefs.
+ \*aResult =
+ NS\_SUCCEEDED(nsScriptSecurityManager::SecurityCompareURIs(mCodebase,
+ otherURI));
SecurityCompareURIs returns a PRBool. So this should be:
\*aResult = nsScriptSecurityManager::SecurityCompareURIs(mCodebase, otherURI);
Was this patch tested against this bug's steps to reproduce?
The code in xpc::PtrAndPrincipalHashKey::KeyEquals mixes 2 and 4 space indent. Pick one, please.

Proposed fix v2
>+ NS\_ASSERTION(otherURI && mCodebase,
>+ "shouldn't be calling this on principals from preferences");
That's bogus; otherURI can be null if aOther is a system principal. We want to return false in that case, which is what SecurityCompareURIs will do, so that's fine. But we can't assert anything about otherURI!
We can probably assert mCodebase, yes.
Should the new method be called equalsIgnoringDomain?
r=me with the nit above fixed.

1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
Mozilla released a round of security updates.
Mozilla Firefox was updated to version 6 on openSUSE 11.4,
Mozilla Firefox was updated to version 3.6.20 on openSUSE 11.3 and
SUSE Linux Enterprise 10 and 11.
Seamonkey was updated to 2.3 on openSUSE 11.3,11.4
Mozilla Thunderbird was updated to 3.1.2 on openSUSE 11.3,11.4.
Mozilla XULRunner was updated to 1.9.2.20.
The updates bring new features, fix bugs and security issues.
Mozilla Firefox 6:
<http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2011/mfsa2011-29.html>
Mozilla Firefox 3.6.20:
<http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2011/mfsa2011-30.html>
Mozilla Seamonkey 2.3:
<http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2011/mfsa2011-33.html>
Mozilla Thunderbird:
<http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2011/mfsa2011-32.html>
\* Miscellaneous memory safety hazards:
Mozilla identified and fixed several memory safety bugs in the
browser engine used in Firefox 4, Firefox 5 and other Mozilla-based
products. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption
under certain circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort
at least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.
Gary Kwong, Igor Bukanov, Nils and Bob Clary reported memory safety
issues which affected Thunderbird 3.1. (CVE-2011-2982)
Aral Yaman reported a WebGL crash which affected Firefox 4 and
Firefox 5. (CVE-2011-2989)
Vivekanand Bolajwar reported a JavaScript crash which affected
Firefox 4 and Firefox 5. (CVE-2011-2991)
Bert Hubert and Theo Snelleman of Fox-IT reported a crash in the
OGG reader which affected Firefox 4 and Firefox 5. (CVE-2011-2992)
Mozilla developers and community members Robert Kaiser, Jesse
Ruderman, moz\_bug\_r\_a4, Mardeg, Gary Kwong, Christoph Diehl, Martijn
Wargers, Travis Emmitt, Bob Clary and Jonathan Watt reported memory
safety issues which affected Firefox 4 and Firefox 5. (CVE-2011-2985)
\* Unsigned scripts can call script inside signed JAR
Rafael Gieschke reported that unsigned JavaScript could call into
script inside a signed JAR thereby inheriting the identity of the
site that signed the JAR as well as any permissions that a user
had granted the signed JAR. (CVE-2011-2993)
\* String crash using WebGL shaders
Michael Jordon of Context IS reported that an overly long shader
program could cause a buffer overrun and crash in a string class
used to store the shader source code. (CVE-2011-2988)
\* Heap overflow in ANGLE library
Michael Jordon of Context IS reported a potentially exploitable heap
overflow in the ANGLE library used by Mozilla's WebGL
implementation. (CVE-2011-2987)
\* Crash in SVGTextElement.getCharNumAtPosition()
Security researcher regenrecht reported via TippingPoint's Zero
Day Initiative that a SVG text manipulation routine contained a
dangling pointer vulnerability. (CVE-2011-0084)
\* Credential leakage using Content Security Policy reports
Mike Cardwell reported that Content Security Policy violation reports
failed to strip out proxy authorization credentials from the list
of request headers. Daniel Veditz reported that redirecting to
a website with Content Security Policy resulted in the incorrect
resolution of hosts in the constructed policy. (CVE-2011-2990)
\* Cross-origin data theft using canvas and Windows D2D
nasalislarvatus3000 reported that when using Windows D2D hardware
acceleration, image data from one domain could be inserted into a
canvas and read by a different domain. (CVE-2011-2986)
\* Privilege escalation using event handlers
Mozilla security researcher moz\_bug\_r\_a\_4 reported a vulnerability
in event management code that would permit JavaScript to be run
in the wrong context, including that of a different website or
potentially in a chrome-privileged context. (CVE-2011-2981)
\* Dangling pointer vulnerability in appendChild
Security researcher regenrecht reported via TippingPoint's Zero
Day Initiative that appendChild did not correctly account for DOM
objects it operated upon and could be exploited to dereference an
invalid pointer. (CVE-2011-2378)
\* Privilege escalation dropping a tab element in content area
Mozilla security researcher moz\_bug\_r\_a4 reported that web
content could receive chrome privileges if it registered for drop
events and a browser tab element was dropped into the content
area. (CVE-2011-2984)
\* Binary planting vulnerability in ThinkPadSensor::Startup
Security researcher Mitja Kolsek of Acros Security reported that
ThinkPadSensor::Startup could potentially be exploited to load a
malicious DLL into the running process. (CVE-2011-2980)
This issue affects probably only MS Windows.
\* Private data leakage using RegExp.input
Security researcher shutdown reported that data from other domains
could be read when RegExp.input was set. (CVE-2011-2983)
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please restart running instances of Mozilla Firefox/Thunderbird and/or seamonkey
after the update.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
"Online Update" module or the "zypper" commandline tool. The package and
patch management stack will detect which updates are required and
automatically perform the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.

To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

## Security issues addressed in SeaMonkey 2.3

Announced
August 16, 2011
Impact
Critical
Products
SeaMonkey
Fixed in

* SeaMonkey 2.3

### Miscellaneous memory safety hazards (rv:4.0)

Impact: Critical

Description: Mozilla identified and fixed several
memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in SeaMonkey 2.2 and other
Mozilla-based products. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption
under certain circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at least
some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

References:

**Aral Yaman** reported a WebGL crash which
affected SeaMonkey 2.2.

* [CVE-2011-2985](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-2985)

### Unsigned scripts can call script inside signed JAR

Impact: Critical

Description: **Rafael Gieschke**
reported that unsigned JavaScript could call into script inside a signed JAR
thereby inheriting the identity of the site that signed the JAR as well as any
permissions that a user had granted the signed JAR.

References:

* [CVE-2011-2993](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-2993)

### String crash using WebGL shaders

Impact: Critical

Description: **Michael Jordon** of
Context IS reported that an overly long shader program could cause a buffer
overrun and crash in a string class used to store the shader source code.

References:

* <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=665936>
* [CVE-2011-2988](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-2988)

### Heap overflow in ANGLE library

Impact: Critical

Description: **Michael Jordon** of
Context IS reported a potentially exploitable heap overflow in the ANGLE library
used by Mozilla's WebGL implementation.

References:

* <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=665934>
* [CVE-2011-2987](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-2987)

### Crash in SVGTextElement.getCharNumAtPosition()

Impact: Critical

Description: Security
researcher **regenrecht** reported via TippingPoint's Zero Day
Initiative that a SVG text manipulation routine contained a dangling pointer
vulnerability.

* [CVE-2011-0084](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-0084)

### Credential leakage using Content Security Policy reports

Impact: High

Description: **Mike Cardwell**
reported that Content Security Policy violation reports failed to strip out
proxy authorization credentials from the list of request headers. **Daniel
Veditz** reported that redirecting to a website with Content Security
Policy resulted in the incorrect resolution of hosts in the constructed
policy.

References:

* [CSP reports leak proxy auth tokens](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=664983)

### Cross-origin data theft using canvas and Windows D2D

Impact: High

Description: **nasalislarvatus3000**
reported that when using Windows D2D hardware acceleration, image data from one
domain could be inserted into a canvas and read by a different domain.

This bug must be resolved before the bugs listed in this field can be resolved.Bug ID
The numeric id of a bug, unique within this entire installation of Bugzilla.CC
Users who may not have a direct role to play on this bug, but who are interested in its progress.Changed
When this bug was last updated.Classification
Bugs are categorised into Classifications, Products and Components. classifications is the top-level categorization.Comment
Bugs have comments added to them by Bugzilla users. You can search for some text in those comments.Comment Tag
Comments can have arbitrary tags added to them to help with filtering as well as mark comments as spam or abusive.Component
Components are second-level categories; each belongs to a particular Product. Select a Product to narrow down this list.Creation date
When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform
This is the hardware platform against which the bug was reported (ARM, ARM64, x86, x86\_64, etc).Priority

| Priority | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | No decision |
| **P1** | Fix in the current release cycle |
| **P2** | Fix in the next release cycle or the following (nightly + 1 or nightly + 2) |
| **P3** | Backlog |
| **P4** | Do not use. This priority is for the Web Platform Test bot. |
| **P5** | Will not fix, but will accept a patch |

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also
This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2011-29

## Security issues addressed in Firefox 6

Announced
August 16, 2011
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox
Fixed in

* Firefox 6

### Miscellaneous memory safety hazards (rv:4.0)

Impact: Critical

Description: Mozilla identified and fixed several
memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox 4, Firefox 5 and other
Mozilla-based products. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption
under certain circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at least
some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

References:

**Aral Yaman** reported a WebGL crash which
affected Firefox 4 and Firefox 5.

* <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=674042> ([CVE-2011-2989](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-2989))

**Vivekanand Bolajwar** reported a JavaScript
crash which affected Firefox 4 and Firefox 5.

* <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=655660> ([CVE-2011-2991](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-2991))

**Bert Hubert**
and **Theo Snelleman** of Fox-IT reported a crash in the Ogg reader
which affected Firefox 4 and Firefox 5.

### Unsigned scripts can call script inside signed JAR

Impact: Critical

Description: **Rafael Gieschke**
reported that unsigned JavaScript could call into script inside a signed JAR
thereby inheriting the identity of the site that signed the JAR as well as any
permissions that a user had granted the signed JAR.

This is a distinct issue
from [MFSA 2008-23](/security/announce/2008/mfsa2008-23.html) and did
not affect Firefox 3.6.

References:

* <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=657267> ([CVE-2011-2993](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-2993))

### String crash using WebGL shaders

Impact: Critical

Description: **Michael Jordon** of
Context IS reported that an overly long shader program could cause a buffer
overrun and crash in a string class used to store the shader source code.

References:

* <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=665936> ([CVE-2011-2988](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-2988))

### Heap overflow in ANGLE library

Impact: Critical

Description: **Michael Jordon** of
Context IS reported a potentially exploitable heap overflow in the ANGLE library
used by Mozilla's WebGL implementation.

References:

* <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=665934> ([CVE-2011-2987](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-2987))

### Crash in SVGTextElement.getCharNumAtPosition()

Impact: Critical

Description: Security
researcher **regenrecht** reported via TippingPoint's Zero Day
Initiative that a SVG text manipulation routine contained a dangling pointer
vulnerability.

References:

* <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=648094> ([CVE-2011-0084](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-0084))

### Credential leakage using Content Security Policy reports

Impact: High

Description: **Mike Cardwell**
reported that Content Security Policy violation reports failed to strip out
proxy authorization credentials from the list of request headers. **Daniel
Veditz** reported that redirecting to a website with Content Security
Policy resulted in the incorrect resolution of hosts in the constructed
policy.

References:

* [CSP reports leak proxy auth tokens](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=664983)
* [Incorrect CSP host resolution](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=679588)
* [CVE-2011-2990](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-2990)

### Cross-origin data theft using canvas and Windows D2D

Impact: High

Description: **nasalislarvatus3000**
reported that when using Windows D2D hardware acceleration, image data from one
domain could be inserted into a canvas and read by a different domain.

References:

* <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=655836> ([CVE-2011-2986](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-2986))
