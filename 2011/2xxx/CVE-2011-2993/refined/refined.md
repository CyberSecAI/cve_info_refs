Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-2993:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an issue in how Firefox handles permissions when unsigned JavaScript interacts with signed JavaScript within a JAR file. Due to a flaw in compartment mapping, unsigned scripts were able to call functions inside signed scripts, effectively inheriting the permissions of the signed JAR.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Compartment Mapping:** The core issue lies in how Firefox's compartment system maps keys, using only the principal's URI and not the principal itself. This caused scripts from different origins to be placed in the same compartment when they should have been isolated, violating same-origin policy.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The ability of unsigned JavaScript to call functions in signed scripts allowed for potential privilege escalation. The unsigned scripts could execute code with the elevated permissions granted to the signed JAR.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By calling functions inside a signed JAR, an attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the signed code.
*   **Security Bypass:** This vulnerability could bypass security restrictions by allowing unsigned scripts to access privileged functionalities.
*   **Data Theft:** With elevated permissions, the attacker might be able to steal sensitive data accessible to the signed JAR.
*   **Machine Compromise:** If the signed JAR has access to system resources or sensitive information, this could potentially be used to compromise the user's machine or data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Website:** An attacker would need to host a malicious webpage containing unsigned JavaScript, which targets a site hosting a vulnerable signed JAR.
*   **User Interaction:** The attack might involve tricking a user into clicking a link or interacting with the malicious website.
*   **Signed JAR Exploitation:** The exploit relies on the presence of a signed JAR on the same domain as the malicious unsigned script, and where that signed JAR contains exploitable code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Host a Webpage:** The attacker needs the capability to host a webpage containing the malicious, unsigned JavaScript.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Signed JARs:** The attacker needs to be aware of sites using signed JARs that are vulnerable to this type of cross-origin privilege escalation.

**Additional Technical Details (From Bugzilla comments):**

*   The vulnerability was a regression from Firefox 3.6 and earlier.
*   The permission dialog displayed an empty string for the site name due to the missing `organizationName` field in the certificate used by the test case (though this is not a root cause).
*   The root cause was the compartment system mapping keys based on URI rather than the principal object.
*   The fix involved modifying the principal comparison logic to properly distinguish between principals.
*   A test case was added to prevent future regressions.
*   The fix was implemented in Firefox 6 and not backported to Firefox 5 due to time constraints.
