[00:35] two pillars the first is uh zero day
[00:38] vulnerability affecting every Internet
[00:41] Explorer version and working on every
[00:44] Windows BX and the second is an advanced
[00:48] use of checking attack and I'm going to
[00:51] talk about this later in the speech okay
[00:55] uh we have a very little time and a lot
[00:57] of things to talk about so um few words
[01:00] about myself um I am an IT professional
[01:02] working in a mobile company based in
[01:05] Rome Italy and I'm focusing on very
[01:09] services so I'm not a security
[01:11] professional I I started researching on
[01:15] security especially security issues
[01:17] about four years ago and since then
[01:19] there was bunch of advisories and
[01:22] Concepts along wish I like to mention V
[01:25] connection which was the first ever
[01:26] across the main EXs world it was able to
[01:29] spread amongst the four most popular web
[01:32] mail providers
[01:33] in U an advisory about mobile framework
[01:37] framework is web framework produced by
[01:39] cryto company um it's quite widespread
[01:43] the vulnerability was about the
[01:46] possibility for an attacker to send an
[01:47] email to the victim the victim by just
[01:49] opening the email could modify the out
[01:53] of four door settings so that any for
[01:56] email received by the victim were
[01:58] automatically forward to the T
[02:00] uh another advisory was related to
[02:02] Windows Med player uh it was a b that
[02:05] allowed to perform information gathering
[02:07] both on victim local machine and both on
[02:09] victim local internet some kind of INF
[02:12] scan and last year the last advisory was
[02:14] about PL Pro for vulnerability in
[02:18] ales this is the URL my of my blog you
[02:22] can check it out for list of my work
[02:25] okay uh let's start talking about intern
[02:28] explor security zones this is because
[02:30] the zero dat found is a bug in the
[02:34] security zones management intern
[02:37] contr basically uh security zones are a
[02:41] proprietary
[02:42] mechanism that Microsoft introduced in
[02:45] their browser line in order to let the
[02:47] user Define an appropriate level of
[02:49] security for each web content uh
[02:52] basically an Internet Explorer any site
[02:54] is assigned to a security Zone and all
[02:57] Sites belonging to the same security
[02:59] Zone behave in the same way according to
[03:01] security
[03:03] privileges um by default there are five
[03:06] predefined security zones and they are
[03:09] here from the the more privileged to the
[03:12] less privileg and they are local machine
[03:13] Zone that applies to any content from
[03:16] your local machine local internet Zone
[03:18] that applies to content from your local
[03:21] internet I mean areation and access the
[03:26] internet to a proxy um this appes
[03:29] content that is sered from an within the
[03:31] exclusion list of the proxy settings and
[03:34] it also applies to any content using UNC
[03:38] PS then side zone is a list the user may
[03:42] decide to put some some proc domain in
[03:45] uh then there is the internet
[03:48] Zone from the web and theist side Zone
[03:52] works it's it's like process Zone but
[03:54] works in the opposite way so the sites
[03:56] are are red a minimum number of cles
[04:00] uh users cannot add or delete security
[04:03] zones but can uh modify the association
[04:07] between security Zone and security
[04:09] privileges and this can be done using
[04:11] security
[04:12] profiles uh the security profile profile
[04:16] basically is a collection of security
[04:18] pre that can be assigned to a security
[04:20] Zone um user me between uh sorry
[04:26] predefined security profiles I mean high
[04:28] medium medum low
[04:30] or
[04:32] can or can customize each security
[04:35] profile by editing each previl contained
[04:38] in the file there are a lot of
[04:40] privileges which you can play with I
[04:43] mean activate execution uh file
[04:47] downloading user
[04:48] authentication scripting language
[04:50] execution and cross Zone interaction
[04:53] cross Zone interaction occurs when two
[04:56] web contant belonging to different zones
[04:59] try to interact with each
[05:01] other uh the association between zones
[05:03] and profiles can be uh can be modified
[05:06] going into the security tab of the tools
[05:08] option Internet Explorer by the you will
[05:11] see that only four security Zone zones
[05:14] are visible uh this zone is it's called
[05:17] my computer but it's local machine zone
[05:19] is by default hien because uh basically
[05:23] it manages the way that browser should
[05:25] behave when opening local files so it's
[05:27] quite sensitive Microsoft doesn't want
[05:29] you to mess around with this
[05:30] configuration you can make this visible
[05:33] by changing register
[05:36] key okay we we were talking a while ago
[05:39] about proc interaction how it works uh
[05:43] by rle of t uh a web content assigned to
[05:47] a a less privileged Zone could not
[05:50] interact with a Content assigned to a
[05:53] more privileged zone for instance if we
[05:57] set up a simple web page and find frame
[06:00] instead of it can set the source of this
[06:01] Frame to a lot of file on our machine as
[06:04] soon as this we page is rendered within
[06:06] the browser an access denied error will
[06:09] be
[06:10] raising uh so in this scenario the pro
[06:13] interaction policy well so it should be
[06:16] impossible for a web content to access
[06:18] machine file at least it should be
[06:21] because it turns out that one of the
[06:23] most sensitive folder in your machine is
[06:25] the only one folder that can be
[06:28] accessible from other zones
[06:30] and this is the folder that contains all
[06:32] your
[06:33] cookies if we slightly modify the code
[06:35] of the web page and set the source of
[06:38] the ey frame to the cookie path cookie
[06:41] path here we will see that the cookie
[06:45] content will be actually rendered inside
[06:47] frame okay this is an obvious violation
[06:50] of person
[06:51] interaction because we are accessing a
[06:54] local content from an Internet domain
[06:57] you see URL we on internet
[07:00] okay uh what kind of cookie what kind of
[07:03] content let's say could you access with
[07:06] with this approach any kind of
[07:09] cookie um as long as it belong to the
[07:12] user currently logged over the Windows
[07:14] machine you cannot access cookie
[07:15] belonging to other users but as long as
[07:19] the current user is concerned you can
[07:21] access any kind of cookies I mean HTP
[07:24] only cookie secure cookie whatever the
[07:25] website because in this scenario they
[07:27] are just they they lose their security
[07:30] characterization they're just managed as
[07:32] normal
[07:33] files uh this is a zero day
[07:36] vulnerability and works on inter 6 78
[07:41] and also with nine u I've tested it on
[07:45] Windows Serv 3 Windows Vista and Windows
[07:48] 7 okay just bit just a bit of history of
[07:52] this closure uh being zero vulnerability
[07:55] I pr to disclos to Microsoft security
[07:58] Response Center by the end of January
[08:01] and at that time internet 9 beta was out
[08:05] and was affected by this vulnerability
[08:07] by the middle of March Microsoft
[08:09] delivered the first official release of
[08:11] Internet Spore 9 and they were able to
[08:14] catch this vulnerability so in about a
[08:17] month they they were able to deliver a
[08:19] safer BR verion okay uh I should add
[08:23] until now because uh a couple of weeks
[08:26] ago I found a quick work around in order
[08:29] to Microsoft protection basically
[08:32] instead of directly accessing the cookie
[08:36] content using file schema it's enough to
[08:39] access um it through a a remote CGI for
[08:43] instance a pro script that does nothing
[08:45] except from redirecting dur your brother
[08:47] to the local file local file so what
[08:52] happen here is that in this redirection
[08:56] process the cross Zone interaction
[08:58] policy seems can be no more important so
[09:01] basically even in Internet Square line
[09:03] we are able to display cookies inside
[09:06] frames
[09:10] okay okay where do we go from here we
[09:13] have an approach we have a
[09:15] technic that allows us to low arbitrary
[09:18] cookies within an iame but we still miss
[09:21] a way to exploit this vulnerability
[09:24] because if we programmatically try to
[09:26] access the cookie content we are blocked
[09:28] by same
[09:30] policy um for instance if we try
[09:32] statement like this okay get me the
[09:35] inner HTML of my same orgin policy us
[09:40] just let me speed about same orgin
[09:42] policy if necessary same orgin policy
[09:44] it's uh security policy enforced in in
[09:48] all browsers that states more or less
[09:51] this uh two
[09:53] contents could not interact
[09:55] grammatically with each other unless the
[09:58] the domains the port and po are the
[10:01] same uh yeah we have the maximum Maxim
[10:04] same to be honest is quite more
[10:07] complicated in this but in order to
[10:09] comprehensively talk about the same
[10:11] policy will take us more than a day so
[10:13] for the presentation scope is just
[10:14] enough so we need a way to access the
[10:17] content without triggering the same
[10:19] origin Poli moreover there is there is a
[10:22] second issue uh we need to guess to
[10:25] guess the victim the name because we
[10:27] need to properly Define the I frame
[10:30] source in order to properly Define
[10:31] theame source we need the
[10:33] username if you notice here in the the
[10:38] the complete cookie Path U in the string
[10:42] the username of course twice the first
[10:44] time in the cookies folder and the
[10:46] second time in file name itself okay so
[10:48] we need the username another thing we
[10:51] need is no is to know the operative
[10:55] system version the vitim is running
[10:58] because different operative system store
[11:00] cookies in different folders forance 6p
[11:02] store cookies in doed setting use the
[11:05] main cookies B7 in a completely
[11:08] different
[11:09] folder okay so in order to solve the
[11:12] first issue uh let's move talking on the
[11:14] other topic of the presentation I inan
[11:16] click
[11:19] jacking Okay click jacking is
[11:21] a is a technic that was introduced in
[11:25] 2008 by Robert hen and jerman
[11:29] it's all about two things uh ey frames
[11:32] and St shs uh through a clever use of ey
[11:37] frames overlapping and um St
[11:41] transparency an attacker May trick a
[11:43] victim into clicking on some resource I
[11:45] mean a button or link while this click
[11:48] is actually hijacked by third party a
[11:51] frame uh let's look at the basic
[11:54] approach uh let's suppose that uh the
[11:57] blue canvas here is the attack web page
[12:00] okay the attacker can find a button and
[12:03] an frame this frame for instance loads
[12:06] some content from a third party Lo page
[12:08] okay this is quite
[12:09] leg um there are three things that the T
[12:13] can control first it can control the
[12:16] absolute position of the frame within
[12:19] his web page so it can proper position
[12:23] the frame to be over the botton second
[12:26] you can control the the size of the
[12:28] frame
[12:29] with so that uh the the iame shape
[12:34] perfectly fits the button shape third
[12:37] you can control three important
[12:39] properties of the Styles sheet applied
[12:41] to the frame or to the we p and these
[12:44] properties are opacity and and Z index
[12:48] uh opacity is about how the frame is
[12:51] transparent so opacity of zero means
[12:54] that frame is completely hi while
[12:56] opacity of 100 means that f scenario is
[12:59] fully
[13:01] visible the other property is z
[13:04] index Z index is about the position of
[13:08] the frame on a theorical z axis coming
[13:10] out of the screen uh so Z index of of
[13:15] zero applied to the web page and Z index
[13:17] of one applied to the frame uh mean that
[13:21] the uh the frame is actually above the
[13:23] ATT page but it's hidden so when a
[13:27] victim tries to click over the bottom is
[13:29] actually not clicking on the bottom but
[13:31] it's clicking on the frame so on some
[13:32] other resources containing in the frame
[13:35] okay so you are in some way foring some
[13:37] clicks what kind of attacks you can do
[13:39] with this approach Pro forgery and drive
[13:42] to the ls for instance in the last
[13:45] couple of year we have seen a bunch of
[13:47] real life attacks using
[13:50] leveraging especially on social networks
[13:53] such as
[13:54] Facebook um and the we aim at to forge C
[13:59] on some link I mean add a friend a
[14:01] little friend post something on on my
[14:03] wall and so on uh last year a security
[14:06] resarch Poon in a previous security
[14:09] conference introduced an advanced
[14:12] checking scenario that called content
[14:14] extraction uh basically this is the
[14:16] scenario uh an attacker May trick a
[14:19] victim into selecting selecting some
[14:23] content from a legiate
[14:26] party and using dve and drop approach
[14:29] can trick his victim to drag it out the
[14:32] frame and drop it into a
[14:34] controlment the aim of this attack what
[14:37] is obviously to steal some sensitive
[14:40] content from the third party frame it's
[14:43] important to notice that as long with
[14:45] the content itself using the drop and
[14:47] drop functionalities also um links and
[14:51] images can be automatically converted
[14:54] into URLs and this is pretty available
[14:56] for an Factor because often especially
[14:59] in authenticated domains U URLs contain
[15:02] s IDs tokens and elements like this that
[15:05] can be that can be very useful for an
[15:08] attacker in order to perform s Runing
[15:11] attacks let's have a look on how how uh
[15:14] works the content extraction technique
[15:17] uh let's suppose that this canvas here
[15:19] is the attacker web page the attacker
[15:21] talk about simple gaming which asks is
[15:23] victim to drag some content for instance
[15:26] a mon somewhere on the screen uh
[15:30] using a cck jacking approach there is an
[15:33] frame that is hidden and it's above the
[15:36] mon itself that Lo some content from a
[15:38] third party domain this is the third
[15:40] party domain uh another thing is is
[15:44] quite important is is that the attacker
[15:46] can programmatically control the
[15:48] relative position of the frame into the
[15:50] third party page so it can
[15:53] programmatically position the frame to
[15:55] be uh at the start at the end or
[15:58] somewhere in the middle of the content
[16:00] that te intend to steal so the attack
[16:02] scenario start with the attacker
[16:04] positioning the ey frame at the start of
[16:07] the country want to Ste uh then he asked
[16:10] the victim okay drug the mo where the
[16:13] victim starts drug this event is
[16:15] intercepted by the attacker the attacker
[16:17] programmatically moves the ey frame to
[16:20] the end of the cont that int Ste so in
[16:22] position be and this is happening while
[16:25] the victim is dragging the the content
[16:28] down with Mouse button clicked so the
[16:30] final effect is that the all the Tex
[16:32] between A and B is been
[16:35] selected then the victim start stops
[16:37] clicking this event is intercepted once
[16:39] again and the attacker moves the
[16:42] position of the frame somewhere in the
[16:44] middle of the selected content for
[16:46] instance in the red
[16:47] area then the attacker asks once again
[16:50] the victim to dve their content
[16:51] somewhere else for instance in this area
[16:54] here okay this may be whatever added B
[16:57] htl element forance de frame text box
[17:00] okay uh by performing this second drag
[17:03] action what the victim is doing is not
[17:06] only draging but draging the selected
[17:09] content contained in the in Daily frame
[17:13] okay so from the this moment on the
[17:15] attacker can
[17:16] control all the uh the
[17:19] text okay so what we have until now uh
[17:24] we have zero vulnerability that allows
[17:27] us to load arbitrary
[17:29] into KN uh we have a a Content
[17:34] extraction technique that allows us to
[17:37] select some content from within an frame
[17:39] and drag it out into an control element
[17:43] the idea is let's make my shop and chain
[17:46] these two attacks in order to build a
[17:48] first pro
[17:50] concept uh in my first pro concept I
[17:53] talk about a simple game in which I
[17:56] asked my Victim to drug a b into a
[18:00] basket from a technical point of view
[18:02] there is an frame a frame that BLS
[18:07] cooking and the frame has an opacity of
[18:10] zero so it's completely even uh and has
[18:14] index one so it's above the B the B
[18:18] image then there is a b image that is
[18:20] overlap on the frame as a an opacity of
[18:23] zero so it's fully visible but has an
[18:27] index of zero so it's uh basically under
[18:31] uh the so using a contraction technque
[18:34] when I ask my Victim to drag the ball
[18:36] it's actually not selecting the B but
[18:38] it's selecting the cookie using some
[18:40] JavaScript trick sorry I'm able to uh to
[18:45] mask the cookie text content and
[18:48] to substitute it with some other I'll
[18:52] let to show this in action if it works
[19:23] turn don't do
[19:27] that that's all
[19:47] okay SP
[19:49] so okay
[20:06] fine
[20:10] okay okay the the idea was to drag the
[20:13] ball into the basket I show you how the
[20:16] cookie will be displayed uh
[20:19] unfortunately I'm not able to show
[20:22] you okay
[20:26] go let's go back
[20:36] okay okay uh even using an approach like
[20:39] this fortunately I can show you uh we
[20:42] have a couple of issue more that we need
[20:45] to solve in order to build reliable
[20:48] explo uh and they are they are both
[20:51] about drug and drop functionality uh
[20:54] basically drug and drop AP uh doesn't
[20:58] work well cross an internet explor
[21:00] browser uh so in order to build pro cont
[21:05] that works on every browser we need to
[21:07] some C Dr the second uh two different
[21:11] drugging actions are required in in
[21:14] content extraction approach the first in
[21:16] order to select the content and the
[21:18] second in order to drag the content out
[21:20] and drop into an attack Control
[21:23] El let's uh uh let's see how it's
[21:26] possible to solve these two issues
[21:29] okay about drag and drop U drag and drop
[21:32] is commonly acknowledged as one of the
[21:34] biggest innovation of HTML file uh to be
[21:38] honest it's not quite part of HTML F
[21:41] specification uh the the current
[21:44] implementation of Dr drop di can be Tred
[21:47] back from original Microsoft
[21:49] implementation that was supported in
[21:51] Internet Explorer 5 and no longer
[21:54] supported in the following releases I
[21:56] mean the situation is that Internet
[21:58] Explorer
[21:59] six seven and8 doesn't fully support uh
[22:02] drug and drop there are some content
[22:04] that you are able to drug to drug and
[22:06] drop and other that you you are not able
[22:08] to so in order to F relable it's useful
[22:12] to find a custom Dr impation I found a
[22:16] custom implementation of his domain uh
[22:18] that works well across any internet
[22:21] score versions and also in Modzilla and
[22:24] web browsers and um it allows you to a
[22:28] lot of
[22:30] effects image I mean change the the
[22:34] image while you are driving some content
[22:36] or changing the mar the cursor shape
[22:38] when you are overing over dropping area
[22:40] or ding area and so
[22:44] on okay about content extraction I want
[22:48] to show you how it's possible to steal
[22:51] uh content from domain uh using only a
[22:55] single Dr action okay uh this is the
[22:58] best
[22:59] uh this is the T we page the T the T
[23:02] defines two Nest diaph frames okay the
[23:05] first contains nothing except from the
[23:07] secondary frame and the secondary frame
[23:09] contains the cookie text
[23:11] using show before uh in order this
[23:15] approach to work it's important to uh
[23:19] Define to properly Define the two the
[23:21] two frame sizes in order that scrolling
[23:24] is needed for the the cookie content to
[23:26] come into view and this is visible if
[23:29] you
[23:30] uh if you define very different aids for
[23:34] the 2A frame for instance frame is 100
[23:38] and the second frame is 500 so which is
[23:40] the sequence uh the sequence is the
[23:43] victim starts click over the cookie um
[23:47] as soon this happen the on Focus event
[23:50] is triggered on the area frame and the
[23:52] scroll speed of the I frame a is set to
[23:55] a big value okay uh so so the frame a
[24:00] starts to scroll down and the B content
[24:02] com to VI and this is happening while
[24:05] the victim is clicking down so while the
[24:08] victim is clicking and content is
[24:10] scrolling up the final effect is that is
[24:13] that as long as the the victim continues
[24:17] to click it continues also to select
[24:20] content so what we have done we have
[24:23] collapsed the first drag action into a
[24:25] single click so we have a click and drag
[24:29] action in start with two different drag
[24:31] action okay let's that this works i'
[24:35] like to show this
[24:59] not like
[25:09] today don't worry about okay
[25:16] it it was no doesn't work okay uh but I
[25:21] can show you I can show you uh
[25:37] video okay this was the first pro
[25:39] concept that I want to show you was
[25:42] about
[25:43] the the dring action okay I'm loged into
[25:48] Gmail I open my broadcast page I have
[25:52] bought the ball and bought the I frame
[25:55] here with the same opacity okay uh so
[25:59] just if you talk the opacity this is the
[26:02] real life attack scenario I see only the
[26:04] B when I start to drag you see the Dr
[26:08] Big
[26:09] Image the final eff is that I'm not
[26:11] dragging the the ball I'm dragging I'm
[26:15] dragging the cookie okay now with the
[26:18] mix opacity you can see what it happens
[26:21] basically as I start to drag the bow I
[26:24] select the cookie and then the cookie is
[26:27] dro attack
[26:29] controlment okay this is the basic
[26:31] approach okay let's stop
[26:37] it stop
[26:41] please let's go
[26:53] back okay uh at this point we scored
[26:57] another another another point we we are
[26:59] able to uh optimize content extraction
[27:03] in order to uh drag some content only a
[27:08] single D we still miss the victim usern
[27:10] name
[27:12] okay in order to steal the victim
[27:14] username we're going to exploit a
[27:17] feature of Internet Explorer that was
[27:19] already discussed last year by another
[27:24] researcher uh basically Internet
[27:26] Explorer let you access uh some
[27:28] resources over SMB shares remote SMB
[27:31] shares using
[27:33] UNC uh UNC uh notation to access this
[27:38] cont so basically if you if you define a
[27:42] tag inside your web page for image and
[27:45] set the source of this image with back
[27:48] SL slash IP back SL image uh the the
[27:53] browser is able to retrieve this image
[27:55] when you are uh browsing in Internet Z
[27:58] and internet z
[28:02] um what's the process that the ruting
[28:05] process like first the browser tries to
[28:08] anonymously access the uh the remote
[28:11] server share if the anous access is
[28:14] denied then an nlm challenge respon
[28:17] negotiation start and as a part of this
[28:19] negotiation the browser sent to the
[28:21] server Windows username Windows computer
[28:24] name and Windows domain name in here in
[28:28] clear text so it's quite easy to steal
[28:31] this victim name because you can put
[28:34] script forance first script that on the
[28:37] server side that sneaks all the traffic
[28:39] on TC Port 445 it's supported by protol
[28:44] so at this point we are able to load
[28:47] cookie internet frame um access this
[28:51] Cookie by extracting it using the
[28:54] functionality optimize content
[28:56] extraction and get guess
[28:58] usern name uh there is another point
[29:02] that we need to guess victim o victim is
[29:05] quite simple Vic is contained in
[29:10] JavaScript object called user Navigator
[29:13] User it's basically a part of the user
[29:15] agent that browser stands in every HTP
[29:17] request so you can pass the user agent
[29:20] and look for Windows NT 5.1 then it's
[29:25] the victim is running an XP machine if
[29:27] it's NT 6.0 then it's miss machine
[29:31] otherwise it's machine okay so we got
[29:34] all the points uh another valuable
[29:36] information is to understand if the
[29:39] cookie we are going to steal is valid
[29:42] because uh it's important because if the
[29:46] victim is not authenticated is not not a
[29:49] valid session of Target website the
[29:51] cookie we are going to Ste maybe it's
[29:53] expired so it's not useful to steal so
[29:57] uh we could probe a user victim to look
[30:01] for it if it's authenticated over over
[30:04] Target website and we can do this using
[30:08] aing approach outlined by ger sem AG
[30:13] basically you can force addicting
[30:14] browser into retrieving some contents
[30:16] for instance Imes scripts and so on that
[30:19] are only available for authenticated
[30:21] users uh so for instance here I try to
[30:25] retrieve a PNG from Google that only
[30:28] available if the victim is authenticated
[30:30] over GMA okay otherwise theor condition
[30:33] will raised will be raised and I know
[30:35] that maybe the cookie I'm retrieving
[30:37] from Google domain is not valid uh this
[30:41] this this scenario gives the attacker
[30:43] the possibility to perform a dynamic
[30:47] attack setup in which it first probs the
[30:50] victim over a Ser Ser of number a given
[30:54] number of domain Target domain and then
[30:56] only for authenticated the domain Define
[30:59] a different number of frames depend on
[31:01] the number of cookie that you want to
[31:04] steal uh the Assumption here is that one
[31:07] I frame is able to load one cookie as I
[31:10] show you
[31:12] before okay so we have all the missing
[31:16] Point here okay we solved all of them
[31:19] and we are ready to uh to give a look at
[31:23] the final offline of the attack the
[31:25] attack starts there is a victim of side
[31:28] obiously and the attacker on the right
[31:30] side the the victim starts browsing over
[31:33] attacker web page inside of this web
[31:36] page there is an image tag that is
[31:40] pointing to a remote smv
[31:42] share uh the image is trying to retrieve
[31:45] is a non-existent image is D image uh
[31:48] but when the browser tries to retrieve
[31:50] this image it sends to the server the
[31:53] windows username uh the username is
[31:55] captured on the server side by the
[31:57] capture script and stored on on a text
[32:01] file on the server side and then theor
[32:04] condition is raised because the this was
[32:07] a nonexistent image so on the eror event
[32:11] the browser is redirected to a second
[32:13] perar script uh this P script reads the
[32:16] username from the text file on the
[32:19] server side and redirect once again the
[32:22] browser to the final to concept page uh
[32:25] this page uh has a static part in the
[32:28] URL and the dynamic part the dynamic
[32:30] part is the ash part of the and the ash
[32:32] part of the URL contains the username so
[32:36] what what the victims get is is a custom
[32:38] Pro concept page in which it username is
[32:41] contained in Das part of the URL okay um
[32:46] okay uh so the victim can be cookie jaed
[32:49] and send the cookie to the attacker okay
[32:54] uh now I finished it with the theory and
[32:56] I should start with the practice
[32:58] uh so when prop is concerned I'm glad to
[33:02] introduce you Denise I choose Denise for
[33:05] my as a subject for my concept because
[33:08] according to google she is the most of
[33:10] the web um and you know I need in order
[33:13] to drink a user I need an appealing
[33:15] content I need some content which the
[33:17] user would willingly interact with so uh
[33:21] I'm I'm
[33:23] [Music]
[33:24] very unfortunately I can't you live but
[33:28] I show you a video about
[33:31] this
[33:33] okay okay
[33:38] um okay this is the server side on the
[33:41] server side there is the script the
[33:43] Snips all the traffic on the port 445
[33:47] okay start
[33:48] from now I move on the trer
[33:51] side we are on Windows 6p internet
[33:54] explor 7 okay I am S I have a session on
[33:58] Twitter Facebook and Gmail okay now I lo
[34:03] the pro concept okay okay solve the jigo
[34:07] to watch things naked Okay seems
[34:09] promising so I start playing uh let's go
[34:13] back at okay on the side I captur the
[34:17] windows the vitim username
[34:20] T okay and the
[34:22] string is contained in dash part of the
[34:26] URL you see
[34:28] so this Pro concept is specially
[34:30] targeted for the
[34:31] B uh what we have here we have four I
[34:35] frames behind each frame there is a
[34:38] cookie you see that the the cursor shape
[34:40] where over over the Mage it turns the
[34:42] the the cursor shape from an arrow to a
[34:45] text elector okay so we are managing we
[34:48] are interacting with the cookie and when
[34:51] I when I start
[34:52] dragging there is the feedback image
[34:54] that tricks the Mage into believing
[34:58] okay but
[35:00] under the cookies you see Twitter
[35:05] Google
[35:08] Facebook
[35:12] [Applause]
[35:22] Facebook even we
[35:26] see okay uh go back to the
[35:30] [Music]
[35:38] presentation for conclusions okay I
[35:41] showed you a new kind of user interface
[35:43] address attack uh that is able to
[35:46] exploit
[35:47] ziling every expor verion on every
[35:50] Windows box it allows you to steal
[35:53] session cookies without need of any
[35:55] subcription vulnerability in the taret
[35:57] website
[35:58] it's website independent because it's
[36:00] browser flow uh and it can be stoed by
[36:04] current current cont measures that
[36:06] websit are putting into use to stop
[36:08] checking because these measures are aim
[36:11] to prevent framing uh in this scenario
[36:14] we are not framing some web content we
[36:16] are framing a lot of files so this is
[36:19] completely
[36:19] useless uh what I show you well I should
[36:23] show you u a couple of HTML Pro concept
[36:27] think about what you can do using flesh
[36:29] technology in order to to build a more
[36:32] attractive Pro concept uh in my opinion
[36:36] this is supposed to to last for a long
[36:39] time even if after Microsoft we release
[36:42] a patch because you know there is a huge
[36:44] customer base affect and there are a lot
[36:46] of people who who don't really download
[36:48] security updates so I think it's quite
[36:51] useful to share knowledge about this
[36:52] vulnerability to inform people that
[36:55] droing content over the Internet would
[36:57] be very
[37:00] okay thank you all for your attention if
[37:02] you have any
[37:06] questions have you tried any
[37:09] of the Dragon drop through I show object
[37:14] talk Dr you tried any of your techniques
[37:16] for Flash lso object no not tried I've
[37:20] not tried I only use the HTML and was
[37:23] great for the concept I'm not a fles guy
[37:27] let's say but maybe the lso is in
[37:30] another directory so it's not possible
[37:33] to exract uh them because you don't have
[37:37] access on all the file system no no no
[37:40] if you exit from the the the the cookie
[37:43] folder of the current user you can
[37:44] access otherwise all the machine could
[37:46] be compromised you can steal some file
[37:48] or some other very sensitive information
[37:51] apart from
[37:53] this a bug let's see a design
[37:56] implementation of
[37:58] Internet Explorer is that Internet
[37:59] Explorer doesn't store cookies in in a
[38:02] random folder while for instance line
[38:05] Chrome Define random folders and random
[38:08] pads for the cookies and this could be a
[38:13] an implementation that stops this kind
[38:14] of but even if even internet sare
[38:18] 9 store stores spookie in PR folder so
[38:22] if you know the windows us and if you
[38:24] know which which version of operative
[38:26] system R you're able to uh to uh Target
[38:30] this cookie okay
[38:37] thank question okay thank you
[38:41] [Applause]

A security researcher has devised an attack that remotely steals digital credentials used to access user accounts on Facebook and other websites by exploiting a flaw in Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser.

Independent researcher Rosario Valotta demonstrated his “cookiejacking” proof of concept last week at the [Hack in the Box](http://conference.hackinthebox.org/hitbsecconf2011ams/?page_id=1388) security conference in Amsterdam. It exploits a flaw that's present in all current versions of IE to steal session cookies that Facebook and other websites issue once a user has entered a valid password and corresponding user name. The cookie acts as a digital credential that allows the user to access a specific account.

The proof of concept code specifically targets cookies issued by Facebook, Twitter and Google Mail, but Valotta said the technique can be used on virtually any website and affects all versions of Windows.

“You can steal any cookie,” he told *The Register*. “There is a huge customer base affected (any IE, any Win version).”

The attack exploits a vulnerability in the IE security zones feature that allows users to segregate trustworthy websites from those they don't know or don't ever want to access. By embedding a special iframe tag in a malicious website, an attacker can circumvent this cross zone interaction and cause the browser to expose cookies stored on the victim's computer.

The exploit requires the attacker to accomplish a variety of difficult tasks, including knowing where on a hard drive cookies are stored (it can be slightly different for various versions of Windows) and knowing the victim's Windows username.

Valotta's exploit incorporates techniques developed by researchers including one by Jorge Medina that manipulates file-sharing functionality built into IE to transmit the Windows username in plain text. It also borrows an advanced form of [clickjacking](https://www.theregister.com/2008/09/16/critical_vulnerability_demo_pulled/), known as drag & drop content extraction, which was demonstrated last year by Paul Stone.

A video of Valotta's attack in action is below.

“It is complicated for the attacker but not for the victim,” Valotta said.

Microsoft spokesman Pete Voss issued a statement that read in part:

"We are aware of an issue that could enable theft of a user's cookies if they were convinced to visit a malicious website and once there, further convinced to click and drag items around on the page. Given the level of required user interaction, this issue is not one we consider high risk in the way a remote code execution would possibly be to users."

He also said attackers can steal cookies only from websites the victim is logged into. He went on to say users should avoid suspicious links.

Valotta said he first alerted members of Microsoft's security team in January. He said the company intends to patch the vulnerability in a series of updates tentatively scheduled for June and August. ®
