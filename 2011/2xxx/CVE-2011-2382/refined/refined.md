A cross-zone interaction bypass allows access to the local files despite security zone restrictions. Clickjacking and drag & drop content extraction to exfiltrate cookie data. Exploitation of UNC paths to leak Windows username via SMB shares.  The exploit works across all versions of Internet Explorer (6,7,8,9) and Windows (XP, Vista, 7)."
