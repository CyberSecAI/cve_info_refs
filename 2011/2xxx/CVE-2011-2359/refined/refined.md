Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-2359:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a failure in Google Chrome to properly track line boxes during rendering. This leads to a "stale pointer" issue.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stale Pointer:** The core issue is a stale pointer, which arises from improper management of line boxes during rendering.
*   **Memory Management Error:** Underlying this is a memory management error related to the rendering process, leading to the stale pointer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause a denial of service by triggering the stale pointer, likely leading to a browser crash or hang.
*   **Unspecified Impact:** The vulnerability could potentially have other unspecified impacts beyond DoS, suggesting the possibility of more severe consequences like arbitrary code execution, although this is not confirmed.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The attack can be carried out remotely via a website.
*   **Unknown Vectors:** The specific vector that triggers the stale pointer is not explicitly defined but it relates to rendering of content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** The attacker needs to be able to serve content to the victim using a webpage or other web technology.
*   **Browser Interaction:** The user has to interact with the content in such a way that the rendering error occurs.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability was present in Google Chrome and is also mentioned in the context of the Debian chromium-browser package.
* It was fixed in Chrome 13.0.782.107, Debian chromium-browser version 6.0.472.63~r59945-5+squeeze6 (stable), 13.0.782.220~r99552-1 (testing/unstable).
* The vulnerability was discovered and reported by miaubiz and Martin Barbella, and Google provided a $1000 reward for its discovery.
