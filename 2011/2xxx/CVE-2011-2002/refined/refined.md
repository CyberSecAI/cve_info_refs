Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2011-2002:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the Windows kernel-mode driver's (win32k.sys) improper handling of the TrueType font type translation. Specifically, the system doesn't correctly process a specially crafted TrueType font file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper input validation: The driver fails to adequately validate the TrueType font data.
- Denial of Service: A specially crafted font file can lead to a denial of service.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can cause the affected system to stop responding (crash/freeze), requiring a restart.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network share: An attacker can host a malicious TrueType font file on a network share. When a user navigates to this share using Windows Explorer, the Details or Preview pane can trigger the vulnerable code path.
- Web-based attacks: An attacker can host a website containing a specially crafted TrueType font file, attempting to lure the user into visiting the site.
- Compromised Websites/advertisements: Similarly, compromised websites or websites accepting user-provided content can contain malicious font files.
- Email/IM: An attacker can send a link via email or instant message to the malicious webpage or file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to host a malicious TrueType font file on a network share, website, or send via email.
- Requires a user to interact with the malicious file/link by visiting the share, website, or opening the attachment.

**Additional Notes:**
- The document mentions that the file sharing protocol SMB is often disabled on perimeter firewalls, limiting remote attack vectors.
- A workaround is provided to disable the WebClient service which helps block the most likely remote attack vector via the Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) client service.
- The Exploitability Index for this vulnerability was rated as '2', indicating that exploitation is less likely but still possible.
