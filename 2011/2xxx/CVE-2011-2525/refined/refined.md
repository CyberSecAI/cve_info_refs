{
  "CVE-2011-2525": {
    "Description": "A flaw allowed the tc_fill_qdisc() function in the Linux kernel's packet scheduler API implementation to be called on built-in qdisc structures. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to trigger a NULL pointer dereference, resulting in a denial of service.",
    "Root cause": "The `tc_fill_qdisc()` function was incorrectly called on built-in qdisc structures.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "NULL pointer dereference",
      "Incorrect function call on specific data structures"
    ],
     "Impact": "A local, unprivileged user can cause a denial of service.",
    "Attack vector": "Local access",
     "Required capabilities": "Local, unprivileged user"
  }
