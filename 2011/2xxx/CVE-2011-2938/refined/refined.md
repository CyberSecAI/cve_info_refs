{
  "CVE-2011-2938": {
    "description": "MantisBT versions prior to 1.2.7 are vulnerable to multiple XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) vulnerabilities. The search.php script does not properly sanitize user-supplied parameters before displaying them in output. This vulnerability could be exploited to inject malicious scripts into the web application.",
    "affected_component": "search.php",
    "root_cause": "The `filter_api.php` file passes user-supplied search parameters back into output without properly escaping the values.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Cross-site scripting (XSS) due to lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied search parameters in `filter_api.php`.",
      "Multiple other parameters were also affected, not just the `project_id`.",
        "The provided content confirms the XSS vulnerability in `search.php`. The initial report also mentions a SQL injection vulnerability but is marked as not reproducible."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web application that can be executed by users, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions. The vulnerability allows the execution of arbitrary web scripts.",
    "attack_vector": "The attacker crafts a malicious URL with XSS payload in the search parameters of `search.php`.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to craft and deliver a malicious URL to a user of the MantisBT application. No special access is required other than knowledge of the vulnerable parameters.",
      "additional_details": "The vulnerability is present in MantisBT versions prior to 1.2.7. The fix involves sanitizing user inputs before displaying them in output."
