- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers with privileged access could obtain sensitive user information like password hashes and ticket correspondence history. This information could potentially be used for further attacks or unauthorized access.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves leveraging privileged user accounts within the RT system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have a privileged user account within the RT system to exploit these vulnerabilities.

**Additional Details**

- This vulnerability affects RT versions 3.0 and above.
- Patches and updated versions (3.8.12 and 4.0.6) were released to address this and other security issues.
