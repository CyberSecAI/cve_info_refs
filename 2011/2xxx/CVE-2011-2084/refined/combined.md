This release, in addition to being a bugfix release, also resolves a
number of security vulnerabilities.  It resolves CVE-2011-2082,
CVE-2011-2083, CVE-2011-2084, CVE-2011-2085, CVE-2011-4458,

 * Remove CSS3PIE, which simply added rounded corners on IE7 and IE8, as
   it was causing numerous crashes of IE.
 * Show the current status in the status dropdown during ticket update,
   to allow forced setting of the status.  This functionality was
   available in RT 3.8, and is now being reinstated.
 * Use SearchBuilder queue limits to restrict what statuses and owners
   are displayed in drop-downs.
 * Make "New Ticket" a top-level SelfService menu item.
 * Display Lifecycle column correctly in queue admin lists.
 * Allow >64k attributes on MySQL; this is particularly useful for
   logos uploaded via the theming editor.
 * Remove two dependencies from the RT mailgate.
 * Adding new arbitrary links to tickets now works as expected in the
   REST interface.
 * Subject: lines in Forward Ticket templates are now respected.
 * Sort ticket link numbers numerically, not alphabetically.
 * Ticket reminders are no longer copied when creating a linked ticket;
   article and <http://> links now are, however.
 * Use relative links (with no hostname) more consistently.
 * Correctly deal with non-ASCII attachment filenames which make use of
   MIME parameter value continuations.
 * Find queue-level CFs first in REST interface when there are
   duplicates by name.
 * Fix graphing of searches which reference Updated and other
   transaction-based limits.
 * Reminder statuses on open and resolve are now configurable
   per-lifecycle.
 * Fix quoting of CF names containing dashes and the like in the
   SearchBuilder.
 * Bump URI dependency to ensure utf8 URLs are correclty generated in
   Dashboard emails.
 * Permit <bdo> and language attributes when scrubbing HTML.

A complete changelog is available from git by running:
  git log rt-4.0.5..rt-4.0.6

# [rt-announce] Security vulnerabilities in RT

```
Internal audits of the RT codebase have uncovered a number of security
vulnerabilities in RT.  We are releasing versions 3.8.12 and 4.0.6 to
resolve these vulnerabilities, as well as patches which apply atop all
released versions of 3.8 and 4.0.

The vulnerabilities addressed by 3.8.12, 4.0.6, and the below patches
include the following:

The previously released tool to upgrade weak password hashes as part of
CVE-2011-0009 was an incomplete fix and failed to upgrade passwords of
disabled users.  This release includes an updated version of the
`vulnerable-passwords` tool, which should be run again to upgrade the
remaining password hashes.  CVE-2011-2082 is assigned to this
vulnerability.

RT versions 3.0 and above contain a number of cross-site scripting (XSS)
vulnerabilities which allow an attacker to run JavaScript with the
user's credentials.  CVE-2011-2083 is assigned to this vulnerability.

RT versions 3.0 and above are vulnerable to multiple information
disclosure vulnerabilities.  This includes the ability for privileged
users to expose users' previous password hashes -- this vulnerability is
particularly dangerous given RT's weak hashing previous to the fix in
CVE-2011-0009.  A separate vulnerability allows privileged users to
obtain correspondence history for any ticket in RT.  CVE-2011-2084 is
assigned to this vulnerability.

All publicly released versions of RT are vulnerable to cross-site
request forgery (CSRF), in which a malicious website causes the browser
to make a request to RT as the currently logged in user.  This attack
vector could be used for information disclosure, privilege escalation,
and arbitrary execution of code.  Because some external integrations may
rely on RT's previously permissive functionality, we have included a
configuration option ($RestrictReferrer) to disable CSRF protection.  We
have also added an additional configuration parameter
($ReferrerWhitelist) to aid in exempting certain originating sites from
CSRF protections.  CVE-2011-2085 is assigned to this vulnerability.

We have also added a separate configuration option
($RestrictLoginReferrer) to prevent login CSRF, a different class of
CSRF attack where the user is silently logged in using the attacker's
credentials.  $RestrictLoginReferrer defaults to disabled, because this
functionality's benign usage is more commonly relied upon and presents
less of a threat vector for RT than many other types of online
applications.

RT versions 3.6.1 and above are vulnerable to a remote execution of code
vulnerability if the optional VERP configuration options ($VERPPrefix
and $VERPDomain) are enabled.  RT 3.8.0 and higher are vulnerable to a
limited remote execution of code which can be leveraged for privilege
escalation.  RT 4.0.0 and above contain a vulnerability in the global
$DisallowExecuteCode option, allowing sufficiently privileged users to
still execute code even if RT was configured to not allow it.
CVE-2011-4458 is assigned to this set of vulnerabilities.

RT versions 3.0 and above may, under some circumstances, still respect
rights that a user only has by way of a currently-disabled group.
CVE-2011-4459 is assigned to this vulnerability.

RT versions 2.0 and above are vulnerable to a SQL injection attack,
which allow privileged users to obtain arbitrary information from the
database.  CVE-2011-4460 is assigned to this vulnerability.

In addition to releasing RT versions 3.8.12 and 4.0.6 which address
these issues, we have also collected patches for all releases of 3.8 and 4.0
into a distribution available for download at this link:

<http://download.bestpractical.com/rt/release/security-2012-05-22.tar.gz>

The README in the tarball contains instructions for applying the
patches.  If you need help resolving this issue locally, we will provide
discounted pricing for single-incident support; please contact us at

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
