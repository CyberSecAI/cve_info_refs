Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-2930 CVE-2011-2931 CVE-2011-3186 CVE-2009-4214

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Rails, the Ruby web
application framework. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:

CVE-2009-4214

    A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability had been found in the
    strip_tags function. An attacker may inject non-printable characters
    that certain browsers will then evaluate. This vulnerability only
    affects the oldstable distribution (lenny).

CVE-2011-2930

    A SQL injection vulnerability had been found in the quote_table_name
    method could allow malicious users to inject arbitrary SQL into a
    query.

CVE-2011-2931

    A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability had been found in the
    strip_tags  helper. An parsing error can be exploited by an attacker,
    who can confuse the parser and may inject HTML tags into the output
    document.

CVE-2011-3186

    A newline (CRLF) injection vulnerability had been found in
    response.rb. This vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary
    HTTP headers and conduct HTTP response splitting attacks via the
    Content-Type header.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.1.0-7+lenny1.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.5-1.2+squeeze1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.14.

We recommend that you upgrade your rails packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

There is a vulnerability in the strip\_tags helper in Ruby On Rails, using specially crafted output an attacker can successfully inject HTML into the document. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-YYYY-XXXX.

Versions Affected: All.
Fixed Versions: 3.0.10, 2.3.13, 3.1.0.rc5

Impact
------
The strip\_tags helper in Ruby on Rails is designed to remove all HTML tags from a string. By using specially crafted values an attacker can confuse the parser and cause HTML tags to be injected into the response. This can be exploited to inject arbitrary javascript into the rendered page.

Future releases of Ruby on Rails are likely to replace the current HTML tokenizer with one provided by libxml to reduce the likelihood of errors such as these in the future. In the meantime users can install the loofah gem[1] which should enhance both the performance and reliability of the HTML sanitization helpers.

All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the work arounds immediately.

Releases
--------
The 3.0.10, 2.3.13 and v3.1.0.rc5 releases are available at the normal locations.

Workarounds
-----------

Users running a release of rails prior to 3.0 can work around this issue by escaping the result of strip\_tags. Replacing:

<%= strip\_tags(params[:user\_content]) %>

with

<%=h strip\_tags(params[:user\_content]) %>

Users running 3.0 or later will have to take an additional step to ensure that the output is correctly escaped.

<%= strip\_tags(params[:user\_content]) %>

must be replaced with

<%=h strip\_tags(params[:user\_content]).to\_str %>

Users running a 2.3 application with the rails\_xss plugin installed are advised to upgrade as there is no feasible workaround.

Patches
-------
To aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided patches for the two supported release series. They are in git-am format and consist of a single changeset.

\* 2-3-strip\_tags.patch - Patch for 2.3 series
\* 3-0-strip\_tags.patch - Patch for 3.0 series
\* 3-1-strip\_tags.patch - Patch for 3.1 series

Please note that only the 2.3.x and 3.0.x series are supported at present. Users of earlier unsupported releases are advised to upgrade as soon as possible.

Credits
-------

Thanks to Sascha Depold for reporting the vulnerability to us and working with us to verify the fix.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=731436#c0)  Vincent Danen    2011-08-17 16:40:19 UTC  ``` An XSS vulnerability in the strip_tags helper in Ruby on Rails was reported [1] where, using specially crafted output, an attacker can successfully inject HTML into the document, which can be used to inject arbitrary javascript into the rendered page.  This is corrected in upstream 3.0.10, 2.3.13, and 3.1.0rc5 versions.  Patches are available in the advisory [1] and in git [2].  [1] <http://groups.google.com/group/rubyonrails-security/browse_thread/thread/2b9130749b74ea12> [2] <https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/586a944ddd4d03e66dea1093306147594748037a>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=731436#c2)  Vincent Danen    2011-08-17 17:22:49 UTC  ``` This flaw is rubygem-actionpack, not rubygem-rails.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=731436#c3)  Vincent Danen    2011-08-17 17:26:15 UTC  ``` Created rubygem-actionpack tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 731448](show_bug.cgi?id=731448 "CLOSED ERRATA - rubygem-actionpack various flaws [fedora-all]")] Affects: epel-5 [[bug 677629](show_bug.cgi?id=677629 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2011-0446 CVE-2011-0447 rubygem-actionpack various flaws [epel-5]")]   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=731436#c5)  Vincent Danen    2011-08-30 04:18:58 UTC  ``` This issue has been assigned the name CVE-2011-2931:  <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/08/19/11>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=731436#c6)  Huzaifa S.

Subject: Re: CVE request: ruby on rails flaws (4)

Sorry, there is one more flaw that needs a CVE assignment:

Response splitting flaw in 2.3.x (3.0.0 and later not affected).
<http://groups.google.com/group/rubyonrails-security/browse_thread/thread/6ffc93bde0298768>
<https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/11dafeaa7533be26441a63618be93a03869c83a9>
<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=732156>

Sorry I missed this one earlier, I was looking at the 3.x advisory page and missed this one.
