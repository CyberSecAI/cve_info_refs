This document provides information about multiple vulnerabilities affecting various Oracle products, which are addressed in the Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2011. The document also references CVE-2011-2287.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The document indicates multiple vulnerabilities within various Oracle products and components. Specific root causes for each are not detailed in this document, but the document references a stack buffer overflow in the Oracle Outside In CorelDRAW file parser (VU#103425) which is associated with CVE-2011-2287.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
* Multiple vulnerabilities exist across various Oracle products and components.
* Vulnerabilities include remote execution of arbitrary code, information disclosure, and denial of service.
*  Specifically, there's a stack buffer overflow in Oracle Outside In's CorelDRAW file parser, which is a specific vulnerability addressed by the patch.

**Impact of exploitation:**
* Remote execution of arbitrary code
* Information disclosure
* Denial of service
* Potential access to sensitive information on compromised databases

**Attack vectors:**
* Vulnerable components may be accessible to unauthenticated, remote attackers.
* An attacker could exploit the vulnerabilities remotely.
* The specific buffer overflow vulnerability can be triggered through a malformed CorelDRAW file, parsed using the vulnerable Outside In component.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*  Remote access to vulnerable Oracle components is often sufficient.
*  For the buffer overflow, the attacker needs to provide a specially crafted CorelDRAW file.
