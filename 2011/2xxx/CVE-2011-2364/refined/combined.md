seamonkey security update (RHSA-2011-0888)

Original Release Date: July 11, 2011

Last Revised: July 11, 2011

Number: ASA-2011-201

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 1.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

SeaMonkey is an open source web browser, email and newsgroup client, IRC
chat client, and HTML editor.

A flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey handled malformed JPEG images. A
website containing a malicious JPEG image could cause SeaMonkey to crash
or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
running SeaMonkey. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2011-2377](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-2377.html) to this issue.

Multiple dangling pointer flaws were found in SeaMonkey. A web page
containing malicious content could cause SeaMonkey to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
SeaMonkey. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names [CVE-2011-0083](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0083.html), [CVE-2011-0085](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0085.html) and [CVE-2011-2363](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-2363.html) to these issues.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could cause SeaMonkey to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
SeaMonkey. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names [CVE-2011-2364](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-2364.html), [CVE-2011-2365](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-2365.html), [CVE-2011-2374](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-2374.html), [CVE-2011-2375](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-2375.html) and [CVE-2011-2376](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-2376.html) to these issues.

An integer overflow flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey handled JavaScript
Array objects. A website containing malicious JavaScript could cause
SeaMonkey to execute that JavaScript with the privileges of the user
running SeaMonkey. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2011-2371](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-2371.html) to this issue.

A use-after-free flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey handled malformed
JavaScript. A website containing malicious JavaScript could cause SeaMonkey
to execute that JavaScript with the privileges of the user running
SeaMonkey. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2011-2373](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-2373.html) to this issue.

It was found that SeaMonkey could treat two separate cookies as
interchangeable if both were for the same domain name but one of those
domain names had a trailing "." character. This violates the same-origin
policy and could possibly lead to data being leaked to the wrong domain.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2011-2362](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-2362.html) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security advisory issued by Red Hat:

## 2. Avaya System Products using a modified version of RHEL4 with affected components/packages installed: | Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | Avaya Message Networking | 3.1 | Low | Upgrade to MN 5.2 or later. |

**Recommended Actions for System Products:**
Avaya strongly recommends that customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place, risk to Avaya
products and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as an Avaya provided
product update or the recommended Avaya action is applied.
Further restrictions as deemed necessary based on the
customer's security policies may be required during this
interim period, but customers should not modify the System Product
operating system or application unless the change is approved by Avaya.
Making changes that are not approved may void the Avaya product service contract.

### Mitigating Factors:

When determining risk, Avaya takes into account many factors as
outlined by Avaya's
[Security Vulnerability Classification Policy](https://support.avaya.com/css/P8/documents/100066674).
The following table describes factors that mitigate the risk of specific
vulnerabilities for affected Avaya products:

| Vulnerability | Mitigating Factors |
| --- | --- |
| CVE-2011-0083 CVE-2011-0085 CVE-2011-2362 CVE-2011-2363 CVE-2011-2364 CVE-2011-2365 CVE-2011-2371 CVE-2011-2373 CVE-2011-2374 CVE-2011-2375 CVE-2011-2376 CVE-2011-2377 | Low risk as no critical system applications or processes would be affected and would require non-standard user interaction. |

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be. Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and then follow
that vendor's guidance.

| Product: | Actions: |
| --- | --- |
| Avaya Aura® Application Enablement Services 4.x/5.x | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the AES application. |
| CVLAN | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite (IMS) | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. |
| Avaya Aura® Presence Services | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the PS application. |
| Avaya Aura® System Manager 1.0 | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the SMGR application. |
| Voice Portal | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the Voice Portal application. |

**Recommended Actions for Software-Only Products:**
In the event that the affected package is installed, Avaya recommends that customers follow recommended actions supplied by Red Hat regarding their Enterprise Linux.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2011-19

## Miscellaneous memory safety hazards (rv:3.0/1.9.2.18)

Announced
June 21, 2011
Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox 3.6.18
* Firefox 5
* SeaMonkey 2.2
* Thunderbird 3.1.11

### Description

Mozilla developers identified and fixed several memory safety bugs
in the browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based
products. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption
under certain circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

### References

Bob Clary, Kevin Brosnan, Nils, Gary Kwong, Jesse Ruderman and
Christian Biesinger reported memory safety problems that were fixed in
clients based on mozilla5 and mozilla-1.9.2 (e.g. Firefox 5 and

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 2.0

Advisory Status: Final

## 1. Overview:

Mozilla Firefox is an open source web browser. XULRunner provides the XUL
Runtime environment for Mozilla Firefox.

A flaw was found in the way Firefox handled malformed JPEG images. A
website containing a malicious JPEG image could cause Firefox to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2011-2377](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-2377.html) to this issue.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names [CVE-2011-2364](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-2364.html), [CVE-2011-2365](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-2365.html), [CVE-2011-2374](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-2374.html), [CVE-2011-2375](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-2375.html) and [CVE-2011-2376](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-2376.html) to these issues.

An integer overflow flaw was found in the way Firefox handled JavaScript
Array objects. A website containing malicious JavaScript could cause
Firefox to execute that JavaScript with the privileges of the user running
Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2011-2371](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-2371.html) to this issue.

A use-after-free flaw was found in the way Firefox handled malformed
JavaScript. A website containing malicious JavaScript could cause Firefox
to execute that JavaScript with the privileges of the user running Firefox.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2011-2373](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-2373.html) to this issue.

It was found that Firefox could treat two separate cookies as
interchangeable if both were for the same domain name but one of those
domain names had a trailing "." character. This violates the same-origin
policy and could possibly lead to data being leaked to the wrong domain.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2011-2362](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-2362.html) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security advisory issued by Red Hat:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0885.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products using a modified version of RHEL with affected packages installed: | Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | Avaya IQ | 4.x, 5.x | None | See Mitigating Factors table below. | | Avaya Message Networking | 5.2 thru 5.2.3 | Low | Upgrade to Message Networking 5.2.4 or later. | | Avaya Messaging Storage Server | 4.0, 5.2 thru 5.2.9 | Low | Upgrade to Messaging Storage Server 5.2.10 or later. | | Avaya Aura® Presence Services | 6.0, 6.1, 6.1.1 | None | Upgrade to Presence Services 6.1.2 or later. See Mitigating Factors table below. | | Avaya Aura® Session Manager | 1.1, 5.x, 6.0.x, 6.1.x | None | Upgrade to Session Manager 6.2 or later. See Mitigating Factors table below. | | Avaya Aura® System Manager | 5.x, 6.x | None | See Mitigating Factors table below. |

**Recommended Actions for System Products:**
Avaya strongly recommends that customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place, risk to Avaya
products and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as an Avaya provided
product update or the recommended Avaya action is applied.
Further restrictions as deemed necessary based on the
customer's security policies may be required during this
interim period, but customers should not modify the System Product
operating system or application unless the change is approved by Avaya.
Making changes that are not approved may void the Avaya product service contract.

### Mitigating Factors:

When determining risk, Avaya takes into account many factors as
outlined by Avaya's
[Security Vulnerability Classification Policy](https://support.avaya.com/css/P8/documents/100066674).
The following table describes factors that mitigate the risk of specific
vulnerabilities for affected Avaya products:

| Vulnerability | Mitigating Factors |
| --- | --- |

3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please close and restart all running instances of MozillaFirefox after the update.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
"Online Update" module or the "zypper" commandline tool. The package and
patch management stack will detect which updates are required and
automatically perform the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

[testcase2 (crashes 1.9.2)](attachment.cgi?id=527659)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=527659&action=edit)

The following was reported to security@m.o by rh01@z1p.biz. There are several crash signatures that were observed, but the worst looking one is the one in this bug's summary:
[bp-f9041a36-322d-498e-b9bb-ef4142110419](https://crash-stats.mozilla.org/report/index/f9041a36-322d-498e-b9bb-ef4142110419) (caused by testcase2)
There may be more than one bug here. The rest of rh0's email follows:

Hello Brandon,
Thanks for your answer. The modified testcase is in the attachment "testcase2.html". There is even a third distinct crash when starting it.
This testcase led to the following crashes, which are to my opinion 3 distinct ones:

Crash type A: 13),1) access violation execute
Crash type B: 9),8),4)
access violation read at 0x20
Crash type C: 12),11),10),7),6),5),3),2) access violation write at 0x0
Crash A is maybe the most dangerous one. Though i don't know exactly how to trigger all three differently.
Here are some scenarios i tried:
Load testcase -> switch on firebug -> crash
Switch on firebug -> load testcase -> sometimes a crash -> if no crash occurs => access dom panel -> crash
I think the worst crash (type A) is mostly triggered when starting firefox again after the crash.
Sometimes it loads the tabs automatically which were opened in the last session, which leads to a new crash, as it tries to load the testcase aswell.
This is crash A. (Firebug is automatically switched on in this case)
Can this automatic reopening be set? (except in the general option tab "when firefox starts").
Please keep me informed. For bugzilla I use the address rh01@z1p.biz. As soon as the bug is
filed, can I access it over my account ? Please let me know if you need something else to proceed. I will still look if other similar testcases trigger the crashes more precisely and/or the issue can be triggered without firebug and/or exploited.
Thank you and regards,
Rh0

Attached file
[testcase3](attachment.cgi?id=527662)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=527662&action=edit)

With Firebug installed, the reporter says he can reproduce the js\_TraceScript crash reliably with testcase3, e.g.:
[bp-0eb1e014-319a-4ad1-8f66-6283a2110419](https://crash-stats.mozilla.org/report/index/0eb1e014-319a-4ad1-8f66-6283a2110419)
-----
Hello Brandon,
with the following testcase (testcase3.html) I was able to trigger almost always the access execution violation, when trying the following several times
1) Open Firefox
2) double click testcase file (=> firefox loads testcase without crash)
3) click on firebug icon
4) after a period of hanging firebug appears in the bottom half without crashing
5) click anywhere in the firefox or firebug window or on a firebug panel (dom/script)
6) crash
Firebug was set to "On for All Web Pages" and was always in minimized mode.
If Firefox crashes at step 2 or 4 , it is the NULL pointer write attempt, otherwise almost always the access execution violation.
Crash IDs (access execution violation):

In my testing the break condition in the 2nd for loop in testcase3 can be reduced from 16 (n <= 16) to 6 (n <= 6).
Then there is no hanging anymore in step 4, firebug appears immediately in the bottom half.
Then clicking the DOM panel of firebug (step 5) results in a hang period with a crash afterward (at js\_TraceScript)

I tried to reproduce this, and I got it to crash once, with testcase3 I think, but when I tried to make it crash again so I could debug it, I couldn't get it to crash any more.

With testcase3 (modified: [comment 2](/show_bug.cgi?id=651990#c2 "RESOLVED FIXED - Investigate crash [@ js_TraceScript]")) on WinXP SP3 (~2GB Ram assigned in VirtualBox OSE Version 3 ,Host: Debian 6.0) 8 of 10 crashes are at js\_TraceScript. On native Windows Vista (2GB RAM)I observed "only" JSScope::add crashes (write attempt at 0x0)
[bp-90443242-b019-4e49-9856-84a022110423](https://crash-stats.mozilla.org/report/index/90443242-b019-4e49-9856-84a022110423)

On a low hardware netbook (1GB RAM) with native Windows 7 it hangs for minutes but finally crashes (JSScope::add)
[bp-3fa77111-719b-4d07-b183-6663f2110423](https://crash-stats.mozilla.org/report/index/3fa77111-719b-4d07-b183-6663f2110423)
On Ubuntu 10.04 on VirtualBox (512MB RAM) i get a SIGKILL signal, no crash reporter comes up.
There's always a crash, after accessing the DOM Panel. If nothing "happens" clicking into the empty firefox window makes firefox unresponsive and ends with a crash.

Thanks for the reply. I was able to repro with the change. I'm fairly sure this particular instance is an OOM crash and not sg:critical. The invalid-exec crashes still concern me a bit. I think they are probably ultimately caused by OOMs as well, so maybe fixing the OOMs will fix those.

To [comment #5](/show_bug.cgi?id=651990#c5 "RESOLVED FIXED - Investigate crash [@ js_TraceScript]")
I agree that the access violation read and access violation write are maybe not critical. According to <https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security_Severity_Ratings> I would consider at least the access execution violation as critical (execution of random memory). There are also fixed bugs, which were critical although they were OOM crashes (e.g.: 608336 , 583077 , 607160 ) So i think an OOM can still be critical. Please correct me if I am wrong.

I agree with you. By "this instance", I meant the exact crash address + access type + source location that I crashed on. But the exec versions are sg:critical.

Notes:
1. Fx4 is confirmed unaffected: it has the OOM check added by the patch.
2. I'm pretty sure there is a bug in Firebug being hit here, so that should probably be reported as well.

I don't see how this patch could possibly fix the EXCEPTION\_ACCESS\_VIOLATION\_EXEC. In the old code where you didn't null-check slots you should immediately crash on the following line
\*slots++ = nslots;
I guess you aren't claiming it does, but then we can't say "Fx4 is confirmed unaffected" based on it having this null check. We can only say Fx4 is not susceptible to the patched crash, which doesn't look like it matches any of the signatures that Rh01 is reporting.

Then there are probably multiple bugs here. The patch for the one I was able to repro, using testcase3.html modified per [comment 2](/show_bug.cgi?id=651990#c2 "RESOLVED FIXED - Investigate crash [@ js_TraceScript]"). It seems likely that we could OOM in various places and fail to detect that, leading to different crash signatures. I will see if I can reproduce the exec violation crash myself.

I can't get any of the test cases to crash with my patch applied. It clearly fixes a bug, so I'd like to land that, then let rh01 test again and see if there's anything left.

To 1.:
There is another issue related to this here, but it affects not only the 1.9.2 but also the 2.0 branch of mozilla firefox, so I filed it as new bug: [bug 654002](/show_bug.cgi?id=654002 "RESOLVED FIXED - Stack overflow with signs of memory corruption (under nsContainerFrame::RemoveFrame)")
To 2.:
I reported this issue also as firebug problem: <http://code.google.com/p/fbug/issues/detail?id=4410>

I just realized i could use the nightly builds. I tested 3.6.18pre:
<http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/latest-mozilla-1.9.2/firefox-3.6.18pre.en-US.win32.installer.exe>
and got to crash it once at all, but at js\_TraceScript:

bc, can you run the crash automation over the test scripts here with both 3.6.17 or before, and also latest 3.6.18 under the following:
1) no firefug
2) firebug installed but not running
3) firebug installed and running
to see if we can get some consistent results.
If there is a consistent crash that's exploitable still we need to stay on this bug or open up new ones.
then we probably need to do the same testing with mozilla-central builds related to [bug 654002](/show_bug.cgi?id=654002 "RESOLVED FIXED - Stack overflow with signs of memory corruption (under nsContainerFrame::RemoveFrame)").
tomcat if you can test by hand that might also help to answer some of these questions.

* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [firefox](/security/cves?package=firefox) - safe and easy web browser from Mozilla
* [xulrunner-1.9.2](/security/cves?package=xulrunner-1.9.2) - XUL + XPCOM application runner

## Details

Multiple memory vulnerabilities were discovered in the browser rendering

engine. An attacker could use these to possibly execute arbitrary code with

the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2011-2364](/security/CVE-2011-2364), [CVE-2011-2365](/security/CVE-2011-2365),

[CVE-2011-2374](/security/CVE-2011-2374), [CVE-2011-2376](/security/CVE-2011-2376))

Martin Barbella discovered that under certain conditions, viewing a XUL

document while JavaScript was disabled caused deleted memory to be

accessed. An attacker could potentially use this to crash Firefox or

execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.

([CVE-2011-2373](/security/CVE-2011-2373))

Jordi Chancel discovered a vulnerability on multipart/x-mixed-replace

images due to memory corruption. An attacker could potentially use this to

crash Firefox or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user

invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2011-2377](/security/CVE-2011-2377))

Chris Rohlf and Yan Ivnitskiy discovered an integer overflow vulnerability

in JavaScript Arrays. An attacker could potentially use this to execute

arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.

([CVE-2011-2371](/security/CVE-2011-2371))

Multiple use-after-free vulnerabilities were discovered. An attacker could

potentially use these to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the

user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2011-0083](/security/CVE-2011-0083), [CVE-2011-0085](/security/CVE-2011-0085), [CVE-2011-2363](/security/CVE-2011-2363))

David Chan discovered that cookies did not honor same-origin conventions.

This could potentially lead to cookie data being leaked to a third party.

([CVE-2011-2362](/security/CVE-2011-2362))

Users who may not have a direct role to play on this bug, but who are interested in its progress.Changed
When this bug was last updated.Classification
Bugs are categorised into Classifications, Products and Components. classifications is the top-level categorization.Comment
Bugs have comments added to them by Bugzilla users. You can search for some text in those comments.Comment Tag
Comments can have arbitrary tags added to them to help with filtering as well as mark comments as spam or abusive.Component
Components are second-level categories; each belongs to a particular Product. Select a Product to narrow down this list.Creation date
When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform
This is the hardware platform against which the bug was reported (ARM, ARM64, x86, x86\_64, etc).Priority

| **P1** | Fix in the current release cycle |
| **P2** | Fix in the next release cycle or the following (nightly + 1 or nightly + 2) |
| **P3** | Backlog |
| **P4** | Do not use. This priority is for the Web Platform Test bot. |
| **P5** | Will not fix, but will accept a patch |

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also
This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
