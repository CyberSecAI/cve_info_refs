Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2011-2008:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is caused by improper input validation within the Host Integration Server when processing specially crafted network traffic. Specifically, it involves an access of unallocated memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper input validation when handling network traffic.
- Access of unallocated memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service. This can cause the affected SNA Server service and all its dependent services (snabase.exe, snaserver.exe, snalink.exe, or mngagent.exe) to stop responding to new requests. The vulnerability does not allow code execution or privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the vulnerable server.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- The attacker can be remote.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is rated as "Important" for all affected versions of Microsoft Host Integration Server.
-  Microsoft was not aware of active exploitation of this vulnerability at the time of the security bulletin's release.
- Workarounds include blocking TCP ports 1477 and 1478 and UDP port 1478 at the firewall.

This vulnerability is part of Microsoft Security Bulletin MS11-082, which also addresses CVE-2011-2007.
