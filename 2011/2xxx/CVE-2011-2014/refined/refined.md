```
Root cause of vulnerability: Active Directory fails to validate the revocation status of an SSL certificate against the Certificate Revocation List (CRL) when configured to use LDAP over SSL (LDAPS). This allows a revoked certificate to be accepted as valid.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Improper certificate validation

Impact of exploitation:
- Elevation of privilege: An attacker can gain access to network resources or run code under the privileges of a specific authorized user. If the user has administrator privileges, the attacker can install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.

Attack vectors:
- Network-based: The attacker needs to authenticate to the Active Directory domain using the revoked certificate.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker must acquire a revoked certificate associated with a valid domain account.
- The attacker needs to be able to communicate with the Active Directory server using LDAPS.
