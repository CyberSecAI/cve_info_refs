Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2011-2879:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from "Lifetime and threading issues in audio node handling."

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Lifetime issues: This suggests that audio nodes might be being accessed or used after they have been freed or are no longer valid.
- Threading issues: This indicates potential race conditions or other concurrency problems when multiple threads access or modify audio nodes, potentially leading to inconsistent state or unexpected behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The provided text doesn't detail the specific impact, but it is categorized as "High" severity. This suggests the impact could be significant, potentially leading to:
    - Application crash
    - Arbitrary code execution
    - Memory corruption 

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the processing of audio nodes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to influence the audio processing in some way to trigger the lifetime and/or threading issues. This is likely done through crafting specific audio input or manipulating how the browser processes audio elements on a web page.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was identified and credited to the Google Chrome Security Team (Inferno).
- This is a high-severity issue.
- The fix is part of the Stable channel update to 14.0.835.202.
