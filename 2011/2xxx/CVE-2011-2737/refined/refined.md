Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-2737:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is an "arbitrary file retrieval vulnerability".

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability allows unauthenticated users to access files from the affected drive.
- This implies a lack of proper access control or input validation when handling file requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation leads to the disclosure of arbitrary files.
- This could result in the exposure of sensitive data, configuration files, or other critical information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based (remote).
- Unauthenticated users can exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- The attacker only needs network access to the vulnerable service.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in RSA enVision 4.x and 3.x.
- The vendor recommends upgrading to RSA enVision 4 SP4 P3 to address this vulnerability.
- CVSS v2 base score: 7.8 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:N/A:N) indicating high confidentiality impact, low attack complexity, and no authentication required.
- The vulnerability is associated with CWE-310 (Cryptographic Issues) and CWE-200 (Information Exposure). The CWE-310 association is likely a miscategorization, and it's more accurately an access control issue related to information exposure (CWE-200).
