## Issue [7189019](/7189019/): Fix even more crashes. To help identify remaining crashes now and in the future, I have made the ... (Closed)

| **Created:** 9 years, 6 months ago by [Ben Goodger (Google)](/user/Ben%20Goodger%20%28Google%29)  **Modified:** 9 years, 6 months ago  **Reviewers:** [Nico](/user/Nico), [sky](/user/sky)  **CC:** chromium-reviews, Paweł Hajdan Jr., dhollowa  **Base URL:** [svn://svn.chromium.org/chrome/trunk/src/](http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/)  **Visibility:** Public. | DescriptionFix even more crashes. To help identify remaining crashes now and in the future, I have made the GetWidget methods on WidgetDelegate pure virtual. This will cause classes that don't define them to fail compile instead of crashing at run time. <http://crbug.com/86119> TEST=none Committed:

The reason is that ConstrainedDialogDelegate is only a typef for views::DialogDelegate – on CrOS, it's a typedef for ConstrainedWindowGtkDelegate instead (see [http://codesearch.google.com/codesearch#OAMlx_jo-ck/src/content/browser/tab_c...](http://codesearch.google.com/codesearch#OAMlx_jo-ck/src/content/browser/tab_contents/constrained_window.h&exact_package=chromium&ct=rc&cd=1&q=ConstrainedDialogDelegate) ).
