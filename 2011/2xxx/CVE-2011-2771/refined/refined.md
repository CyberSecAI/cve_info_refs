Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2011-2771:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of input sanitization in the processing of RSS feeds within the Mahara application, specifically in the handling of URI attributes. The application doesn't properly sanitize or validate the URLs present in RSS feed items before rendering them on a webpage, allowing for the injection of malicious code through these URIs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS flaw. Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code into the `link` and `guid` attributes of an RSS feed. When a user views a page displaying this malicious feed, the injected JavaScript executes within their browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- By exploiting the XSS vulnerability, an attacker could:
    - Execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser.
    - Potentially steal user session cookies or other sensitive information.
    - Redirect users to malicious websites.
    - Perform actions on behalf of the user, such as modifying data or settings.
    - Deface the website by altering its content.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves a malicious RSS feed. The attacker would need to:
    1. Create an RSS feed containing malicious JavaScript code within the `link` or `guid` tags.
    2. Host this RSS feed online.
    3. Add the malicious RSS feed URL into a Mahara "External Feed" block, for example on a group page.
    4. When a user views a page containing the "External Feed" block, their browser would execute the injected javascript.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to:
   - Create and host a malicious RSS feed.
   - Have the ability to add the feed to an external feed block.
   - The attack can be carried out by an authenticated user with the permission to add external feed blocks, e.g. a member of a group.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is not limited to the "External Feed" block, as any HTML attributes such as `href`, `src`, and `action` that contain unsanitized URIs can be a vector.
- The fix involves implementing a `sanitize_url()` function that will check for potentially dangerous protocols such as `javascript:` and remove them.

This vulnerability is addressed in Mahara version 1.4.1 and in earlier supported stable branches 1.0.x, 1.2.x and 1.3.x.
