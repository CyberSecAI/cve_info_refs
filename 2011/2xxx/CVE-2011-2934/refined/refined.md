  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not require multiple steps or explicit confirmation for sensitive transactions for the majority of administrator functions.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF/XSRF)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can trick a victim into executing arbitrary commands in the context of their session with the application, without further prompting or verification. This includes adding new users with administrator privileges.",
  "Attack vectors": "A crafted URL, which is sent to a logged-in user. The attacker tricks the user into visiting a web page containing the malicious request.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL and trick a logged-in user into visiting a webpage containing it. The attacker does not require any specific privileges within the application, as they are leveraging the privileges of the victim."
