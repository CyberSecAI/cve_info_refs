Debian Security Advisory DSA-2292-1                   security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                            Florian Weimer
August 11, 2011                        <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : isc-dhcp
Vulnerability  : denial of service
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-2748 CVE-2011-2749

David Zych discovered that the ISC DHCP crashes when processing
certain packets, leading to a denial of service.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.1.1-6+lenny6 of the dhcp3 package.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.1.1-P1-15+squeeze3 of the isc-dhcp package.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your ISC DHCP packages.

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <http://www.debian.org/security/>

openSUSE Security Update: dhcp: Fixed two denial of service flaws and some bugs
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Announcement ID: openSUSE-SU-2011:1021-1
Rating: moderate
References: #700771 #711420 #712438 #712653 #714004
Cross-References: CVE-2011-2748 CVE-2011-2749
Affected Products:
openSUSE 11.4
openSUSE 11.3
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that solves two vulnerabilities and has three
fixes is now available. It includes two new package
versions.
Description:
This update of dhcp fixes two Denial of Service
(CVE-2011-2748, CVE-2011-2749) vulnerabilities caused by
specially crafted BOOTP packets.
Also following bugs were fixed:
- Moved server pid files into chroot directory even chroot
is not used and create a link in /var/run, so it can
write one when started as user without chroot and avoid
stop problems when the chroot sysconfig setting changed
(bnc#712438).
- Fixed dhclient-script to not remove alias IP when it
didn't changed to not wipe out iptables connmark when
renewing the lease (bnc#700771). Thanks to James Carter
for the patch.
- Removed GPL licensed files (bind-\*/contrib/dbus) from
bind.tgz to ensure, they're not used to build non-GPL
dhcp.
- Disabled log-info level messages in dhclient(6) quiet
mode to avoid excessive logging of non-critical messages
(bnc#711420).
Patch Instructions:
To install this openSUSE Security Update use YaST online\_update.
Alternatively you can run the command listed for your product:
- openSUSE 11.4:
zypper in -t patch dhcp-5081
- openSUSE 11.3:
zypper in -t patch dhcp-5081
To bring your system up-to-date, use "zypper patch".
