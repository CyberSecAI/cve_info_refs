Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-2209:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A signedness issue in the `osf_sysinfo` system call allows copying large amounts of kernel memory to userland.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Signedness Issue:** The vulnerability stems from improper handling of signedness when determining the size of the data to be copied from kernel space to user space. This allows a large, potentially out-of-bounds, memory copy.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information Leakage:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to read arbitrary kernel memory. This could expose sensitive system data, potentially including passwords, cryptographic keys, or other secrets.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is present in the `osf_sysinfo` system call of the Linux kernel for the Alpha architecture.
- An attacker can trigger the vulnerable code by making a specially crafted system call `osf_sysinfo`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to execute code on the target system and make system calls.
- No special privileges are explicitly required to trigger the vulnerability. However, the ability to make system calls generally requires having user-level access.
