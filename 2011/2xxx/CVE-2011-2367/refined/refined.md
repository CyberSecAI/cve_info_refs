{
  "CVE-2011-2367": {
    "description": "Multiple WebGL crashes",
    "root_cause": "The WebGL state tracking code was getting confused into believing that there is an element array buffer bound when there really isn't.",
     "weaknesses": [
        "Incorrect bookkeeping in bindBuffer() allowed for a mismatch between the WebGL state and the actual GL state, leading to a use-after-free."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially read arbitrary memory from the GPU by exploiting the incorrect state, leading to information disclosure.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A specially crafted WebGL application could trigger the vulnerability by manipulating buffer bindings.",
      "The attacker would need to have the ability to execute WebGL code."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
     "The attacker needs to be able to craft a WebGL program.",
     "The attacker needs to trick the web browser into using the malformed program."
    ],
    "more_info": "The vulnerability stems from a state tracking issue where `bindBuffer()` updated its bookkeeping before parameter validation was complete. Specifically, it occurs when the bookkeeping is updated, but the corresponding GL call is not performed, resulting in the bookkeeping no longer reflecting the actual GL state. This can be exploited to achieve a read of arbitrary memory by setting up vertex data, a vertex shader, a fragment shader, and then triggering `glDrawElements` with an incorrect index."
