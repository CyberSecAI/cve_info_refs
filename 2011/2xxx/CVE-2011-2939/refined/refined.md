CVE-2011-2939: Perl decode_xs Heap-Based Buffer Overflow

**Root cause:**
A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `decode_xs` function within the Encode module of Perl. This vulnerability is triggered when processing a specially crafted Unicode string.

**Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the calculation of the required buffer size when decoding UTF-8 sequences in `Unicode.xs`. An incorrect calculation leads to a heap buffer overflow. Specifically, the `remaining` variable, which determines the buffer allocation, is calculated incorrectly. In scenarios where the input string has a large sequence of multi-byte characters, followed by single-byte characters, or when remaining is zero, this calculation does not allocate enough space, leading to an overflow.

**Impact:**
An attacker can exploit this heap-based buffer overflow to potentially cause a denial of service (DoS) by crashing the affected application or, in more severe cases, execute arbitrary code by overwriting memory. The severity is rated as medium by Red Hat, while some sources suggest the single byte overflow may not be directly exploitable.

**Attack Vector:**
The vulnerability can be triggered by feeding a specifically crafted Unicode string to the vulnerable `decode_xs` function in the Encode module. This can occur in various scenarios where Perl is processing external input, including web applications handling requests with malicious character sets, or network traffic.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be able to supply a specifically crafted unicode string as input to a Perl application that uses the vulnerable `decode_xs` function from the Encode module. The attacker can be external.

**Additional Details:**
* The vulnerability affects Perl versions 5.10.0 and later.
* The vulnerability is located in the `Unicode.xs` file of the `Encode` module.
* The patch involves correcting the `remaining` calculation by adding 1 to the division result to ensure adequate buffer space is allocated (`STRLEN remaining = (e - s)/usize + 1;`).
* The overflow can lead to a 13-byte overwrite in some cases, when `remaining` is zero.
