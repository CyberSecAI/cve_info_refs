How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

No reproducer or other details are known now. This flaw is public. Non-replied question has been post to perl-ports mailing list (<http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.perl.perl5.porters/98004>).   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=731246#c1)  Vincent Danen    2011-08-19 20:52:05 UTC  ``` This was assigned the name CVE-2011-2939:  <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/08/19/17>  As noted in the email, it looks like a single byte overflow that probably is not exploitable.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=731246#c3)  Ramon de C Valle    2011-10-03 16:44:34 UTC  ``` When remaining is zero, max_alloc is 8*1024*1024 and est_alloc is zero, thus est_alloc is used for newlen. It results in resultbuf and resultbuflen being unmodified, where it should they should be at least increased by UTF8_MAXLEN.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=731246#c4)  Ramon de C Valle    2011-10-03 17:11:27 UTC  ``` This issue could result in a 13 bytes overflow of resultbuf, which for Perl's UTF-8 is how wide can a single UTF-8 encoded character become in bytes.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=731246#c7)  Ramon de C Valle    2011-10-04 12:47:00 UTC  ``` Created perl tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 743266](show_bug.cgi?id=743266 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2011-2939 Perl decode_xs heap-based buffer overflow [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=731246#c8)  Fedora Update System    2011-10-24 23:03:31 UTC  ``` perl-5.12.4-162.fc15 has been pushed to the Fedora 15 stable repository.

# NAME

perldelta - what is new for perl v5.14.2

# DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.14.1 release and the 5.14.2 release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.14.0, first read [perl5141delta](/pod/release/FLORA/perl-5.14.2/pod/perl5141delta.pod), which describes differences between 5.14.0 and 5.14.1.

# Core Enhancements

No changes since 5.14.0.

# Security

## `File::Glob::bsd_glob()` memory error with GLOB\_ALTDIRFUNC (CVE-2011-2728).

Calling `File::Glob::bsd_glob` with the unsupported flag GLOB\_ALTDIRFUNC would cause an access violation / segfault. A Perl program that accepts a flags value from an external source could expose itself to denial of service or arbitrary code execution attacks. There are no known exploits in the wild. The problem has been corrected by explicitly disabling all unsupported flags and setting unused function pointers to null. Bug reported by Clément Lecigne.

## `Encode` decode\_xs n-byte heap-overflow (CVE-2011-2939)

A bug in `Encode` could, on certain inputs, cause the heap to overflow. This problem has been corrected. Bug reported by Robert Zacek.

# Incompatible Changes

There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.14.0. If any exist, they are bugs and reports are welcome.

# Deprecations

There have been no deprecations since 5.14.0.

# Modules and Pragmata

## New Modules and Pragmata

None

## Updated Modules and Pragmata

* [CPAN](/pod/CPAN) has been upgraded from version 1.9600 to version 1.9600\_01.

  [CPAN::Distribution](/pod/CPAN%3A%3ADistribution) has been upgraded from version 1.9602 to 1.9602\_01.

  Backported bugfixes from CPAN version 1.9800. Ensures proper detection of `configure_requires` prerequisites from CPAN Meta files in the case where `dynamic_config` is true. [rt.cpan.org #68835]

  Also ensures that `configure_requires` is only checked in META files, not MYMETA files, so protect against MYMETA generation that drops `configure_requires`.
* [Encode](/pod/Encode) has been upgraded from version 2.42 to 2.42\_01.

  See ["Security"](#Security).
* [File::Glob](/pod/release/FLORA/perl-5.14.2/ext/File-Glob/Glob.pm) has been upgraded from version 1.12 to version 1.13.

  See ["Security"](#Security).
* [PerlIO::scalar](/pod/release/FLORA/perl-5.14.2/ext/PerlIO-scalar/scalar.pm) has been upgraded from version 0.11 to 0.11\_01.

  It fixes a problem with `open my $fh, ">", \$scalar` not working if `$scalar` is a copy-on-write scalar.

## Removed Modules and Pragmata

None

# Platform Support

## New Platforms

None

## Discontinued Platforms

None

## Platform-Specific Notes

HP-UX PA-RISC/64 now supports gcc-4.x

A fix to correct the socketsize now makes the test suite pass on HP-UX PA-RISC for 64bitall builds.

Building on OS X 10.7 Lion and Xcode 4 works again

The build system has been updated to work with the build tools under Mac OS X 10.7.

# Bug Fixes

* In @INC filters (subroutines returned by subroutines in @INC), $\_ used to misbehave: If returned from a subroutine, it would not be copied, but the variable itself would be returned; and freeing $\_ (e.g., with `undef *_`) would cause perl to crash. This has been fixed [perl #91880].
* Perl 5.10.0 introduced some faulty logic that made "U\*" in the middle of a pack template equivalent to "U0" if the input string was empty. This has been fixed [perl #90160].
* `caller` no longer leaks memory when called from the DB package if `@DB::args` was assigned to after the first call to `caller`. [Carp](/pod/release/FLORA/perl-5.14.2/lib/Carp.pm) was triggering this bug [perl #97010].
* `utf8::decode` had a nasty bug that would modify copy-on-write scalars' string buffers in place (i.e., skipping the copy). This could result in hashes having two elements with the same key [perl #91834].
* Localising a tied variable used to make it read-only if it contained a copy-on-write string.
* Elements of restricted hashes (see the [fields](/pod/fields) pragma) containing copy-on-write values couldn't be deleted, nor could such hashes be cleared (`%hash = ()`).
* Locking a hash element that is a glob copy no longer causes subsequent assignment to it to corrupt the glob.
* A panic involving the combination of the regular expression modifiers `/aa` introduced in 5.14.0 and the `\b` escape sequence has been fixed [perl #95964].

# Known Problems

This is a list of some significant unfixed bugs, which are regressions from 5.12.0.

* `PERL_GLOBAL_STRUCT` is broken.

  Since perl 5.14.0, building with `-DPERL_GLOBAL_STRUCT` hasn't been possible. This means that perl currently doesn't work on any platforms that require it to be built this way, including Symbian.

  While `PERL_GLOBAL_STRUCT` now works again on recent development versions of perl, it actually working on Symbian again hasn't been verified.

  We'd be very interested in hearing from anyone working with Perl on Symbian.

# Acknowledgements

Perl 5.14.2 represents approximately three months of development since Perl 5.14.1 and contains approximately 1200 lines of changes across 61 files from 9 authors.

Perl continues to flourish into its third decade thanks to a vibrant community of users and developers. The following people are known to have contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.14.2:

Craig A. Berry, David Golden, Father Chrysostomos, Florian Ragwitz, H.Merijn Brand, Karl Williamson, Nicholas Clark, Pau Amma and Ricardo Signes.

# Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ . There may also be information at http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the [perlbug](/pod/release/FLORA/perl-5.14.2/utils/perlbug.PL) program included with your release. Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but sufficient test case. Your bug report, along with the output of `perl -V`, will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it to perl5-security-report@perl.org. This points to a closed subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who be able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use this address for security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on CPAN.

## Details

It was discovered that the decode\_xs function in the Encode module is

vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow via a crafted Unicode string.

An attacker could use this overflow to cause a denial of service.

([CVE-2011-2939](/security/CVE-2011-2939))

It was discovered that the 'new' constructor in the Digest module is

vulnerable to an eval injection. An attacker could use this to execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2011-3597](/security/CVE-2011-3597))

It was discovered that Perl's 'x' string repeat operator is vulnerable

to a heap-based buffer overflow. An attacker could use this to execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2012-5195](/security/CVE-2012-5195))

Ryo Anazawa discovered that the CGI.pm module does not properly escape

newlines in Set-Cookie or P3P (Platform for Privacy Preferences Project)

headers. An attacker could use this to inject arbitrary headers into

responses from applications that use CGI.pm. ([CVE-2012-5526](/security/CVE-2012-5526))

Subject: Re: CVE request: heap overflow in perl while
 decoding Unicode string

I'm going to assign this CVE-2011-2939. It looks like a single byte
overflow. It's probably not exploitable (even as a DoS), but to play it
safe, I'm assigning this ID.

Thanks.

=head1 NAME

perldelta - what is new for perl v5.14.2

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.14.1 release and
the 5.14.2 release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.14.0, first read
L<perl5141delta>, which describes differences between 5.14.0 and
5.14.1.

=head1 Core Enhancements

No changes since 5.14.0.

=head1 Security

=head2 C<File::Glob::bsd_glob()> memory error with GLOB_ALTDIRFUNC (CVE-2011-2728).

Calling C<File::Glob::bsd_glob> with the unsupported flag GLOB_ALTDIRFUNC would
cause an access violation / segfault.  A Perl program that accepts a flags value from
an external source could expose itself to denial of service or arbitrary code
execution attacks.  There are no known exploits in the wild.  The problem has been
corrected by explicitly disabling all unsupported flags and setting unused function
pointers to null.  Bug reported by Clément Lecigne.

=head2 C<Encode> decode_xs n-byte heap-overflow (CVE-2011-2939)

A bug in C<Encode> could, on certain inputs, cause the heap to overflow.
This problem has been corrected.  Bug reported by Robert Zacek.

=head1 Incompatible Changes

There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.14.0. If any
exist, they are bugs and reports are welcome.

=head1 Deprecations

There have been no deprecations since 5.14.0.

=head1 Modules and Pragmata

=head2 New Modules and Pragmata

None

=head2 Updated Modules and Pragmata

=over 4

=item *

L<CPAN> has been upgraded from version 1.9600 to version 1.9600_01.

L<CPAN::Distribution> has been upgraded from version 1.9602 to 1.9602_01.

Backported bugfixes from CPAN version 1.9800.  Ensures proper
detection of C<configure_requires> prerequisites from CPAN Meta files
in the case where C<dynamic_config> is true.  [rt.cpan.org #68835]

Also ensures that C<configure_requires> is only checked in META files,
not MYMETA files, so protect against MYMETA generation that drops
C<configure_requires>.

=item *

L<Encode> has been upgraded from version 2.42 to 2.42_01.

See L</Security>.

=item *

L<File::Glob> has been upgraded from version 1.12 to version 1.13.

See L</Security>.

=item *

L<PerlIO::scalar> has been upgraded from version 0.11 to 0.11_01.

It fixes a problem with C<< open my $fh, ">", \$scalar >> not working if
C<$scalar> is a copy-on-write scalar.

=back

=head2 Removed Modules and Pragmata

None

=head1 Platform Support

=head2 New Platforms

None

=head2 Discontinued Platforms

None

=head2 Platform-Specific Notes

=over 4

=item HP-UX PA-RISC/64 now supports gcc-4.x

A fix to correct the socketsize now makes the test suite pass on HP-UX
PA-RISC for 64bitall builds.

=item Building on OS X 10.7 Lion and Xcode 4 works again

The build system has been updated to work with the build tools under Mac OS X
10.7.

=back

=head1 Bug Fixes

=over 4

=item *

In @INC filters (subroutines returned by subroutines in @INC), $_ used to
misbehave: If returned from a subroutine, it would not be copied, but the
variable itself would be returned; and freeing $_ (e.g., with C<undef *_>)
would cause perl to crash.  This has been fixed [perl #91880].

=item *

Perl 5.10.0 introduced some faulty logic that made "U*" in the middle of
a pack template equivalent to "U0" if the input string was empty.  This has
been fixed [perl #90160].

=item *

C<caller> no longer leaks memory when called from the DB package if
C<@DB::args> was assigned to after the first call to C<caller>.  L<Carp>
was triggering this bug [perl #97010].

=item *

C<utf8::decode> had a nasty bug that would modify copy-on-write scalars'
string buffers in place (i.e., skipping the copy).  This could result in
hashes having two elements with the same key [perl #91834].

=item *

Localising a tied variable used to make it read-only if it contained a
copy-on-write string.

=item *

Elements of restricted hashes (see the L<fields> pragma) containing
copy-on-write values couldn't be deleted, nor could such hashes be cleared
(C<%hash = ()>).

=item *

Locking a hash element that is a glob copy no longer causes subsequent
assignment to it to corrupt the glob.

=item *

A panic involving the combination of the regular expression modifiers
C</aa> introduced in 5.14.0 and the C<\b> escape sequence has been
fixed [perl #95964].

=back

=head1 Known Problems

This is a list of some significant unfixed bugs, which are regressions
from 5.12.0.

=over 4

=item *

C<PERL_GLOBAL_STRUCT> is broken.

Since perl 5.14.0, building with C<-DPERL_GLOBAL_STRUCT> hasn't been
possible. This means that perl currently doesn't work on any platforms that
require it to be built this way, including Symbian.

While C<PERL_GLOBAL_STRUCT> now works again on recent development versions of
perl, it actually working on Symbian again hasn't been verified.

We'd be very interested in hearing from anyone working with Perl on Symbian.

=back

=head1 Acknowledgements

Perl 5.14.2 represents approximately three months of development since
Perl 5.14.1 and contains approximately 1200 lines of changes
across 61 files from 9 authors.

Perl continues to flourish into its third decade thanks to a vibrant
community of users and developers.  The following people are known to
have contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.14.2:

Craig A. Berry, David Golden, Father Chrysostomos, Florian Ragwitz, H.Merijn
Brand, Karl Williamson, Nicholas Clark, Pau Amma and Ricardo Signes.

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles
recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl
bug database at http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ .  There may also be
information at http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the L<perlbug>
program included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down
to a tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the
output of C<perl -V>, will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be
analysed by the Perl porting team.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send
it to perl5-security-report@perl.org. This points to a closed subscription
unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who be able
to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help
co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use this address for
security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently
distributed on CPAN.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Message-ID: <20110818165844.GA1360@redhat.com>

From: Vincent Danen <vdanen@...hat.com>

Subject: CVE request: heap overflow in perl while decoding Unicode string

Does anyone know more about this flaw?  It's in perl and the Encode
module:

<http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/DANKOGAI/Encode-2.44/Changes>

! Unicode/Unicode.xs
   Addressed the following:
     Date: Fri, 22 Jul 2011 13:58:43 +0200
     From: Robert Zacek <zacek@...st.com>
     To: perl5-security-report@...l.org
     Subject: Unicode.xs!decode_xs n-byte heap-overflow

It's been fixed in perl:

<http://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git/commitdiff/e46d973584785af1f445c4dedbee4243419cb860#patch5>

Seems to be in all versions of perl since 5.10.0.

There isn't really information on the impact of this though.  I don't
know enough to determine whether this is something that can cause
arbitrary code execution, whether some gcc/glibc hardening prevents or
minimizes the impact, whether it's a crash-only, etc.  It has been asked
on the perl5-porters list, but no response was given:

<http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.perl.perl5.porters/98004>

Does anyone know anything more about this flaw?  Could a CVE be assigned
to it as well?

Thanks.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
