  "CVE-2011-2377": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "A flaw in the way Firefox handled malformed JPEG images.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Memory corruption due to a malformed JPEG image within a multipart/x-mixed-replace stream.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could cause a crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user.",
      "Attack vectors": "A website containing a malicious JPEG image embedded in a multipart/x-mixed-replace stream.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to host a malicious web page with a crafted JPEG image in a multipart/x-mixed-replace stream that the victim visits."
    },
        {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The PostSize() call in nsJPEGDecoder::WriteInternal() leads to an error because it's a multipart channel and the image has a different size. The DoError() call leads to ShutdownDecoder() which nulls out 'mDecoder'; this is the last ref so it's deleted.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Null pointer dereference after the decoder is shut down. Improper call to JPEG library after decoder shutdown.",
       "Impact of exploitation": "Crash, potential arbitrary code execution.",
      "Attack vectors": "Changing the image size while the server is delivering a stream of images to the browser using multipart/x-mixed-replace.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position":"Attacker needs to control the multipart/x-mixed-replace stream and the ability to change the image size mid-stream."
