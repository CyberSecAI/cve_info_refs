Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-2674:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in BaserCMS's access restriction mechanism, specifically when adding a user to the "operators" user group, which is created by default during installation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Access Control:** The core issue is a failure to properly restrict access permissions, allowing users without administrative privileges to gain elevated access. This is a CWE-264 (Permissions, Privileges, and Access Controls) vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** Users without administrative rights can potentially acquire administrative privileges.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Unauthorized users can alter the information of administrators, potentially leading to unauthorized modifications of the system configuration or data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The attack can be performed remotely over the internet.
*   **Authentication Required:** The attacker requires a valid user account, but it does not need to have administrator privileges.  The user account needs to be created by an administrator first.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Existing User Account:** The attacker must possess a user account on the BaserCMS instance.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to reach the vulnerable BaserCMS instance.
*   **No user interaction required:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability without the interaction of a valid user.

**Summary:**

CVE-2011-2674 highlights a critical access control vulnerability in BaserCMS. By exploiting this flaw, a regular user could gain administrator-level access, allowing for a complete takeover of the system and the ability to alter the administrators configurations and data.
