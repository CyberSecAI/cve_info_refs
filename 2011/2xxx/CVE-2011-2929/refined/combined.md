| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=731432#c0)  Vincent Danen    2011-08-17 16:29:39 UTC  ``` A flaw in the template selection code in Ruby on Rails >=3.0 could allow an attacker to render a view they should not have access to [1].  This is corrected in 3.0.10 and 3.1.0rc6, patches are available in the advisory [1] and in git [2].  [1] <http://groups.google.com/group/rubyonrails-security/browse_thread/thread/3420ac71aed312d6> [2] <https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/5f94b93279f6d0682fafb237c301302c107a9552>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=731432#c2)  Vincent Danen    2011-08-17 17:16:37 UTC  ``` This flaw is in rubygem-actionpack, not rubygem-rails.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=731432#c3)  Vincent Danen    2011-08-17 17:25:46 UTC  ``` Created rubygem-actionpack tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-15 [[bug 731448](show_bug.cgi?id=731448 "CLOSED ERRATA - rubygem-actionpack various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=731432#c5)  Chris Lalancette    2011-08-18 14:08:21 UTC  ``` I'm not really familiar with the Fedora security response procedures, but don't we also need a F-16 and rawhide bug as well?  Since the flaw was just fixed yesterday, the problem will be in all 3.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=731432#c6)  Vincent Danen    2011-08-18 20:29:37 UTC  ``` You should be able to use the same tracking bug for all three.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=731432#c7)  Chris Lalancette    2011-08-18 20:45:55 UTC  ``` OK, thanks, that's what I wanted to know.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=731432#c8)  Vincent Danen    2011-08-30 04:21:01 UTC  ``` This issue has been assigned the name CVE-2011-2929:  <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/08/19/11>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=731432#c10)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2011-09-07 05:57:21 UTC  ``` This issue does not affect the version of rubygem-actionpack shipped with Fedora 14.

There is a vulnerability in the template selection code in Ruby on Rails releases after 3.0 which could allow an attacker to render a view they should not have access to. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-YYYY-XXXX.

Versions Affected: 3.0.0 and Later
Not affected: Versions prior to 3.0
Fixed Versions: 3.0.10, 3.1.0.rc6

Impact
------
Due to a bug in the template selection code an attacker can craft a URL and cause Rails to render an arbitrary view, but not call its corresponding action. This only affects 3.0 applications which use ':action' in their routes.

All users running an affected release and using :action in their routes should either upgrade or use one of the workarounds immediately.

Releases
--------
The 3.0.10 and 3.1.0.rc6 releases are available at the normal locations.

Workarounds
-----------
This only affects users with routes containing the parameter :action, you can avoid the vulnerability by providing additional constraints. For instance replacing:

match '/:controller(/:action(/:id))'

with

match '/:controller(/:action(/:id))', :action => /[a-z\_]+/

Patches
-------
To aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided patches for the two supported release series. They are in git-am format and consist of a single changeset.

\* 3-0-filter\_skipping.patch - Patch for 3.0 series

Please note that only the 2.3.x and 3.0.x series are supported at present. Users of earlier unsupported releases are advised to upgrade as soon as possible.

Credits
-------

Thanks to Jan M. Faber of supersaas for reporting the problem to us and working with us to verify the fix.

Subject: Re: CVE request: ruby on rails flaws (4)

  <https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=673010>
  <http://webservsec.blogspot.com/2011/02/ruby-on-rails-vulnerability.html>

Thanks in advance.

Subject: Re: CVE request: ruby on rails flaws (4)

Sorry, there is one more flaw that needs a CVE assignment:

Response splitting flaw in 2.3.x (3.0.0 and later not affected).
<http://groups.google.com/group/rubyonrails-security/browse_thread/thread/6ffc93bde0298768>
<https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/11dafeaa7533be26441a63618be93a03869c83a9>
<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=732156>

Sorry I missed this one earlier, I was looking at the 3.x advisory page and missed this one.
