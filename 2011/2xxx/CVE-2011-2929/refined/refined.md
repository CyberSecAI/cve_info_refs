Filter Skipping Vulnerability in Ruby on Rails 3.0

There is a vulnerability in the template selection code in Ruby on Rails releases after 3.0 which could allow an attacker to render a view they should not have access to. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-YYYY-XXXX.

Versions Affected: 3.0.0 and Later
Not affected: Versions prior to 3.0
Fixed Versions: 3.0.10, 3.1.0.rc6

Impact
------
Due to a bug in the template selection code an attacker can craft a URL and cause Rails to render an arbitrary view, but not call its corresponding action. This only affects 3.0 applications which use ':action' in their routes.
```
```
commit 5f94b93
Properly escape glob characters.
```

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A flaw in the template selection code in Ruby on Rails versions 3.0 and later allowed an attacker to render arbitrary views.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper handling of template paths, leading to arbitrary view rendering.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could render views they should not have access to, potentially exposing sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors:** Crafting a malicious URL to exploit the template selection process.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs the ability to send crafted HTTP requests. The application must use `:action` in their routes.
