    },
    "Vulnerability Details": {
      "Root cause": "The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the FileUtils function in Kiwi. Specifically, shell metacharacters present in the input are not properly escaped before being passed to the command interpreter, leading to command injection.",
      "Vulnerabilities": [
        "Command Injection"
      ],
      "Impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system with the privileges of the user running Kiwi/SUSE Studio.",
      "Attack vector": "The attack vector is through network access since the vulnerability is triggered via an unspecified FileUtils function call that's part of kiwi before 3.74.2 and SUSE Studio 1.1 before 1.1.4.",
       "Required capabilities": "The attacker needs network access to interact with the vulnerable instance of Kiwi or SUSE Studio and supply malicious input containing shell metacharacters, without the need for authentication."
