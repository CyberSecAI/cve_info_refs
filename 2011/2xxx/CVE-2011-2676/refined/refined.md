Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient access control within the A-Form plugin for Movable Type. Specifically, the plugin doesn't properly restrict access to its data management features.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Improper Access Control:** The core issue is that Movable Type administrators who do not have specific administrative privileges for A-Form can still modify A-Form's database information. This indicates a flaw in how A-Form enforces access permissions, allowing unauthorized modification of its data.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** A separate vulnerability exists in specific parts of A-Form PC 3.0 and A-Form PC/Mobile 3.0, which exposes them to XSS attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Modification:** An attacker, who is a Movable Type administrator but lacks A-Form administrative rights, can alter information stored and managed by the A-Form plugin. This could lead to data corruption, manipulation of form data, and potential misuse of the system.
*   **XSS Attacks:** The XSS vulnerability could allow attackers to inject malicious scripts into the affected A-Form versions, potentially leading to session hijacking, phishing attacks, or other client-side exploits.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Parameter Manipulation:** The primary attack vector involves manipulating HTTP parameters sent to the A-Form administrative interface. This allows unauthorized Movable Type administrators to bypass access controls and directly modify the A-Form database.
*   **XSS Injection:** Attackers could exploit the XSS vulnerability by injecting malicious scripts into specific parts of the A-Form interface, possibly through form fields or URL parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Movable Type Administrator Access:** Attackers need to be authenticated Movable Type administrators. They do *not* need to be A-Form administrators to exploit the access control vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited over a network.
*   **For XSS:** The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious scripts into the affected A-Form component.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects various versions of the A-Form plugin, including older versions (1.x and 2.x) and version 3.0 for PC and PC/Mobile.
*   Patches were released for versions 1.3.6, 2.0.3, and 3.1 to address these vulnerabilities.
