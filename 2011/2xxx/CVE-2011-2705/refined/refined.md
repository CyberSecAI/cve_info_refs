```
{
  "Root cause": "The Ruby `securerandom.rb` module, when using OpenSSL, did not properly reinitialize the random number generator when forking a new process. The OpenSSL PRNG uses the PID to seed the generator, which leads to predictability due to PID recycling.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "Inadequate initialization of random number generator in forked processes.",
    "Reliance on PID for PRNG seeding, leading to predictable sequences upon PID reuse."
  ],
  "Impact": "A local attacker could more easily predict random numbers generated by Ruby processes, potentially leading to security vulnerabilities in applications relying on `SecureRandom` for cryptographic operations or other security-sensitive tasks. For example, it could impact the generation of session keys.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local access to a system where Ruby applications using the vulnerable `securerandom.rb` module are running. An attacker needs to have the ability to fork processes that use the `SecureRandom` module.",
  "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to execute code on the target system and have the ability to fork new Ruby processes. The attacker would also need to know the PID of the parent process and when the process is forking."
