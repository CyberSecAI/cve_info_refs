| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=722415#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-07-15 09:51:59 UTC  ``` It was found that Ruby did not properly reinitialize the random number generator, when forking new Ruby process. A local attacker could use this flaw to easier predict random numbers.

(I'm not sure why MITRE assigned [CVE-2011-3009](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-3009) to this as it sounds like this is an exact duplicate of CVE-2011-2686; I've inquired as to what makes this different from [CVE-2011-2686](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-2686)).   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=722415#c16)  Vincent Danen    2011-09-21 15:13:52 UTC  ``` I've not heard anything back from MITRE about the difference, but I've looked at the CVE entry for [CVE-2011-2686](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-2686) and it reads:  Ruby before 1.8.7-p352 does not reset the random seed upon forking, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to predict the values of random numbers by leveraging knowledge of the number sequence obtained in a different child process, a related issue to [CVE-2003-0900](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2003-0900). NOTE: this issue exists because of a regression during Ruby 1.8.6 development.   Which has me a bit more confused.  By the sounds of the description, [CVE-2011-2686](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-2686) was fixed in 1.8.6, but regressed which caused the flaw in 1.8.7 (I have no idea if this is the case).  I suspect we should use [CVE-2011-2686](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-2686) to describe any fixes in 1.8.6 and [CVE-2011-3009](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-3009) to describe any fixes in 1.8.7.   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=722415#c17)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-12-06 12:08:04 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2011:1581 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-1581.html>   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=722415#c22)  Vít Ondruch    2012-01-13 15:21:32 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 555084](attachment.cgi?id=555084&action=diff "RHEL-5.8 patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=555084&action=edit "RHEL-5.8 patch") RHEL-5.8 patch   ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=722415#c23)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-01-30 18:33:34 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2012:0070 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0070.html>   ``` |  |

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

Looking at the above patches, there seems to be two issues here, perhaps
it needs two CVE ids to be assigned?

1. <http://svn.ruby-lang.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi?view=revision&revision=31713>

This one pertains to rand returning same values in forked processes.
<http://redmine.ruby-lang.org/issues/show/4338>
This is a regression, as it was fixed in 1.8.6-p114, but re-appeared in
1.8.6-p399.

2. <http://svn.ruby-lang.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi?view=revision&revision=32050>

This is an issue in the securerandom.rb module.
<http://redmine.ruby-lang.org/issues/4579>

Josh,

Can we please assign CVE-2011-2686 to one of the issues and have another
CVE id to the other issue?

Thanks.

**Description**

=begin

This could arguably be a bug in OpenSSL or the openssl extension, but

I think it's easier to fix in Ruby right now.

The PRNG in OpenSSL uses the PID to seed the PRNG. Since PIDs get

recycled over time on Unix systems, this means independent processes

over a long time span will repeat random byte sequences. This has

security implications, but fortunately very little software forks

very frequently. I am not a security expert.

I am using OpenSSL 0.9.8g-15+lenny11 (Debian Lenny)

Attached is a script that reproduces the issue (takes a while to run).

It'll output two identical lines to illustrate the issue.

SecureRandom.random\_bytes is just a wrapper of OpenSSL::Random.random\_bytes(n) on systems with openssl.

And OpenSSL::Random.random\_bytes is a wrapper of RAND\_bytes(3).

You know its result depends pid and openssl ext should use RAND\_add(3) or something.

I don't have an idea how OpenSSL can be 'fork-safe' for your purpose...

Call OpenSSL::Random.load\_random\_file("/dev/urandom" or "/dev/random" or ENV["RANDFILE"]) after each fork.

Usually openssl read /dev/urandom only once. But RAND\_cleanup() lead to read /dev/urandom again. Thus attached patch fixes this issue.

This is better patch than PAND\_add(/dev/urandom) because openssl can use other entropy source internally.

Hi

> Motohiro: I don't know you're serious or not about using pthread\_atfork(), we should ask to change OpenSSL's "1 time initialization by RAND\_poll() per process when using built-in MD based RPNG engine" strategy if we really want.

It's ruby's spec. We already decided random seed should reinitialize per fork.

void rb\_thread\_atfork(void)

{

rb\_thread\_atfork\_internal(terminate\_atfork\_i);

GET\_THREAD()->join\_list\_head = 0;

```
 /* We don't want reproduce CVE-2003-0900. */
 rb_reset_random_seed();

```

}

Now, SecureRandom is insecure than normal random from fork issue. It's

rather than unhappy.

=begin

I think you're confusing SecureRandom's spec and ext/openssl (formerly ruby-pki) spec. ext/openssl aims to wrap OpenSSL that user's using so if OpenSSL is not 'fork-safe' as Eric expected, so ruby-pki doesn't.

So if OpenSSL can't change this behavior (I bet they can't at least in the near future), why don't we change lib/securerandom.rb?

The reason why I think you're not serious is adding ptherad\_atfork() in ext is too ad-hoc-ish. We can't do it from Ruby world if I understand correctly. Adding atfork hook first?

To change (OK, 'fix') this behavior, it could be good to abandon using OpenSSL::Random.random\_bytes(). We cannot use OpenSSL's engine which could provide physical random number but OpenSSL::Random.random\_bytes must be enough for such user.

Tanaka-san, what do you think about the change?

I hope everything in Ruby (including 3rd-party extensions/gems) can be

made fork-safe by default (if they run on a system with fork) one day.

I don't agree with blindly mimicking OpenSSL upstream behavior if Ruby

can be made easier-to-use.

Yes, I confirmed OpenSSL can't change the current behavior:

<http://marc.info/?l=openssl-dev&m=130298304903422&w=2>

I'm still hoping to get a list of things that need to be reinitialized

in OpenSSL after fork() from openssl-dev...

I would be 100% in favor of making something analogous to

pthread\_atfork() available in Ruby. It would make it much easier to

manage various resources in a multi-process situation

No comment on the appropriateness of pthread\_atfork() inside an ext.

Hm.

I don't like pthread\_atfork because the hook is run even if we don't need random functions in the child process.

(Remember only async signal safe functions are safe in forked child process)

We should delay modifying PRNG state until we really need it.

securerandom-openssl-pid-recycle.patch do it.

It should work until we have very fast machine which pid is recycled in a nano second.

Is that only the case with poor urandom implementations in some

systems?

I'm fine with securerandom-openssl-pid-recycle.patch but I like

securerandom\_opensslfree.diff since it removes OpenSSL dependency.

(I personally never liked OpenSSL)

I think securerandom\_opensslfree.diff is too radical for this issue.

It may decrease working platforms.

However concrete advantage/disadvantage between OpenSSL and /dev/urandom is interesting.

Agreed. Your fix is nice. We should have been aware of that. Thanks.

On Linux, /dev/urandom seems to return the values which are

"theoretically vulnerable to a cryptographic attack on the algorithms

used by the driver" (from man page). I though it returns shorter bytes

than expected. I was wrong.

And using /dev/urandom every time consumes too much entropy that OS

has, so /dev/random users would not like it. We should avoid using

/dev/urandom every time on the env w/o OpenSSL in the future.

Reasonable. Why don't you do so? I mean that removing /dev/urandom

fallback from securerandom.rb and letting simply warn "Please install

OpenSSL".

> Cryptographic algorithms should be implemented/maintained by cryptographic experts but I am not a cryptographic expert.

You wrote securerandom.rb. I think it's too late. :-) :-) Joking

aside, since there's no cryptography expert around us, delegating PRNG

thing to OpenSSL is good I think.

I don't understand why /dev/urandom fallback should be removed.

Is your reason the "theoretically vulnerable to a cryptographic attack on the algorithms used by the driver" (from Linux man page)?
