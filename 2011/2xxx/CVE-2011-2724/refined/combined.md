# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=726691#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-07-29 13:51:11 UTC  ``` Originally the [CVE-2010-0547](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-0547) identifier has been assigned by Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures to the following security issue:  client/mount.cifs.c in mount.cifs in smbfs in Samba 3.4.5 and earlier does not verify that the (1) device name and (2) mountpoint strings are composed of valid characters, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (mtab corruption) via a crafted string.  Later a bug was found in the upstream patch for this issue. More specifically:  check_mtab() calls check_newline() to check device and directory name.  check_newline() returns EX_USAGE (1) when error is detected, while check_mtab() expects -1 to indicate an error.  This bug in original [CVE-2010-0547](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-0547) fix (not to propagate the error properly) caused mount.cifs command on specially-crafted mount point (containing newline character) still to succeed and potentially, to corrupt mtab table on the systems, where [CVE-2010-0296](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-0296) glibc fix was not applied yet.

Those packages are rather affected by the original [CVE-2010-0547](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-0547), as the incomplete fix was never released for those packages.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=726691#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-08-29 17:27:31 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2011:1220 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-1220.html>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=726691#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-08-29 17:38:30 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2011:1221 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-1221.html>   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=726691#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-07-29 13:51:11 UTC  ``` Originally the [CVE-2010-0547](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-0547) identifier has been assigned by Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures to the following security issue:  client/mount.cifs.c in mount.cifs in smbfs in Samba 3.4.5 and earlier does not verify that the (1) device name and (2) mountpoint strings are composed of valid characters, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (mtab corruption) via a crafted string.  Later a bug was found in the upstream patch for this issue. More specifically:  check_mtab() calls check_newline() to check device and directory name.  check_newline() returns EX_USAGE (1) when error is detected, while check_mtab() expects -1 to indicate an error.  This bug in original [CVE-2010-0547](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-0547) fix (not to propagate the error properly) caused mount.cifs command on specially-crafted mount point (containing newline character) still to succeed and potentially, to corrupt mtab table on the systems, where [CVE-2010-0296](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-0296) glibc fix was not applied yet.

Subject: CVE-2011-2724 assignment notification -- samba -- incomplete fix
 for CVE-2010-0547 issue

Hello Josh, Steve, vendors,

   during creation of automated test case for samba CVE-2010-0547 issue
I have noticed still to be possible mount.cifs to succeed to mount Samba
share to specially-crafted mount point (containing newline character),
potentially resulting into mtab corruption (on systems, where glibc
package was not patched against CVE-2010-0296 flaw yet).

The new CVE identifier of CVE-2011-2724 has been assigned to this issue
(as an incomplete fix for CVE-2010-0547 issue).

Kudos to Tomas Hoger and Jeffrey Layton for their analysis of the issue:

check_mtab() calls check_newline() to check device and directory name.
check_newline() returns EX_USAGE (1) when error is detected, while
check_mtab() expects -1 to indicate an error.

and to Jeffrey Layton again for providing the patch almost immediately:
[1] <http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel.cifs/3827>

References:
[2] <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2011-2724>

Thank you && Regards, Jan.
