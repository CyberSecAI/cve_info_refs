Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2011-2916:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The qtnx client stores non-custom SSH keys within configuration files located in the user's `~/.qtnx/` directory. These configuration files (specifically, `.nxml` files) are created with world-readable permissions (e.g. `rw-r--r--`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure File Permissions:** The primary vulnerability is the creation of configuration files containing sensitive SSH keys with world-readable permissions. This allows any user on the system to read these files.
*   **Reliance on User's Home Directory Security:** The vulnerability is exacerbated if a user has a world-readable or world-executable home directory. In such cases, other local users can traverse the directory and access the insecurely stored keys.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access to Remote NX Sessions:** A local attacker who gains access to the private SSH key can use it to connect to remote NX sessions of the targeted user without authorization.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system where the qtnx client is being used and where the vulnerable configuration files are stored.
*   **File System Access:** The attacker needs to be able to read the vulnerable configuration files, which requires read access on the `~/.qtnx` directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be a local user on the same system as the victim.
*   The attacker needs to be able to read files within the victim's `~/.qtnx/` directory which may be achieved through a world-readable configuration or world-executable home directory.
*   No special privileges are required as it is a local privilege escalation issue.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is specifically associated with `qtnx` version 0.9
*   The vulnerability is considered a low to moderate severity issue, which is also highlighted in multiple sources, including Ubuntu which marks it low and CVSS v3 gives a score of 5.5 (Medium).
*   The vulnerability was initially reported on Debian, which then propagated to other systems that had the same software included.
*   Patches for this vulnerability involve correcting the permissions set on the directory and configuration files. Specifically, the permissions should be limited to the user.
*   Some vendors like RedHat and SUSE have stated that the issue does not affect their products, or were marked as "WONTFIX", despite the problem existing in the software.
*  The issue was initially reported and resolved in Debian but was then removed from their archive, and the security patches were not backported.
