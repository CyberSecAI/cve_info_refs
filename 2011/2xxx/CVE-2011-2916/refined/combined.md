| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=730081#c0)  Vincent Danen    2011-08-11 17:44:05 UTC  ``` It was reported [1] that the qtnx client would store non-custom SSH keys in a world-readable configuration file.  If a user did not have a properly secured home directory (if it was world-readable or world-executable), this could allow other users on the local system to obtain the private key used to connect to remote NX sessions.  For example:  % ls -al .qtnx total 12 drwxrwxr-x.  2 user user 4096 Aug 11 11:36 . drwxr-x---. 27 user user 4096 Aug 11 11:37 .. -rw-rw-r--.  1 user user 1209 Aug 11 11:40 cerb.nxml % grep Auth .qtnx/cerb.nxml  <option key="Authentication Key" value="sekritz"></option>  qtnx should probably set the permissions of the *.nxml files to 0600, or the ~/.qtnx/ directory should be mode 0700 (like ~/.ssh/)  [1] <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=637439>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=730081#c1)  Vincent Danen    2011-08-11 17:50:22 UTC  ``` Created freenx-client tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 730085](show_bug.cgi?id=730085 "CLOSED WONTFIX - freenx-client: qtnx stores configuration, including non-default authentication key, with insecure permissions [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=730081#c2)  Vincent Danen    2011-08-12 21:41:34 UTC  ``` This issue was assigned the name [CVE-2011-2916](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-2916).   ``` |  |

Subject: qtnx: stores keys world readable
Date: Thu, 11 Aug 2011 15:03:20 +0200
```
Package: qtnx
Version: 0.9-3
Severity: grave
Tags: security
Justification: user security hole

Hi.

It seems that qtnx stores any non-custom ssh keys world-readable:
$ ls -al ~/.qtnx/
total 12
drwxr-xr-x  2 user user 4096 Aug 11 15:01 .
drwx------ 51 user user 4096 Aug 11 15:01 ..
-rw-r--r--  1 user user 1932 Aug 11 14:59 session.nxml

The file contains the key.

Cheers,
Chris.

Dear maintainer,

Recently you fixed one or more security problems and as a result you closed
this bug. These problems were not serious enough for a Debian Security
Advisory, so they are now on my radar for fixing in the following suites
through point releases:

squeeze (6.0.7) - use target "stable"

Please prepare a minimal-changes upload targetting each of these suites,
and submit a debdiff to the Release Team [0] for consideration. They will
offer additional guidance or instruct you to upload your package.

I will happily assist you at any stage if the patch is straightforward and
you need help. Please keep me in CC at all times so I can
track [1] the progress of this request.

For details of this process and the rationale, please see the original
announcement [2] and my blog post [3].

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.
