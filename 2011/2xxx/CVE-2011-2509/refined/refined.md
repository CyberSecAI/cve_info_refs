Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of several parameters within Joomla! core components when submitted to the `/index.php` URL. Specifically, the `QueryString`, `option`, and `searchword` parameters in the `com_content`, `com_contact`, `com_newsfeeds`, and `com_search` components were vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS, where unsanitized user-supplied data is reflected in the web page, allowing the execution of malicious scripts in a victim's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Compromised User/Administrator Sessions:** Attackers can compromise active user or administrator sessions.
*   **Impersonation of Arbitrary User Actions:** Attackers can perform any actions that a compromised user or administrator is authorized to do, including administrative functions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious URLs:** Attackers can craft special URLs with malicious scripts embedded in vulnerable parameters.
*   **POST Requests:** In the case of the `searchword` parameter in the `com_search` component, the attack can be performed via a POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to craft malicious URLs:** An attacker needs to be able to generate and deliver URLs with embedded malicious scripts.
*   **Ability to send POST requests:** For the search component vulnerability, the attacker needs to be able to send a crafted POST request.
*   **No special privileges:** The attacker does not require special privileges on the target system other than the ability to send HTTP requests.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Joomla! versions 1.6.3 and lower.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Aung Khant of YGN Ethical Hacker Group.
*   The fix for this vulnerability is to upgrade to Joomla! 1.6.4 or higher.
*   Proof-of-concept exploits are provided in the content for different components and parameters.
*   The `searchword` parameter vulnerability is identified to be present via source code analysis.
