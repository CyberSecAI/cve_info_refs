Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2011-2506:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a combination of two factors within phpMyAdmin:

1.  **Unsanitized Session Data:** The application takes a key from the `Servers` array within the `$_SESSION` superglobal and uses this key, unsanitized, in the comment section of a generated configuration file.

2.  **Controllable Session Data:** The `$_SESSION` superglobal can be manipulated by an attacker using a separate vulnerability(CVE-2011-2505) where any variable in the $_SESSION array can be overwritten.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Sanitization:** The code fails to properly sanitize the server key extracted from the session before embedding it into the generated configuration file.
*   **Session Manipulation:** An attacker can control the contents of the $_SESSION array and inject code via the $_SERVER['QUERY_STRING'] and the use of parse_str(), which was assigned CVE-2011-2505. This allows modifying keys in the 'Servers' array.
*  **Remote Code Injection**: By controlling the session variable, an attacker can inject PHP code by closing the comment and then adding their own code. This injected code then gets written to config/config.inc.php and executed when accessed via the web server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** By injecting malicious code into the configuration file, an attacker can achieve arbitrary remote code execution on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** An attacker crafts a malicious HTTP request to modify the session variables (using CVE-2011-2505) and subsequently trigger the code injection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the phpMyAdmin instance.
*  **Exploitation of CVE-2011-2505**: Requires the ability to overwrite the $_SESSION superglobal array by crafting a malicious query string.
* **Misconfiguration**: The /config folder containing the config.inc.php must still exist.

**Additional Information from the Content:**

*   The vulnerability is present in phpMyAdmin versions 3.4.3 and earlier.
*   Versions 3.3.10.2 and 3.4.3.1 contain a fix for this issue.
*   The vulnerability is considered "non-critical" by phpMyAdmin.
*   The fix involves sanitizing the `Servers` array key to prevent code injection.
*   The attacker can inject any php code which will then get saved to a file and executed when accessed via the web server.
