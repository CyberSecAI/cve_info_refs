Hello Mango,

   thank you for your report.

Wondering if you have contacted phpMyAdmin Security Team first (Cc-ed
too) for their review, opinion and actions planned regarding the issues
below? ( <http://www.phpmyadmin.net/home_page/security/> )

Also, are there relevant upstream bugzilla issue tracking system:
[1] <http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=377408&group_id=23067&func=browse>

records (where further information about the issues could be found) yet?

Thank you && Regards, Jan.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

 Vulnerabilities

This sounds like 4 issues. It's possible it's less, but I suspect duping
will be less work than splitting in the future. IDs below.

----- Original Message -----
> Hi.
> I've found a bunch of vulnerabilities in the latest release of

> Vuln 1:
> Any variable in the super global $_SESSION array can be overwritten or

> Vuln 2:
> A (common) misconfiguration of phpMyAdmin allows content from the

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# TYPO3-SA-2011-008: Directory Traversal and Code Injection vulnerability in extension phpMyAdmin (phpmyadmin)

It has been discovered that the extension phpMyAdmin (phpmyadmin) is vulnerable to Directory Traversal and Code Injection.

**Component Type:** Third party extension. This extension is not a part of the TYPO3 default installation.

**Affected Versions:** Version 4.11.1 and below

**Vulnerability Type:** Directory Traversal, Code Injection

**Severity:** High

**Suggested CVSS v2.0:** [AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:P/I:N/A:N/E:ND/RL:OF/RC:C](http://jvnrss.ise.chuo-u.ac.jp/jtg/cvss/cvss2.cgi?vector=(AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:P/I:N/A:N/E:ND/RL:OF/RC:C)&g=2&lang=en "CVSS calculator") ([What's that?](http://buzz.typo3.org/teams/security/article/use-of-common-vulnerability-scoring-system-in-typo3-security-advisories/ "Blog post on CVSS usage"))

**References:** PMASA-2011-5, PMASA-2011-6, PMASA-2011-7, PMASA-2011-8

**Release Date:** 06.07.2011

**Problem Description:**

It was possible to manipulate the PHP session superglobal using some of the Swekey authentication code. Because an unsanitized key from the Servers array is written in a comment of the generated config, an attacker can modify this key by modifying the SESSION superglobal array. This allows the attacker to close the comment and inject code.

Through a possible bug in PHP, a null byte can truncate the pattern string allowing an attacker to inject the /e modifier causing the preg\_replace function to execute its second argument as PHP code.

Filtering of a file path in the MIME-type transformation code, which allowed for directory traversal has been fixed.

**Solution:** An updated version 4.11.2 is available from the TYPO3 extension manager and at[typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/phpmyadmin/4.11.2/](http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/phpmyadmin/4.11.2/). Users of the extension are advised to update the extension as soon as possible.

The TYPO3 Security Team requests TYPO3 administrators to consider our advice from [TYPO3-SA-2009-015](http://typo3.org/teams/security/security-bulletins/typo3-sa-2009-015/) to either use extension phpMyAdmin only on development servers or to use the phpMyAdmin standalone application on production servers.

This advice is also relevant in context of the TYPO3 Security Team not being informed about this security fix by the extension maintainer. Therefore, the TYPO3 Security Team cannot guarantee to publish advisories along with future security fixes released by the extension maintainer.

**Credits:** Thanks to Andreas Beutel for providing a TYPO3 extension package with an updated phpMyAdmin version.

**General advice:** Follow the recommendations that are given in the [TYPO3 Security Cookbook](http://typo3.org/teams/security/security-bulletins/fileadmin/security-team/typo3_security_cookbook_v-0.5.pdf "Initiates file download"). Please subscribe to the[typo3-announce mailing list](http://lists.typo3.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/typo3-announce "Opens external link in new window") to receive future Security Bulletins via E-mail.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### phpMyAdmin 3.x Multiple Remote Code Executions

This post details a few interesting vulnerabilities I found while relaxing and reading the sourcecode of phpMyAdmin. [My original advisory can be found here.](http://www.xxor.se/advisories/phpMyAdmin_3.x_Multiple_Remote_Code_Executions.txt)

If you would like me to audit your PHP project, check out Xxor's [PHP security auditing service](http://www.xxor.se/services/php-security-audit.php).
http://www.xxor.se/services/php-security-audit.php
## The first vulnerability

File: libraries/auth/swekey/swekey.auth.lib.php

Lines: 266-276

Patched in: 3.3.10.2 and 3.4.3.1

Type: Variable Manipulation

Assigned CVE id: [CVE-2011-2505](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-2505)

PMA Announcement-ID: [PMASA-2011-5](http://www.phpmyadmin.net/home_page/security/PMASA-2011-5.php)
`if (strstr($_SERVER['QUERY_STRING'],'session_to_unset') != false)
{
parse_str($_SERVER['QUERY_STRING']);
session_write_close();
session_id($session_to_unset);
session_start();
$_SESSION = array();
session_write_close();
session_destroy();
exit;
}`
Notice the call to [parse\_str](http://php.net/manual/en/function.parse-str.php) on line 268 that passes the query string as it's first argument. It's missing a second argument. This means that what ever parameters and values are present in the query string will be used as variables in the current namespace. But since the code path that executes the call to parse\_str inevitably leads to a call to exit there ain't much to exploit. However the session variables persists between requests. Thus giving us full control of the $\_SESSION array.

When reading the code, you might believe that the session gets destroyed. But the call to session\_write\_close on line 269 saves the modified session, and the call to session\_id on line 270 switches session. This could be confuseing when testing in a browser because the call to session\_start will send a new cookie instructing the browser to forget about the modified session.

From here on there are numerous XSS and SQL injection vulnerabilities open for attack. But we'll focus on three far more serious vulnerabilities.
## The second vulnerability

Patched in: 3.3.10.2 and 3.4.3.1

Type: Remote Static Code Injection

Assigned CVE id: [CVE-2011-2506](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-2506)

PMA Announcement-ID: [PMASA-2011-6](http://www.phpmyadmin.net/home_page/security/PMASA-2011-6.php)

File: setup/lib/ConfigGenerator.class.php

Lines: 16-78

`/**
* Creates config file
*
* @return string
*/
public static function getConfigFile()
{
$cf = ConfigFile::getInstance();
$crlf = (isset($_SESSION['eol']) && $_SESSION['eol'] == 'win') ? "\r\n" : "\n";
$c = $cf->getConfig();
// header
$ret = 'get('PMA_VERSION')
. ' setup script' . $crlf
. ' * Date: ' . date(DATE_RFC1123) . $crlf
. ' */' . $crlf . $crlf;
// servers
if ($cf->getServerCount() > 0) {
$ret .= "/* Servers configuration */$crlf\$i = 0;" . $crlf . $crlf;
foreach ($c['Servers'] as $id => $server) {
$ret .= '/* Server: ' . strtr($cf->getServerName($id), '*/', '-') . " [$id] */" . $crlf
. '$i++;' . $crlf;
foreach ($server as $k => $v) {
$k = preg_replace('/[^A-Za-z0-9_]/', '_', $k);
$ret .= "\$cfg['Servers'][\$i]['$k'] = "
. (is_array($v) && self::_isZeroBasedArray($v)
? self::_exportZeroBasedArray($v, $crlf)
: var_export($v, true))
. ';' . $crlf;
}
$ret .= $crlf;
}
$ret .= '/* End of servers configuration */' . $crlf . $crlf;
}
unset($c['Servers']);
// other settings
$persistKeys = $cf->getPersistKeysMap();
foreach ($c as $k => $v) {
$k = preg_replace('/[^A-Za-z0-9_]/', '_', $k);
$ret .= self::_getVarExport($k, $v, $crlf);
if (isset($persistKeys[$k])) {
unset($persistKeys[$k]);
}
}
// keep 1d array keys which are present in $persist_keys (config.values.php)
foreach (array_keys($persistKeys) as $k) {
if (strpos($k, '/') === false) {
$k = preg_replace('/[^A-Za-z0-9_]/', '_', $k);
$ret .= self::_getVarExport($k, $cf->getDefault($k), $crlf);
}
}
$ret .= '?>';
return $ret;
}`
On line 42 in this file a comment is created to show some additional information in a config file. We can see that the output of the call to $cf->getServerName($id) is sanitized to prevent user input from closing the comment. However $id, the key of the $c['Servers'] array, is not. So if we could rename a key in this array we could close the comment and inject arbitrary PHP code.

On line 26 the $c array is created from a call to $cf->getConfig().

File: libraries/config/ConfigFile.class.php

Lines: 469-482

`/**
* Returns configuration array (full, multidimensional format)
*
* @return array
*/
public function getConfig()
{
$c = $_SESSION[$this->id];
foreach ($this->cfgUpdateReadMapping as $map_to => $map_from) {
PMA_array_write($map_to, $c, PMA_array_read($map_from, $c));
PMA_array_remove($map_from, $c);
}
return $c;
}`
Bingo! The $c array is derived from the $\_SESSION array hence we could have full control of its contents by utilizing the first vulnerability. Now we can inject arbitrary PHP code that will be saved into the file config/config.inc.php. Then we would just browse to this file and the webserver would executed it.

This vulnerability requires one specific condition. The config directory must have been left in place after the initial configuration. This is something advised against and hence a majority of servers wont be susceptible to this attack. Therefor we'll check out a third and a fourth vulnerability.
## The third vulnerability

Patched in: 3.3.10.2 and 3.4.3.1

Type: Authenticated Remote Code Execution

Assigned CVE id: [CVE-2011-2507](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-2507)

PMA Announcement-ID: [PMASA-2011-7](http://www.phpmyadmin.net/home_page/security/PMASA-2011-6.php)

File: server\_synchronize.php

Line: 466

`$trg_db = $_SESSION['trg_db'];`
Line: 477
`$uncommon_tables = $_SESSION['uncommon_tables'];`
Line: 674
`PMA_createTargetTables($src_db, $trg_db, $src_link, $trg_link, $uncommon_tables, $uncommon_table_structure_diff[$s], $uncommon_tables_fields, false);`
File: libraries/server\_synchronize.lib.php

Lines: 613-631
`function PMA_createTargetTables($src_db, $trg_db, $src_link, $trg_link, &$uncommon_tables, $table_index, &$uncommon_tables_fields, $display)
{
if (isset($uncommon_tables[$table_index])) {
$fields_result = PMA_DBI_get_fields($src_db, $uncommon_tables[$table_index], $src_link);
$fields = array();
foreach ($fields_result as $each_field) {
$field_name = $each_field['Field'];
$fields[] = $field_name;
}
$uncommon_tables_fields[$table_index] = $fields;
$Create_Query = PMA_DBI_fetch_value("SHOW CREATE TABLE " . PMA_backquote($src_db) . '.' . PMA_backquote($uncommon_tables[$table_index]), 0, 1, $src_link);
// Replace the src table name with a `dbname`.`tablename`
$Create_Table_Query = preg_replace('/' . PMA_backquote($uncommon_tables[$table_index]) . '/',
PMA_backquote($trg_db) . '.' .PMA_backquote($uncommon_tables[$table_index]),
$Create_Query,
$limit = 1
);`
The variables $uncommon\_tables[$table\_index] and $trg\_db are derived from the $\_SESSION array. By utilizing the first vulnerability we can inject what ever we want into both the first and the second argument of the function preg\_replace on lines 627-631. [In a previous post to this blog I've detailed how this condition can be turned into a remote code execution](http://www.blogger.com/2011/06/null-byte-injection-in-pregreplace.html). Basicly we can inject the *"e"* modifier into the regexp pattern which causes the second argument to be executed as PHP code.

This vulnerability have two major restrictions from an attackers perspective. First the [Suhosin](http://www.hardened-php.net/suhosin/) patch that completly defends against this type of attack. Second, this piece of code can only be reached if we're authenticated. So to exploit it we would need to have previous knowledge of credentials to an account of the database that phpMyAdmin is set up to manage. Except for some obscure configurations that allows us to bypass this restriction.

Since the Suhosin patch is pretty popular, and for example compiled by default in OpenBSD's PHP packages, it's worth exploring a fourth vulnerability.
## The fourth vulnerability

Patched in: 3.3.10.2 and 3.4.3.1

Type: Path Traversal

Assigned CVE id: [CVE-2011-2508](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-2508)

PMA Announcement-ID: [PMASA-2011-8](http://www.phpmyadmin.net/home_page/security/PMASA-2011-6.php)

File: libraries/display\_tbl.lib.php

Lines: 1291-1299
`if ($GLOBALS['cfgRelation']['mimework'] && $GLOBALS['cfg']['BrowseMIME']) {
if (isset($GLOBALS['mime_map'][$meta->name]['mimetype']) && isset($GLOBALS['mime_map'][$meta->name]['transformation']) && !empty($GLOBALS['mime_map'][$meta->name]['transformation'])) {
$include_file = $GLOBALS['mime_map'][$meta->name]['transformation'];
if (file_exists('./libraries/transformations/' . $include_file)) {
$transformfunction_name = str_replace('.inc.php', '', $GLOBALS['mime_map'][$meta->name]['transformation']);
require_once './libraries/transformations/' . $include_file;`
This fourth vulnerability is a directory traversal in a call to require\_once which can be exploited as a local file inclusion. The variable $GLOBALS['mime\_map'][$meta->name]['transformation'] is derived from user input. For example, by setting $GLOBALS['mime\_map'][$meta->name]['transformation'] to "../../../../../../etc/passwd" the local passwd-file could show up.

This vulnerability can only be reached if we're authenticated and requires that the transformation feature is setup correctly in phpMyAdmin's configuration storage. However, the $GLOBALS['cfgRelation'] array is derived from the $\_SESSION array. Hence the variable $GLOBALS['cfgRelation']['mimework'] used to check this can be modified using the first vulnerability.

File: libraries/display\_tbl.lib.php

Lines: 707-710
`if ($GLOBALS['cfgRelation']['commwork'] && $GLOBALS['cfgRelation']['mimework'] && $GLOBALS['cfg']['BrowseMIME'] && ! $_SESSION['tmp_user_values']['hide_transformation']) {
require_once './libraries/transformations.lib.php';
$GLOBALS['mime_map'] = PMA_getMIME($db, $table);
}`
And the fact that $GLOBALS['mime\_map'] is conditionally initialized together with the fact that phpMyAdmin registers all request variables in the global namespace (blacklists some, but not mime\_map) allows us to set $GLOBALS['mime\_map'][$meta->name]['transformation'] to whatever we want, even when the transformation feature is not setup correctly.
## Summary

* If the config folder is left in place, phpMyAdmin is vulnerable.

* If an attacker has access to database credentials and the Suhosin patch is not installed, phpMyAdmin is vulnerable.

* If an attacker has access to database credentials and knows how to exploit a local file inclution, phpMyAdmin is vulnerable.

   @Anonymous

   Your original session is modified by:
   parse\_str($\_SERVER['QUERY\_STRING']);

   Then it switches session with:
   session\_id($session\_to\_unset);

   Then the new session is reset using:
   session\_start();

   Your original session remains and is modified.

   Don't try to test this issue in a browser. Write a script to handle the cookies and requests yourself.

   @Mango
   How to modify that session with $\_SERVER['QUERY\_STRING']

   is it right way?

   ./swekey.auth.lib.php?\_SESSION['attribute']=myvalue&session\_to\_unset=null

   but why i can't modify Session

   @Josh

   ./index.php?\_SESSION[attribute]=myvalue&session\_to\_unset=null

   It cant be done with a browser. Since you need to retain your old cookies when it switches session.

   @Anonymous2

   It's usable as a LFI.

   If the transformation feature in phpMyAdmin is setup correctly, you can insert the path in it's interface. Otherwise you need to write a script to use the first vulnerability.

    It seems it's not the Suhosin patch which will defend against the /e modifier attack, but rather the extension combined with the following, off-by-default option:

    What is a WPS pin?
    Well, the **[WPS Pin](https://www.hpprintersupportpro.com/blog/find-the-wps-pin-on-my-hp-printer/)** connects the HP Printer to the wireless network; it is also known as a WiFi protected setup pin. To get this code, you have two options either from the back of the router or you can get from the printer control panel. Firstly you should check beneath your router or at the end of it; if you can’t find it over there, then follow this process- press the home menu on your printer control panel then press the wireless icon. After that click wireless option and then press Wifi protected setup, now click Generate personal identification number, and note down your WPS pin.

     I’m extremely impressed along with your writing skills as smartly as with the structure to your weblog.

      **Is blocking someone on Facebook impression on-page part?**

     To make an impression on a page part, you are needed to sign in to your Facebook account and then navigate the business page. If you are [**blocking someone on Facebook,**](https://www.supporttechhelp.com/blog/how-to-unblock-someone-on-facebook/) then you failed to do it. Actually, you have to tap on the compose something tab and then sort the message what you want to convey to your page part.

     Which is the best office set up according to you?
     There are numerous office setups available in the market like WPS office, Libre, Microsoft **[office.com/setup](https://m-officecomsetup.com/)** to name a few. But in my opinion, the popularity and feasibility of Microsoft office in comparison to others are remarkable. It offers a complete package of products and services that are required in an enterprise and their products are way easy to use. The only thing is its cost. It costs comparatively more than the other available options but then its features take full control and the cost seems nothing in front. Its latest version Office 2019 is getting popular day by day but on the other hand Office 365, a cloud-based version is still holding the command over others.

     There are numerous office setups available in the market like WPS office, Libre, Microsoft **[office.com/setup](https://m-officecomsetup.com/)** to name a few. But in my opinion, the popularity and feasibility of Microsoft office in comparison to others are remarkable. It offers a complete package of products and services that are required in an enterprise and their products are way easy to use. The only thing is its cost. It costs comparatively more than the other available options but then its features take full control and the cost seems nothing in front. Its latest version Office 2019 is getting popular day by day but on the other hand Office 365, a cloud-based version is still holding the command over others.

     blog commenting is, by all means, the easiest way of making blogs interactive. But wait – it helps the blogger who has written the blog as the comments got so many people discussing the blog topic in context. Also, blog comments helped in making the blog social as people talk about it and share it. But is it also valuable to individuals who are commenting on the blog?

Subject: CVE Request: phpMyAdmin 3.4 Multiple Vulnerabilities

Hi.
I've found a bunch of vulnerabilities in the latest release of phpMyAdmin.

Vuln 1:
Any variable in the super global $_SESSION array can be overwritten or
created with an arbitrate value.

Vuln 2:
A (common) misconfiguration of phpMyAdmin allows content from the $_SESSION
array can be written to a .php-file.
Combined with Vuln 1 this becomes a conditional remote code execution.

Vuln 3:
Content from the $_SESSION array are (post authentication) used as input to
a function that can execute PHP code.
Under the current circumstances a previously unknown null byte string
truncation in this function is used.
I have only been able to reproduce this string truncation on PHP 5.2.13
running on Windows 7 and I've failed to reproduce it on PHP 5.2.13 running
on OpenBSD 4.7 and PHP 5.2.17 running on Linux 2.6.18. I do lack
the necessary C++ debugging skills to find out why this only works on my
windows box.
Combined with Vuln 1 this becomes an authenticated remote code execution.

Vuln 4:
Under a certain configuration an authenticated attacker can include a local
file and interpret it's content as PHP.
By modifying values in the $_SESSION array a cache holding the required
configuration option can be temporarily altered during run time.
If combined with Vuln 1 all configurations are vulnerable to this
authenticated local file inclusion.

Vuln 2 & 3 does not rely on Vuln 1 since the $_SESSION array could also be
modified by a local attacker trying to elevate his/hers privileges in an
improperly configured shared environment.
Do I need 4 CVEs?
