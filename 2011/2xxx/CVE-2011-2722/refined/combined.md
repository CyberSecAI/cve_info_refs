# HPLIP: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201203-17**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in HPLIP, the worst of
which may allow execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-print/hplip** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.11.10** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.11.10** |

### Background

The Hewlett-Packard Linux Imaging and Printing system (HPLIP) provides
drivers for HP's inkjet and laser printers, scanners and fax machines.

### Description

Two vulnerabilities have been found in HPLIP:

* The "hpmud\_get\_pml()" function in pml.c contains a boundary error
  which could cause a stack-based buffer overflow (CVE-2010-4267).
* The "send\_data\_to\_stdout()" function in hpcupsfax.cpp creates
  insecure temporary files (CVE-2011-2722).

### Impact

A remote attacker might send specially crafted SNMP reponses, possibly
resulting in execution of arbitrary code or a Denial of Service
condition. Furthermore, a local attacker could perform symlink attacks to
overwrite arbitrary files.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All HPLIP users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-print/hplip-3.11.10"

```

## Topic

Updated hplip3 packages that fix one security issue and one bug are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

## Description

Hewlett-Packard Linux Imaging and Printing (HPLIP) provides drivers for
Hewlett-Packard (HP) printers and multifunction peripherals.

It was found that the HP CUPS (Common UNIX Printing System) fax filter in
HPLIP created a temporary file in an insecure way. A local attacker could
use this flaw to perform a symbolic link attack, overwriting arbitrary
files accessible to a process using the fax filter (such as the
hp3-sendfax tool). (CVE-2011-2722)

This update also fixes the following bug:

* Previous modifications of the hplip3 package to allow it to be installed

alongside the original hplip package introduced several problems to fax
support; for example, the hp-sendfax utility could become unresponsive.
These problems have been fixed with this update. (BZ#501834)

All users of hplip3 are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Because a predicatable temporary filename is used (/tmp/hpcupsfax.out), an attacker could use a symlink attack to overwrite an arbitrary file with the privileges of the process running the HP CUPS fax filter.  422     FILE    *fp; 423     fp = NULL; 424     if (iLogLevel & SAVE_PCL_FILE) 425     { 426         fp = fopen ("/tmp/hpcupsfax.out", "w"); 427         system ("chmod 666 /tmp/hpcupsfax.out"); 428     } 429     while ((i = read (fdFax, pTmp, iSize)) > 0) 430     { 431         write (STDOUT_FILENO, pTmp, i); 432         if (iLogLevel & SAVE_PCL_FILE && fp) 433         { 434             fwrite (pTmp, 1, i, fp); 435         } 436     } 437     free (pTmp);  This flaw only exists in hplip 3.x and is not present in earlier versions of hplip.  [1] <https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=704608>   Statement:  This issue did not affect the versions of hplip as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5. A future update in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 (for hplip3) and 6 may address this flaw.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=725830#c1)  Vincent Danen    2011-07-26 17:29:27 UTC  ``` Created hplip tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 725831](show_bug.cgi?id=725831 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - hplip: insecure temporary file handling [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=725830#c2)  Vincent Danen    2011-07-26 20:44:58 UTC  ``` This was assigned the name CVE-2011-2722:  <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/07/26/14>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=725830#c3)  Tim Waugh    2011-07-29 09:48:08 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 515866](attachment.cgi?id=515866&action=diff "hplip-CVE-2011-2722.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=515866&action=edit "hplip-CVE-2011-2722.patch") hplip-CVE-2011-2722.patch  Suggested patch.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

I wonder why there is not any kind of response

from the HPLIP team regarding this security bug?

First and foremost I aks for a response whether or not

the HPLIP developers think it is actually a security bug.

As far as I see the crucial point to decide this is to know

under which exact circumstances the condition

"if (iLogLevel & SAVE\_PCL\_FILE)" becomes "true".

If "iLogLevel & SAVE\_PCL\_FILE" is true in in normal operation

(i.e. when it is true by default), it is a security bug.

In contrast if "iLogLevel & SAVE\_PCL\_FILE" is true only

under special circumstances it may be no security bug.

E.g. when only the user "root" can set someting

so that "iLogLevel & SAVE\_PCL\_FILE" is true

(e.g. somehow enable debugging mode which is

by default disabled for normal users)

when the issue is no security bug.

I do not have the knowledge to decide this.

Therefore an analysis from the HPLIP team is needed.

Hi,

Sorry for the delay in response. Regarding the issue mentioned by you, here are my comments.

1) SAVE\_PCL\_FILE is a macro defined in ./prnt/hpcups/CommonDefinitions.h of HPLIP Source code. ie

#define BASIC\_LOG 1

#define SAVE\_PCL\_FILE 2

#define SAVE\_INPUT\_RASTERS 4

#define SEND\_TO\_PRINTER\_ALSO 8

2) iLogLevel is read from the file /etc/cups/cupsd.conf if following line is present in the file.

hpLogLevel <NUMBER>

Where <NUMBER> is the integer value betwwen 1-15 based on our need.

Note: This line is not present in the above file by default. For debugging purpose only root can add this line in /etc/cups/cupsd.conf and then collect the logs.

Therefore "if (iLogLevel & SAVE\_PCL\_FILE) " condition will be True only when /etc/cups/cupsd.conf file is modified in root mode and then cups is restarted. Since "iLogLevel & SAVE\_PCL\_FILE" is true only under special circumstances it should not be a security bug.

Thanks,

Sanjay

Sanjay, your explanation as given is not an excuse of writing insecure code, as there is

no way to "secure" enable this option on systems with potential malicious users.

A simple symlink left in /tmp/hpcupsfax.out to /etc/shadow or other relevant system files could be used by local attackers to make that file writable and ultimately gain root privileges.

Hello Marcus,

Thanks for your comments. The code which you are seeing above is exercised only when there is a problem and we need to generate the log files and debug information. The log levels are enabled by the users and are exercised only temporarily to generate the logs. After logs are generated, they will revert it back to original settings.These files can be cleaned up by the users after generating the logs. Please let us know if this is still an issue.

Sanjay,

I wished there were comments in the HPLIP code which tell

how the stuff is meant (i.e. what the purpose and idea behind is).

Because I don't know for sure what the purpose and idea behind is

I can only make assumptions according to how I understand the code.

Based on this assumptions I think the following:

From my point of view "/tmp/hpcupsfax.out" is not meant

as a temporary file but as output file for debugging purpose

which (unfortunately) exists in a directory (/tmp)

where any user can create a symbolic link like for example

  /tmp/hpcupsfax.out -> /etc/passwd

and then when

  system ("chmod 666 /tmp/hpcupsfax.out")

would be run as root (I don't know under which user it runs)

it would do an evil thing.

When "/tmp/hpcupsfax.out" is meant as output file for debugging purpose

it would be not nice when the debugging output file name is not

a fixed name which is known in advance but instead it would be some

secure but awkward "mktemp" name like /tmp/hpcupsfax.out.XXXXXXXXXX

When "/tmp/hpcupsfax.out" is meant as output file for debugging purpose

I think it should be o.k. to remove an existing file or symbolic link

with this name via something like:

if (iLogLevel & SAVE\_PCL\_FILE)

  {

    if (system ("rm -f /tmp/hpcupsfax.out"))

    { return 1;

    }

    fp = fopen ("/tmp/hpcupsfax.out", "w");

    system ("chmod 666 /tmp/hpcupsfax.out");

  }

But because of the stick bit in the /tmp/ directory

"rm -f /tmp/hpcupsfax.out" works only for root and for the user

who had created /tmp/hpcupsfax.out

I think this could be o.k. because when the stuff is run as root

it would enforce "the right thing" and when it is run as non-root

it would do "the right thing" when /tmp/hpcupsfax.out from

the same user already exists and otherwise it would return

something like a "failed" state as far as I guess the meaning

of "return 1" in prnt/hpijs/hpcupsfax.cpp

But I am not a security expert to finally decide about it.

fp = fopen ("/tmp/hpcupsfax.out", "w");
system ("chmod 666 /tmp/hpcupsfax.out");
}
But because of the stick bit in the /tmp/ directory
"rm -f /tmp/hpcupsfax.out" works only for root and for the user
who had created /tmp/hpcupsfax.out
I think this could be o.k. because when the stuff is run as root
it would enforce "the right thing" and when it is run as non-root
it would do "the right thing" when /tmp/hpcupsfax.out from
the same user already exists and otherwise it would return
something like a "failed" state as far as I guess the meaning
of "return 1" in prnt/hpijs/hpcupsfax.cpp
But I am not a security expert to finally decide about it.

Hi Johannes,

Thanks for the detailed analysis of the problem. We will remove the hard coded name "hpcupsfax.out" for the temp file creation and instead create temp file using mkstemp() call. Please let us know if there is any issue.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

# USN-1981-1: HPLIP vulnerabilities

30 September 2013

HPLIP could be made to overwrite files.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [hplip](/security/cves?package=hplip) - HP Linux Printing and Imaging System (HPLIP)

## Details

It was discovered that HPLIP incorrectly handled temporary files when using

the fax capabilities. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to

overwrite arbitrary files. This issue only applied to Ubuntu 10.04 LTS.

([CVE-2011-2722](/security/CVE-2011-2722))

Tim Waugh discovered that HPLIP incorrectly handled temporary files when

printing. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to overwrite

arbitrary files. In the default installation of Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu

12.10, this should be prevented by the Yama link restrictions.

([CVE-2013-0200](/security/CVE-2013-0200))

### Reduce your security exposure

##### Ubuntu 12.10

* [hplip](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/hplip)
  -
  [3.12.6-3ubuntu4.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/hplip/3.12.6-3ubuntu4.2)

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [hplip](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/hplip)
  -
  [3.12.2-1ubuntu3.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/hplip/3.12.2-1ubuntu3.3)

##### Ubuntu 10.04

  -
  [3.10.2-2ubuntu2.4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/hplip/3.10.2-2ubuntu2.4)

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.
