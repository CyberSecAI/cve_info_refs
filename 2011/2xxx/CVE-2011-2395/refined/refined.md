Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-2395:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way Cisco switches handle fragmented IPv6 packets when the Router Advertisement Guard feature is enabled. Specifically, the switch fails to properly inspect fragmented packets, allowing malicious router advertisements to bypass the guard.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate Fragment Handling:** The primary weakness is the switch's inability to correctly reassemble and inspect fragmented IPv6 packets, particularly those containing router advertisements.
*   **Bypass of Router Advertisement Guard:** The vulnerability allows attackers to circumvent the intended protection mechanism, the Router Advertisement Guard.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** By sending malicious router advertisements, an attacker can manipulate the routing tables of vulnerable hosts on the network. This could allow the attacker to intercept and potentially modify network traffic.
*   **Network Disruption:**  Malicious RAs can lead to network instability and denial-of-service conditions, effectively disrupting legitimate network communication.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Fragmented IPv6 Packets:** The attack involves crafting IPv6 packets with specific fragmentation characteristics.
*   **Malicious Router Advertisements (RAs):**  The core of the exploit is the injection of manipulated ICMPv6 router advertisements.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Proximity:** The attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the vulnerable Cisco switch.
*   **Packet Crafting:** The attacker needs the capability to craft and send fragmented IPv6 packets.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attack can be performed without requiring authentication.

**Specific Attack Methods:**

1.  **Fragmented RA:**
    *   The attacker sends two fragmented IPv6 packets.
    *   The first fragment contains the IPv6 header, a fragmentation header, and a large destination header.
    *   The second fragment contains the continuation of the destination header and a malicious ICMPv6 RA.
    *   The switch fails to reconstruct and properly inspect the fragmented packet, allowing the malicious RA to bypass the guard.

2.  **Fragmented Overwrite (Workaround Bypass):**
    *   The attacker sends two fragmented IPv6 packets.
    *   The first fragment contains the IPv6 header, a fragmentation header, a small destination header and a benign ICMPv6 echo request.
    *   The second fragment contains a fragmentation header with an offset that overwrites the ICMPv6 echo request with a malicious ICMPv6 RA.
    *   The switch may interpret the overwritten information as a valid RA. The exact outcome is platform dependent (some platforms take the first fragment, others take the last fragment received).

**Workaround:**

The suggested workaround is to implement an IPv6 ACL (Access Control List) on all ports that blocks traffic with an "undetermined-transport" type. This will drop packets that the switch cannot correctly identify, including the crafted packets used in the attack. However, this may also block legitimate but unusual IPv6 traffic.

**Additional Notes:**

*   Cisco was informed of the vulnerability and "accepts the risk" according to the source material.
*   The information provided indicates that the vulnerability has a high exploitability score (10/10) and a low attack complexity.
