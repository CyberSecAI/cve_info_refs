```
  - Root cause of vulnerability: The `sendfile` functionality in Tomcat's HTTP connectors (APR and NIO) did not properly sanitize arguments when a web application was running under a security manager, allowing bypass of security restrictions.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: 
      -  **Improper Input Validation:** Tomcat did not sanitize the arguments provided to the `sendfile` call methods.
      - **Security Manager Bypass:** When a security manager was enabled, a malicious web application could bypass file access restrictions.
      - **JVM Crash:** Using the APR connector, invalid `sendfile` start/end points could be specified causing a JVM crash.
  - Impact of exploitation:
      - **Information Disclosure:** A malicious web application could access server files that should be inaccessible under the security manager.
      - **Denial of Service (DoS):** A malicious web application could specify invalid sendfile start/end points causing a JVM crash leading to DoS.
  - Attack vectors: A malicious web application deployed on a vulnerable Tomcat instance would be able to leverage the `sendfile` functionality.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position:
    - The attacker must be able to deploy a malicious web application on the vulnerable server.
    - The application must be running under a security manager.
    - The HTTP APR or NIO connector must be enabled and configured to allow sendfile (default).
