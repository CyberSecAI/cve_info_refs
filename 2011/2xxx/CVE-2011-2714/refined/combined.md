Please use CVE-2011-2714 for the XSS.

CVE-2011-2715 is for the SQL injection.

Thanks.

# Drupal Data Module Multiple Vulnerabilities

---

*From*: Justin Klein Keane <justin () madirish net>

*Date*: Wed, 09 Feb 2011 12:40:29 -0500

---

```
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Description of Vulnerability:

Drupal (<http://drupal.org>) is a robust content management system (CMS)
written in PHP and MySQL. The Drupal Data module
(<http://drupal.org/project/data>) "helps you model, manage and query
related sets of tables. It offers an administration interface and a low
level API for manipulating tables and accessing their contents."

The Data module contains multiple Cross Site Scripting (XSS)
vulnerabilities because it fails to sanitize table descriptions, field
names or labels before display.  This results in multiple stored XSS as
well as DOM based XSS vulnerabilities.  Drupal site users with the
ability to create or edit tables using the Data module could inject
arbitrary HTML into administrative pages.

The Data module also contains numerous SQL injection vulnerabilities
because it fails to sanitize values for table names or column names
before invoking SQL statements.  This allows users with the ability to
create or edit tables managed by the Data module to perform SQL
injection attacks.

Systems affected:

Drupal 6.20 with Data 6.x-1.0-alpha14 was tested and shown to be vulnerable.

Impact

User could inject arbitrary scripts into pages affecting site users.
This could result in administrative account compromise leading to web
server process compromise. A more likely scenario would be for an
attacker to inject hidden content (such as iframes, applets, or embedded
objects) that would attack client browsers in an attempt to compromise
site users' machines. This vulnerability could also be used to launch
cross site request forgery (XSRF) attacks against the site that could
have other unexpected consequences.

Mitigating factors:

In order to exploit this vulnerability the attacker must have
credentials to an authorized account that has been assigned the
permissions to administer or edit in the Data module. This could be
accomplished via social engineering, brute force password guessing, or
abuse or legitimate credentials.

Vendor response:

Drupal security team does not handle issues with pre-release versions of
modules (such as alpha or dev). These issues were reported in the
module's public issue queue (<http://drupal.org/node/1056470>).

The text of this advisory has also been posted at
<http://www.madirish.net/?article=480>

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.
