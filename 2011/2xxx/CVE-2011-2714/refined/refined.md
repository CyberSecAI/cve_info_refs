Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2011-2714:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The Drupal Data module fails to sanitize user-supplied data (table descriptions, field names, and labels) before displaying it. This lack of sanitization allows for the injection of arbitrary HTML/scripts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The module is vulnerable to both stored XSS and DOM-based XSS.
    *   **Stored XSS:** Malicious scripts are saved in the database and executed when the data is displayed to other users.
    *   **DOM based XSS:** Malicious script is injected via a reflected vector by manipulating the DOM.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary script execution:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts that execute in the browsers of users who view affected pages.
*   **Administrative account compromise:** Successful XSS attacks could potentially lead to the compromise of administrative accounts.
*   **Web server process compromise:** Through account compromise, an attacker could potentially gain control of the web server.
*   **Client-side attacks:**  Attackers can inject hidden content (iframes, applets, embedded objects) to attack client browsers.
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (XSRF) attacks:** XSS can be leveraged to launch XSRF attacks, potentially leading to unexpected consequences on the affected site.

**Attack vectors:**

*   An attacker must have an authorized account with permissions to create or edit tables using the Data module.
*   Injection of malicious HTML/Javascript occurs through table descriptions, field names, or labels.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs a valid account on the Drupal site with the appropriate permissions to administer or edit within the Data module. This could be obtained through social engineering, brute-force password attacks, or by exploiting existing legitimate credentials.
