### Overview

The Oracle products and components listed above are affected by multiple vulnerabilities. The impacts of these vulnerabilities include remote execution of arbitrary code, information disclosure, and denial of service.

The [Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2011](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/cpujuly2011-313328.html) addresses 78 vulnerabilities in various Oracle products and components. The advisory provides information about affected components, access, and authorization required for successful exploitation and the impact from the vulnerabilities on data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

Oracle has associated CVE identifiers with the vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update. More detail about one of the vulnerabilities is available in US-CERT Vulnerability Note [VU#](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/103425)[103425](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/103425).

### Impact

The impact of these vulnerabilities varies depending on the product, component, and configuration of the system. Potential consequences include the execution of arbitrary code or commands, information disclosure, and denial of service. Vulnerable components may be available to unauthenticated, remote attackers. An attacker who compromises an Oracle database may be able to access sensitive information.

### Solution

Apply the appropriate patches or upgrade as specified in the [Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2011](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/cpujuly2011-313328.html). Note that this document only lists newly corrected issues. Updates to patches for previously known issues are not listed.

## Oracle Outside In CorelDRAW file parser stack buffer overflow

#### Vulnerability Note VU#103425

Original Release Date: 2011-07-19 | Last Revised: 2014-04-28

---

### Overview

Oracle Outside In contains a stack buffer overflow in the CorelDRAW parser, which can allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.

### Description

| [Oracle Outside In](http://www.oracle.com/us/technologies/embedded/025613.htm) is a set of libraries that can decode over 500 different file formats. Originally written by Stellent, [Outside In is now part of Oracle](http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/Acquisitions/stellent/index.html). The Oracle Outside In libraries are used by a variety of applications, including Oracle Fusion Middleware, Google Search Appliance, Guidance Encase Forensics, AccessData FTK, and Novell Groupwise.  Outside In versions 8.3.5.5927 and 8.3.2.5927 and earlier fail to properly handle CorelDRAW data, which is handled by the imcdr2.flt library. |
| --- |

### Impact

| By causing an application to process a specially-crafted .CDR file with the Oracle Outside In library, a remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the vulnerable application. Depending on what application is using Outside In, this may happen as the result of some user interaction, such as single-clicking on a file, or it may happen with no user interaction at all. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**These vulnerabilites are addressed in the Oracle Fusion Middleware [Critical Patch Update July 2011](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/cpujuly2011-313328.html). Please see [Oracle Support Note 1323616.1](http://support.oracle.com/CSP/main/article?cmd=show&type=NOT&id=1323616.1) (valid Oracle CSI# required) for more details. If you are using an application that uses Outside In, please check with that application's vendor for updates. If updates for your application are not yet available, or if you wish to mitigate other vulnerabilities in Outside In, please consider the following workarounds: |
| --- |

| **Use the Microsoft Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit**  The [Microsoft Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=c6f0a6ee-05ac-4eb6-acd0-362559fd2f04) (EMET) can be used to help prevent exploitation of this and other vulnerabilities.**Enable DEP in Microsoft Windows**Consider enabling Data Execution Prevention (DEP) in supported versions of Windows. DEP should not be treated as a complete workaround, but it can mitigate the execution of attacker-supplied code in some cases. Microsoft has published detailed technical information about DEP in Security Research & Defense blog posts "Understanding DEP as a mitigation technology" [part 1](http://blogs.technet.com/srd/archive/2009/06/05/understanding-dep-as-a-mitigation-technology-part-1.aspx) and [part 2](http://blogs.technet.com/srd/archive/2009/06/12/understanding-dep-as-a-mitigation-technology-part-2.aspx). DEP should be used in conjunction with the application of patches or other mitigations described in this document.Note that when relying on DEP for exploit mitigation, it is important to use a system that supports Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) as well. ASLR is not supported by Windows XP or Windows Server 2003 or earlier. ASLR was introduced with Microsoft Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008. Please see the Microsoft SRD blog entry: [On the effectiveness of DEP and ASLR](http://blogs.technet.com/b/srd/archive/2010/12/08/on-the-effectiveness-of-dep-and-aslr.aspx) for more details. |

### [MarkLogic Corporation](#WDON-8J4JEE) Affected

Notified:  August 08, 2011  Updated: August 26, 2011

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

MarkLogic Corporation acknowledges CERT Vulnerability Notes VU#103425 and
VU#520721 and confirms that an affected version of Oracle Outside In is bundled
and shipped with MarkLogic Server versions 4.0, 4.1 and 4.2.  Outside In file
conversion is a keyed option in MarkLogic Server.  The Outside In converters
cannot be accessed from within the MarkLogic Server programming environment
without an installed license key that enables the Outside In conversion
option.  The Outside In conversion option for MarkLogic Server has not been
advertised and circulation is highly restricted.  Therefore, the security risk
imposed by the bundled Outside In utility on the MarkLogic user community is
extremely limited.

Regardless, the affected Outside In libraries have been removed from MarkLogic
Server 4.1 (4.1-11) and 4.2 (4.2-6) and will be absent in all future
maintenance releases for those codelines.  Further, Outside In will be removed
entirely from upcoming MarkLogic Server version 5.0.
