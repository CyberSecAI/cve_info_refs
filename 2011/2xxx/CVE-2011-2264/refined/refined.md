Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2011-2264:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A stack buffer overflow exists within the CorelDRAW parser of Oracle Outside In library (specifically the `imcdr2.flt` library).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stack buffer overflow: The vulnerability lies in how the CorelDRAW file parser handles specially crafted .CDR files, allowing for the overwriting of memory on the stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: A remote, unauthenticated attacker can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the application using the vulnerable Oracle Outside In library. This can lead to a full system compromise depending on the application's privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted .CDR files: An attacker needs to create a specially crafted .CDR file.
- Application processing the malicious file: The attacker must cause a vulnerable application using the Oracle Outside In library to process the crafted .CDR file. This can occur via user interaction (e.g., clicking on a file) or automatically depending on the application's functionality.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Remote, unauthenticated attacker: The attacker can be remote and does not require any authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
- Ability to create malicious .CDR files: The attacker must possess the ability to craft a .CDR file that exploits the buffer overflow.
- Induce a vulnerable application to process the malicious .CDR file.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Oracle Outside In versions 8.3.5.5927 and 8.3.2.5927 and earlier.
- Many products from different vendors use the vulnerable Oracle Outside In library making them susceptible to this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is addressed in the Oracle Fusion Middleware Critical Patch Update July 2011.
- Mitigation measures such as using Microsoft EMET or enabling DEP can help reduce the risk of exploitation but are not complete workarounds.
