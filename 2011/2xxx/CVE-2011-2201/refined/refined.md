Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2011-2201:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `Data::FormValidator` Perl module, specifically how it handles data validation when the `untaint_all_constraints` directive is enabled.
- The core issue is that when a regular expression (regex) constraint is used for input validation, a prior successful regex match elsewhere could lead to the module incorrectly marking an invalid field as valid and also untainting it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Validation:** The module incorrectly validates user input against defined constraints, specifically regular expressions.
- **Taint Bypass:** The vulnerability bypasses Perl's taint mode protection, which is intended to prevent the use of potentially unsafe user-provided data. By incorrectly marking invalid input as valid and untainted, the module allows tainted data to be passed further to the script processing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Security Bypass:** A remote attacker can bypass taint mode protections, potentially leading to security vulnerabilities. This can allow an attacker to inject malicious data into an application that was thought to be protected by Data::FormValidator and Perl's taint mode.
- **Code Execution/Data Manipulation:** By bypassing taint checks, it is possible to inject data that, if used improperly, might cause arbitrary code execution or data manipulation. The nature of the impact is dependent on how the validated data is used by the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited by a remote attacker through crafted input to an HTML form.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to send HTTP requests:** The attacker needs the ability to send data to a vulnerable server, typically through HTTP requests.
- **Understanding of Vulnerability:**  The attacker must know how the `untaint_all_constraints` directive is configured and how to craft input that triggers the flaw.

**Additional Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is specific to regular expression constraints with `untaint_all_constraints` enabled.
- A prior regex match is required to trigger the issue.
- The core fix involved ensuring the regex match within the Data::FormValidator is correctly checked for a successful match. The original code used `defined $match` instead of `$match` resulting in the bypass. The fix is to use a boolean check on `$match` rather than checking if the result is defined.
- The issue was present in versions 4.66 and earlier and fixed in 4.66-3 (unstable) and 4.66-1+squeeze1 (stable) of the `libdata-formvalidator-perl` package.
