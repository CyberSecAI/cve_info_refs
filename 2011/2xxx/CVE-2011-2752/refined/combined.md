Package        : squirrelmail
Vulnerability  : various
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2010-4554 CVE-2010-4555 CVE-2011-2023
                 CVE-2011-2752 CVE-2011-2753

Various vulnerabilities have been found in SquirrelMail, a webmail
application. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following vulnerabilities:

CVE-2010-4554

  SquirrelMail did not prevent page rendering inside a third-party
  HTML frame, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct
  clickjacking attacks via a crafted web site.

CVE-2010-4555, CVE-2011-2752, CVE-2011-2753

  Multiple small bugs in SquirrelMail allowed an attacker to inject
  malicious script into various pages or alter the contents of user
  preferences.

CVE-2011-2023

  It was possible to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a
  crafted STYLE element in an HTML part of an e-mail message.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.15-4+lenny5.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.21-2.

For the testing (wheezy) and unstable distribution (sid), these problems
have been fixed in version 1.4.22-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your squirrelmail packages.

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <http://www.debian.org/security/>

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A0103)

## Topic

An updated squirrelmail package that fixes several security issues is now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

SquirrelMail is a standards-based webmail package written in PHP.

A cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the way SquirrelMail
performed the sanitization of HTML style tag content. A remote attacker
could use this flaw to send a specially-crafted Multipurpose Internet Mail
Extensions (MIME) message that, when opened by a victim, would lead to
arbitrary web script execution in the context of their SquirrelMail
session. (CVE-2011-2023)

Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) flaws were found in SquirrelMail. A
remote attacker could possibly use these flaws to execute arbitrary web
script in the context of a victim's SquirrelMail session. (CVE-2010-4555)

An input sanitization flaw was found in the way SquirrelMail handled the
content of various HTML input fields. A remote attacker could use this
flaw to alter user preference values via a newline character contained in
the input for these fields. (CVE-2011-2752)

It was found that the SquirrelMail Empty Trash and Index Order pages did
not protect against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. If a remote
attacker could trick a user, who was logged into SquirrelMail, into
visiting a specially-crafted URL, the attacker could empty the victim's
trash folder or alter the ordering of the columns on the message index
page. (CVE-2011-2753)

SquirrelMail was allowed to be loaded into an HTML sub-frame, allowing a
remote attacker to perform a clickjacking attack against logged in users
and possibly gain access to sensitive user data. With this update, the
SquirrelMail main frame can only be loaded into the top most browser frame.
(CVE-2010-4554)

A flaw was found in the way SquirrelMail handled failed log in attempts. A
user preference file was created when attempting to log in with a password
containing an 8-bit character, even if the username was not valid. A
remote attacker could use this flaw to eventually consume all hard disk
space on the target SquirrelMail server. (CVE-2010-2813)

A flaw was found in the SquirrelMail Mail Fetch plug-in. If an
administrator enabled this plug-in, a SquirrelMail user could use this flaw
to port scan the local network the server was on. (CVE-2010-1637)

Users of SquirrelMail should upgrade to this updated package, which
contains backported patches to correct these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
