  "CVE-2011-2989": {
    "Description": "Mozilla identified and fixed several memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in Thunderbird 5 and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption under certain circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code. Aral Yaman reported a WebGL crash which affected Thunderbird 5.",
    "Root cause": "Memory safety bugs in the browser engine.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Memory corruption"
    ],
    "Impact": "Potential arbitrary code execution.",
     "Attack vectors": [
        "Triggered by specific circumstances within the browser engine"
      ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Ability to trigger the memory corruption, potentially through crafted web content"
  }
