{
  "cveId": "CVE-2011-2512",
  "description": "The virtio_queue_notify() function checks that the virtqueue number is less than the maximum number of virtqueues. A signed comparison is used but the virtqueue number could be negative if a buggy or malicious guest is run. This results in memory accesses outside of the virtqueue array.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "The `virtio_queue_notify()` function uses a signed comparison to validate the virtqueue number, allowing a negative value to bypass the check, leading to out-of-bounds memory access.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Out-of-bounds memory access"
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious or buggy guest could cause a denial of service by crashing the host or potentially escalate privileges on the host.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Exploiting the virtio PCI config space",
      "Issuing a 32-bit write to the Queue Notify field (which is meant to be 16-bit)"
    ],
     "requiredCapabilities": "An unprivileged user within a virtual machine guest with the ability to manipulate virtio queue commands."
  }
