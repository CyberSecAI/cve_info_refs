-= Security Advisory =-
Advisory: MediaCast Password Dump Vulnerability
Release Date: 04/25/2011
Author: Daniel Clemens [daniel.clemens[at]packetninjas.net]
Application: MediaCast <= 8 (By Inventive, Inc) - http://www.InventiveTec.com
Description:
Vulnerabilities exist within the MediaCast application have been discovered that allow
an unauthenticated user to force the application to return critical values (Username
and Password Information) to the end user within verbose error messages.
By sending a GET request to /authenticate\_ad\_setup\_finished.cfm?UserID=<ID>&ClearSession=1
( or /authenticate\_ad\_setup\_finished.cfm?UserID=<ID> )
usernames and passwords of previously cached Active Directory
credentials would be displayed as well as specific application level user name and
password information (which at times could differ from AD credentials if the
credentials have been updated within Active Directory and the user hasn't logged into
the web application with new credentials).
The impact of this vulnerability is that an attacker has the ability to enumerate sequential
usernames as well as the clear text passwords associated with users within the application
and Active Directory Domain.
Further review of the root cause of this vulnerability was not performed during the analysis
of this vulnerability since these issues were discovered during a remote penetration test
of a network in contrast to a dedicated application review.
Besides obvious correlation between verbose error message output and
incorrect or non-existant exception handlers, it appears that this vulnerability
exists due because the following conditions met:
\* Incorrect Session Handling and Implementation (on /authenticate\_ad\_setup\_finished.cfm)
\* Incorrect Logic implementation
\* Clear Text Storage of password information
\* Active ldap integration with existing Active Directory Domain
\* Possibly a problem with the cold fusion dll that is aiding in the AD integration....
Risk: Critical
Vendor Status: Patch Available

Disclosure Timeline:
July 21, 2010 - Initial Contact with client using MediaCAST which enabled remote root of network
during remote penetration test.
August 11, 2010 - Email contact as well as phone calls placed to vendor
August x, 2010 - Multiple calls to developers, support etc.
August 24, 2010 - Vendor Response
"You are correct that the system was displaying verbose error messages that contained
information that could be used in a nefarious way.
I have turned off the display of this extended debugging information.
I have also addressed the issue with the /authenticate\_ad\_setup\_finished.cfm URL
such that it traps the problematic condition and redirects the user to the login page."
Recommendation:
- Patch to the most current version of MediaCast, or patch current MediaCast application.
CVE Information:
CVE-2010-0216
Misc. Items that should be patched with patched deployed by MediaCast:
1) Default Blue Dragon Administrative Interface exposed to the Internet in default installations.
This should really be bound to localhost:10000
- Misc xss vulns were present in this piece of software.
2) XML Injection - /inventivex/mangetraining/ CP\_RIGHTSOURCE , bdclient\_Inventive Cookie
3) SQL Injection through /authenticate\_ad\_setup\_finished.cfm
4) SQL Injection MediaCast SQL Injection /inventivex/managetraining [ CP\_ENLARGESTYLE cookie ] injection
5) Mediacast Application Information Leakage URI: /inventivex/isptools/release/metadata/globalIncludeFolders.txt

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
