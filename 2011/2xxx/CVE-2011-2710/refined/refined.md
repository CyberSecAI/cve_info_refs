Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-2710:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in Joomla! Core components. Specifically, the `searchword` parameter and the Request URI are not adequately sanitized before being used in the `/index.php` URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS, where an attacker can inject malicious script code into web pages viewed by other users.
    *   The `searchword` parameter within the `com_search` component is vulnerable.
    *   The Request URI within `/includes/application.php` at line 176 and 181 is vulnerable because it doesn't use `htmlspecialchars` on `JURI::current()`

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can craft a malicious URL that, when accessed by a victim, executes arbitrary script code within the victim's browser.
*   **Session Compromise:** Successful exploitation could lead to the compromise of a currently logged-in user's or administrator's session.
*  **Impersonation of Arbitrary User Actions:** Attackers could potentially impersonate user actions, including those within the `/administrator/` functions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious URLs:** The primary attack vector is through specially crafted URLs.
    *   These URLs can include malicious javascript in the `searchword` parameter.
     *   These URLs can also include malicious javascript by appending it to the request URI.
*   **User Interaction:** An attacker needs to trick a user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a page with the injected XSS payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs that are then accessed by the victim.
*  No specific prior authentication is needed, and the attack can target any user accessing the crafted URL.

**Additional Information:**
* The vulnerability affects Joomla! versions 1.7.0-RC and all versions of 1.6.x.

* A proof of concept using a crafted POST request was provided for the search parameter.
*  A proof of concept using crafted URLs was provided to demonstrate the Request URI vulnerability
