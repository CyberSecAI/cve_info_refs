- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The code was using `int` to store the return value of `strlen`, which could lead to an integer overflow if the string was too long. This could cause `fastMalloc` to allocate a smaller buffer than required for the string copy, leading to a heap buffer overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Integer overflow, heap buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A heap buffer overflow could lead to arbitrary code execution or a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation would involve providing a very long string as input that would trigger the overflow in `strlen`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need to control the input string passed to the vulnerable code.
