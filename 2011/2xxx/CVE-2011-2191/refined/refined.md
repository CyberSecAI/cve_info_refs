Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2011-2191:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Cherokee web server's admin interface is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **CSRF:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of CSRF protection in the Cherokee admin interface. This allows an attacker to craft malicious requests that, when triggered by an authenticated administrator, can modify the server's configuration.
*   **Persistent XSS:** The CSRF vulnerability can be exploited to inject persistent XSS into several pages, including the "status" page, through the "nickname field" of a virtual server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Server Reconfiguration:** An attacker can reconfigure the server, potentially:
    *   Changing the user the server runs as (e.g., to root).
    *   Setting up log handlers (hooks) to execute arbitrary commands on error or access events.
    *   Injecting persistent XSS, which allows for arbitrary JavaScript execution in the context of the administrator's session, which can potentially lead to further privilege escalation/account compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious Website:** An attacker would host a malicious webpage that contains a crafted form designed to submit requests to the vulnerable Cherokee admin interface.
*   **Social Engineering:** An attacker would need to trick an authenticated Cherokee administrator into visiting the malicious page while logged into the admin panel. The malicious page then triggers the crafted form submission without the administrator's explicit interaction or consent.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the target server.
*   The attacker needs to be able to host a web page or inject malicious HTML into a page visited by the target admin.
*   The attacker needs a logged-in administrator to visit the attacker's malicious page.
*   The attacker does not need to directly interact with the Cherokee admin interface, other than to identify the vulnerable endpoints/parameters.
