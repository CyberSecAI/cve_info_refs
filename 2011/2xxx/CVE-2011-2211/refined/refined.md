Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-2211:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `osf_wait4` system call within the Alpha architecture-specific code of the Linux kernel.
- It involves the incorrect usage of a user-supplied pointer while operating under `KERNEL_DS`. `KERNEL_DS` is a data segment that gives the kernel full access to system memory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Incorrect pointer handling:** The `osf_wait4` syscall used a user-provided pointer (`ustatus`) to write the return value of the internal `sys_wait4` call. Because `osf_wait4` was running under the kernel's data segment (`KERNEL_DS`), it could write to any memory address.
- **Privilege Escalation:** A malicious user could manipulate the `ustatus` pointer to point to a kernel memory address. The `sys_wait4` return value, when written via `put_user`, would then corrupt arbitrary kernel memory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** By writing to kernel memory, a local attacker could potentially escalate their privileges to those of the kernel and gain full control of the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Local:** The attacker needs to be able to execute code on the target system to make the `osf_wait4` system call.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be a local user on the system with the ability to invoke the `osf_wait4` syscall.
- The attacker needs to provide a malicious user-space pointer.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `arch/alpha/kernel/osf_sys.c` file.
- The fix involves modifying the `osf_wait4` syscall to use a kernel-space variable to store the return value from `sys_wait4` and then use the `put_user` function to safely copy the value to the user-provided address. The fix also removes the use of `KERNEL_DS` in the syscall.
- The relevant code snippet shows that before the patch, `ret = sys_wait4(pid, ustatus, options, (struct rusage __user *) &r);`  used the user supplied ustatus pointer and executed with KERNEL_DS active.
- The patched code uses `ret = sys_wait4(pid, (unsigned int __user *) &status, options, (struct rusage __user *) &r);` using a local variable `status` and after deactivating `KERNEL_DS`.
