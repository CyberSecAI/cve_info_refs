How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=728348#c0)  Vincent Danen    2011-08-04 19:42:34 UTC  ``` It was reported [1] that pysmb.py in system-config-printer does not sanitize a host's netbios name or workgroup/domain name.  A specially crafted netbios name on the local network could cause pysmb.py to execute arbitrary commands based on the hostname.  This was originally reported in Ubuntu against foomatic-gui, and has been patched [2], however the origin of the script in foomatic-gui is in the system-config-printer package.  If a remote SMB server on the local network had a crafted hostname and a user ran pysmb.py, it would be possible for shell commands to be executed with the privileges of the user running pysmb.py.  The pysmb.py script in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 does not use os.popen().  [1] [https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/foomatic-gui/+bug/811119](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/foomatic-gui/%2Bbug/811119) [2] <http://cvs.savannah.gnu.org/viewvc/foomatic-gui/foomatic/pysmb.py?root=foomatic-gui&r1=1.2&r2=1.3&view=patch>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=728348#c1)  Vincent Danen    2011-08-04 19:49:29 UTC  ``` It looks like some of the vulnerable functions are called by the system-config-printer (or printconf in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4) GUI's, but I'm not positive that shell injection will happen there.  It also would require some trickery on the attacker's part, since the netbios name is returned in uppercase, the attacker's SMB server would have to be modified to present the netbios name in lowercase.  On Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 this does look problematic:  # python /usr/share/system-config-printer/pysmb.py {'IP': '192.168.251.125', 'DOMAIN': 'MYGROUP'} {'NAME': "OH'NOTQUOTEZSIF"} sh: -c: line 0: unexpected EOF while looking for matching `'' sh: -c: line 1: syntax error: unexpected end of file {} {'IP': '192.168.250.50', 'DOMAIN': 'ANNVIX'}  However, I'm not sure about RHEL4 as running the script presents some problems:  % /usr/share/printconf/util/pysmb.py Domain=[WORKGROUP] OS=[Apple Base Station] Server=[CIFS 4.32] Domain=[WORKGROUP] OS=[Apple Base Station] Server=[CIFS 4.32] Receiving SMB: Server stopped responding {}  It might be possible to get this to work on RHEL4 (it does use os.popen() as well), but it's not picking up any real samba servers like the script does on RHEL5.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=728348#c2)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2011-08-10 06:12:40 UTC  ``` So using a local samba server on the same machine i am able to reproduce this on RHEL4 as well.  Relevant config in samba.conf:          netbios name = oh'notquotezSIF  [root@athlon3 ~]# /etc/init.d/smb start Starting SMB services: [  OK  ] Starting NMB services: [  OK  ]  [root@athlon3 ~]# python /usr/share/printconf/util/pysmb.py sh: -c: line 0: unexpected EOF while looking for matching `'' sh: -c: line 1: syntax error: unexpected end of file {}  [root@athlon3 ~]# /etc/init.d/smb stop Shutting down SMB services: [  OK  ] Shutting down NMB services: [  OK  ]  [root@athlon3 ~]# python /usr/share/printconf/util/pysmb.py Domain=[WORKGROUP] OS=[Windows 5.0] Server=[Windows 2000 LAN Manager] Domain=[WORKGROUP] OS=[Windows 5.0] Server=[Windows 2000 LAN Manager] {}   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=728348#c4)  Tim Waugh    2011-08-10 11:31:14 UTC  ``` FWIW the patch at savannah introduces a typo:  @@ -59,26 +67,29 @@                  if val.find ("~") != -1:                      continue   -                if l.find (" <GROUP> ") != -1 and not dict.has_key ('GROUP'): -                    dict['GROUP'] = l.split (" ")[0] +                if l.find (" <GROUP> ") != -1 and not dct.has_key ('GROUP'): +                    dct['GROUP'] = l.split (" ")[0] ===>             elif not dict.has_key ('NAME'):                      name = l.split (" ")[0] -                    dict['NAME'] = name +                    dct['NAME'] = name  That line should read:  elif not dct.has_key ('NAME'):  The perils of doing "minor clean-ups" while fixing some other problem...   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=728348#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-08-23 14:41:33 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4  Via RHSA-2011:1196 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-1196.html>   ``` |  |

Bug #811119 reported by

### Bug Description

The "/usr/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/foomatic/pysmb.py" script which is part of python-foomatic (foomatic-gui depends on this apparently :/) appears that it maybe vulnerable to command injection.

I suspect this because it does \_not\_ escape the value of a host's 'netbios name' nor the 'workgroup' / domain of the network on line ~118 [0] in the function get\_printer\_list. I have not checked but I believe this script may be used in the foomatic-gui :/

You can test against the script by doing the following:

#1 install samba

#2 add netbios name = oh'notquotezSIF to /etc/samba/smb.conf

#3 restart samba

#4 run "python /usr/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/foomatic/pysmb.py"

By replacing a bunch of strupper\_m function calls in source3/nmbd/ with strlower\_m I was able to get /usr/bin/nmblookup to output 'lowercase' netbios and workgroup names.

So now that I managed to get a 'lower case netbios name' - I decided to make my 'attacker' vm's netbios name '&reboot&'. Then on the 'victim' I opened foomatic-gui (via sudo) and attempted to 'discover remote printers' (after a little bit --> the "discover" code checks for tcp printers first see /usr/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/foomatic/detect.py 445 [0] ) the victim vm rebooted :)
