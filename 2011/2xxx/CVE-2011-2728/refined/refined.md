Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-2728:

**Summary:**

The vulnerability, CVE-2011-2728, is a memory error within the `File::Glob::bsd_glob()` function in Perl when called with the unsupported `GLOB_ALTDIRFUNC` flag. This could lead to an access violation (segfault), potentially enabling a denial of service or arbitrary code execution.

**Root Cause:**

- The root cause lies in the `File::Glob::bsd_glob` function not properly handling the unsupported flag `GLOB_ALTDIRFUNC`. When this flag is used, the function attempts to use an uninitialized function pointer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Uninitialized Function Pointer Dereference:** The code attempts to dereference an uninitialized function pointer when `GLOB_ALTDIRFUNC` is used, leading to an access violation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A program crashing due to this vulnerability could lead to a denial of service.
- **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** Though no known exploits are present in the wild, the nature of the vulnerability (dereferencing a potentially controllable uninitialized memory location) could theoretically lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **External Input:** A Perl program that accepts a flags value from an external source and passes it to `File::Glob::bsd_glob` is vulnerable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to influence flags:** The attacker needs the ability to control or influence the `flags` parameter passed to the `bsd_glob` function. This could come from untrusted user input or any external source that directly controls the flags argument.
- **Execution of code:** The attacker needs to have the ability to execute the vulnerable Perl script/application.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided content from `cpansearch.perl.org` indicates that the vulnerability has been corrected by explicitly disabling all unsupported flags and setting unused function pointers to null.
- The information from `access.redhat.com` and `bugzilla.redhat.com` confirms that this vulnerability was addressed in Fedora distributions through security updates.
- The information from `blogs.oracle.com` confirms that this vulnerability was fixed in various versions of Solaris.
- The information from the commit log (`perl5.git.perl.org`) details the fix that was implemented.

**In summary,** CVE-2011-2728 is a memory error that can be triggered through a specially crafted flags parameter passed to the `File::Glob::bsd_glob` function in Perl. While primarily a DoS risk, the vulnerability has the potential for arbitrary code execution. Patches addressing this vulnerability have been implemented and made available by various vendors and distributions.
