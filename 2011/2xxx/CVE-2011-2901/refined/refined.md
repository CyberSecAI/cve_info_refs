{
  "CVE-2011-2901": {
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "Root cause": "An off-by-one error exists in the `__addr_ok()` macro within the Xen hypervisor implementation for x86_64 systems.",
      "Weaknesses": "The `__addr_ok()` macro, intended to validate addresses, uses an incorrect shift count, leading to insufficient address space checks.",
      "Impact": "A malicious guest administrator can crash the host system by exploiting the flawed address validation, potentially leading to a denial-of-service.",
       "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered via certain hypercalls that bypass the intended virtual address space restrictions.",
      "Required attacker capabilities": "Requires a malicious guest administrator with the ability to execute hypercalls on a vulnerable system."
    },
    "additional_information": {
      "Affected_systems": "Xen 3.3 or earlier hypervisors with 64-bit PV guests.",
      "Unaffected_systems": "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 6, and Red Hat Enterprise MRG are not affected. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 is affected but the issue has been addressed via RHSA-2011:1212.",
      "Exploitation": "There are no known further exploits, but these have not been ruled out.",
      "Resolution": "The issue is resolved by applying the provided patch or upgrading to a more recent hypervisor. The patch corrects the shift count in the `__addr_ok()` macro, restoring proper address validation."
