Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2011-2085:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a lack of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection in all publicly released versions of RT (Request Tracker).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CSRF:** The core weakness is the absence of proper CSRF protection mechanisms. This allows a malicious website to force a user's browser to make unintended requests to RT while the user is logged in.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially use CSRF to extract sensitive information from RT.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** CSRF attacks could be leveraged to grant an attacker higher privileges within the RT system.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** It is mentioned that the attack vector could be used for "arbitrary execution of code", although the specific mechanism for this is not described in detail in this document. This would likely be dependent on the targeted user's specific privileges and the actions available within the RT application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through malicious websites. An attacker would host a site containing code designed to trigger unintended requests to an RT instance when a logged in RT user visits it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to create and host a malicious website.
*   The attacker relies on a user with an active RT session visiting their website.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided text highlights that a configuration option `$RestrictReferrer` was added to disable CSRF protection due to external integrations potentially relying on the previous behavior, indicating that the permissive behavior was part of the intended design before the discovery of the vulnerability.
*   Another configuration parameter `$ReferrerWhitelist` was added to allow certain sites to be exempt from CSRF protection.
*   A separate configuration option `$RestrictLoginReferrer` was added to prevent login CSRF attacks but is disabled by default since this functionality's benign usage is more commonly relied upon.
*   The fix was released in RT versions 3.8.12 and 4.0.6, and as patches for all released versions of 3.8 and 4.0.
