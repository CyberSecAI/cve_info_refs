Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2011-2018:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability exists in the Windows kernel due to improper initialization of an object before it's accessed. Specifically, the kernel attempts to access an object that has not been correctly initialized in memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Object Initialization:** The core issue is the kernel's failure to properly initialize an object before accessing it. This leads to accessing uninitialized memory.
*   **Elevation of Privilege:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in kernel mode, thus escalating their privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code within the kernel.
*   **Full System Control:** This allows the attacker to gain complete control of the affected system.
*   **Malicious Actions:** The attacker could then install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack requires the attacker to have valid logon credentials and the ability to log on locally to the affected system.
*   **Specially Crafted Application:** The attacker needs to run a specially crafted application designed to exploit the memory access vulnerability within the kernel.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Valid Logon Credentials:** The attacker must possess legitimate user credentials for the target system.
*   **Local System Access:** The attacker needs to be able to log on to the system directly; remote exploitation is not possible.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered when the Windows kernel accesses a non-initialized object during the processing of a system call.
*   The vulnerability is not exploitable remotely or by anonymous users.

**Affected Systems:**

*   32-bit editions of Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, and Windows 7. Note that 64-bit versions are not affected.

**Mitigation:**

*   Apply the security update provided by Microsoft. This update helps to ensure that the Windows kernel initializes objects in memory before accessing them, thus preventing the vulnerability.
