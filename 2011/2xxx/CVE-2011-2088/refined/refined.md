Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is the lack of proper output escaping in the XWork framework when generating error messages. User-provided data, specifically the action and method names within the `<s:submit>` tag, are not sanitized before being included in error responses.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is reflected XSS. Malicious JavaScript code can be injected into the action or method parameters of the `<s:submit>` tag. When an error occurs, this unsanitized input is reflected back in the HTML response, causing the injected script to execute in the user's browser.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The error messages also expose internal paths for the Java class implementing the action, potentially revealing sensitive information about the application's structure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Defacement of the web page
    *   Redirection to malicious websites
    *   Information theft
*   **Information Disclosure:** Exposure of internal Java class paths can aid attackers in further reconnaissance and planning of targeted attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Manipulated HTTP Parameters:** The attack vector involves manipulating the `action` and `method` parameters within the `<s:submit>` tag via HTTP requests. This is done by injecting malicious JavaScript code.
*   **Specifically crafted URLs:** XSS can be triggered by using specifically crafted URLs that include malicious code within the action name, as in `http://test.app1.net/login%3Cimg%3E.action`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   **Understanding of Struts/XWork:** The attacker needs to understand how Struts/XWork handles requests and generates errors, specifically the usage of `<s:submit>` tag and the DMI.
*   **Ability to craft malicious URLs and payloads:**  The attacker must be able to craft URLs and request parameters containing malicious JavaScript that will be reflected in the error messages.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Dynamic Method Invocation (DMI):** The vulnerability is specifically triggered when DMI is enabled and the requested method or action does not exist. This causes the framework to generate an error message that includes the unsanitized user input.
*   **Struts Configuration:** The absence of global exception mappings in `struts.xml` contributes to the problem, as it prevents the application from handling errors in a secure way.
*   **Affected Components:** Apache Struts 2 and WebWork frameworks.

In summary, the vulnerability lies in the lack of proper input sanitization in the Struts/XWork framework during error handling, allowing for reflected XSS attacks through manipulated parameters in `<s:submit>` tags. This, combined with the exposure of internal paths, presents a serious risk to the security of web applications using these frameworks.
