| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=725349#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2011-07-25 09:23:45 UTC  ``` A missing DHCP option checking / sanitization flaw was reported for multiple DHCP clients.  This flaw may allow DHCP server to trick DHCP clients to set e.g. system hostname to a specially crafted value containing shell special characters.  Various scripts assume that hostname is trusted, which may lead to code execution when hostname is specially crafted.  This issue was tracked in [bug #689832](show_bug.cgi?id=689832 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2011-0997 dhclient: insufficient sanitization of certain DHCP response values") for ISC dhclient ([CVE-2011-0997](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-0997)), which also discussed few other affected clients.  This bug is created to track dhcpv6 separately.  The impact for DHCPv6 clients is significantly lower than impact for DHCPv4 clients, as DHCPv6 does not allow passing hostname in the DHCP reply.  DNS domain name search is provided in the DHCPv6 replies.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=725349#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2011-07-25 10:01:51 UTC  ``` Proposed patch adding check for the domain-search option is attached in the previously mentioned [bug #689832](show_bug.cgi?id=689832 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2011-0997 dhclient: insufficient sanitization of certain DHCP response values"):   [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=689832#c2](show_bug.cgi?id=689832#c2 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2011-0997 dhclient: insufficient sanitization of certain DHCP response values")  (In reply to [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=725349#c0)) > The impact for DHCPv6 clients is significantly lower than impact for DHCPv4 > clients, as DHCPv6 does not allow passing hostname in the DHCP reply.  DNS > domain name search is provided in the DHCPv6 replies.  There are currently no known good ways to take advantage of the specially-crafted domain name noted as "search" option value in /etc/resolv.conf.  We have inspected various scripts that update resolv.conf file, none of them process existing search value insecurely.  The only problematic use that was identified was in shtool's sh.echo script. This script may possibly use search value as part of the replacement argument to the sed's substitution command.  Special crafted value can result in the sed command execution, which may lead to file overwrite or direct code execution (GNU sed).  This would require shtool's echo to be used with "%d" construct to request expansion to host's domain.  Additionally, domain name extracted from hostname (only when '%h' is used too) or domain value from resolv.conf take precedence over the search value.   ``` |  |

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).
