Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-2717:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient checking or sanitization of DHCP options received by the dhcp6c client. Specifically, the lack of proper validation of the domain search option.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Shell command injection:** A malicious DHCP server can provide a specially crafted domain name within the DHCPv6 response. This crafted domain name can contain shell special characters.
- **Insufficient input validation:** The dhcp6c client does not properly sanitize the received domain search option before using it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Code execution:**  The vulnerability can lead to code execution if the specially crafted domain name is used in a context where it's interpreted as a command.  The specific example given is the `shtool`'s `sh.echo` script which may use the "search" value in a `sed` command, leading to command injection.
- **File Overwrite**: The sed command injection could allow for overwriting files on the system.
-  While the initial description indicates that the impact for DHCPv6 clients is lower than for DHCPv4 due to lack of a hostname option, the crafted domain search option still presents a significant security risk.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious DHCPv6 server:** An attacker sets up or controls a DHCPv6 server.
- **Crafted DHCP response:** The malicious server responds to a dhcp6c client's request with a crafted domain name in the DHCP reply.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Control over a DHCPv6 server:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept and respond to DHCPv6 requests. This could be achieved by setting up a rogue DHCPv6 server on the network.
- **Network proximity:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable dhcp6c client to intercept and respond to DHCP requests.

**Additional Notes:**
- The Red Hat bugzilla entry indicates that the issue was considered "CLOSED WONTFIX". This likely means the vulnerability was not deemed critical enough to warrant a patch in Red Hat products at the time. However, the underlying issue remains valid in vulnerable versions of dhcp6c.
- The vulnerability is related to similar issues in DHCPv4 clients (CVE-2011-0997 and CVE-2011-0996) where hostname options could be abused. Although dhcpv6 doesn't have a hostname option, the domain search option still poses a security risk if not handled properly.
- `shtool`'s `sh.echo` script is identified as one particular location where this vulnerability can be exploited via sed command injection.
