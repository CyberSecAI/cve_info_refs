How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: CVE-Request -- phpMyAdmin -- PMASA-2011-11 and PMASA-2011-12

Hello Josh, Steve, vendors,

   the following two doesn't seem to have CVE identifiers yet:
1) <http://www.phpmyadmin.net/home_page/security/PMASA-2011-11.php>

A local file inclusion and arbitrary SQL code execution flaws were
found in the way phpMyAdmin, the MySQL over WWW administration tool,
performed 'export_type' sanitization, when retrieving and verifying
relation schema export options. A local attacker could use this flaw to
obtain security sensitive information or, potentially, execute
arbitrary SQL code with the privileges of the user running the query.

References:
[1] <http://www.phpmyadmin.net/home_page/security/PMASA-2011-11.php>
[2] <http://www.phpmyadmin.net/home_page/news.php>
[3] <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=725383>

Upstream patches:

<http://phpmyadmin.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin;a=commitdiff;h=3ae58f0cd6b89ad4767920f9b214c38d3f6d4393>

Further flaw exploitation note:
An attacker must be logged in via phpMyAdmin to exploit this problem.

Affected versions:
Versions 3.4.0 to 3.4.3.1 are affected.

2) <http://www.phpmyadmin.net/home_page/security/PMASA-2011-12.php>

A session values manipulation flaw was found in the way phpMyAdmin, the
MySQL over WWW administration tool, performed sanitization of the
user-provided query string, when the Swekey extension based
authentication method was enabled. A remote attacker could use this flaw
to manipulate the PHP session superglobal variable via specially-crafted
query string provided to the Swekey authentication module.

[4] <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=725384>

Upstream patches:
[5]
<http://phpmyadmin.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin;a=commitdiff;h=e7bb42c002885c2aca7aba4d431b8c63ae4de9b7>

Patches against v3.3 branch:
[7]
<http://phpmyadmin.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin;a=commitdiff;h=f6f6ee3f1171addb166fa18e75a0b56599bf374c>

Affected Versions:
The 3.4.3.1 and earlier versions are affected.
Branch 2.11.x is not affected by this.

3) The other two recent phpMyAdmin issues (addressed in v3.3.10.3,
v3.4.3.2) already have CVE identifiers:
[1] <http://www.phpmyadmin.net/home_page/security/PMASA-2011-10.php>
[2] <http://www.phpmyadmin.net/home_page/security/PMASA-2011-9.php>

Cc-ed phpMyAdmin upstream contact, Herman van Rink, to correct me on
the description of the 1) and 2) flaws, where appropriate.

Josh, Steve, could you please allocate CVE ids for 1) PMASA-2011-11.php
and 2) PMASA-2011-12.php issues?

Thank you && Regards, Jan.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=725383#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-07-25 10:58:29 UTC  ``` A local file inclusion and arbitrary SQL code execution flaws were found in the way phpMyAdmin, the MySQL over WWW administration tool, performed 'export_type' sanitization, when retrieving and verifying relation schema export options. A local attacker could use this flaw to obtain security sensitive information or, potentially, execute arbitrary SQL code with the privileges of the user running the query.

Affected versions: Versions 3.4.0 to 3.4.3.1 are affected.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=725383#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-07-25 11:00:38 UTC  ``` This issue affects the versions of the phpMyAdmin package, as shipped with Fedora release of 14 and 15.
