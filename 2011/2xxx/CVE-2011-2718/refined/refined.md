Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2011-2718:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of the 'export_type' parameter within the relational schema code of phpMyAdmin. This parameter is used to construct a class name, and inadequate sanitization allows for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The vulnerability enables an attacker to include arbitrary local files due to the insufficient sanitization.
- **Arbitrary SQL Code Execution:** By manipulating the 'export_type' parameter, a local attacker can potentially execute arbitrary SQL code with the privileges of the user running the query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Security Sensitive Information Disclosure:** An attacker could exploit the LFI vulnerability to obtain security-sensitive information from the server.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Attackers can potentially execute arbitrary SQL code, which can result in data modification or disruption of database operations.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is a crafted request to phpMyAdmin, where the 'export_type' parameter is maliciously modified.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the server where phpMyAdmin is hosted.
- **Authenticated phpMyAdmin User:** The attacker must be logged into phpMyAdmin to exploit this vulnerability.

**Affected Versions:**
- phpMyAdmin versions 3.4.0 to 3.4.3.1 are affected by this vulnerability.

**Mitigation:**
- Upgrade to phpMyAdmin 3.4.3.2 or apply the patch available in the provided link.
