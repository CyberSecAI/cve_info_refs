How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=718824#c0)  Vincent Danen    2011-07-04 21:42:27 UTC  ``` It was reported [1] that Plone suffers from a vulnerability that can be exploited to bypass certain security restrictions.  This is due to a vulnerable bundled version of Zope.  Plone 3.x users that backported the fix for [CVE-2011-0720](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-0720) (PloneHotfix20110720) are affected due to the vulnerability being inadvertently backported via the hotfix.  A new hotfix (20110622) is available [2] to correct the flaw.

Fantastic, thank you Ryan.  I'm assuming that when you refer to RHEL4 you're talking about the cluster product, correct?  (conga 0.11.2-4.el4).  If that is the case, then only Plone in EPEL5 is affected by this.  However, if that is indeed the case, then I'm wondering why we did an update for [CVE-2011-0720](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-0720) for RHEL4 and RHEL5, which seem to contain the patch that introduced this flaw.  That would imply to me that we are indeed affected:  <https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0720.html>  Judging by that alone, we should be affected, shouldn't we?   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=718824#c10)  Ryan McCabe    2011-07-06 17:37:31 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #9](show_bug.cgi?id=718824#c9)) > Fantastic, thank you Ryan.

[CVE-2011-0720](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-0720) specified that Plone 2.5 was affected, which is why we applied the patch there.  <http://plone.org/products/plone/security/advisories/20110622> mentions that the vulnerability in Plone3 was introduced by the previous hotfix, but it doesn't say anything similar about any other versions of Plone. I guess the previous hotfix interacted with only Plone3 in a way so as to introduce the new problem.  At the bottom of the FAQ page, they write:  "Q: I see "ImportError: No module named traversing" on startup after installing the hotfix.  You have installed the hotfix onto a Plone 2.5 or Zope 2.8/2.9 site. The Hotfix is not required; you should remove it."   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=718824#c11)  Vincent Danen    2011-07-06 17:59:41 UTC  ``` Yes, the advisory indicates:  "Other versions are not affected. Plone 2.5 and Zope 2.8/2.9 are unaffected; you should not install this hotifx on those sites."  Great, thanks for the clarification Ryan.  I'll note that RHEL is unaffected by this.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=718824#c12)  Vincent Danen    2011-07-15 16:54:42 UTC  ``` This has been assigned the name CVE-2011-2528:  <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2011/q3/75>   ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Message-ID: <20110704215939.GE1947@redhat.com>

From: Vincent Danen <vdanen@...hat.com>

Subject: CVE request: plone privilege escalation flaw

Looks like the previous fix for Plone/Zope (CVE-2011-0720) caused a new
privilege escalation flaw in Plone 3.x and 4.x.

Could a CVE be assigned?
