Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2011-2369:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in how the `innerHTML` getter in Mozilla Firefox and SeaMonkey browsers handles content within inline SVG elements, specifically within `<style>` and `<script>` tags.  The `innerHTML` getter fails to properly encode HTML entities, leading to a situation where HTML-encoded characters like `&lt;` and `&gt;` within SVG are decoded, but not re-encoded when the `innerHTML` is accessed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect HTML Entity Handling:** The core weakness is the failure of the `innerHTML` getter to re-encode HTML entities when serializing content from SVG elements. This discrepancy creates a vulnerability.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** This improper encoding allows an attacker to inject malicious HTML, such as `<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>`, through HTML entities. When the `innerHTML` property is accessed, the browser renders the injected script, leading to an XSS vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a vulnerable website. This could lead to various malicious actions.
*   **Data Theft:** Attackers could use the injected code to steal user data, session cookies, or other sensitive information.
*   **Website Defacement:** It can also be used to deface the website or redirect the user to a malicious website.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Injection via User-Supplied Content:** The vulnerability arises when a website takes user-provided content, stores or displays it within SVG tags after HTML encoding it.
*   **Retrieval via `innerHTML`:** The vulnerability is triggered when the website then retrieves this content via the `innerHTML` property of an SVG element, expecting the content to be safe.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to inject HTML entities:** The attacker needs the ability to inject HTML encoded data, specifically with characters like `&lt;` and `&gt;` into SVG elements, which is then later read and rendered using `innerHTML`.
*   **Target is using vulnerable browser:** The user needs to be using a vulnerable version of Firefox or SeaMonkey.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered specifically with in-line SVG content and within `<style>` and `<script>` tags
*   The issue isn't with HTML entity decoding in general, but with the specific lack of re-encoding by the `innerHTML` getter when handling SVG.
*   Other browsers tested (IE9, GC10-12, O11) did not exhibit this behaviour, as they do not decode `<` and `>` when processing HTML entities in SVG elements.

**Resolution:**

The fix involves modifying the HTML serializer to properly escape the contents of text nodes within `<style>` and `<script>` elements in SVG. This ensures the HTML entities are re-encoded, preventing the execution of injected malicious scripts. The fix was implemented in:

*   Firefox 5
*   SeaMonkey 2.2

This vulnerability has a CVSS v2 base score of 6.8 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P), reflecting a medium-severity issue, requiring some attacker capability to inject content.
