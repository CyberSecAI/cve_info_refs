{
  "cveId": "CVE-2011-2701",
  "description": "The ocsp_check function in rlm_eap_tls.c in FreeRADIUS 2.1.11, when OCSP is enabled, does not properly parse replies from OCSP responders, which allows remote attackers to bypass authentication by using the EAP-TLS protocol with a revoked X.509 client certificate.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "The `ocsp_check` function in `rlm_eap_tls.c` performs a basic verification of the value returned by the OCSP service but does not verify the certificate status itself.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Authentication",
      "The OCSP implementation fails to check if a certificate has been revoked"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to network resources by using a revoked client certificate when the server is configured to use EAP-TLS with OCSP validation.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Remote network attack"
    ],
    "requiredCapabilities": "Attacker needs access to a revoked client certificate and its corresponding private key."
  },
  "affectedProduct": "FreeRADIUS 2.1.11 (specifically the OCSP feature)",
    "additionalInformation": [
        "OCSP support was added in version 2.1.11, so earlier versions are not affected.",
        "The vulnerability is due to the insufficient parsing of OCSP responses, specifically the lack of check against 'V_OCSP_CERTSTATUS_GOOD'.",
        "The vulnerability allows an attacker to use a revoked certificate to authenticate successfully against the FreeRADIUS server.",
        "A patch was proposed that checks the status of the certificate using `OCSP_resp_find_status()` and `OCSP_check_validity()`",
        "The vulnerability is related to the `ocsp_check()` function in `rlm_eap_tls.c`.",
      "The issue can be mitigated by disabling OCSP and using CRL checking instead, until a patch is available."
