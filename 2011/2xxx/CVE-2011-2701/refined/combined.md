| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=724815#c0)  Vincent Danen    2011-07-21 21:38:06 UTC  ``` DFN-CERT reported [1] a vulnerability in the OCSP feature in FreeRADIUS 2.1.11 where it does not verify the status of a certificate (e.g. if the certificate was revoked).  No further details, or a patch, were provided.  According to the changelog on the FreeRADIUS site [2], OCSP support was added in version 2.1.11:  * OCSP support from Alex Bergmann. See raddb/eap.conf, "ocsp" section.  Therefore earlier versions of FreeRADIUS are not affected by this flaw.  [1] <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2011/q3/105> [2] <http://freeradius.org/>  Statement:  Not vulnerable.

In matrix-js-sdk versions versions 9.11.0 through 34.7.0, the method `MatrixClient.sendSharedHistoryKeys` is vulnerable to interception by malicious homeservers. The method was introduced by MSC3061) and is commonly used to share historical message keys with newly invited users, granting them access to past messages in the room. However, it unconditionally sends these "shared" keys to all of the invited user's devices, regardless of whether the user's cryptographic identity is verified or whether the user's devices are signed by that identity. This allows the attacker to potentially inject its own devices to receive sensitive historical keys without proper security checks. Note that this only affects clients running the SDK with the legacy crypto stack. Clients using the new Rust cryptography stack (i.e. those that call `MatrixClient.initRustCrypto()` instead of `MatrixClient.initCrypto()`) are unaffected by this vulnerability, because `MatrixClient.sendSharedHistoryKeys()` raises an exception in such environments. The vulnerability was fixed in matrix-js-sdk 34.8.0 by removing the vulnerable functionality. As a workaround, remove use of affected functionality from clients.](https://cxsecurity.com/cveshow/CVE-2024-47080/ "matrix-js-sdk is the Matrix Client-Server SDK for JavaScript and TypeScript.

Note that this only affects clients running the SDK with the legacy crypto stack. Clients using the new Rust cryptography stack (i.e. those that call `MatrixClient.initRustCrypto()` instead of `MatrixClient.initCrypto()`) are unaffected by this vulnerability, because `MatrixClient.sendSharedHistoryKeys()` raises an exception in such environments. The vulnerability was fixed in matrix-js-sdk 34.8.0 by removing the vulnerable functionality. As a workaround, remove use of affected functionality from clients.") |

The implemented procedure does not verify the status of
the certificate. For instance, if the certificate has been revoked.

We are not aware of any upstream fix.

DFN-CERT Services GmbH - Security Advisory
==========================================
\* Advisory: DSB-2011-01
\* Version: 1.0
\* Released on: 2011-07-22
\* Updated on: 2011-07-22
\* Product: FreeRADIUS 2.1.11 (2011-06-29)
Summary
- -------
FreeRADIUS is a RADIUS server software which supports many
authentication protocols. One of those protocols is EAP-TLS
used within 802.1X. In EAP-TLS X.509 client certificates are
used to authenticate remote users/clients.
FreeRADIUS supports several methods for checking the revocation
status of X.509 certificates. Recently support for revocation
status checking with the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP)
was added to FreeRADIUS.
During a test of the OCSP support in FreeRADIUS, a security
vulnerability has been found in the way the FreeRADIUS code parses
the replies from an OCSP responder.
This allows a remote attacker to use a revoked certificate from an
otherwise trusted certification authority (CA) to successfully
authenticate against the FreeRADIUS server if it is configured
to use EAP-TLS with OCSP certificate validation.
OCSP is not enabled in the default configuration of FreeRADIUS.
Solution
- --------
Until now, there is no official patch for the vulnerability.
Therefore, we strongly advise you to disable OCSP support in the
FreeRADIUS configuration until an official patch by the packet
maintainer is available. Instead, the use of certification revocation
list (CRL) checking which is implemented by FreeRADIUS is recommended.
Details (CVE-2011-2701)
- -----------------------
In the file rlm\_eap\_tls.c, the ocsp\_check() function performs a basic
verification of the value that is returned by the OCSP service
OCSP\_basic\_verify(), but it does not verify the status of the
certificate itself. Thus, if an attacker has access to a revoked
certificate and its matching private key, the attacker is able to get
authenticated against the FreeRADIUS server.
This allows the attacker to gain access to all network resources that
are accessible due to the FreeRADIUS authentication, e.g. Internet access.
To avoid the issue, the status of the certificate has to be checked with
the OCSP\_resp\_find\_status() function by comparing the returned status
value against 'V\_OCSP\_CERTSTATUS\_GOOD', and by checking the freshness of
the OCSP response with OCSP\_check\_validity().
References
- ----------
This advisory and further updates of it will be published at:
<https://www.dfn-cert.de/informationen/Sicherheitsbulletins/dsb-2011-01.
html>
New releases, or patches, for the software can be downloaded from the
official FreeRADIUS web site:
<http://freeradius.org>
Contact
- -------
We created a basic patch for this issue which is not publicly available
because of possible side effects and a missing test environment. However,
we are willing to send our patch to all Linux/BSD vendors as a basis for
their own patches.
Any questions regarding this advisory, or the patch itself,
can be sent to advisory (at) dfn-cert (dot) de. [email concealed]
Please note that we will not make our patch publicly available.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
