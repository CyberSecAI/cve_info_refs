Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2011-2907:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in how Torque (a resource manager) handles authorization of job submissions. The Torque server relies on the `PBS_O_HOST` environment variable provided by the `qsub` client to authenticate requests. This variable indicates the submit host. The server performs checks based on this value.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-   **Insecure client-provided data:** The server trusts the `PBS_O_HOST` variable, which is set by the client submitting the job, without proper validation.
-   **Bypassing authorization checks:** An attacker can modify the `PBS_O_HOST` variable to impersonate a trusted host, allowing them to bypass the ruserok(), submit\_hosts, and allow\_node\_submit authorization mechanisms.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Authorization bypass:** An attacker can submit jobs to the Torque server from unauthorized hosts. This could lead to arbitrary code execution and potentially compromise the system.
-   **Resource abuse:** Attackers can abuse cluster resources by submitting malicious or resource-intensive jobs.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **Manipulated `PBS_O_HOST` variable:** The primary attack vector is setting the `PBS_O_HOST` environment variable to a value that is trusted by the Torque server. This can be achieved by modifying the variable within a client script when submitting a job with `qsub`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Access to a Torque client:** The attacker needs access to a machine where they can run the `qsub` client.
-   **Knowledge of a trusted host:** The attacker needs to know a host that the Torque server considers to be authorized to submit jobs.
-   **Ability to set environment variables:** The attacker must be able to set or manipulate the `PBS_O_HOST` environment variable when submitting a job through `qsub`.

**Additional Information:**
-   The vulnerability does not affect Torque installations compiled with Munge support. Munge provides a secure method of authentication that bypasses the vulnerable code.
-   The vulnerability affects Torque versions prior to 2.5.7, which include versions 2.3.13, 2.4.12 and older.
-   The fix for this vulnerability involves enabling Munge support in Torque.
-   The vendor, Adaptive Computing, has acknowledged the issue and is working on a long-term solution, but have suggested using Munge as an immediate mitigation.
