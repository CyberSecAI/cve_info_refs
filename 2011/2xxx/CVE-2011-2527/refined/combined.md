## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2011%3A1531)

## Topic

Updated qemu-kvm packages that fix one security issue, multiple bugs, and
add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

## Description

KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for
Linux on AMD64 and Intel 64 systems. qemu-kvm is the user-space component
for running virtual machines using KVM.

It was found that qemu-kvm did not properly drop supplemental group
privileges when the root user started guests from the command line
("/usr/libexec/qemu-kvm") with the "-runas" option. A qemu-kvm process
started this way could use this flaw to gain access to files on the host
that are accessible to the supplementary groups and not accessible to the
primary group. (CVE-2011-2527)

Note: This issue only affected qemu-kvm when it was started directly from
the command line. It did not affect the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
platform or applications that start qemu-kvm via libvirt, such as the
Virtual Machine Manager (virt-manager).

This update also fixes several bugs and adds various enhancements.
Documentation for these bug fixes and enhancements will be available
shortly from the Technical Notes document, linked to in the References
section.

All users of qemu-kvm are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
which contain backported patches to correct these issues and add these
enhancements. After installing this update, shut down all running virtual
machines. Once all virtual machines have shut down, start them again for
this update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/kb/docs/DOC-11259>

# qemu privilege escalation

Bug #807893 reported by

on 2011-07-09

|  | [QEMU](https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu) | Fix Released | Undecided | [Stefan Hajnoczi](https://launchpad.net/~stefanha) |  |

### Bug Description

If qemu is started as root, with -runas, the extra groups is not dropped correctly

/proc/`pidof qemu`/status

..

Uid: 100 100 100 100

Gid: 100 100 100 100

FDSize: 32

Groups: 0 1 2 3 4 6 10 11 26 27

...

The fix is to add initgroups() or setgroups(1, [gid]) where appropriate to os-posix.c.

The extra gid's allow read or write access to other files (such as /dev etc).

Emulating the qemu code:

# python

...

>>> import os

>>> os.setgid(100)

>>> os.setuid(100)

>>> os.execve("/bin/sh", [ "/bin/sh" ], os.environ)

sh-4.1$ xxd /dev/sda | head -n2

0000000: eb48 9000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 .H..............

0000010: 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 ................

sh-4.1$ ls -l /dev/sda

brw-rw---- 1 root disk 8, 0 Jul 8 11:54 /dev/sda

| --- | --- | --- | --- |

Andrew Griffiths reports that -runas does not set supplementary group

IDs. This means that gid 0 (root) is not dropped when switching to an

unprivileged user.

Add an initgroups(3) call to use the -runas user's /etc/groups

membership to update the supplementary group IDs.

Signed-off-by: Stefan Hajnoczi <email address hidden>

Note this needs compile testing on various POSIX host platforms. Tested on

Linux. Should work on BSD and Solaris. initgroups(3) is SVr4/BSD but not in

POSIX.

Yep, that fix looks fine. RedHat should have a CVE number for this issue.

Are you happy with this patch? Bumping because security-related.

Regarding portability, Linux, BSD, Solaris, and Mac OS X all provide

initgroups(3). I think we're good.

Requesting CVE. Tools like libvirt deprivilege themselves before launching qemu as an unprivileged user (no use of -runas), so aren't vulnerable.

Does initgroups need access to /etc/group? How does this combine w/

-chroot?

Added bonus...this will fail when the initial user is not privileged

\_and\_ is the same user as -runas user (probably not what a user intended,

but would've worked before). Something like:

[doh@laptop qemu]$ qemu -runas doh

Tested this on Linux, and w/out /etc/group it simply fails to add any

supplementary groups (doesn't fail completely, just fails safely).

Appears similar from solaris manpages.

Once you have code execution in the process, you can modify the others threads execution (if required) to execute your own code. With full capabilities, it would be trivial to escape from a chroot on a normal Linux kernel (grsecurity with appropriate kernel chroot restrictions enabled would reduce the avenues available for escaping.).

I seem to recall other distro's handle thread privileges differently.

Hi Andrew,

I think what Chris meant is that libvirt does not use -runas at all.

It drops privileges (including initgroups(3)) itself \*before\* invoking

QEMU. So I think his statement is simply that libvirt (commonly used

in KVM deployments) is not affected.

Regarding the threads having different privilege level, I have isolated that to being related to my grsecurity configuration (more specifically, chroot\_findtask will block it).

While it's still an issue on older glibc where the setuid/setgid code does not enforce it across all threads, it may not be high priority since fixing it would be a lot more effort.

Wow, just learnt something new that glibc does behind our backs :). I

see it uses SIGRTMIN+1 to signal threads and get them to do the set\*id

system calls.

I'm glad it does this because although most QEMU threads should be

started after command-line parsing, I can think of instances where we

might start a thread before -runas is completed.

Actually, from a quick google perhaps ensuring all threads run after chroot / dropping privileges might be a good idea.

- <http://wiki.freebsd.org/Per-Thread%20Credentials>

- <http://www.cocoabuilder.com/archive/cocoa/33107-cthread-fork.html>

though it looks like you might need to put in effort into getting per-thread uid's for freebsd/macosx when they make that available, and you're assuming they're running a recent glibc. Depending on complexity, it can't hurt to ensure you're not going to hit into per-thread uid/gid's. I'm of two minds about glibc doing this. This was a particular favourite bug class of mine :)

It seems that there is a linux distro which uses uclibc, which does not emulate the glibc behaviour:

<http://dl-4.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v2.2/main/x86/> <-- has qemu packages.

we can use <http://paste.pocoo.org/raw/438497/> to emulate qemu's behaviour

# ./test

[main] my [ug]id is 100/100

[thread] my [ug]id is 0/0

^-- the qemu thread would be running as root

Actually, from a quick google perhaps ensuring all threads run after chroot / dropping privileges might be a good idea.

though it looks like you might need to put in effort into getting per-thread uid's for freebsd/macosx when they make that available, and you're assuming they're running a recent glibc. Depending on complexity, it can't hurt to ensure you're not going to hit into per-thread uid/gid's. I'm of two minds about glibc doing this. This was a particular favourite bug class of mine :)
It seems that there is a linux distro which uses uclibc, which does not emulate the glibc behaviour:
http://dl-4.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v2.2/main/x86/ <-- has qemu packages.
we can use http://paste.pocoo.org/raw/438497/ to emulate qemu's behaviour
# ./test
[main] my [ug]id is 100/100

Good point about other OSes and distros. QEMU does not create any

threads before -runas processing AFAICT.

It's a nasty problem in general though because shared libraries could...

The -runas processing doesn't happen until os\_setup\_post() right

before entering the main loop. It is too late at that point because

threads may have been spawned.

My mistake was to think -runas processing happens in os\_parse\_cmd\_args().

Mike, the issue is solved for Linux hosts with a modern glibc. Andrew

explained that uclibc or non-Linux hosts may still be affected if they do

not apply set\*id() to all threads in the process.

The safe way to solve this universally is to perform -runas before creating

threads.

Here's some reproduction code you can use to see the difference between glibc and raw system calls:

<https://gist.github.com/1084042>

If you're wondering about Linux and non-glibc distributions using qemu, Alpine is one particular answer to that question (so the affected Linux distributions is non-zero).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=720773#c0)  Vincent Danen    2011-07-12 18:11:34 UTC  ``` It was reported [1] that qemu did not properly drop extra group privileges when started as root with the -runas commandline option.  This means that the extra GID's would give qemu elevated privileges to read or write files that the supplementary groups allowed, because qemu is still running with group root privileges   When qemu is used by libvirt or vdsm (to launch KVM), however, libvirt itself drops privileges prior to launching qemu, so when started in this fashion there is no elevation of privileges to the qemu process.  [1] [https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/807893](https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/%2Bbug/807893)   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=720773#c1)  Vincent Danen    2011-07-12 18:26:19 UTC  ``` A proposed patch is available here:  [https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/807893/comments/1](https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/%2Bbug/807893/comments/1)  This also only affects qemu versions greater than 0.10.0 (where the -runas option was introduced).   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=720773#c2)  Vincent Danen    2011-07-12 18:27:53 UTC  ``` Created qemu tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 720784](show_bug.cgi?id=720784 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2011-2527 qemu: when started as root, extra groups are not dropped correctly [fedora-all]")] Affects: epel-5 [[bug 720785](show_bug.cgi?id=720785 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2011-2527 qemu: when started as root, extra groups are not dropped correctly [epel-5]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=720773#c3)  Vincent Danen    2011-07-14 18:16:02 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 513239](attachment.cgi?id=513239&action=diff "upstream patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=513239&action=edit "upstream patch") upstream patch  Commit cc4662f9642995c78bed587707eeb9ad8500035b from upstream to fix the flaw.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=720773#c5)  Petr Matousek    2011-07-15 18:54:35 UTC  ``` Statement:  Future qemu-kvm updates in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 may address this flaw. This issue did not affect the versions of qemu-kvm as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 as it did not include support for "run as" functionality.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=720773#c7)  Eduardo Habkost    2011-11-17 16:32:55 UTC  ```      Technical note added. If any revisions are required, please edit the "Technical Notes" field     accordingly. All revisions will be proofread by the Engineering Content Services team.          New Contents: Cause: qemu did not properly drop extra group privileges when started as root with the -runas commandline option.  Consequence: extra GID's would give qemu elevated privileges to read or write files that the supplementary groups allowed, because qemu is still running with group root privileges.  Fix:  Added an initgroups(3) call to use the -runas user's /etc/groups membership to update the supplementary group IDs.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: CVE Request: qemu -runas does not clear supplementary groups

There's a missing initgroups() call in qemu in the -runas
argument handling.  Details are available on

 [https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/807893](https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/%2Bbug/807893)

in short, -runas is supposed to reduce privileges to a
bare minimum (after all initialization is completed),
but the process still has all the supplementary groups
which should be dropped too.

Can a CVE id be assigned for this issue?

Thanks,

/mjt

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Sorry, we were contacted directly to provide a CVE name, and I'm not
sure if that was before or after you wrote this mail (probably after).
That bug has been updated with the assigned CVE name, CVE-2011-2527.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

Upstream it is easily triggered by ejecting a SCSI CD-ROM during anaconda's media test step.  No known reproducer for RHEL6 (we do not have SCSI CD-ROMs), but fixing it is a good idea anyway because it can be triggered by the guest just by cancelling SCSI commands.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): qemu-kvm-0.12.1.2-2.194.el6   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=744780#c2)  Dor Laor    2011-10-10 17:17:20 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=744780#c0)) > Description of problem: > I found a use-after-free in QEMU's SCSI target code.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
