Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2011-2984:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a flaw in how the browser handles drag-and-drop events, specifically when a browser tab element is dropped onto a web content area. The vulnerability stems from insufficient security checks when transferring data via the `dataTransfer` object during a drop event.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** Web content can access and manipulate chrome-privileged objects (like browser tab elements) when they are dropped onto the content area.
*   **Inadequate Data Transfer Security:** The `nsDOMDataTransfer::MozGetDataAt` function doesn't properly filter out or censor chrome-privileged objects from being exposed to content scripts during drag-and-drop.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By obtaining a reference to a chrome-privileged tab object, malicious web content could call privileged functions, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution within the browser's context or even privilege escalation to the operating system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Drag and Drop:** The attack vector involves a user dragging a browser tab and dropping it onto a web page that has registered a drop event listener.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to serve malicious web content:** The attacker needs to be able to serve a web page with the malicious drop event listener.
*   **User Interaction:** The user must drag and drop a browser tab element onto the malicious page.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in the `nsDOMDataTransfer.cpp` file within the browser's source code, specifically in how `MozGetDataAt` handles data transfer during drag and drop operations.
*   The vulnerability is related to the fact that `XPCConvert::NativeInterface2JSObject` does not create COWs (Copy-on-Write) objects automatically, which could mitigate the issue of privileged object exposure, but the vulnerability still exists because the chrome object shouldn't be exposed to content in the first place.
*   The vulnerability is exploitable by registering a drop event listener in the web content, and then dropping a tab element from the browser onto the content area.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The issue is described as a "critical" security issue.
*   The vulnerability affects multiple versions of Mozilla Firefox, Thunderbird, and Seamonkey.
*   The fix involves restricting access to chrome objects when using data transfer during drag and drop operations.
*   The fix involves checking the principal of the object being dragged to check if it can be accessed.
