Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-2730:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause is an information disclosure vulnerability in the Spring Framework related to the handling of Expression Language (EL) within JSPs. The issue arises because, by default, EL expressions within JSP tags are evaluated, which can lead to unintended information exposure.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability is due to the default behavior of Spring Framework to evaluate EL within JSP tags. This can expose sensitive data if EL is used improperly.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Information Leakage:** Attackers can potentially extract sensitive information by crafting malicious EL expressions within JSP tags. This can expose internal application data, configurations, or other sensitive details.

**Attack vectors:**

- The attack vector is through user-controlled input that can be injected into JSP tags processed by the Spring Framework.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- Attackers need the ability to inject or influence the content of JSP tags that will be processed by Spring Framework. This may be achieved through vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting (XSS) or other input manipulation attacks.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix involves introducing a new context parameter named `springJspExpressionSupport`. When set to `false`, it prevents Spring from evaluating EL within tags, mitigating the vulnerability. It is recommended to set this parameter to false in environments where EL support is provided by the container.
- The provided bug report is related to CVE-2011-2730, but also mentions other CVEs like CVE-2011-2731, CVE-2011-2732, and CVE-2011-2894, indicating multiple related vulnerabilities in the Spring Framework.
- The fix was backported from version 2.5.6.SEC03 to version 2.5.6.SEC02-2+squeeze1 in the Debian package.
