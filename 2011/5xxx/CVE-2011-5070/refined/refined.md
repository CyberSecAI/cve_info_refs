      "vulnerability": "Multiple vulnerabilities in Support Incident Tracker (SiT!)",
      "description": "Support Incident Tracker (SiT!) version 3.65, and possibly earlier versions, contain multiple vulnerabilities including; malicious file uploads, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and cross-site request forgery.",

        {
          "cwe_id": "CWE-434",
          "name": "Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type",
          "description": "The incident_attachments.php and ftp_upload_file.php scripts do not properly filter file extensions, allowing an attacker to upload arbitrary files including PHP shells. The folder path can be obtained by brute-forcing the folder name, or by triggering an error message in the move_uploaded_file.php script."

          "description": "The incident_attachments.php, link_add.php, and translate.php scripts are vulnerable to XSS. An attacker can upload filenames containing arbitrary script or inject script into the link creation and translation pages which will then be executed with the privileges of the web service."

      "impact": "An attacker may be able to inject arbitrary script, execute commands as a logged-in user, or upload malicious files to the web server.",

        "Malicious file uploads",
        "SQL injection",
        "Cross-site scripting",

      "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs user access to the website, and the ability to either brute force folder paths or cause errors to reveal file paths. For CSRF, the attacker needs to trick a logged-in user to visit a malicious link.",
