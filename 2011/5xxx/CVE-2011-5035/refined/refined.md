  "CVE-2011-5035": {
    "description": "The OpenJDK embedded web server did not guard against an excessive number of a request parameters, leading to a denial of service vulnerability involving hash collisions.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation and resource management within the OpenJDK's embedded web server, which fails to limit the number of request parameters. This allows an attacker to exploit hash collisions within the server's HashMap implementation. The server does not check or limit the number of HTTP request headers leading to excessive CPU usage.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of input validation",
       "Lack of resource management",
      "Predictable hash collisions"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition by sending HTTP requests with a large number of headers or parameters, causing the server to consume excessive CPU resources by triggering hash collisions in the HashMap used for processing requests. This can lead to the server becoming unresponsive or crashing.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote attack over network by sending crafted HTTP requests with a large number of headers or parameters."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the affected server.",
