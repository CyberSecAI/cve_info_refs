```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from the way Distributed Ruby (DRb) handles the `instance_eval` and `syscall` methods, allowing for arbitrary code execution.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Unsafe use of `instance_eval` which allows arbitrary Ruby code execution",
    "Unsafe use of `syscall` which allows for execution of system calls, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution when combined with file creation and execution"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote code execution on the vulnerable server.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Sending a malicious `instance_eval` payload to the vulnerable DRb server.",
    "Sending a series of `syscall` calls to the vulnerable DRb server to create, write to, and execute a file containing a malicious payload."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to connect to the vulnerable DRb service and send commands. Knowledge of the DRb URI is required."
