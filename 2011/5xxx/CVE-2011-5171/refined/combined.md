How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Power2Go buffer overflow vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#158003

Original Release Date: 2011-12-09 | Last Revised: 2011-12-09

---

### Overview

Power2Go 8 contains a buffer overflow in the handling of project (.p2g) files, which can allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.

### Description

| According to CyberLink's [website](http://www.cyberlink.com/products/power2go/burning_en_US.html), "Power2Go 8 features all the tools you need to easily copy all your media to any disc. Now you can mount disc images as virtual drives, rip, copy and edit your music and experience the ultimate in convenience with drag and drop burning." Power2Go 8, and possibly prior versions, fails to perform adequate boundary checks on user-supplied input when parsing malformed project (.p2g) files causing a stack-based buffer overflow leading to possible remote code execution.  The reporter has also stated that the WaveEditor component of Power2Go 8 contains the same vulnerability when parsing WaveEditor project files (.wve). |
| --- |

### Impact

| By causing the Power2Go 8 application to parse a specially-crafted project (.p2g) file, a remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user using the application. |
| --- |

### Solution

| We are currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem. |
| --- |

| **Use the Microsoft Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit**The [Microsoft Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit](http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=1677) (EMET) can be used to help prevent exploitation of these vulnerabilities.**Enable DEP in Microsoft Windows**Consider enabling Data Execution Prevention (DEP) in supported versions of Windows. DEP should not be treated as a complete workaround, but it can mitigate the execution of attacker-supplied code in some cases. Microsoft has published detailed technical information about DEP in Security Research & Defense blog posts "Understanding DEP as a mitigation technology" [part 1](http://blogs.technet.com/srd/archive/2009/06/05/understanding-dep-as-a-mitigation-technology-part-1.aspx) and [part 2](http://blogs.technet.com/srd/archive/2009/06/12/understanding-dep-as-a-mitigation-technology-part-2.aspx). DEP should be used in conjunction with the application of patches or other mitigations described in this document.Note that when relying on DEP for exploit mitigation, it is important to use a system that supports Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) as well. ASLR is not supported by Windows XP or Windows Server 2003 or earlier. ASLR was introduced with Microsoft Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008. Please see the Microsoft SRD blog entry: [On the effectiveness of DEP and ASLR](http://blogs.technet.com/b/srd/archive/2010/12/08/on-the-effectiveness-of-dep-and-aslr.aspx) for more details. |

# Software Link: http://www.cyberlink.com/downloads/trials/index_en_US.html
# CVE : -

### Software Description
# CyberLink Power2Go is all-media disc burning software.
# Copy all your media to any disc with Power2Go 8! With new System Recovery tools
# and over 5000 free DVD menus to choose from on DirectorZone.com, Power2Go 8 not
# only burns everything but allows you to create pro-like DVDs, rip CDs and
# safeguard valuable data.

# CyberLink Wave Editor will help user to convert audio format when producing, editing,
# or creating backups for some audios or videos. This additional tools is also included
# since PowerDirector 9 to PowerDirector 10, and now included on Power2Go 8.

### Vulnerability Details
# Most of CyberLink products contain built-in project file with their own format and
# extension. This file usually contains our recently modified project or work.
# Most of this filetypes contain this section:
#     <File src=
#     <File name=
# Generally, those sections will be filled with source path or filename.
# both products will lead us to command execution because the address of
# SE Handler is overwritten with 0x00410041.

# Notes:
# I cannot find any good return address for WaveEditor, if you can make it
# through the hard way, kudos!!

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
