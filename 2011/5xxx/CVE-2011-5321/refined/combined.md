| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1201887#c0)  Prasad Pandit    2015-03-13 17:50:28 UTC  ``` Linux kernel built with the virtual console support(CONFIG_VT) is vulnerable to a NULL pointer dereference issue. It could occur while accessing pseudo terminal device(/dev/pts/*) files.  An unprivileged user could use this flaw to crash the system kernel resulting in DoS.  Upstream fix: -------------   -> <https://git.kernel.org/linus/c290f8358acaeffd8e0c551ddcc24d1206143376>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1201887#c1)  Prasad Pandit    2015-03-13 18:02:45 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue does not affect the versions of the kernel package as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 7 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.  This issue affects the version of Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6. Future kernel updates for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 may address this issue.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1201887#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2015-07-14 15:12:39 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2015:1221 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015-1221.html>   ``` |  |

hid/apple: modern macbook airs use the standard apple function key translations
commit 21404b772a1c65f7b935b8c0fddc388a949f4e31 upstream.
This removes the use of the special "macbookair\_fn\_keys" keyboard
translation table for the MacBookAir4,x models (ie the 2011 refresh).
They use the standard apple\_fn\_keys[] translation. Apparently only the
old MacBook Air's need a different translation table.
This mirrors the change that commit da617c7cb915 ("HID: consolidate
MacbookAir 4,1 mappings") did for the WELLSPRING6A ones, but does it for
the WELLSPRING6 model used on the MacBookAir4,2.

mtd: nand\_base: always initialise oob\_poi before writing OOB data
commit f722013ee9fd24623df31dec9a91a6d02c3e2f2f upstream.
In nand\_do\_write\_ops() code it is possible for a caller to provide
ops.oobbuf populated and ops.mode == MTD\_OOB\_AUTO, which currently
means that the chip->oob\_poi buffer isn't initialised to all 0xFF.
The nand\_fill\_oob() method then carries out the task of copying
the provided OOB data to oob\_poi, but with MTD\_OOB\_AUTO it skips
areas marked as unavailable by the layout struct, including the
bad block marker bytes.
An example of this causing issues is when the last OOB data read
was from the start of a bad block where the markers are not 0xFF,
and the caller wishes to write new OOB data at the beginning of
another block. In this scenario the caller would provide OOB data,
but nand\_fill\_oob() would skip the bad block marker bytes in
oob\_poi before copying the OOB data provided by the caller.
This means that when the OOB data is written back to NAND,
the block is inadvertently marked as bad without the caller knowing.
This has been witnessed when using YAFFS2 where tags are stored
in the OOB.
To avoid this oob\_poi is always initialised to 0xFF to make sure
no left over data is inadvertently written back to the OOB area.

patch.

Not using parentheses in proper manner for ternary operator

commit f5ff7cd1a84caa9545d952a37ac872ccb73825fb upstream.
The previous commit enforces a new rule for handling the cloned packets
for transmit time stamping. These packets must not be freed using any other
function than skb\_complete\_tx\_timestamp. This commit fixes the one and only
driver using this API.
The driver first appeared in v3.0.

crypto: cryptd - Use subsys\_initcall to prevent races with aesni
commit b2bac6acf86d05d8af0499f37d91ecac15722803 upstream.
As cryptd is depeneded on by other algorithms such as aesni-intel,
it needs to be registered before them. When everything is built
as modules, this occurs naturally. However, for this to work when
they are built-in, we need to use subsys\_initcall in cryptd.

mtd: pxa3xx\_nand: Fix blank page ECC mismatch
commit 543e32d5ff165d0d68deedb0e3557478c7c36a4a upstream.
This bug was introduced in f8155a40 ("mtd: pxa3xx\_nand: rework irq
logic") and causes the PXA3xx NAND controller fail to operate with NAND
flash that has empty pages. According to the comment in this block, the
hardware controller will report a double-bit error for empty pages,
which can and must be ignored.
This patch restores the original behaviour of the driver.

When keep\_config is set, the detection would goes different routine.
That the driver would read out the setting which is set previously
by bootloader. While most bootloader keep the irq mask as off, and
current driver need all irq default open, keep\_config behavior would
lead to no irq at all.

mtd: provide an alias for the redboot module name
commit d5de1907d0af22e1a02de2b16a624148517a39c2 upstream.
parse\_mtd\_partitions takes a list of partition types; if the driver
isn't loaded, it attempts to load it, and then it grabs the partition
parser. For redboot, the module name is "redboot.ko", while the parser
name is "RedBoot". Since modprobe is case-sensitive, attempting to
modprobe "RedBoot" will never work. I suspect the embedded systems that
make use of redboot just always manually loaded redboot prior to loading
their specific nand chip drivers (or statically compiled it in).

The offchannel code is currently broken - we should

the work's channel and channel\_type are the same

netlink: validate NLA\_MSECS length
commit c30bc94758ae2a38a5eb31767c1985c0aae0950b upstream.
L2TP for example uses NLA\_MSECS like this:
policy:
[L2TP\_ATTR\_RECV\_TIMEOUT] = { .type = NLA\_MSECS, },
code:
if (info->attrs[L2TP\_ATTR\_RECV\_TIMEOUT])
cfg.reorder\_timeout = nla\_get\_msecs(info->attrs[L2TP\_ATTR\_RECV\_TIMEOUT]);
As nla\_get\_msecs() is essentially nla\_get\_u64() plus the
conversion to a HZ-based value, this will not properly
reject attributes from userspace that aren't long enough
and might overrun the message.
Add NLA\_MSECS to the attribute minlen array to check the
size properly.

VFS: we need to set LOOKUP\_JUMPED on mountpoint crossing
commit a3fbbde70a0cec017f2431e8f8de208708c76acc upstream.
Mountpoint crossing is similar to following procfs symlinks - we do
not get ->d\_revalidate() called for dentry we have arrived at, with
unpleasant consequences for NFS4.
Simple way to reproduce the problem in mainline:
cat >/tmp/a.c <<'EOF'
#include
#include
#include
main()
{
struct flock fl = {.l\_type = F\_RDLCK, .l\_whence = SEEK\_SET, .l\_len = 1};
if (fcntl(0, F\_SETLK, &fl))
perror("setlk");
}
EOF
cc /tmp/a.c -o /tmp/test
then on nfs4:
mount --bind file1 file2
/tmp/test < file1 # ok
/tmp/test < file2 # spews "setlk: No locks available"...
What happens is the missing call of ->d\_revalidate() after mountpoint
crossing and that's where NFS4 would issue OPEN request to server.
The fix is simple - treat mountpoint crossing the same way we deal with
following procfs-style symlinks. I.e. set LOOKUP\_JUMPED...

blk-flush: move the queue kick into
commit e67b77c791ca2778198c9e7088f3266ed2da7a55 upstream.
A dm-multipath user reported[1] a problem when trying to boot
a kernel with commit 4853abaae7e4a2af938115ce9071ef8684fb7af4
(block: fix flush machinery for stacking drivers with differring
flush flags) applied. It turns out that an empty flush request
can be sent into blk\_insert\_flush. When the BUG\_ON was fixed
to allow for this, I/O on the underlying device would stall. The
reason is that blk\_insert\_cloned\_request does not kick the queue.
In the aforementioned commit, I had added a special case to
kick the queue if data was sent down but the queue flags did
not require a flush. A better solution is to push the queue
kick up into blk\_insert\_cloned\_request.
This patch, along with a follow-on which fixes the BUG\_ON, fixes
the issue reported.

This is because bdev holds on to disk but disk doesn't pin the
associated queue. If a SCSI device is removed while the device is
still open, the sdev puts the base reference to the queue on release.
When the bdev is finally released, the associated queue is already
gone along with the bdi and bdev\_inode\_switch\_bdi() ends up
dereferencing already freed bdi.
Even if it were not for this bug, disk not holding onto the associated
queue is very unusual and error-prone.
Fix it by making add\_disk() take an extra reference to its queue and
put it on disk\_release() and ensuring that disk and its fops owner are
put in that order after all accesses to the disk and queue are
complete.

NFS/sunrpc: don't use a credential with extra groups.
commit dc6f55e9f8dac4b6479be67c5c9128ad37bb491f upstream.
The sunrpc layer keeps a cache of recently used credentials and
'unx\_match' is used to find the credential which matches the current
process.
However unx\_match allows a match when the cached credential has extra
groups at the end of uc\_gids list which are not in the process group list.
So if a process with a list of (say) 4 group accesses a file and gains
access because of the last group in the list, then another process
with the same uid and gid, and a gid list being the first tree of the
gids of the original process tries to access the file, it will be
granted access even though it shouldn't as the wrong rpc credential
will be used.

When a device is in the process of being detected at driver load time then
if it is removed, the device that is no longer present will not be added
to the list. So the code in \_scsih\_probe\_sas() is rearranged as such so

Fix block queue and elevator memory leak in scsi\_alloc\_sdev
commit f7c9c6bb14f3104608a3a83cadea10a6943d2804 upstream.
When looking at memory consumption issues I noticed quite a
lot of memory in the kmalloc-2048 bucket:
OBJS ACTIVE USE OBJ SIZE SLABS OBJ/SLAB CACHE SIZE NAME
6561 6471 98% 2.30K 243 27 15552K kmalloc-2048
Over 15MB. slub debug shows that cfq is responsible for almost
all of it:
# sort -nr /sys/kernel/slab/kmalloc-2048/alloc\_calls
6402 .cfq\_init\_queue+0xec/0x460 age=43423/43564/43655 pid=1 cpus=4,11,13
In scsi\_alloc\_sdev we do scsi\_alloc\_queue but if slave\_alloc
fails we don't free it with scsi\_free\_queue.
The patch below fixes the issue:
OBJS ACTIVE USE OBJ SIZE SLABS OBJ/SLAB CACHE SIZE NAME

iscsi-target: Fix non-immediate TMR handling
commit 5a4c8666c6d576f076a7c6824589cdbb984c0f84 upstream.
This patch addresses two issues with non immediate TMR handling in
iscsit\_handle\_task\_mgt\_cmd(). The first involves breakage due to
v3.1-rc conversion of iscsit\_sequence\_cmd(), which upon good status
would hit the iscsit\_add\_reject\_from\_cmd() block of code. This patch
adds an explict check for CMDSN\_ERROR\_CANNOT\_RECOVER.
The second adds a check to return when non immediate TMR operation is
detected after iscsit\_ack\_from\_expstatsn(), as iscsit\_sequence\_cmd()
-> iscsit\_execute\_cmd() will have called transport\_generic\_handle\_tmr()
for the non immediate TMR case already.

tcm\_loop: Add explict read buffer memset for SCF\_SCSI\_CONTROL\_SG\_IO\_CDB
commit 8cd79f24350826b81e16990d9e12bc878e67d385 upstream.
This patch addresses an issue with buggy userspace code sending I/O
via scsi-generic that does not explictly clear their associated read
buffers. It adds an explict memset of the first SGL entry within
tcm\_loop\_new\_cmd\_map() for SCF\_SCSI\_CONTROL\_SG\_IO\_CDB payloads that
are currently guaranteed to be a single SGL by target-core code.
This issue is a side effect of the v3.1-rc1 merge to remove the
extra memcpy between certain control CDB types using a contigious
+ cleared buffer in target-core, and performing a memcpy into the
SGL list within tcm\_loop.
It was originally mainfesting itself by udev + scsi\_id + scsi-generic
not properly setting up the expected /dev/disk/by-id/ symlinks because
the INQUIRY payload was containing extra bogus data preventing the
proper NAA IEEE WWN from being parsed by userspace.

USB: Update last\_busy time after autosuspend fails
commit b2c0a863e14676fa5760c6d828fd373288e2f64a upstream.
Originally, the runtime PM core would send an idle notification
whenever a suspend attempt failed. The idle callback routine could
then schedule a delayed suspend for some time later.
However this behavior was changed by commit
f71648d73c1650b8b4aceb3856bebbde6daa3b86 (PM / Runtime: Remove idle
notification after failing suspend). No notifications were sent, and
there was no clear mechanism to retry failed suspends.
This caused problems for the usbhid driver, because it fails
autosuspend attempts as long as a key is being held down. A companion
patch changes the PM core's behavior, but we also need to change the
USB core. In particular, this patch (as1493) updates the device's
last\_busy time when an autosuspend fails, so that the PM core will
retry the autosuspend in the future when the delay time expires
again.

Help text under choice menu is never displayed because it does not have

under choice, assuming that it will be displayed when user selects help.
for example in Kconfig if we have:
choice
prompt "Choice"
---help---
HELP TEXT ...
config A
bool "A"
config B
bool "B"
endchoice
Without this patch "HELP TEXT" is not displayed when user selects help
option when "Choice" is highlighted from menuconfig or xconfig or
gconfig.
This patch changes the logic in menu\_get\_ext\_help to display help for
cases which dont have symbol names like choice.

drm/radeon: avoid bouncing connector status btw disconnected & unknown
commit 340764465aa4a586ca332e61ae64883e5ad6f183 upstream.
Since force handling rework of d0d0a225e6ad43314c9aa7ea081f76adc5098ad4
we could end up bouncing connector status btw disconnected and unknown.
When connector status change a call to output\_poll\_changed happen which
in turn ask again for detect but with force set.
So set the load detect flags whenever we report the connector as
connected or unknown this avoid bouncing btw disconnected and unknown.

commit 43dea228a3ba5463392281535dfb3d3fe56f4c2c upstream.
The 3.1 kernel has a regression for ALC861 codec where no sound output
is heard with the default setup. It's because the amps in DACs aren't
properly unmuted while the output mixers are assigned only to pins.
This patch fixes the missing initialization of DACs when no mixer is

ALSA: hda/realtek - Don't create alt-stream for capture when unnecessary
commit 1fa1757366783fb52e6e85c2d735db49b818d382 upstream.
When the driver finds multiple ADCs, it tries to create an alternative
capture PCM stream. However, these secondary ADCs might be useless or
in uncontrolled paths in some cases, e.g. when auto-mic or dynamic
ADC-switching is enabled. Also, when only a single capture source is
available, the multi-streams don't make sense, too.
With this patch, the driver checks such condition and skips the alt
stream appropriately.

powerpc: get\_hugepte() don't put\_page() the wrong page
commit 405e44f2e312dd5dd63e5a9f459bffcbcd4368ef upstream.
"page" may have changed to point to the next hugepage after the loop
completed, The references have been taken on the head page, so the
put\_page must happen there too.
This is a longstanding issue pre-thp inclusion.
It's totally unclear how these page\_cache\_add\_speculative and
pte\_val(pte) != pte\_val(\*ptep) checks are necessary across all the
powerpc gup\_fast code, when x86 doesn't need any of that: there's no way
the page can be freed with irq disabled so we're guaranteed the
atomic\_inc will happen on a page with page\_count > 0 (so not needing the
speculative check).
The pte check is also meaningless on x86: no need to rollback on x86 if
the pte changed, because the pte can still change a CPU tick after the
check succeeded and it won't be rolled back in that case. The important
thing is we got a reference on a valid page that was mapped there a CPU
tick ago. So not knowing the soft tlb refill code of ppc64 in great
detail I'm not removing the "speculative" page\_count increase and the
pte checks across all the code, but unless there's a strong reason for
it they should be later cleaned up too.
If a pte can change from huge to non-huge (like it could happen with
THP) passing a pte\_t \*ptep to gup\_hugepte() would also require to repeat
the is\_hugepd in gup\_hugepte(), but that shouldn't happen with hugetlbfs
only so I'm not altering that.

This part of gup\_fast doesn't seem capable of handling hugetlbfs ptes,
those should be handled by gup\_hugepd only, so these checks are
superfluous.
Plus if this wasn't a noop, it would have oopsed because, the insistence
of using the speculative refcounting would trigger a VM\_BUG\_ON if a tail
page was encountered in the page\_cache\_get\_speculative().

xhci: If no endpoints changed, don't issue BW command.
commit 2dc3753997f3c80ce8b950242ab9bb3fb936acfd upstream.
Some alternate interface settings have no endpoints associated with them.
This shows up in some USB webcams, particularly the Logitech HD 1080p,
which uses the uvcvideo driver. If a driver switches between two alt
settings with no endpoints, there is no need to issue a configure endpoint
command, because there is no endpoint information to update.
The only time a configure endpoint command with just the add slot flag set
makes sense is when the driver is updating hub characteristics in the slot
context. However, that code never calls xhci\_check\_bandwidth, so we
should be safe not issuing a command if only the slot context add flag is
set.

usb\_storage: Don't freeze in usb-stor-scan
commit f02fe890ece7d695a5744b20525d45312382e6e4 upstream.
Scanning cannot be run during suspend or hibernation, but if
usb-stor-scan freezes another thread waiting on scanning to
complete may fail to freeze.
However, if usb-stor-scan is left freezable without ever actually
freezing then the freezer will wait on it to exit, and threads
waiting for scanning to finish will no longer be blocked. One
problem with this approach is that usb-stor-scan has a delay to
wait for devices to settle (which is currently the only point where
it can freeze). To work around this we can request that the freezer
send a fake signal when freezing, then use interruptible sleep to
wake the thread early when freezing happens.
To make this happen, the following changes are made to
usb-stor-scan:
\* Use set\_freezable\_with\_signal() instead of set\_freezable() to
request a fake signal when freezing
\* Use wait\_event\_interruptible\_timeout() instead of
wait\_event\_freezable\_timeout() to avoid freezing

ext4: fix race in xattr block allocation path
commit 6d6a435190bdf2e04c9465cde5bdc3ac68cf11a4 upstream.
Ceph users reported that when using Ceph on ext4, the filesystem
would often become corrupted, containing inodes with incorrect
i\_blocks counters.
I managed to reproduce this with a very hacked-up "streamtest"
binary from the Ceph tree.
Ceph is doing a lot of xattr writes, to out-of-inode blocks.
There is also another thread which does sync\_file\_range and close,
of the same files. The problem appears to happen due to this race:
sync/flush thread xattr-set thread
----------------- ----------------
do\_writepages ext4\_xattr\_set
ext4\_da\_writepages ext4\_xattr\_set\_handle
mpage\_da\_map\_blocks ext4\_xattr\_block\_set
set DELALLOC\_RESERVE
ext4\_new\_meta\_blocks
ext4\_mb\_new\_blocks
if (!i\_delalloc\_reserved\_flag)
vfs\_dq\_alloc\_block
ext4\_get\_blocks
down\_write(i\_data\_sem)
set i\_delalloc\_reserved\_flag
...
up\_write(i\_data\_sem)
if (i\_delalloc\_reserved\_flag)
vfs\_dq\_alloc\_block\_nofail
In other words, the sync/flush thread pops in and sets
i\_delalloc\_reserved\_flag on the inode, which makes the xattr thread
think that it's in a delalloc path in ext4\_new\_meta\_blocks(),
and add the block for a second time, after already having added
it once in the !i\_delalloc\_reserved\_flag case in ext4\_mb\_new\_blocks
The real problem is that we shouldn't be using the DELALLOC\_RESERVED
state flag, and instead we should be passing
EXT4\_GET\_BLOCKS\_DELALLOC\_RESERVE down to ext4\_map\_blocks() instead of
using an inode state flag. We'll fix this for now with using
i\_data\_sem to prevent this race, but this is really not the right way
to fix things.

function calls ext4\_handle\_dirty\_metadata with the inode of the file that's
being added to the directory, not the directory inode itself. Therefore,
correct the code to dirty the directory buffers with the directory inode, not
the file inode.

ext4: ext4\_mkdir should dirty dir\_block with newly created directory inode
commit f9287c1f2d329f4d78a3bbc9cf0db0ebae6f146a upstream.
ext4\_mkdir calls ext4\_handle\_dirty\_metadata with dir\_block and the inode "dir".
Unfortunately, dir\_block belongs to the newly created directory (which is
"inode"), not the parent directory (which is "dir"). Fix the incorrect

commit bcaa992975041e40449be8c010c26192b8c8b409 upstream.
When ext4\_rename performs a directory rename (move), dir\_bh is a
buffer that is modified to update the '..' link in the directory being
moved (old\_inode). However, ext4\_handle\_dirty\_metadata is called with
the old parent directory inode (old\_dir) and dir\_bh, which is

hwspinlock/core: use a mutex to protect the radix tree
commit 93b465c2e186d96fb90012ba0f9372eb9952e732 upstream.
Since we're using non-atomic radix tree allocations, we
should be protecting the tree using a mutex and not a
spinlock.
Non-atomic allocations and process context locking is good enough,
as the tree is manipulated only when locks are registered/
unregistered/requested/freed.
The locks themselves are still protected by spinlocks of course,
and mutexes are not involved in the locking/unlocking paths.

ALSA: hda - Add missing static ADC tables for ALC269 quirks
[There is no upstream commit for this patch since the corresponding
code was removed from 3.2 kernel. This is a regression found only in
3.1 kernel, so please apply this only to 3.1.x series.]
Some ALC269 quirks define their own .cap\_mixer field but without the
static adc\_nids[]. This resulted in the mismatch of ADC because ALC269
may have the widget 0x07 for another audio-in, and the auto-parser picks
this up instead.
This patch fixes the problem by adding the static adc\_nids[] and co
again to these entries.

mm: thp: tail page refcounting fix
commit 70b50f94f1644e2aa7cb374819cfd93f3c28d725 upstream.
Michel while working on the working set estimation code, noticed that
calling get\_page\_unless\_zero() on a random pfn\_to\_page(random\_pfn)
wasn't safe, if the pfn ended up being a tail page of a transparent
hugepage under splitting by \_\_split\_huge\_page\_refcount().
He then found the problem could also theoretically materialize with
page\_cache\_get\_speculative() during the speculative radix tree lookups
that uses get\_page\_unless\_zero() in SMP if the radix tree page is freed
and reallocated and get\_user\_pages is called on it before
page\_cache\_get\_speculative has a chance to call get\_page\_unless\_zero().
So the best way to fix the problem is to keep page\_tail->\_count zero at
all times. This will guarantee that get\_page\_unless\_zero() can never
succeed on any tail page. page\_tail->\_mapcount is guaranteed zero and
is unused for all tail pages of a compound page, so we can simply
account the tail page references there and transfer them to
tail\_page->\_count in \_\_split\_huge\_page\_refcount() (in addition to the
head\_page->\_mapcount).
While debugging this s/\_count/\_mapcount/ change I also noticed get\_page is
called by direct-io.c on pages returned by get\_user\_pages. That wasn't
entirely safe because the two atomic\_inc in get\_page weren't atomic. As
opposed to other get\_user\_page users like secondary-MMU page fault to
establish the shadow pagetables would never call any superflous get\_page
after get\_user\_page returns. It's safer to make get\_page universally safe
for tail pages and to use get\_page\_foll() within follow\_page (inside
get\_user\_pages()). get\_page\_foll() is safe to do the refcounting for tail
pages without taking any locks because it is run within PT lock protected
critical sections (PT lock for pte and page\_table\_lock for
pmd\_trans\_huge).
The standard get\_page() as invoked by direct-io instead will now take
the compound\_lock but still only for tail pages. The direct-io paths
are usually I/O bound and the compound\_lock is per THP so very
finegrined, so there's no risk of scalability issues with it. A simple
direct-io benchmarks with all lockdep prove locking and spinlock
debugging infrastructure enabled shows identical performance and no
overhead. So it's worth it. Ideally direct-io should stop calling
get\_page() on pages returned by get\_user\_pages(). The spinlock in
get\_page() is already optimized away for no-THP builds but doing
get\_page() on tail pages returned by GUP is generally a rare operation
and usually only run in I/O paths.
This new refcounting on page\_tail->\_mapcount in addition to avoiding new
RCU critical sections will also allow the working set estimation code to
work without any further complexity associated to the tail page
refcounting with THP.

jsm: remove buggy write queue
commit 9d898966c4a07e4a5092215b5a2829d0ef02baa2 upstream.
jsm uses a write queue that copies from uart\_core circular buffer. This
copying however has some bugs, like not wrapping the head counter. Since
this write queue is also a circular buffer, the consumer function is

This buggy copying function was making some bytes be dropped when

iwlagn: do not use interruptible waits
commit effd4d9aece9184f526e6556786a94d335e38b71 upstream.
Since the dawn of its time, iwlwifi has used
interruptible waits to wait for synchronous
commands and firmware loading.
This leads to "interesting" bugs, because it
can't actually handle the interruptions; for
example when a command sending is interrupted
it will assume the command completed fully,
and then leave it pending, which leads to all
kinds of trouble when the command finishes
later.
Since there's no easy way to gracefully deal
with interruptions, fix the driver to not use
interruptible waits.
This at least fixes the error
iwlagn 0000:02:00.0: Error: Response NULL in 'REPLY\_SCAN\_ABORT\_CMD'

ALSA: hda - Fix ADC input-amp handling for Cx20549 codec
commit 6b45214277bec2193ad3ccb8d7aa6100b5a0f1a9 upstream.
It seems that Conexant CX20549 chip handle only a single input-amp even
though the audio-input widget has multiple sources. This has been never
clear, and I implemented in the current way based on the debug information
I got at the early time -- the device reacts individual input-amp values
for different sources. This is true for another Conexant codec, but it's
not applied to CX20549 actually.
This patch changes the auto-parser code to handle a single input-amp
per audio-in widget for CX20549. After applying this, you'll see only a
single "Capture" volume control instead of separate "Mic" or "Line"
captures when the device is set up to use a single ADC.
We haven't tested 20551 and 20561 codecs yet. If these show the similar
behavior like 20549, they need to set spec->single\_adc\_amp=1, too.

mm: avoid null pointer access in vm\_struct via /proc/vmallocinfo
commit f5252e009d5b87071a919221e4f6624184005368 upstream.
The /proc/vmallocinfo shows information about vmalloc allocations in
vmlist that is a linklist of vm\_struct. It, however, may access pages
field of vm\_struct where a page was not allocated. This results in a null
pointer access and leads to a kernel panic.
Why this happens: In \_\_vmalloc\_node\_range() called from vmalloc(), newly
allocated vm\_struct is added to vmlist at \_\_get\_vm\_area\_node() and then,
some fields of vm\_struct such as nr\_pages and pages are set at
\_\_vmalloc\_area\_node(). In other words, it is added to vmlist before it is
fully initialized. At the same time, when the /proc/vmallocinfo is read,
it accesses the pages field of vm\_struct according to the nr\_pages field
at show\_numa\_info(). Thus, a null pointer access happens.
The patch adds the newly allocated vm\_struct to the vmlist \*after\* it is
fully initialized. So, it can avoid accessing the pages field with
unallocated page when show\_numa\_info() is called.

plat-mxc: iomux-v3.h: implicitly enable pull-up/down when that's desired
commit 6571534b600b8ca1936ff5630b9e0947f21faf16 upstream.
To configure pads during the initialisation a set of special constants
is used, e.g.
#define MX25\_PAD\_FEC\_MDIO\_\_FEC\_MDIO IOMUX\_PAD(0x3c4, 0x1cc, 0x10, 0, 0, PAD\_CTL\_HYS | PAD\_CTL\_PUS\_22K\_UP)
The problem is that no pull-up/down is getting activated unless both
PAD\_CTL\_PUE (pull-up enable) and PAD\_CTL\_PKE (pull/keeper module
enable) set. This is clearly stated in the i.MX25 datasheet and is
confirmed by the measurements on hardware. This leads to some rather
hard to understand bugs such as misdetecting an absent ethernet PHY (a
real bug i had), unstable data transfer etc. This might affect mx25,
mx35, mx50, mx51 and mx53 SoCs.
It's reasonable to expect that if the pullup value is specified, the
intention was to have it actually active, so we implicitly add the
needed bits.

md/raid10: Fix bug when activating a hot-spare.
commit 7fcc7c8acf0fba44d19a713207af7e58267c1179 upstream.
This is a fairly serious bug in RAID10.
When a RAID10 array is degraded and a hot-spare is activated, the
spare does not take up the empty slot, but rather replaces the first
working device.
This is likely to make the array non-functional. It would normally
be possible to recover the data, but that would need care and is not
guaranteed.
This bug was introduced in commit
2bb77736ae5dca0a189829fbb7379d43364a9dac
which first appeared in 3.1.

tuner\_xc2028: Allow selection of the frequency adjustment code for XC3028
commit 9bed77ee2fb46b74782d0d9d14b92e9d07f3df6e upstream.
This device is not using the proper demod IF. Instead of using the
IF macro, it is specifying a IF frequency. This doesn't work, as xc3028
needs to load an specific SCODE for the tuner. In this case, there's
no IF table for 5 MHz.

fb: avoid possible deadlock caused by fb\_set\_suspend
commit 9e769ff3f585db8f978f9113be83d36c7e3965dd upstream.
A lock ordering issue can cause deadlocks: in framebuffer/console code,
all needed struct fb\_info locks are taken before acquire\_console\_sem(),
in places which need to take console semaphore.
But fb\_set\_suspend is always called with console semaphore held, and
inside it we call lock\_fb\_info which gets the fb\_info lock, inverse
locking order of what the rest of the code does. This causes a real
deadlock issue, when we write to state fb sysfs attribute (which calls
fb\_set\_suspend) while a framebuffer is being unregistered by
remove\_conflicting\_framebuffers, as can be shown by following show
blocked state trace on a test program which loads i915 and runs another
forked processes writing to state attribute:

fb-test2 which reproduces above is available on kernel.org bug #26232.
To solve this issue, avoid calling lock\_fb\_info inside fb\_set\_suspend,
and move it out to where needed (callers of fb\_set\_suspend must call
lock\_fb\_info before if needed). So far, the only place which needs to
call lock\_fb\_info is store\_fbstate, all other places which calls
fb\_set\_suspend are suspend/resume hooks that should not need the lock as
they should be run only when processes are already frozen in
suspend/resume.

carminefb: Fix module parameters permissions
commit c84c14224bbca6ec60d5851fcc87be0e34df2f44 upstream.
The third parameter of module\_param is supposed to be an octal value.
The missing leading "0" causes the following:
$ ls -l /sys/module/carminefb/parameters/
total 0
-rw-rwxr-- 1 root root 4096 Jul 8 08:55 fb\_displays
-rw-rwxr-- 1 root root 4096 Jul 8 08:55 fb\_mode
-rw-rwxr-- 1 root root 4096 Jul 8 08:55 fb\_mode\_str
After fixing the perm parameter, we get the expected:
$ ls -l /sys/module/carminefb/parameters/
total 0
-r--r--r-- 1 root root 4096 Jul 8 08:56 fb\_displays

user per registers vs. ptrace single stepping
commit a45aff5285871bf7be1781d9462d3fdbb6c913f9 upstream.
git commit 5e9a2692 "[S390] ptrace cleanup" introduced a regression
for the case when both a user PER set (e.g. a storage alteration trace) and
PTRACE\_SINGLESTEP are active. The new code will overrule the user PER set
with a instruction-fetch PER set over the whole address space for ptrace
single stepping. The inferior process will be stopped after each instruction
with an instruction fetch event. Any other events that may have occurred
concurrently are not reported (e.g. storage alteration event) because the
control bits for them are not set. The solution is to merge the PER control
bits of the user PER set with the PER\_EVENT\_IFETCH control bit for
PTRACE\_SINGLESTEP.

io-mapping: ensure io\_mapping\_map\_atomic \_is\_ atomic
commit 24dd85ff723f142093f44244764b9b5c152235b8 upstream.
For the !HAVE\_ATOMIC\_IOMAP case the stub functions did not call
pagefault\_disable/\_enable. The i915 driver relies on the map
actually being atomic, otherwise it can deadlock with it's own
pagefault handler in the gtt pwrite fastpath.
This is exercised by gem\_mmap\_gtt from the intel-gpu-toosl gem
testsuite.

nfsd4: fix open downgrade, again
commit 3d02fa29dec920c597dd7b7db608a4bc71f088ce upstream.
Yet another open-management regression:
- nfs4\_file\_downgrade() doesn't remove the BOTH access bit on
downgrade, so the server's idea of the stateid's access gets
out of sync with the client's. If we want to keep an O\_RDWR
open in this case, we should do that in the file\_put\_access
logic rather than here.
- We forgot to convert v4 access to an open mode here.
This logic has proven too hard to get right. In the future we may
consider:
- reexamining the lock/openowner relationship (locks probably
don't really need to take their own references here).
- adding open upgrade/downgrade support to the vfs.
- removing the atomic operations. They're redundant as long as
this is all under some other lock.
Also, maybe some kind of additional static checking would help catch
O\_/NFS4\_SHARE\_ACCESS confusion.

nfsd4: permit read opens of executable-only files
commit a043226bc140a2c1dde162246d68a67e5043e6b2 upstream.
A client that wants to execute a file must be able to read it. Read
opens over nfs are therefore implicitly allowed for executable files
even when those files are not readable.
NFSv2/v3 get this right by using a passed-in NFSD\_MAY\_OWNER\_OVERRIDE on
read requests, but NFSv4 has gotten this wrong ever since
dc730e173785e29b297aa605786c94adaffe2544 "nfsd4: fix owner-override on
open", when we realized that the file owner shouldn't override
permissions on non-reclaim NFSv4 opens.
So we can't use NFSD\_MAY\_OWNER\_OVERRIDE to tell nfsd\_permission to allow
reads of executable files.
So, do the same thing we do whenever we encounter another weird NFS
permission nit: define yet another NFSD\_MAY\_\* flag.
The industry's future standardization on 128-bit processors will be
motivated primarily by the need for integers with enough bits for all
the NFSD\_MAY\_\* flags.

nfs: don't try to migrate pages with active requests
commit 2da956523526e440ef4f4dd174e26f5ac06fe011 upstream.
nfs\_find\_and\_lock\_request will take a reference to the nfs\_page and
will then put it if the req is already locked. It's possible though
that the reference will be the last one. That put then can kick off
a whole series of reference puts:
nfs\_page
nfs\_open\_context
dentry
inode
If the inode ends up being deleted, then the VFS will call
truncate\_inode\_pages. That function will try to take the page lock, but
it was already locked when migrate\_page was called. The code
deadlocks.
Fix this by simply refusing the migration request if PagePrivate is
already set, indicating that the page is already associated with an
active read or write request.
We've had a customer test a backported version of this patch and
the preliminary results seem good.

tracing: Fix returning of duplicate data after EOF in trace\_pipe\_raw
commit 436fc280261dcfce5af38f08b89287750dc91cd2 upstream.
The trace\_pipe\_raw handler holds a cached page from the time the file
is opened to the time it is closed. The cached page is used to handle
the case of the user space buffer being smaller than what was read from
the ring buffer. The left over buffer is held in the cache so that the
next read will continue where the data left off.
After EOF is returned (no more data in the buffer), the index of
the cached page is set to zero. If a user app reads the page again
after EOF, the check in the buffer will see that the cached page
is less than page size and will return the cached page again. This
will cause reading the trace\_pipe\_raw again after EOF to return
duplicate data, making the output look like the time went backwards
but instead data is just repeated.
The fix is to not reset the index right after all data is read
from the cache, but to reset it after all data is read and more
data exists in the ring buffer.

md/raid5: fix bug that could result in reads from a failed device.
commit 355840e7a7e56bb2834fd3b0da64da5465f8aeaa upstream.
This bug was introduced in 415e72d034c50520ddb7ff79e7d1792c1306f0c9
which was in 2.6.36.
There is a small window of time between when a device fails and when
it is removed from the array. During this time we might still read
from it, but we won't write to it - so it is possible that we could
read stale data.
We didn't need the test of 'Faulty' before because the test on
In\_sync is sufficient. Since we started allowing reads from the early
part of non-In\_sync devices we need a test on Faulty too.
This is suitable for any kernel from 2.6.36 onwards, though the patch
might need a bit of tweaking in 3.0 and earlier.

net: hold sock reference while processing tx timestamps
commit da92b194cc36b5dc1fbd85206aeeffd80bee0c39 upstream.
The pair of functions,
\* skb\_clone\_tx\_timestamp()
\* skb\_complete\_tx\_timestamp()
were designed to allow timestamping in PHY devices. The first
function, called during the MAC driver's hard\_xmit method, identifies
PTP protocol packets, clones them, and gives them to the PHY device
driver. The PHY driver may hold onto the packet and deliver it at a
later time using the second function, which adds the packet to the
socket's error queue.
As pointed out by Johannes, nothing prevents the socket from
disappearing while the cloned packet is sitting in the PHY driver
awaiting a timestamp. This patch fixes the issue by taking a reference
on the socket for each such packet. In addition, the comments
regarding the usage of these function are expanded to highlight the
rule that PHY drivers must use skb\_complete\_tx\_timestamp() to release
the packet, in order to release the socket reference, too.
These functions first appeared in v2.6.36.

we no longer send a netlink message when a networking device is moved

Since all network devices that are processed by dev\_change\_net\_namspaces are

However, the current test in nfs\_commit\_unstable\_pages does not handle
the edge condition properly. When ncommit == 0, then that means that the
kernel doesn't need to do anything more for the inode. The current test
though in the WB\_SYNC\_NONE case will return true, and the inode will end
up being marked dirty. Once that happens the inode will never be clean
until there's a WB\_SYNC\_ALL flush.
Fix this by immediately returning from nfs\_commit\_unstable\_pages when
ncommit == 0.
Mike noticed this problem initially in RHEL5 (2.6.18-based kernel) which
has a backported version of 420e3646. The inode cache there was growing
very large. The inode cache was unable to be shrunk since the inodes
were all marked dirty. Calling sync() would essentially "fix" the
problem -- the WB\_SYNC\_ALL flush would result in the inodes all being
marked clean.
What I'm not clear on is how big a problem this is in mainline kernels
as the writeback code there is very different. Either way, it seems
incorrect to re-mark the inode dirty in this case.

Revert "NFS: Ensure that writeback\_single\_inode() calls write\_inode() when syncing"
commit 59b7c05fffba030e5d9e72324691e2f99aa69b79 upstream.
This reverts commit b80c3cb628f0ebc241b02e38dd028969fb8026a2.
The reverted commit was rendered obsolete by a VFS fix: commit
5547e8aac6f71505d621a612de2fca0dd988b439 (writeback: Update dirty flags in
two steps). We now no longer need to worry about writeback\_single\_inode()
missing our marking the inode for COMMIT in 'do\_writepages()' call.
Reverting this patch, fixes a performance regression in which the inode
would continuously get queued to the dirty list, causing the writeback
code to unnecessarily try to send a COMMIT.

platform: samsung\_laptop: fix samsung brightness min/max calculations
commit bee460be8c691c544e84ed678280ace6153104c6 upstream.
The min\_brightness value of the sabi\_config is incorrectly used in brightness
calculations. For the config where min\_brightness = 1 and max\_brightness = 8,
the user visible range should be 0 to 7 with hardware being set in the range
of 1 to 8. What is actually happening is that the user visible range is 0 to
8 with hardware being set in the range of -1 to 7.
This patch fixes the above issue as well as a miscalculation that would occur
in the case of min\_brightness > 1.

caif: Fix BUG() with network namespaces
commit 08613e4626c06ca408fc55071f6aedee36986a87 upstream.
The caif code will register its own pernet\_operations, and then register
a netdevice\_notifier. Each time the netdevice\_notifier is triggered,
it'll do some stuff... including a lookup of its own pernet stuff with
net\_generic().
If the net\_generic() call ever returns NULL, the caif code will BUG().
That doesn't seem \*so\* unreasonable, I suppose — it does seem like it
should never happen.
However, it \*does\* happen. When we clone a network namespace,
setup\_net() runs through all the pernet\_operations one at a time. It
gets to loopback before it gets to caif. And loopback\_net\_init()
registers a netdevice... while caif hasn't been initialised. So the caif
netdevice notifier triggers, and immediately goes BUG().
We could imagine a complex and overengineered solution to this generic
class of problems, but this patch takes the simple approach. It just
makes caif\_device\_notify() \*not\* go looking for its pernet data
structures if the device it's being notified about isn't a caif device
in the first place.

With Xen changeset 23428 "libxl: Add 'e820\_host' option to config file"
the E820 as seen from the host can now be passed into the guest.
This means that a PV guest can now:
- Use the correct PCI I/O gap. Before these patches, Linux guest would
boot up and would tell:
[ 0.000000] Allocating PCI resources starting at 40000000 (gap: 40000000:c0000000)
while in actuality the PCI I/O gap should have been:
[ 0.000000] Allocating PCI resources starting at b0000000 (gap: b0000000:4c000000)
- The PV domain with PCI devices was limited to 3GB. It now can be booted
with 4GB, 8GB, or whatever number you want. The PCI devices will now \_not\_ conflict
with System RAM. Meaning the drivers can load.

ath9k: disable unnecessary PHY error reporting
commit ac06697c79bad09e44a8b1d52104014016fb90de upstream.
PHY errors relevant for ANI are always tracked by hardware counters, the
bits that allow them to pass through the rx filter are independent of that.
Enabling PHY errors in the rx filter often creates lots of useless DMA traffic
and might be responsible for some of the rx dma stop failure warnings.

commit 6321eb0977b011ac61dfca36e7c69b2c4325b104 upstream.
this patch fixes the assumption of maximum number of GPIO pins present
in AR9287/AR9300. this fix is essential as we might encounter some
functionality issues involved in accessing the status of GPIO pins which
are all incorrectly assumed to be not within the range of max\_num\_gpio

commit e9c10469cf3c71bc1c6b0f01319161e277d6ac9b upstream.
Do the magnitude/phase coeff correction only if the outlier
is detected. Updating wrong magnitude/phase coeff factor
impacts not only tx gain setting but also leads to poor
performance in congested networks. In the clear environment
the impact is very minimal because the outlier happens
very rarely according to the past experiment. It occured
less than once every 1000 calibrations.

commit 2394d67e446bf616a0885167d5f0d397bdacfdfc upstream.
The new runtime PM code has shown that many webcams suffer
from a race condition that may crash them upon resume.
Runtime PM is especially prone to show the problem because
it retains power to the cameras at all times. However
system suspension may also crash the devices and retain
power to the devices.
The only way to solve this problem without races is in
usbcore with the RESET\_RESUME quirk.

commit a8b43c00ef06aec49b9fe0a5bad8a6a320e4d27b upstream.
At least some OHCI hardware (such as the MCP89) fails to flag any change
in the host status register or the port status registers when receiving
a remote wakeup while in D3 state. This results in the controller being
resumed but no device state change being noticed, at which point the
controller is put back to sleep again. Since there doesn't seem to be any
reliable way to identify the state change, just unconditionally resume the
hub. It'll be put back to sleep in the near future anyway if there are no
active devices attached to it.

Turning off the blink\_timer unconditionally before starting to blink
make sure that a sequence like:
OFF

epoll: fix spurious lockdep warnings
commit d8805e633e054c816c47cb6e727c81f156d9253d upstream.
epoll can acquire recursively acquire ep->mtx on multiple "struct
eventpoll"s at once in the case where one epoll fd is monitoring another
epoll fd. This is perfectly OK, since we're careful about the lock
ordering, but it causes spurious lockdep warnings. Annotate the recursion
using mutex\_lock\_nested, and add a comment explaining the nesting rules
for good measure.
Recent versions of systemd are triggering this, and it can also be
demonstrated with the following trivial test program:
--------------------8<--------------------
int main(void) {
int e1, e2;
struct epoll\_event evt = {
.events = EPOLLIN
};
e1 = epoll\_create1(0);
e2 = epoll\_create1(0);
epoll\_ctl(e1, EPOLL\_CTL\_ADD, e2, &evt);
return 0;
}

x86: Fix compilation bug in kprobes' twobyte\_is\_boostable
commit 315eb8a2a1b7f335d40ceeeb11b9e067475eb881 upstream.
When compiling an i386\_defconfig kernel with gcc-4.6.1-9.fc15.i686, I
noticed a warning about the asm operand for test\_bit in kprobes'
can\_boost. I discovered that this caused only the first long of
twobyte\_is\_boostable[] to be output.
Jakub filed and fixed gcc PR50571 to correct the warning and this output
issue. But to solve it for less current gcc, we can make kprobes'
twobyte\_is\_boostable[] non-const, and it won't be optimized out.

x86: uv2: Workaround for UV2 Hub bug (system global address format)
commit 6a469e4665bc158599de55d64388861d0a9f10f4 upstream.
This is a workaround for a UV2 hub bug that affects the format of system
global addresses.
The GRU API for UV2 was inadvertently broken by a hardware change. The
format of the physical address used for TLB dropins and for addresses used
with instructions running in unmapped mode has changed. This change was
not documented and became apparent only when diags failed running on
system simulators.
For UV1, TLB and GRU instruction physical addresses are identical to
socket physical addresses (although high NASID bits must be OR'ed into the
address).
For UV2, socket physical addresses need to be converted. The NODE portion
of the physical address needs to be shifted so that the low bit is in bit
39 or bit 40, depending on an MMR value.
It is not yet clear if this bug will be fixed in a silicon respin. If it
is fixed, the hub revision will be incremented & the workaround disabled.

target: Fix REPORT TARGET PORT GROUPS handling with small allocation length
commit 6b20fa9aaf0c2f69ee6f9648e20ab2be0206705e upstream.
This patch fixes a bug with the handling of REPORT TARGET PORT GROUPS
containing a smaller allocation length than the payload requires causing
memory writes beyond the end of the buffer. This patch checks for the
minimum 4 byte length for the response payload length, and also checks
upon each loop of T10\_ALUA(su\_dev)->tg\_pt\_gps\_list to ensure the Target
port group and Target port descriptor list is able to fit into the
remaining allocation length.
If the response payload exceeds the allocation length length, then rd\_len
is still increments to indicate to the initiator that the payload has
been truncated.

This patch addresses a bug with the lio-core-2.6.git conversion of

of individual struct se\_queue\_req allocations allowing a single se\_cmd to
be added to the queue mulitple times. This was changed in the following:

target: Embed qr in struct se\_cmd
The problem is that some target code still assumes performing multiple
adds is allowed via transport\_add\_cmd\_to\_queue(), which ends up causing
list corruption in qobj->qobj\_list code. This patch addresses this
by removing an existing struct se\_cmd from the list before the add, and
removes an unnecessary list walk in transport\_remove\_cmd\_from\_queue()
It also changes cmd->t\_transport\_queue\_active to use explict sets intead
of increment/decrement to prevent confusion during exception path handling.

ALSA: hda - Keep EAPD turned on for old Conexant chips
commit 254f296840b64b034a4c850d45dbde7c040f0819 upstream.
In the old Conexant chips (5045, 5047, 5051 and 5066), a single EAPD
may handle both headphone and speaker outputs while it's assigned only
to one of them. Turning off dynamically leads to the unexpected silent
output in such a configuration with the auto-mute function.
Since it's difficult to know how the EAPD is handled in the actual h/w
implementation, better to keep EAPD on while running for such codecs.

ipr: Always initiate hard reset in kdump kernel
commit 5d7c20b7fa5c6ca19e871b4050e321c99d32bd43 upstream.
During kdump testing I noticed timeouts when initialising each IPR
adapter. While the driver has logic to detect an adapter in an
indeterminate state, it wasn't triggering and each adapter went
through a 5 minute timeout before finally going operational.
Some analysis showed the needs\_hard\_reset flag wasn't getting set.
We can check the reset\_devices kernel parameter which is set by
kdump and force a full reset. This fixes the problem.

The following patch for megaraid\_sas will fix a potential bad pointer access

PCI quirk: mmc: Always check for lower base frequency quirk for Ricoh 1180:e823
commit 3e309cdf07c930f29a4e0f233e47d399bea34c68 upstream.
Commit 15bed0f2f added a quirk for the e823 Ricoh card reader to lower the
base frequency. However, the quirk first checks to see if the proprietary
MMC controller is disabled, and returns if so. On some devices, such as the
Lenovo X220, the MMC controller is already disabled by firmware it seems,
but the frequency change is still needed so sdhci-pci can talk to the cards.
Since the MMC controller is disabled, the frequency fixup was never being run
on these machines.
This moves the e823 check above the MMC controller check so that it always
gets run.

mmc: core: Fix hangs related to insert/remove of cards
commit 7f7e4129c23f0419257184dff6fec89d2d5a8964 upstream.
During a rescan operation mmc\_attach(sd|mmc|sdio) functions are
called. The error handling in these function can trigger a detach
of the bus, which also meant a power off. This is not notified by
the rescan operation which then continues to the next attach function.
If a power off has been done, the framework must never send any
new commands to the host driver, without first doing a new power up.
This will most likely trigger any host driver to hang.
Moving power off out of detach and instead handle power off
separately when it is actually needed, solves the issue.

drm/i915/panel: Always record the backlight level again (but cleverly)
commit f52c619a590fa75276c07dfcaf380dee53e4ea4c upstream.
The commit 47356eb67285014527a5ab87543ba1fae3d1e10a introduced a
mechanism to record the backlight level only at disabling time, but it
also introduced a regression. Since intel\_lvds\_enable() may be called
without disabling (e.g. intel\_lvds\_commit() calls it unconditionally),
the backlight gets back to the last recorded value. For example, this
happens when you dim the backlight, close the lid and open the lid,
then the backlight suddenly goes to the brightest.
This patch fixes the bug by recording the backlight level always
when changed via intel\_panel\_set\_backlight(). And,
intel\_panel\_{enable|disable}\_backlight() call the internal function not
to update the recorded level wrongly.

xHCI: AMD isoc link TRB chain bit quirk
commit 7e393a834b41001174a8fb3ae3bc23a749467760 upstream.
Setting the chain (CH) bit in the link TRB of isochronous transfer rings
is required by AMD 0.96 xHCI host controller to successfully transverse
multi-TRB TD that span through different memory segments.
When a Missed Service Error event occurs, if the chain bit is not set in
the link TRB and the host skips TDs which just across a link TRB, the
host may falsely recognize the link TRB as a normal TRB. You can see
this may cause big trouble - the host does not jump to the right address
which is pointed by the link TRB, but continue fetching the memory which
is after the link TRB address, which may not even belong to the host,
and the result cannot be predicted.
This causes some big problems. Without the former patch I sent: "xHCI:
prevent infinite loop when processing MSE event", the system may hang.
With that patch applied, system does not hang, but the host still access
wrong memory address and isoc transfer will fail. With this patch,
isochronous transfer works as expected.
This patch should be applied to kernels as old as 2.6.36, which was when
the first isochronous support was added for the xHCI host controller.

EHCI: workaround for MosChip controller bug
commit 68aa95d5d4de31c9348c1628ffa85c805305ebc5 upstream.
This patch (as1489) works around a hardware bug in MosChip EHCI
controllers. Evidently when one of these controllers increments the
frame-index register, it changes the three low-order bits (the
microframe counter) before changing the higher order bits (the frame
counter). If the register is read at just the wrong time, the value
obtained is too low by 8.
When the appropriate quirk flag is set, we work around this problem by
reading the frame-index register a second time if the first value's
three low-order bits are all 0. This gives the hardware a chance to
finish updating the register, yielding the correct value.

serial-core: power up uart port early before we do set\_termios when resuming
commit 94abc56f4d90f289ea32a0a11d3577fcd8cb28fb upstream.
The following patch removed uart\_change\_pm() in uart\_resume\_port():

serial-core: reset the console speed on resume
It will break the pxa serial driver when the system resumes from suspend mode
as it will try to set baud rate divider register in set\_termios but with
clock off. The register value can not be set correctly on some platform if
the clock is disabled. The pxa driver will check the value and report the
following warning:

commit c4b6a2eaf1c14810a4803d658f68614365978738 upstream.
netif\_notify\_peers() caused a kernel warning in netvsc\_linkstatus\_callback(),
because netvsc\_linkstatus\_callback() is within IRQ context. So we move
the first call to netif\_notify\_peers() into queued work as well, but with
zero delay.
In addition to "staging-next", this should also be back-ported to stable
kernels 2.6.32 and later.

staging: quatech\_usb2: Potential lost wakeup scenario in TIOCMIWAIT
commit e8df1674d383d2ecc6efa8d7dba74c03aafdfdd7 upstream.
If the usermode app does an ioctl over this serial device by
using TIOCMIWAIT, then the code will wait by setting the current
task state to TASK\_INTERRUPTIBLE and then calling schedule().
This will be woken up by the qt2\_process\_modem\_status on URB
completion when the port\_extra->shadowMSR is set to the new
modem status.
However, this could result in a lost wakeup scenario due to a race
in the logic in the qt2\_ioctl(TIOCMIWAIT) loop and the URB completion
for new modem status in qt2\_process\_modem\_status.
Due to this, the usermode app's task will continue to sleep despite a
change in the modem status.

USB: for usb\_autopm\_get\_interface\_async -EINPROGRESS is not an error
commit c5a48592d874ddef8c7880311581eccf0eb30c3b upstream.
A return value of -EINPROGRESS from pm\_runtime\_get indicates that
the device is already resuming due to a previous call. Internally,
usb\_autopm\_get\_interface\_async doesn't treat this as an error and
increments the usage count, but passes the error status along
to the caller. The logical assumption of the caller is that
any negative return value reflects the device not resuming
and the pm\_usage\_cnt not being incremented. Since the usage count
is being incremented and the device is resuming, return success (0)
instead.

commit 1177c0efc04d032644895b8d757f55b433912596 upstream.
Mistakenly, commit 64ba3dc3143d (tty: never hold BTM while getting
tty\_mutex) switched one fail path in ptmx\_open to not free the newly
allocated tty.
Fix that by jumping to the appropriate place. And rename the labels so
that it's clear what is going on there.

TTY: make tty\_add\_file non-failing
commit fa90e1c935472281de314e6d7c9a37db9cbc2e4e upstream.
If tty\_add\_file fails at the point it is now, we have to revert all
the changes we did to the tty. It means either decrease all refcounts
if this was a tty reopen or delete the tty if it was newly allocated.
There was a try to fix this in v3.0-rc2 using tty\_release in 0259894c7
(TTY: fix fail path in tty\_open). But instead it introduced a NULL
dereference. It's because tty\_release dereferences
filp->private\_data, but that one is set even in our tty\_add\_file. And
when tty\_add\_file fails, it's still NULL/garbage. Hence tty\_release
cannot be called there.
To circumvent the original leak (and the current NULL deref) we split
tty\_add\_file into two functions, making the latter non-failing. In
that case we may do the former early in open, where handling failures
is easy. The latter stays as it is now. So there is no change in
functionality.
The original bug (leak) was introduced by f573bd176 (tty: Remove
\_\_GFP\_NOFAIL from tty\_add\_file()). Thanks Dan for reporting this.
Later, we may split tty\_release into more functions and call only some
of them in this fail path instead. (If at all possible.)

TTY: drop driver reference in tty\_open fail path
commit c290f8358acaeffd8e0c551ddcc24d1206143376 upstream.
When tty\_driver\_lookup\_tty fails in tty\_open, we forget to drop a
reference to the tty driver. This was added by commit 4a2b5fddd5 (Move
tty lookup/reopen to caller).
Fix that by adding tty\_driver\_kref\_put to the fail path.
I will refactor the code later. This is for the ease of backporting to
stable.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1203712#c0)  Vasyl Kaigorodov    2015-03-19 14:03:03 UTC  ``` Linux kernel built with the IPv6 networking support(CONFIG_IPV6) is vulnerable to setting its 'hop_limit' too low, via the neighbour discovery protocol. It could result in thwarting the IPv6 functionality.  An unprivileged user on a local network could use this flaw to cause DoS to a remote system.  Upstream fix: -------------   -> <https://git.kernel.org/linus/6fd99094de2b83d1d4c8457f2c83483b2828e75a>  Reference: ----------   -> <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/04/04/2>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1203712#c1)  Vasyl Kaigorodov    2015-03-19 14:17:22 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1003851](attachment.cgi?id=1003851 "linux-3.18-ipv6-hop_limit.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1003851&action=edit "linux-3.18-ipv6-hop_limit.patch") linux-3.18-ipv6-hop_limit.patch   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1203712#c2)  Vasyl Kaigorodov    2015-03-19 14:19:15 UTC  ``` In the attachment there is a patch for the Linux kernel that fixes this issue.  Other suggested mitigations: * Disallowing Router Advertisements on a Switch level (RA filtering) * Dropping Router Advertisements that do not contain a network/route * Dropping Router Advertisements with short hop limits (hop limit < 40 or similar)  Other interesting combinations is to send "route removal" packet (timeout = 0 )  in combination. Reported found that it isn't necessary, but most code paths will then delete the route if it finds it, even if it's not getting the "drop route" message from the host that advertised the route.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1203712#c3)  Prasad Pandit    2015-04-02 11:36:44 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue affects the versions of the Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, 7 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.

TTY: drop driver reference in tty\_open fail pathWhen tty\_driver\_lookup\_tty fails in tty\_open, we forget to drop a
reference to the tty driver. This was added by commit 4a2b5fddd5 (Move
tty lookup/reopen to caller).
Fix that by adding tty\_driver\_kref\_put to the fail path.
I will refactor the code later. This is for the ease of backporting to
stable.

# RHSA-2015:1221 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Moderate: kernel security, bug fix, and enhancement update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2015%3A1221)

## Topic

Updated kernel packages that fix multiple security issues, several bugs,
and add one enhancement are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

* A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's

virtual console implementation handled reference counting when accessing
pseudo-terminal device files (/dev/pts/\*). A local, unprivileged attacker
could use this flaw to crash the system. (CVE-2011-5321, Moderate)

* It was found that the Linux kernel's ping socket implementation did not

properly handle socket unhashing during spurious disconnects, which could
lead to a use-after-free flaw. On x86-64 architecture systems, a local user
able to create ping sockets could use this flaw to crash the system.
On non-x86-64 architecture systems, a local user able to create ping
sockets could use this flaw to escalate their privileges on the system.
(CVE-2015-3636, Moderate)

* An integer overflow flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel randomized

the stack for processes on certain 64-bit architecture systems, such as
x86-64, causing the stack entropy to be reduced by four. (CVE-2015-1593,
Low)

* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's 32-bit emulation

implementation handled forking or closing of a task with an 'int80' entry.
A local user could potentially use this flaw to escalate their privileges
on the system. (CVE-2015-2830, Low)

* It was found that the Linux kernel's TCP/IP protocol suite implementation

for IPv6 allowed the Hop Limit value to be set to a smaller value than the
default one. An attacker on a local network could use this flaw to prevent
