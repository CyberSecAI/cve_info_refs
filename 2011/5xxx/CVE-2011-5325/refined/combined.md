Debian Bug     : 902724 882258 879732 818497 818499 803097 802702

Busybox, utility programs for small and embedded systems, was affected
by several security vulnerabilities. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following issues.

CVE-2011-5325

    A path traversal vulnerability was found in Busybox implementation
    of tar. tar will extract a symlink that points outside of the
    current working directory and then follow that symlink when
    extracting other files. This allows for a directory traversal
    attack when extracting untrusted tarballs.

CVE-2013-1813

    When device node or symlink in /dev should be created inside
    2-or-deeper subdirectory (/dev/dir1/dir2.../node), the intermediate
    directories are created with incorrect permissions.

CVE-2014-4607

    An integer overflow may occur when processing any variant of a
   "literal run" in the lzo1x_decompress_safe function. Each of these
    three locations is subject to an integer overflow when processing
    zero bytes. This exposes the code that copies literals to memory
    corruption.

CVE-2014-9645

    The add_probe function in modutils/modprobe.c in BusyBox allows
    local users to bypass intended restrictions on loading kernel
    modules via a / (slash) character in a module name, as demonstrated
    by an "ifconfig /usbserial up" command or a "mount -t /snd_pcm none
    /" command.

CVE-2016-2147

    Integer overflow in the DHCP client (udhcpc) in BusyBox allows
    remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a
    malformed RFC1035-encoded domain name, which triggers an
    out-of-bounds heap write.

CVE-2016-2148

    Heap-based buffer overflow in the DHCP client (udhcpc) in BusyBox
    allows remote attackers to have unspecified impact via vectors
    involving OPTION_6RD parsing.

CVE-2017-15873

    The get_next_block function in archival/libarchive
    /decompress_bunzip2.c in BusyBox has an Integer Overflow that may
    lead to a write access violation.

CVE-2017-16544

    In the add_match function in libbb/lineedit.c in BusyBox, the tab
    autocomplete feature of the shell, used to get a list of filenames
    in a directory, does not sanitize filenames and results in executing
    any escape sequence in the terminal. This could potentially result
    in code execution, arbitrary file writes, or other attacks.

CVE-2018-1000517

    BusyBox contains a Buffer Overflow vulnerability in
    Busybox wget that can result in a heap-based buffer overflow.
    This attack appears to be exploitable via network connectivity.

CVE-2015-9621

    Unziping a specially crafted zip file results in a computation of an
    invalid pointer and a crash reading an invalid address.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
1:1.22.0-9+deb8u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your busybox packages.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1274215#c0)  Adam Mariš    2015-10-22 09:40:29 UTC  ``` A path traversal vulnerability was found in Busybox implementation of tar. tar will extract a symlink that points outside of the current working directory and then follow that symlink when extracting other files. This allows for a directory traversal attack when extracting untrusted tarballs.  Reproducer:  <http://git.busybox.net/busybox/commit/?id=a116552869db5e7793ae10968eb3c962c69b3d8c>  CVE assignment:  <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q4/121>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1274215#c1)  Adam Mariš    2015-10-22 10:06:07 UTC  ```  Created busybox tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1274227](show_bug.cgi?id=1274227 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2011-5325 busybox: Path traversal via crafted tar file containing symlink [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1274215#c2)  Martin Prpič    2015-10-23 07:07:36 UTC  ``` Upstream bug:  <https://bugs.busybox.net/8411>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1274215#c3)  Tomas Hoger    2015-12-01 11:39:46 UTC  ``` The busybox packages are shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and earlier.  However, they have a rather narrow use case that does not expose this flaw.  Even when busybox packages are installed, there's no 'tar' symlinks created for user to accidentally use busybox version instead of the one provided by the tar packages.  Users would have to explicitly execute "busybox tar" to use it, or create their own symlink.  Therefore, there's currently no plan to backport a fix for this issue to already released Red Hat Enterprise Linux versions.   ``` |  |

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Hard-coded Administrator Password
The hard-coded administrator password was found in the ZTE mobile hotspot
MS910S firmware version "CN_EUV1.00.01", which is available at.
<http://devicedownload.zte.com.cn/support/product/201701161506340/soft/20170116151106465.zip>

2) Known BusyBox Vulnerabilities
The used BusyBox toolkit in version 1.15.0 is outdated and contains multiple
known vulnerabilities. The outdated version was found by IoT Inspector.
One of the discovered vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-16544) was verified by using
the MEDUSA scalable firmware run-time.

3) Known Backdoor in GoAhead Webserver
An unusual "telnetd" port was identified on an emulated device which led to the
assumption that a backdoor can be opened via the GoAhead web-server.
This conclusion was done because of a blog post from another researcher:
<http://blog.asiantuntijakaveri.fi/2017/03/backdoor-and-root-shell-on-zte-mf286.html>

By partially reverse engineering the binaries of the GoAhead webserver, the
functionality described in the corresponding blog post can be underpinned.

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Hard-coded Administrator Password
The firmware file (ZTE_MF910SV1.0.1B09.bin) is using the JFFS2 filesystem which
was extracted. The hardcoded password can be found in the /etc/shadow file
within the firmware:

/_DL_MF910S_CN_EUV1.00.01.exe.extracted/Data/version/_ZTE_MF910SV1.0.1B09.bin.extracted/jffs2-root/fs_1/etc/shadow

The file content is shown below:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
root:$1$$zdlNHiCDxYDfeF4MZL.H3/:10933:0:99999:7:::
Admin:$1$$zdlNHiCDxYDfeF4MZL.H3/:10933:0:99999:7:::
bin::10933:0:99999:7:::
daemon::10933:0:99999:7:::
adm::10933:0:99999:7:::
lp:*:10933:0:99999:7:::
sync:*:10933:0:99999:7:::
shutdown:*:10933:0:99999:7:::
halt:*:10933:0:99999:7:::
uucp:*:10933:0:99999:7:::
operator:*:10933:0:99999:7:::
nobody::10933:0:99999:7:::
ap71::10933:0:99999:7:::
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Both the user "root" and "admin" are using the same weak hardcoded password
"5up".

2) Known BusyBox Vulnerabilities
BusyBox version 1.12.0 contains multiple CVEs like:
CVE-2013-1813, CVE-2016-2148, CVE-2016-6301, CVE-2011-2716, CVE-2011-5325,
CVE-2015-9261, CVE-2016-2147 and more.

The BusyBox shell autocompletion vulnerability (CVE-2017-16544) was verified on
an emulated device. A file with the name "\ectest\n\e]55;test.txt\a" was crea-
ted to trigger the vulnerability.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ls "pressing <TAB>"
test
]55;test.txt
#
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3) Known Backdoor in GoAhead Webserver
Starting the telnet daemon on the emulated device leads to a listener on a very
unusual port:
[...]
# telnetd
#netstat -tulen
Active Internet connections (only servers)
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:4719            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN
[...]

Because this seems to be not configured on the system by any file, the BusyBox
binary was inspected.

The pseudocode snippet of BusyBox' telnetd function that was generated by Hex-
Rays ARM Decompiler, indicated that this port was hard-coded:
<snip>
dword_788DC = (int)"/bin/login";
  dword_788E0 = (int)"/etc/issue.net";
  v3 = sub_5DBFC(a2, "f:l:Kip:b:F", &dword_788E0, &dword_788DC, &v76, &v75);
  v4 = v3 & 8;
  v5 = v3;
  if ( !(v3 & 8) && !(v3 & 0x40) )
    sub_64A10(v3 & 8);
  if ( (v5 & 0x48) != 64 )
  {
    openlog((const char *)dword_798DC, 1, 24);
    dword_78630 = 2;
  }
  if ( v5 & 0x10 )
    v6 = sub_64FF8(v76);
  else
    v6 = 4719; <------------------------------------- Port "4719"
  if ( !v4 )
  {
    v2 = sub_65578(v75, v6);
    sub_E394(v2, 1);
    sub_D9B0(v2);
    goto LABEL_13;
  }
  dword_788D8 = (int)sub_1C480(0);
  if ( dword_788D8 )
  {
<snip>

This led to the assumption that the GoAhead webserver was modified like
described in the following blog post:
<http://blog.asiantuntijakaveri.fi/2017/03/backdoor-and-root-shell-on-zte-mf286.html>

Inspecting the GoAhead webserver binary reinforces this assumption. The
pseudocode was generated with Hex-Rays ARM Decompiler, like for the prior
BusyBox binary:
<snip>
int __fastcall sub_21D48(int a1)
{
  int v1; // r5
  const char *v2; // r4

  v1 = a1;
  cfg_get("debug_level");
  v2 = (const char *)sub_17DF0(v1, "change_mode", "");
  cfg_set("login_9527", "1");
  if ( !strcmp("1", v2) )
  {
    cfg_set("change_mode", "1");
    cfg_get("debug_level");
    system("mode_change 1");
  }
  else if ( !strcmp("2", v2) ) <--- change mode "2"
  {
    cfg_get("debug_level");
    system("telnetd &"); <--------- telnet daemon started
  }
  else if ( !strcmp("3", v2) )
  {
    cfg_get("debug_level");
    system("rem_start.sh &");
  }
  else if ( !strcmp("4", v2) )
  {
    cfg_get("debug_level");
    system("rem_kill.sh &");
  }
  else
  {
    cfg_set("change_mode", "0");
    cfg_get("debug_level");
    system("mode_change 0");
  }
  return sub_34374(v1, "success");
}
<snip>

Other scripts could also be started via the webserver, like "rem_start.sh".
This script contains the following lines:

#!/bin/sh
if ps|grep remserial
then
echo "remserial is running.."
else
remserial -p 10005 -r 192.168.1.10 -s "115200 raw" /dev/ttyUSB0 &
fi

That means, that a serial console with the speed of 115200 Baud on port 10005
is started.

## Binary packages built by this source

[busybox](/ubuntu/trusty/%2Bpackage/busybox):
Tiny utilities for small and embedded systems

BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a single

 small executable. It provides minimalist replacements for the most common

 utilities you would usually find on your desktop system (i.e., ls, cp, mv,

 mount, tar, etc.). The utilities in BusyBox generally have fewer options than

 their full-featured GNU cousins; however, the options that are included

 provide the expected functionality and behave very much like their GNU

 counterparts.

 .

 This package installs the BusyBox binary but does not install

 symlinks for any of the supported utilities. Some of the utilities

 can be used in the system by installing the busybox-syslogd,

 busybox-udhcpc or busybox-udhcpd packages.

[busybox-dbgsym](/ubuntu/trusty/%2Bpackage/busybox-dbgsym):
debug symbols for package busybox

[busybox-initramfs](/ubuntu/trusty/%2Bpackage/busybox-initramfs):
Standalone shell setup for initramfs

BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a single

 small executable. It provides minimalist replacements for the most common

 utilities you would usually find on your desktop system (i.e., ls, cp, mv,

 .

 busybox-initramfs provides a simple stand alone shell that provides

 only the basic utilities needed for the initramfs.

[busybox-static](/ubuntu/trusty/%2Bpackage/busybox-static):
Standalone rescue shell with tons of builtin utilities

BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a single

 small executable. It provides minimalist replacements for the most common

 utilities you would usually find on your desktop system (i.e., ls, cp, mv,

 mount, tar, etc.). The utilities in BusyBox generally have fewer options than

 their full-featured GNU cousins; however, the options that are included

 provide the expected functionality and behave very much like their GNU

 counterparts.

 .

 busybox-static provides you with a statically linked simple stand alone shell

 that provides all the utilities available in BusyBox. This package is

 intended to be used as a rescue shell, in the event that you screw up your

 system. Invoke "busybox sh" and you have a standalone shell ready to save

 your system from certain destruction. Invoke "busybox", and it will list the

 available builtin commands.

 mount, tar, etc.). The utilities in BusyBox generally have fewer options than

 their full-featured GNU cousins; however, the options that are included

 provide the expected functionality and behave very much like their GNU

 counterparts.

 .

 busybox-static provides you with a statically linked simple stand alone shell

 that provides all the utilities available in BusyBox. This package is

 intended to be used as a rescue shell, in the event that you screw up your

 system. Invoke "busybox sh" and you have a standalone shell ready to save

 your system from certain destruction. Invoke "busybox", and it will list the

 available builtin commands.

[busybox-syslogd](/ubuntu/trusty/%2Bpackage/busybox-syslogd):
Provides syslogd and klogd using busybox

The system log daemon is responsible for providing logging of

 messages received from programs and facilities on the local host as

 well as from remote hosts.

 .

 The kernel log daemon listens to kernel message sources and is

 responsible for prioritizing and processing operating system

 messages.

 .

 The busybox implementation of the syslogd is particular useful on

 embedded, diskless (netboot) or flash disk based systems because it

 can use a fixed size ring buffer for logging instead of saving logs

 to the disk or sending it to remote logging servers. The ring buffer

 can be read using the (also busybox based) command logread.

 .

 This package provides the glue to the busybox syslogd and klogd to be

 used in the system by providing the appropriate symbolic links and

 scripts.

[busybox-udeb](/ubuntu/trusty/%2Bpackage/busybox-udeb):
Tiny utilities for the debian-installer

BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a single

 small executable. It provides minimalist replacements for the most common

 utilities you would usually find on your desktop system (i.e., ls, cp, mv,

 mount, tar, etc.). The utilities in BusyBox generally have fewer options than

 their full-featured GNU cousins; however, the options that are included

 provide the expected functionality and behave very much like their GNU

 counterparts.

 .

 busybox-udeb is used by the debian-installer, so unless you are working on

 the debian-installer, this package is not for you. Installing this

 on your Debian system is a very, very bad idea. You have been warned.

[busybox-udeb-dbgsym](/ubuntu/trusty/%2Bpackage/busybox-udeb-dbgsym):
debug symbols for package busybox-udeb

BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a single

 small executable. It provides minimalist replacements for the most common

 utilities you would usually find on your desktop system (i.e., ls, cp, mv,

 mount, tar, etc.). The utilities in BusyBox generally have fewer options than

 their full-featured GNU cousins; however, the options that are included

 provide the expected functionality and behave very much like their GNU

 counterparts.

 .

 busybox-udeb is used by the debian-installer, so unless you are working on

 the debian-installer, this package is not for you. Installing this

 on your Debian system is a very, very bad idea. You have been warned.

[udhcpc](/ubuntu/trusty/%2Bpackage/udhcpc):
Provides the busybox DHCP client implementation

Busybox contains a very small yet fully function RFC compliant DHCP

 client formerly known as udhcpc.

 .

 This package contains the glue to use the busybox udhcpc as DHCP

 client in the system by providing the appropriate symbolic links and

 scripts.

[udhcpd](/ubuntu/trusty/%2Bpackage/udhcpd):
Provides the busybox DHCP server implementation

Busybox contains a very small yet fully function RFC compliant DHCP

 server formerly known as udhcpd.

 .

 This package contains the glue to use the busybox udhcpd as DHCP

 server in the system by providing the appropriate symbolic links and

 scripts.

Source: <http://www.wago.us/wago/>

Business recommendation:
------------------------
SEC Consult recommends to immediately apply the available patches
from the vendor. A thorough security review should be performed by
security professionals to identify further potential security issues.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
The industrial managed switch series 852 from WAGO is affected by multiple
vulnerabilities such as old software components embedded in the firmware.
Furthermore, hardcoded password hashes and credentials were also found by doing
an automated scan with IoT Inspector. Two vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-16544 and
CVE-2015-0235) were verified by emulating the device with the MEDUSA scaleable
firmware runtime. The validity of the password hashes and the embedded keys were
also verified by emulating the device.

1) Known BusyBox Vulnerabilities
The used BusyBox toolkit in version 1.12.0 is outdated and contains multiple
known vulnerabilities. The outdated version was found by IoT Inspector.
One of the discovered vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-16544) was verified by using
the MEDUSA scaleable firmware runtime.

2) Known GNU glibc Vulnerabilities
The used GNU glibc in version 2.8 is outdated and contains multiple known
vulnerabilities. The outdated version was found by IoT Inspector. One of
the discovered vulnerabilities (CVE-2015-0235, "GHOST") was verified by
using the MEDUSA scaleable firmware runtime.

3) Hardcoded Credentials (CVE-2019-12550)
The device contains hardcoded users and passwords which can be used to login
via SSH and Telnet.

4) Embedded Private Keys (CVE-2019-12549)
The device contains hardcoded private keys for the SSH daemon. The fingerprint
of the SSH host key from the corresponding SSH daemon matches to the embedded
private key.

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Known BusyBox Vulnerabilities
BusyBox version 1.12.0 contains multiple CVEs like:
CVE-2013-1813, CVE-2016-2148, CVE-2016-6301, CVE-2011-2716, CVE-2011-5325,
CVE-2015-9261, CVE-2016-2147 and more.

The BusyBox shell autocompletion vulnerability (CVE-2017-16544) was verified on
an emulated device. A file with the name "\ectest\n\e]55;test.txt\a" was created
to trigger the vulnerability.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ls "pressing <TAB>"
test
]55;test.txt
#
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2) Known GNU glibc Vulnerabilities
GNU glibc version 2.8 contains multiple CVEs like:
CVE-2010-0296, CVE-2010-3856, CVE-2012-4412, CVE-2014-4043, CVE-2014-9402,
CVE-2014-9761, CVE-2014-9984, CVE-2015-1472 and more.

The gethostbyname buffer overflow vulnerability (GHOST) was checked with the help
of the exploit code from <https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q1/274>. It was compiled
and executed on the emulated device to test the system.

3) Hardcoded Credentials (CVE-2019-12550)
The following credentials were found in the 'passwd' file of the firmware:
<Password Hash>                                 <Plaintext>         <User>
<removed>                                       <removed>            root
No password is set for the account              [EMPTY PASSWORD]     admin

By using these credentials, it's possible to connect via Telnet and SSH on the
emulated device. Example for Telnet:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[root@localhost ~]# telnet 192.168.0.133
Trying 192.168.0.133...
Connected to 192.168.0.133.
Escape character is '^]'.

L2SWITCH login: root
Password:
~ #
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example for SSH:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[root@localhost ~]# ssh 192.168.0.133
root@192.168.0.133's password:
~ #
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4) Embedded Private Keys (CVE-2019-12549)
The following host key fingerprint is shown by accessing the SSH daemon on
the emulated device:

[root@localhost ~]# ssh 192.168.0.133
The authenticity of host '192.168.0.133 (192.168.0.133)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:X5Vr0/x0/j62N/aqZmHz96ojwl8x/I8mfzuT8o6uZso.
RSA key fingerprint is MD5:2e:65:85:fc:45:04:bd:68:30:74:51:45:7d:2f:95:e2.

This matches the embedded private key (which has been removed from this advisory):
SSH Fingerprint: 2e:65:85:fc:45:04:bd:68:30:74:51:45:7d:2f:95:e2

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Known BusyBox Vulnerabilities
BusyBox version 1.12.0 contains multiple CVEs like:
CVE-2013-1813, CVE-2016-2148, CVE-2016-6301, CVE-2011-2716, CVE-2011-5325,
CVE-2015-9261, CVE-2016-2147 and more.

The BusyBox shell autocompletion vulnerability (CVE-2017-16544) was verified on
an emulated device. A file with the name "\ectest\n\e]55;test.txt\a" was created
to trigger the vulnerability.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ls "pressing <TAB>"
test
]55;test.txt
#
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2) Known GNU glibc Vulnerabilities
GNU glibc version 2.8 contains multiple CVEs like:
CVE-2010-0296, CVE-2010-3856, CVE-2012-4412, CVE-2014-4043, CVE-2014-9402,
CVE-2014-9761, CVE-2014-9984, CVE-2015-1472 and more.

The gethostbyname buffer overflow vulnerability (GHOST) was checked with the help
of the exploit code from <https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q1/274>. It was compiled
and executed on the emulated device to test the system.

3) Hardcoded Credentials (CVE-2019-12550)
The following credentials were found in the 'passwd' file of the firmware:
<Password Hash>                                 <Plaintext>         <User>
<removed>                                       <removed>            root
No password is set for the account              [EMPTY PASSWORD]     admin

By using these credentials, it's possible to connect via Telnet and SSH on the
emulated device. Example for Telnet:

4) Embedded Private Keys (CVE-2019-12549)
The following host key fingerprint is shown by accessing the SSH daemon on
the emulated device:

[root@localhost ~]# ssh 192.168.0.133
The authenticity of host '192.168.0.133 (192.168.0.133)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:X5Vr0/x0/j62N/aqZmHz96ojwl8x/I8mfzuT8o6uZso.
RSA key fingerprint is MD5:2e:65:85:fc:45:04:bd:68:30:74:51:45:7d:2f:95:e2.

This matches the embedded private key (which has been removed from this advisory):
SSH Fingerprint: 2e:65:85:fc:45:04:bd:68:30:74:51:45:7d:2f:95:e2

Vulnerable / tested versions:

2019-05-20: Asking for a status update
2019-05-22: VDE CERT: no news from WAGO yet, 5th June release date
2019-05-29: Asking for a status update
2019-05-29: VDE CERT: detailed answer from WAGO, patches will be published
            on 7th June, SEC Consult proposes new advisory release date for
            12th June
2019-06-07: VDE CERT provides security advisory information from WAGO;
            WAGO releases security patches
2019-06-12: Coordinated release of security advisory

Solution:
---------
The vendor provides patches to their customers at their download page. The
following versions fix the issues:
* 852-303: v1.2.2.S0
* 852-1305: v1.1.6.S0
* 852-1505: v1.1.5.S0

According to the vendor, busybox and glibc have been updated and the embedded
private keys are being newly generated upon first boot and after a factory reset.
The root login via Telnet and SSH has been disabled and the admin account is
documented and can be changed by the customer.

Workaround:
-----------
Restrict network access to the device & SSH server.

Use CVE-2011-5325.

OK, so there's no additional CVE ID.

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

## Details

Tyler Hicks discovered that BusyBox incorrectly handled symlinks inside tar

archives. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a

specially crafted tar archive, a remote attacker could overwrite arbitrary

files outside of the current directory. This issue only affected Ubuntu

14.04 LTS and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. ([CVE-2011-5325](/security/CVE-2011-5325))

Mathias Krause discovered that BusyBox incorrectly handled kernel module

loading restrictions. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to

bypass intended restrictions. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

([CVE-2014-9645](/security/CVE-2014-9645))

It was discovered that BusyBox incorrectly handled certain ZIP archives. If

a user or automated system were tricked into processing a specially crafted

ZIP archive, a remote attacker could cause BusyBox to crash, leading to a

denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Ubuntu

16.04 LTS. ([CVE-2015-9261](/security/CVE-2015-9261))

Nico Golde discovered that the BusyBox DHCP client incorrectly handled

certain malformed domain names. A remote attacker could possibly use this

issue to cause the DHCP client to crash, leading to a denial of service.

This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.

([CVE-2016-2147](/security/CVE-2016-2147))

Nico Golde discovered that the BusyBox DHCP client incorrectly handled

certain 6RD options. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause the

DHCP client to crash, leading to a denial of service, or possibly execute

arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Ubuntu 16.04

LTS. ([CVE-2016-2148](/security/CVE-2016-2148))

It was discovered that BusyBox incorrectly handled certain bzip2 archives.

If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a specially

crafted bzip2 archive, a remote attacker could cause BusyBox to crash,

leading to a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. This

issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. ([CVE-2017-15873](/security/CVE-2017-15873))

It was discovered that BusyBox incorrectly handled tab completion. A local

attacker could possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary code. This

issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. ([CVE-2017-16544](/security/CVE-2017-16544))

It was discovered that the BusyBox wget utility incorrectly handled certain

responses. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause BusyBox to

crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2018-1000517](/security/CVE-2018-1000517))

It was discovered that the BusyBox DHCP utilities incorrectly handled

certain memory operations. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue

to access sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-20679](/security/CVE-2018-20679), [CVE-2019-5747](/security/CVE-2019-5747))

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=8411#c0)  Tyler Hicks    2015-10-20 00:29:11 UTC  ``` It was discovered that busybox's tar implementation will extract a symlink that points outside of the current working directory and follow that symlink when extracting other files. This allows for a directory traversal attack when extracting untrusted tarballs.  This behavior is documented in the source code:    <http://git.busybox.net/busybox/tree/archival/tar.c#n25>  I took a quick look at how GNU tar handles such situations. If the symlink target is absolute or contains a ".." component, they create a regular file as a placeholder. After all other files have been extracted, the placeholder files are replaced with the originally intended symlinks.  (That is also how they handle hardlink extraction but I don't see any support for LNKTYPE files in busybox tar.) ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=8411#c1)  Tyler Hicks    2015-10-21 21:55:41 UTC  ``` CVE-2011-5325 was assigned to this issue:    <http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/10/21/7> ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=8411#c2)  Chris Lamb (lamby)    2015-11-05 16:33:24 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 6191](attachment.cgi?id=6191 "Patch for busybox 1.22.0") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=6191&action=edit "Patch for busybox 1.22.0") Patch for busybox 1.22.0 ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=8411#c3)  Chris Lamb (lamby)    2015-11-05 16:38:56 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 6196](attachment.cgi?id=6196 "Patch for busybox 1.22.0 v2") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=6196&action=edit "Patch for busybox 1.22.0 v2") Patch for busybox 1.22.0 v2  Updated patch attached - I didn't spot I had removed a TODO comment; apologies. ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=8411#c4)  Chris Lamb (lamby)    2015-11-05 16:46:13 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 6201](attachment.cgi?id=6201 "Patch for busybox 1.22.0 v3") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=6201&action=edit "Patch for busybox 1.22.0 v3") Patch for busybox 1.22.0 v3  Matching code style. ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=8411#c5)  Tyler Hicks    2015-11-07 06:06:25 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=8411#c4)) > Created [attachment 6201](attachment.cgi?id=6201 "Patch for busybox 1.22.0 v3") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=6201&action=edit "Patch for busybox 1.22.0 v3") > Patch for busybox 1.22.0 v3 >  > Matching code style.

Something odd happened with the patch that you attached. It is base64 encoded and, while it does contain some changes, does not contain the change to match a lateral ".." sequence. ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=8411#c8)  Chris Lamb (lamby)    2015-11-09 23:29:00 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 6211](attachment.cgi?id=6211 "Patch for busybox 1.22.0 v5") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=6211&action=edit "Patch for busybox 1.22.0 v5") Patch for busybox 1.22.0 v5  That's.. odd.

Good point regarding "..foo". I guess that means that strstr(file_header->link_target, "../") will unintentionally match a target of "foo../bar". ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=8411#c10)  Chris Lamb (lamby)    2015-11-10 00:45:56 UTC  ``` > Good point regarding "..foo".

Although an aside, inadventent matching is "harmless" as it will end up as symlink just as intended.. but via the placeholder mechanism first. :)  Will update patch tomorrow (UTC+0) with a fresh head. ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=8411#c11)  Tyler Hicks    2015-11-10 00:53:13 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=8411#c0)) > I took a quick look at how GNU tar handles such situations.

I was wrong about hardlinks. They're supported in busybox's libarchive and they're also vulnerable. From archival/libarchive/data_extract_all.c:          /* Handle hard links separately          * We encode hard links as regular files of size 0 with a symlink */ ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=8411#c12)  Tyler Hicks    2015-11-10 00:58:19 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 6216](attachment.cgi?id=6216 "Tar file containing two files (abs and rel) encoded as hardlinks of /tmp/foo") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=6216&action=edit "Tar file containing two files (abs and rel) encoded as hardlinks of /tmp/foo") Tar file containing two files (abs and rel) encoded as hardlinks of /tmp/foo  Here's a tar file that includes two files, abs and rel, that are encoded in such a way to match busybox libarchive's encoding of hardlinks (which seems to differ from what GNU tar uses).  Busybox tar will extract the two files and create them as hardlinks of /tmp/foo.  $ rm -f /tmp/foo $ touch /tmp/foo $ stat -c %h /tmp/foo 1 $ busybox tar -xvf hardlink.tar abs rel $ stat -c %h /tmp/foo # should print "1" 3 ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=8411#c13)  Chris Lamb (lamby)    2015-12-15 14:23:04 UTC  ``` Right, let's get this finished.

Closes 8411  However, I'm not sure this is sufficient to stop the attacks, if the target system is careless enough to untar untrusted tarballs. What if attacker supplies two tarballs, one creates a symlink to "/etc", and another has a lone "symlink/passwd" file? Both tarballs are not "malicious" individually. tar program can't know that unpacking second tar is doing a wrong thing!

The change is made smaller by deleting ARCHIVE_EXTRACT_QUIET flag -     it is unused since 2010, and removing conditionals on it     allows commonalizing some error message codes. ``` |  |
