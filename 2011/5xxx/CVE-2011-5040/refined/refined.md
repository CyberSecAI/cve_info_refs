Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2011-5040:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The application, "Infoproject Biznis Heroj", suffers from multiple vulnerabilities due to improper sanitization of user-supplied input. Specifically, input passed through the `filter` parameter in `widget.dokumenti_lista.php` and the `fin_nalog_id` parameter in `nalozi_naslov.php` are not sanitized before being used in SQL queries. Additionally, the `config` parameter in both `nalozi_naslov.php` and `widget.dokumenti_lista.php` is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS).
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **SQL Injection (SQLi):**  The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized input in the `filter` and `fin_nalog_id` parameters.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The `config` parameter is vulnerable to reflected XSS, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** An attacker can manipulate SQL queries, potentially leading to:
        *   Exposure of sensitive data.
        *   Manipulation of application data.
        *   Potential compromise of the database server.
    *  **Cross-Site Scripting:** Successful XSS exploitation enables an attacker to:
        *   Execute arbitrary code in the context of the victim's browser session.
        *   Potentially steal cookies and session tokens.
        *   Redirect victims to malicious websites.
        *   Perform actions on behalf of the victim user.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** Attackers can inject malicious SQL code through the `filter` and `fin_nalog_id` parameters in HTTP requests.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting:** Attackers inject malicious scripts via the `config` parameter in HTTP requests. These scripts are then reflected back to the user's browser when accessing the vulnerable page.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. This means they can be remote.
    *   For XSS, the victim user needs to visit a crafted URL containing the malicious script or be tricked into doing so.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The content provides more specific details than the basic CVE description. It outlines the vulnerable parameters and scripts, allowing for a more concrete understanding of the attack vectors.
*   The exploit-db content also links to CVE-2011-5039 which is for a different vulnerability (authentication bypass) in the same application.
*   The advisory from zeroscience.mk (ZSL-2011-5064) is linked in exploit-db and describes the SQLi and XSS vulnerabilities.
*   The exploit-db content provides a proof-of-concept example for both SQL injection and XSS exploitation.

**Summary of relevant information:**
The vulnerability is due to lack of sanitization of user input, which causes SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.  This could lead to exposure of system information, sensitive data, data manipulation and execution of arbitrary code in the user's browser session.  The attack vectors are the `filter` and `fin_nalog_id` parameters for SQL injection and the `config` parameter for XSS. The attacker can exploit these remotely.
