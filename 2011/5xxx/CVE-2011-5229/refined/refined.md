Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities found in appRain CMF 0.1.5, as described in the context of CVE-2011-5229 and CVE-2011-5228:

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **SQL Injection (CVE-2011-5229):**
    *   **Root Cause:** The application does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries. Specifically, the `profile` parameter within the Forum module is vulnerable.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of proper input sanitization, leading to the ability to inject arbitrary SQL code.
    *   **Impact:** Remote attackers can execute arbitrary SQL statements, potentially leading to database compromise, data breaches, or complete compromise of the CMS.
    *   **Attack Vector:** HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `/quickstart/profile/` endpoint.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Remote attacker.

2.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (CVE-2011-5228):**
    *   **Root Cause:** The application does not properly sanitize or encode user-supplied input within the search functionality before displaying it back to the user.
    *   **Weakness:** Insufficient output encoding and input sanitization, resulting in the ability to inject arbitrary JavaScript code.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts that can be executed in the context of other users' browsers. This can lead to session hijacking, account theft, or other malicious actions. Specifically, the advisory mentions hijacking skype customer sessions.
    *   **Attack Vector:**  HTTP POST request to the `/quickstart/search` endpoint with malicious JavaScript code in the `ss` parameter.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Remote attacker; requires user interaction to trigger the XSS.

**Additional Information:**

*   The advisory mentions a timeline for reporting, notification, and public disclosure of the vulnerabilities.
*   It also provides example URLs and POST data for exploitation (Proof of Concept).
*   The advisory suggests using prepared statements for SQL injections and input parsing for cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.
*   The severity of the SQL injection is considered critical, while the XSS is considered low(+) due to high user interaction needed.

**Relationship to CVEs:**

The content explicitly mentions **CVE-2011-5229** for SQL Injection and **CVE-2011-5228** for Cross-Site Scripting, thus it is directly related to CVE-2011-5229.

The provided content gives a good breakdown of both vulnerabilities, including the root causes, affected modules, proof of concept examples, and suggested solutions.
