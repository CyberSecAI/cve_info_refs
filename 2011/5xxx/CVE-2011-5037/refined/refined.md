The provided content is related to CVE-2011-5037.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is the predictable collision properties in the hashing algorithms used by various programming languages and web frameworks when processing key/value pairs in hash data structures, which can be exploited. Specifically, some implementations do not sufficiently randomize their hash functions or provide means to limit key collision attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Predictable Hash Collisions:** The hashing algorithms used in multiple languages and frameworks are vulnerable to predictable collisions. This means that an attacker can craft inputs that will generate the same hash value, leading to excessive processing when inserting these inputs into a hash table.
- **Lack of Input Limits:** Many applications and frameworks lack sufficient limits on the number of parameters, particularly in POST requests. This allows an attacker to send a large number of colliding keys, exacerbating the denial-of-service condition.
- **Insufficient Hash Randomization:** Some implementations lack sufficient randomization in their hash functions, making them vulnerable to collision attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial-of-Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause a DoS condition by sending specially crafted requests with colliding key values. This can lead to 100% CPU usage, potentially for hours, rendering the application or server unresponsive.
- **Resource Exhaustion:** Exploitation can lead to resource exhaustion due to the excessive processing required to handle hash collisions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Requests:** Specifically crafted HTTP POST requests containing many parameters with colliding hash values are the primary attack vector.
- **Web Applications:** Web applications using affected frameworks or languages are particularly vulnerable, as they often receive user-controlled input through web requests.
- **Unauthenticated Attackers:** The attacks can be carried out by unauthenticated attackers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the targeted server or application.
- **Ability to Send HTTP Requests:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests, particularly POST requests.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Hashing Algorithms:** The attacker requires knowledge of the hashing algorithms used by the targeted application to craft inputs that cause hash collisions.
- **Ability to Generate Colliding Keys:** The attacker needs to be able to generate keys that produce hash collisions.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is similar to a previously reported vulnerability in 2003 that affected Perl, indicating that the issue is not new, but has resurfaced in different contexts.
- The vulnerability is widespread, affecting multiple programming languages (Java, JRuby, PHP, Python, Rubinius, Ruby), web servers (Apache Tomcat), application servers (Oracle Glassfish), and web frameworks (Rack, Plone).
- Mitigation strategies include limiting CPU time per request, limiting POST request size, and limiting the maximum number of request parameters.
- Some languages, like Ruby 1.9.x, have implemented hash function randomization to mitigate this vulnerability.
- Patches and updates have been released for affected products, often including limits to parameters in request and hash randomization or improved collision handling.
