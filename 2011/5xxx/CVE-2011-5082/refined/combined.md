We are currently running 111029 and we are hitting a wall with the PCI Scan. Its been brought to our attention that would should see if you have a possible fix for your script.

Here is a copy of part of the scan that involved s2Member Pro

XSS is a type of computer security vulnerability typically found in web applications which allow code injection by malicious
web users into the web pages viewed by other users. Examples of such code include HTML code and client-side scripts.
An attacker can use this vulnerability to completely alter the layout of a particular page for a specific user or to force the user
to launch malicious javascript.
Cross site scripting occurs when user input is not properly encoded by the application prior to display back to the user. In
order to fix this issue, the application developers must encode most non-alphanumeric user-supplied data into their
corresponding HTML characters before the data is displayed back to the user. For example, " would convert to &quot and <
would convert to &lt;
There are built in functions for different languages that may do the encoding for you. In PHP you can use the
htmlspecialchars() function In .Net you can use the Server.HtmlEncode() function.

Please reach out as soon as you can.

Thanks,
Jeremy

From what I received from the scan its looks to be a cross site script from a web service called fritiko. Here is a copy/paste of the scan result. And thanks for the assistance on it.

Thanks for the heads up on this thread.
~ and thanks for reporting this important security issue.

Interesting. s2Member does not interact with this service:
Code: [Select all](viewtopic.php%3Ff%3D4%26t%3D16173.html)`Web Services :: Fritko`
What PCI scanning service are you using please?
Also, what you posted prior is a general outline of the issue that was detected. It does not point to anything specific, nor does it isolate the issue to s2Member. Please check your full PCI compliance scan and associated reports. Look for the exact test your scanning service performed, which would allow you to reproduce the issue. For XSS, this would normally include a URL with a particular query string.
Code: [Select all](viewtopic.php%3Ff%3D4%26t%3D16173.html)`Path: /member-registration`( not enough to go on )

\* Note: we are not currently aware of any XSS vulnerability in s2Member or s2Member Pro. However, if you have a report that indicates there is, please post that information. We'll be happy to review it.

Thanks for the follow-up.

I'm not aware of any issue in this regard. All of these variables are sanitized by s2Member before they are used and/or displayed back to the user. Your report indicates otherwise. If you have more information you can provide, we'll be happy to have a look. This list just shows the variables, it doesn't show the vulnerability being reproduced yet. I suspect this is a false positive.

Thanks again for looking into this. I have submitted a support ticket with our people to run our own PCI Scan so we have a clear visual on the hits. I will be in touch soon.

I received information back from our PCI Scan:

Jeremy

I have attached proof of concept that the cross-site scripting threat is legitimate. I was able to pop it on the [www.protectanddefend.org/member-registration](http://www.protectanddefend.org/member-registration) pageJust some background information that may assist your developers, I was able to manually verify the cross-site scripting by using a proxy and intercepting the request. Once I intercepted the request, I was able to change the s2member\_pro\_authnet\_checkout[card\_type] to "Amex" (American Express isn't one of the selectable options originally) and I was also able to insert the script into the s2member\_pro\_authnet\_checkout[coupon] parameter.

Resolved in s2Member and s2Member Pro v111220.
<http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/s2member/changelog/>

`v111220

 (s2Member Pro) Security fix. PayPal® Pro and Authorize.Net® Forms were vulnerable to an XSS attack, reproducible with a Coupon Code containing special characters. Discovered by ControlScan™. Fixed in this release. For further details, please see this thread.

 (s2Member Pro) Security hardening. s2Member's Systematics routine hardended against a possible attack coming from a spoofed IP address matching that of the installation server itself. For further details, please see this thread.

 (s2Member Pro) Security hardening. PayPal® Pro and Authorize.Net® Forms hardended against a possible attack against card types. Discovered by ControlScan™. For further details, please see this thread.`

I personally wanted to thank you for such a quick resolve on this. I have turned it back over to ControlScan to run hopefully a final scan on this matter. I will update if there are anymore findings.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
