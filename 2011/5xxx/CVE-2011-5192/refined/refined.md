Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2011-5192:

**CVE-2011-5192:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input, specifically the `$_GET['slug']` parameter within the `pretty-bar.php` file of the Pretty Link WordPress plugin.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS vulnerability. By manipulating the `slug` parameter, an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the generated HTML output of the Pretty Link plugin.
    *   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The code directly uses the unsanitized `$_GET['slug']` variable in the construction of a URL, making the application susceptible to XSS.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser when they view a page containing the vulnerable Pretty Link.
    *   This could lead to various malicious actions, including:
        *   Session hijacking
        *   Defacement of the website
        *   Redirection of users to malicious sites
        *   Unauthorized actions on behalf of the user.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector is through a crafted URL that includes malicious JavaScript within the `slug` parameter of a Pretty Link.
    *   The attacker would need to entice a user to click on or visit a page containing this specially crafted link.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with the malicious `slug` parameter.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to deliver this crafted URL to a target user.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerable code in `pretty-bar.php` was:

```php
<a href="http://twitter.com/home?status=<?php echo $prli_blogurl . PrliUtils::get_permalink_pre_slug_uri() . $_GET['slug']; ?>" target="_top">Share on Twitter</a>
```

The fix implemented in version 1.5.6 was to escape the `$_GET['slug']` variable by using `esc_html()`:

```php
<a href="http://twitter.com/home?status=<?php echo $prli_blogurl . PrliUtils::get_permalink_pre_slug_uri() . esc_html($_GET['slug']); ?>" target="_top">Share on Twitter</a>
```

This escaping prevents the browser from executing the JavaScript by converting special characters into their corresponding HTML entities.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content details the fix in the changelog of the Pretty Link plugin, specifically mentioning "Fixed a cross-site scripting vulnerability that could have affected a very small number of users".
*   The changesets in `plugins.trac.wordpress.org` clearly show the code modifications which addressed the XSS vulnerability by adding the `esc_html()` function.
*   The `secunia.com` content is about the Secunia Research team which is unrelated to the specifics of the vulnerability in the Pretty Link plugin.
