  Orginal advisory <http://seclists.org/bugtraq/2011/Nov/120> didn’t have much information. Do you know if this issue is fixed? What versions are affected? Does this issue have CVE-identifier?

  Thank you Henri for reporting this to us.

  While WordPress does have a cross site scripting problem (XSS) where not all user input is sanitized, if any of that unsanitized user input is redirected to the screen or browser, an attacker would be able to execute malicious scripts. However, Lanoba’s plug in does sanitize user input, and because that input is never sent to the browser, an attacker has no way of executing script or code on a user’s behalf.

  Thank you again for your input, we hope you found this information to be helpful.

  I double-checked this and it is indeed false-positive. Thank you for fast reply. It seems that the person who originally reported this has made several other false-positive reports.
