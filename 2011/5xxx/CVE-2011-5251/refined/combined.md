  ## Potential Phishing Vector

  Thu 2 Jun '11, 9:32am

  We have been recently advised of an indirect, low risk phishing vector that could allow a malicious user to restructure vBulletin URL(s) in a fairly obvious attempt to trick an unsuspecting user into inputting their user account information on a site other than the original destination.

  It has been identified this as a low-priority phishing vector in all versions of vBulletin, including vBulletin 3 and 4. At this time we believe that the risk to our customers is indirect and at best minimal . Accordingly, no patch is currently available or required for any and all versions of vBulletin software related to this report.

  Generic example of the Phishing Attempt:
  + User can post a fake thread inviting others to reset their passwords using the provided link
  + User edits the link to append an incorrect ‚Äúlast location‚Äù to url therefore redirecting traffic outside the site after the form successfully/correctly submits on the original site.
  + For example: [http://www.vbulletin.com/forum/login...www.google.com](http://www.vbulletin.com/forum/login.php?do=lostpw&url=http://www.google.com)
  + Instead of Google.com in this example the user would go to a fake site where they could potentially be tricked into submitting real information.

  This vector was reported by:
