Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the potential phishing vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the ability of a malicious user to manipulate URLs within vBulletin by appending an incorrect "last location" parameter. This allows them to redirect users to an external site after the form is submitted on the original site.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **URL Manipulation:** The primary weakness is the lack of sufficient validation or sanitization of the "url" parameter used in password reset or other similar forms. This allows for the injection of an arbitrary URL for redirection.
*   **Lack of Redirection Validation:**  The system does not properly verify if the redirection URL is within the expected domain or a trusted source.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Phishing:** Attackers can redirect users to fake login pages or other malicious sites, potentially stealing their credentials or other sensitive information.
*   **User Deception:** Users may be tricked into believing they are still on the legitimate vBulletin site while entering their data on a malicious page.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Posted Links:** Attackers can post fake threads or messages with manipulated links disguised as legitimate requests for password reset or other actions requiring user input.
*   **Malicious Redirect:** Users who click on the crafted URL will be redirected to the attacker's controlled site after submitting the form on the legitimate site.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Post Content:** Attackers need the ability to create posts or edit links within the vBulletin forum.
*   **Understanding of vBulletin URL Structure:** They must understand how to append the "url" parameter to redirect users.
*   **External Hosting:** Attackers require an external web server to host their fake login page or other malicious content.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vBulletin team considers this a "low-priority phishing vector" and no patch was initially released, suggesting the risk is minimal but not zero.
*   The provided example URL is: `http://www.vbulletin.com/forum/login.php?do=lostpw&url=http://www.google.com`. In a real attack, the "http://www.google.com" part would be replaced with the attacker's malicious website.
*   A later security patch was released for vB 4.1.4 and vB 3.8.7 addressing this phishing issue (mentioned in a related topic).
