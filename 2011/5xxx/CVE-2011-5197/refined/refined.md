```
  - Root cause of vulnerability: Unprotected file upload vulnerabilities in the administrative interfaces of Open Conference/Journal/Harvester Systems. These vulnerabilities are susceptible to CSRF attacks.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
    - CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) vulnerability allowing unauthorized file uploads.
    - Unrestricted file upload allowing injection of malicious PHP code.
    - Lack of authentication/authorization checks on file upload functionalities.
  - Impact of exploitation: Remote code execution on the server by uploading a malicious PHP file, leading to complete compromise of the application and potentially the server.
  - Attack vectors: Attacker crafts a malicious HTML page that, when visited by an authenticated administrator, forces the browser to upload a PHP webshell to the target server. This is achieved through CSRF.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to convince a logged-in administrator of the target application to visit the malicious HTML page. The attacker needs to know the target server, the application path, and the application type (conference, journal, archive).
