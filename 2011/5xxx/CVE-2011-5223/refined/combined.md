Hi All,

I has installed the Cacti 0.8.7g and will publish to internet but my security team has done some security assessment and found that something to be fix.

Below are the security issues that should be fix and I have no idea how to fix the issues.

1. Authentication Bypass Using SQL Injection

Example: <https://IP> Address/cacti/index.php (Parameter: login\_username)

Remediation: Filter out hazardous characters from user input

2. Cross-Site Scripting

Example: <https://IP> Address/cacti/graph\_settings.php

Remediation: Filter out hazardous characters from user input

3. Phishing Through URL Redirection

Example: <https://IP> Address/cacti/graph\_settings.php (Parameter: referer)

Remediation: Disable redirection to external sites based on parameter values

4. Stored Cross-Site Scripting

Example: <https://IP> Address/cacti/graph\_settings.php

Remediation: Filter out hazardous characters from user input

5. Cross-Site Request Forgery

Example: <https://IP> Address/cacti/logout.php

Remediation: Decline malicious requests

6. Inadequate Account Lockout

Example: <https://IP> Address/cacti/index.php (Parameter: login\_password)

Remediation: Enforce account lockout after several failed login attempts

7. Phishing Through Frames

Example: <https://IP> Address/cacti/graph\_settings.php (Parameter: num\_columns)

Remediation: Filter out hazardous characters from user input

Very appreciate if the cacti experts can help me to fix this security issues.

Thanks

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
