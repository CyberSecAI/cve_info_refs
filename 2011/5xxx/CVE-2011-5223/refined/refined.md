Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2011-5223:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization and validation within the Cacti application, specifically in version 0.8.7g. This leads to multiple vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The following vulnerabilities are present:
1.  **Authentication Bypass via SQL Injection:**  Improper handling of the `login_username` parameter in `index.php` allows for SQL injection, potentially bypassing authentication.
2.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  Vulnerable input fields in `graph_settings.php` allow injection of malicious scripts, leading to XSS.
3.  **Phishing Through URL Redirection:** The `referer` parameter in `graph_settings.php` can be manipulated to redirect users to external, potentially malicious sites.
4.  **Stored Cross-Site Scripting:** Vulnerable input fields within `graph_settings.php` also allow for stored XSS attacks.
5. **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The `logout.php` page is susceptible to CSRF attacks, allowing an attacker to perform unwanted actions in the context of an authenticated user.
6. **Inadequate Account Lockout:** The application does not enforce account lockout after multiple failed login attempts using the `login_password` parameter in `index.php`.
7.  **Phishing Through Frames:** The `num_columns` parameter in `graph_settings.php` can be exploited to conduct phishing attacks through frame injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
The exploitation of these vulnerabilities can lead to:
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Gaining access to the Cacti application without valid credentials via SQL injection.
*   **Data Theft and Manipulation:** The ability to inject arbitrary scripts leading to data compromise.
*   **Malicious Redirections:** Misleading users to phishing sites via manipulated redirect parameters.
*   **Account Hijacking:** Performing actions on behalf of a logged-in user through CSRF.
*   **Account Compromise:** Gaining unauthorized access to accounts via brute force attacks due to lack of lockout mechanism.
* **Phishing:** Redirecting users to malicious sites through frame injection.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vectors include:
*   **HTTP GET/POST requests:** Exploiting parameters such as `login_username`, `referer`, and `num_columns` via crafted URLs and form submissions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have network access to the Cacti server.
*   The attacker does not need valid user credentials to exploit the SQL injection and CSRF issues, however a session may be required to perform actions on behalf of a valid user.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The forum post indicates that all patches were applied during installation, yet these vulnerabilities were still discovered. This may indicate insufficient patching or a misunderstanding of the vulnerability.
*   The forum post also indicates the issues were submitted as bugs and assigned bug id 2062. This bug was addressed in Cacti 0.8.7i, which includes "Multiple security vulnerabilities" bug fix with the id of 2062.

**Summary:**
The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities present in Cacti 0.8.7g due to insufficient input sanitization. These vulnerabilities range from authentication bypass via SQL injection to various types of cross-site scripting (XSS), CSRF, and phishing through URL redirection and frames. The successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities can lead to unauthorized access, data compromise, and phishing attacks, among other impacts. These issues were addressed in a later release, Cacti 0.8.7i.
