The provided content does not contain any information about CVE-2011-5093. However, it does detail several other CVEs related to RT (Request Tracker) software. These include:

**CVE-2011-2082:**
*   **Root Cause:** Incomplete fix for upgrading weak password hashes. The previously released tool failed to upgrade passwords for disabled users.
*   **Weakness:** Inadequate password hashing implementation.
*   **Impact:** Inability to properly update weak password hashes for disabled users.
*   **Attack Vectors:**  Not directly exploitable, but rather a failure in a remediation.
*   **Required Capabilities:**  Privileged user/admin to run the `vulnerable-passwords` tool.

**CVE-2011-2083:**
*   **Root Cause:** Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
*   **Weakness:** Insufficient input sanitization and output encoding.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript with the user's credentials.
*   **Attack Vectors:**  Malicious input injected into the application.
*   **Required Capabilities:**  Ability to inject malicious JavaScript into the application through a vulnerable input field.

**CVE-2011-2084:**
*   **Root Cause:** Information disclosure vulnerabilities.
*   **Weakness:** Insufficient access control and data sanitization.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Privileged users can expose previous password hashes.
    *   Privileged users can obtain correspondence history for any ticket.
*   **Attack Vectors:**  Exploiting insecure API endpoints or insufficient permission checks.
*   **Required Capabilities:**  Privileged user access within the application.

**CVE-2011-2085:**
*   **Root Cause:** Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of proper CSRF protection mechanisms.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Information disclosure.
    *   Privilege escalation.
    *   Arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack Vectors:**  Malicious website can cause the victim's browser to make unintended requests to the RT application.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs the victim to be logged into the RT application.

**CVE-2011-4458:**
*  **Root Cause:** Remote code execution vulnerability.
    *   If VERP configuration options ($VERPPrefix and $VERPDomain) are enabled, or by exploiting the $DisallowExecuteCode option.
*  **Weakness:** Unsafe use of code execution and insufficient restrictions on execution permissions.
*  **Impact:** Remote execution of code and privilege escalation
*  **Attack Vectors:** By exploiting vulnerable configuration options or settings.
*  **Required Capabilities:**  Configuration of vulnerable options or high privileged account.

**CVE-2011-4459:**
*   **Root Cause:**  Users retaining rights from disabled groups.
*   **Weakness:** Inconsistent group/user privilege handling.
*   **Impact:** Users might retain permissions they should no longer have.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Exploiting insecure permission checks.
*  **Required Capabilities:**  User account within the RT system.

**CVE-2011-4460:**
*   **Root Cause:** SQL injection attack.
*   **Weakness:** Insufficient sanitization of user inputs in SQL queries.
*   **Impact:** Privileged users can obtain arbitrary information from the database.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Malicious SQL statements injected via vulnerable input field.
*   **Required Capabilities:**  Privileged user access within the application.
