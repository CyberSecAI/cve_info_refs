Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2011-5026

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to the lack of input sanitization on the "name" variable within the Winn Guestbook application. This means that user-supplied input is not properly checked or filtered before being used in the application.
*   **Weakness:** The primary weakness is a **Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** vulnerability. This occurs when malicious scripts are injected into the application's database (or persistent storage) and are executed when other users view the affected content.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attack vector is through the guestbook's input form where the "name" field is vulnerable to script injection. An attacker can enter malicious JavaScript code into the name field.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to submit data to the vulnerable guestbook form. If the email address used by the attacker is added to the "approved posters" list, exploitation is easier, because the attacker's malicious input will be displayed to other users.
*   **Impact:** When a user views a guestbook entry with the malicious script in the name field, the injected script executes within their browser. This can lead to various malicious outcomes, including:
    *   **Session Hijacking:** Stealing cookies and session tokens to impersonate other users.
    *   **Phishing:** Redirecting users to fake login pages to steal credentials.
    *   **Malware Distribution:** Redirecting users to sites that host malware.
    *   **Defacement:** Altering the appearance of the web page.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Accessing sensitive information that users have access to.

**Affected Software:**

*   **Product:** Winn Guestbook
*   **Version:** 2.4.8c

**Resolution:**
*   Upgrade to version 2.4.8d, where this vulnerability has been patched.

**Additional Details:**
*   The exploit-db entry indicates that the vendor was notified and issued a patch.
*   The vulnerability is classified as a stored XSS.
