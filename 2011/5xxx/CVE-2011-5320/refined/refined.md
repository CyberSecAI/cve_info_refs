Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2011-5320:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the `scanf` implementation within the `glibc` library. Specifically, the `scanf` function crashes when processing certain long numerical inputs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Crash on Specific Inputs:** The `scanf` function, when used with format specifiers like `%d`, `%f`, or `%i` (and possibly others), crashes when it encounters very long numerical input strings, especially a long string of zeros.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The `scanf` function does not properly handle extremely large numerical strings, leading to a crash instead of a more graceful error handling mechanism.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  A malicious actor can cause a program using the vulnerable `scanf` function to crash, leading to a denial of service. The program becomes unavailable, affecting its functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Input:** The primary attack vector is providing a program with a crafted input containing an excessively long string of digits (specifically zeros) through the standard input or any other method that uses `scanf` for data processing.
*   **File Input:** As shown in the `marc.info` content, this vulnerability can also be exploited by providing crafted input via a file which is then processed by the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Provide Input:** An attacker must have the ability to provide input to a program that uses `scanf` and related functions from the `glibc` library, either through direct user interaction, file input, or another means of providing data.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Not all crashes are within scope:** The CVE scope specifically excludes crashes caused by extremely large strings of non-zero digits (like "5" repeated many times), which are considered to fall under the standard's allowance for undefined behavior. The focus is on the "huge string of zeros" scenario.
*   **Affected versions:** The issue was present since the beginning and was fixed in `glibc` version 2.15.
*   **Red Hat Enterprise Linux:** Red Hat states the issue affects versions of glibc as shipped with RHEL 5 and 6, and was not present in RHEL 7.
*  **Mitigation:** The vulnerability is mitigated by updating to a version of glibc containing the fix.
