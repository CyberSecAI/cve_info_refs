### [Premiums Support is NOT premium, training videos don’t exist](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/premium-support-is-not-premium/)

I paid for Premiums Support over a week ago and to date have not heard from them or received any support at all.
Feels like a scam.
Can anybody tell me if they are actually still doing anything?
How do I get my money back because clearly they have not provided what was purchased.
VERY UNHAPPY!!!
AND
What is the point in having a link to non-existing ‘training videos’?
On the Details page you have:
Learn quickly with our video tutorials
Click on the ‘video tutorials’ link and you get a ‘Page Not Found’ error.

### [No documentation, no support, no clear code](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/no-documentation-no-support-no-clear-code/)

First of all, the code is not documented AT ALL! and they code in a way which is impossible to be understood without documentation.
Second, no documentation is online on their website, they don’t reply to emails and none of the issues related to this plugin on github or on wordpress.org are solved, they have not even tried to solved them. So I assume there is no support team.
Everyone, use WooCommerce, I haven’t tried it yet, but it’s definitely better supported.
To be honest, I am disappointed I can’t give them 0 stars instead of 1.

Just first time I have to set up a Wordpress payment, and this Plugin just made it extremely easy. I’ve just had an issue from my server and the IPN, that was filtered and blocked. The amazing support service of this plugin spot the problem and now i can use it without any problem.
A big Up for Mihai and WP eCommerce!
