New condition added in the above commits restrict idx to be less than MAX_NAME before executing while loop body.  idx is incremented in the body, so for oversized input, idx is MAX_NAME after the loop and the terminating 0 is written one off in ident[idx] = 0;. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=643882#c1)  Scott Reeves    2011-03-16 00:31:31 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 183479](attachment.cgi?id=183479 "patch to fix the buffer overwrite") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=183479&action=edit "patch to fix the buffer overwrite") [[review]](review?bug=643882&attachment=183479) patch to fix the buffer overwrite ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=643882#c2)  Carlos Garcia Campos    2011-03-20 10:02:26 UTC  ``` Pushed to git master, thanks! ``` |  |
