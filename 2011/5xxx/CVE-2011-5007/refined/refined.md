Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2011-5007:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the `CmpWebServer` component of the CoDeSys software, specifically in the function at address `0040f480`. This component handles HTTP connections, often on port 8080.
*   The overflow occurs when the software copies the input URI into a fixed-size stack buffer without proper bounds checking.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121):** The core weakness is the lack of proper input validation when handling the URI in an HTTP request, leading to a buffer overflow when a URI larger than the allocated buffer is supplied. This can overwrite adjacent memory on the stack, including the return address.
*   **Lack of input sanitization:** The `CmpWebServer` component fails to sanitize or validate the length of the URI before copying it into a fixed-size buffer, leading to the overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation leads to a crash of the PLC system, rendering it unavailable until the system's power is cycled.
*   **Potential for Remote Code Execution:** By overwriting the return address, it could be possible to redirect execution flow to malicious code, though this is not explicitly stated, a typical characteristic of stack overflows.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable by sending a crafted HTTP GET request with an overly long URI to the vulnerable webserver port (typically 8080).
*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the PLC to send malicious HTTP requests.
*   **Low Skill Level:** Publicly available exploits make this vulnerability easy to exploit for even a low-skilled attacker.

**Additional Information from the provided content:**
*   The vulnerability exists in the CoDeSys software, which is used by multiple vendors. The specific content identifies ABB AC500 PLC Webserver as vulnerable due to its use of the CoDeSys Web server component.
*   The Exploit-DB entry provides a proof-of-concept exploit targeting the CoDeSys web server.
*   The vulnerability is related to ICS-CERT Advisory, ICSA-12-006-01, which highlights other vulnerabilities in the 3S Smart Software Solutions CoDeSys.
*   The vulnerability is present in ABB AC500 CPU modules with firmware version V2.1.3 and Web server enabled. Firmware versions starting from V2.1.4 do not contain the vulnerability.
*   ABB has released a patch (V2.1.5) that mitigates this vulnerability.

**CVSS Score**:
*   A CVSS v2 base score of 7.8 has been assigned with the vector string (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C).

In summary, CVE-2011-5007 is a remotely exploitable stack-based buffer overflow in the CoDeSys webserver component, which can cause a denial of service by crashing the target system.
