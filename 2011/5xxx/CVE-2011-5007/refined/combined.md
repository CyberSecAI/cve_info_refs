How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

ICS Advisory
# ABB AC500 PLC Webserver CoDeSys Vulnerability

Last RevisedApril 30, 2013
Alert CodeICSA-12-320-01

## Overview

ICS-CERT has been notified of a buffer overflow vulnerability in the ABB AC500 PLC Webserver application. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a denial of service (DoS), affecting the availability of the service. This vulnerability is related to ICS-CERT Advisory, [ICSA-12-006-01--3S Smart Software Solutions CoDeSys Vulnerabilities](/control_systems/pdf/ICSA-12-006-01.pdf) as the ABB AC500 PLC uses the CoDeSys Webserver.

ABB has produced a patch for the AC500 PLC that mitigates this vulnerability. This vulnerability affects multiple sectors to include the energy, critical manufacturing, and transportation sectors.

This vulnerability could be exploited remotely. Exploits that target this vulnerability are known to be publicly available.

## Affected Products

The following ABB AC500 CPU modules with firmware Version V2.1.3 and Web server enabled are affected:

* 1SAP130 300 R0271 PM573-ETH,
* 1SAP140 300 R0271 PM583-ETH,
* 1SAP150 000 R0271 PM590-ETH,
* 1SAP150 100 R0271 PM591-ETH,
* 1SAP150 200 R0271 PM592-ETH,
* 1TNE968 900 R0110 PM554-T-ETH,
* 1TNE968 900 R1110 PM564-T-ETH,
* 1TNE968 900 R1210 PM564-R-ETH, and
* 1TNE968 900 R1211 PM564-R-ETH-AC.

## Impact

Exploitation of this buffer overflow vulnerability in the embedded CoDeSys Web server component used by ABB causes a DoS of the PLC that can only be recovered after cycling the system’s power.

Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.

## Background

ABB is a Swiss-based company that maintains offices in several countries around the world. ABB develops products in multiple critical sectors that are deployed worldwide.

The affected products, AC500 PLCs, are Web-based SCADA systems. According to ABB, the AC500 PLCs are deployed across several sectors including the energy, critical manufacturing, transportation, and others. ABB estimates that these products are deployed worldwide.

## Vulnerability Characterization

### Vulnerability Overview

#### Stack-Based Buffer OverflowCWE, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/121.html, CWE-121: Stack-Based Buffer Overflow, Web site last accessed November 15, 2012.

The ABB AC500 Webserver uses the CoDeSys embedded software. By sending an overly long URL to Port 80/TCP (Port 80 by default, but the device may be configured to use any arbitrary port), an attacker could cause a stack-based buffer overflow. This causes a crash of the PLC. The only remediation is to cycle the system’s power.

[CVE-2011-5007](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2011-5007) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 7.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is [(AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C)](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&vector=(AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C)).

## Mitigation

ABB has released a Vulnerability Security Advisorye and patch (V2.1.5) that mitigates this vulnerability that was made available in December 2011. Firmware versions starting from V2.1.4 do not contain the vulnerability. Firmware V2.1.5 can be found in the [ABB PLC download center](http://www.abb.com/plc).

The Web server component is not active in the default configuration of the system. It should only be used if human-machine interface visualization is required. PLCs that are continuously running are expected to be in a factory environment where additional cybersecurity measures, such as isolation, intrusion detection, etc., are part of normal security operations and reduce the risk for malware or unauthorized personnel to have a network connection to the PLC.

ICS-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices. Critical devices should not directly face the Internet.
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

ICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the US-CERT Web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving [*Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies*](/control_systems/practices/Recommended_Practices.html). ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to taking defensive measures.

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS-CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01A—Cyber Intrusion Mitigation Strategies](/control_systems/pdf/ICS-TIP-12-146-01A.pdf).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

1) Introduction

From vendor's homepage:
"The CoDeSys Automation Suite is a comprehensive software tool for
industrial automation technology. All common automation tasks solved by
means of software can be realized with the CoDeSys Suite based on the
wide-spread controller and PLC development system of the same name."
#######################################################################
=======
2) Bugs
=======
----------------------------------
A] GatewayService integer overflow
----------------------------------
GatewayService uses a 32bit value at offset 0x0c of the header which
specifies the size of the data to receive.
The program takes this number, adds 0x34 and allocates that amount of
memory resulting in an integer overflow:
0042CB30 /$ 55 PUSH EBP
0042CB31 |. 8BEC MOV EBP,ESP
0042CB33 |. 8B45 08 MOV EAX,DWORD PTR SS:[EBP+8]

00447B03 |. 8945 0C MOV DWORD PTR SS:[EBP+C],EAX
00447B06 |> 6A 01 PUSH 1
00447B08 |. 8B4D 0C MOV ECX,DWORD PTR SS:[EBP+C]
00447B0B |. 51 PUSH ECX
00447B0C |. E8 A7050200 CALL GatewayS.004680B8 ; allocation
------------------------------
B] CmpWebServer stack overflow
------------------------------
CmpWebServer is the component used in services like 3SRTESrv3 and
CoDeSysControlService for handling the HTTP connections on port 8080.
The library is affected by a buffer overflow in the function 0040f480
that copies the input URI in a limited stack buffer allowing code
execution:
0040F5C5 |> 8B55 F4 MOV EDX,DWORD PTR SS:[EBP-C]
0040F5C8 |. 2B55 08 SUB EDX,DWORD PTR SS:[EBP+8]
0040F5CB |. 52 PUSH EDX
0040F5CC |. 8B45 08 MOV EAX,DWORD PTR SS:[EBP+8]
0040F5CF |. 50 PUSH EAX
0040F5D0 |. 8B4D 10 MOV ECX,DWORD PTR SS:[EBP+10]
0040F5D3 |. 51 PUSH ECX
0040F5D4 |. E8 97420000 CALL CoDeSysC.00413870 ; memcpy
-------------------------------------------
C] CmpWebServer Content-Length NULL pointer
-------------------------------------------
NULL pointer caused by the lack of checks on the memory allocated
trusting the Content-Length value of an HTTP POST request:
eax=812aa3a7 ebx=00a7ae7c ecx=20000000 edx=00000000 esi=012aa3a7 edi=00000000
eip=0128cc9a esp=02e9feec ebp=02e9fef4 iopl=0 nv up ei pl nz ac po nc

CmpWebServer!ComponentEntry+0xb37a:
0128cc9a f3a5 rep movs dword ptr es:[edi],dword ptr [esi]
-------------------------------------------------
D] CmpWebServer invalid HTTP request NULL pointer
-------------------------------------------------
NULL pointer caused by the usage of an unexpected HTTP request
different than GET, POST or HEAD:
eax=028228d4 ebx=00000009 ecx=00000004 edx=02822957 esi=00000000 edi=00000005
eip=0128dd6c esp=02e9fed4 ebp=02e9fee0 iopl=0 nv up ei pl nz na po nc
cs=001b ss=0023 ds=0023 es=0023 fs=003b gs=0000 efl=00010202
CmpWebServer!ComponentEntry+0xc44c:
0128dd6c 3a51fc cmp dl,byte ptr [ecx-4] ds:0023:00000000=??
--------------------------------
E] CmpWebServer folders creation
--------------------------------
Not a security bug (at least at the moment) but enough weird and funny
to note.
The webserver calls CreateDirectory at address 0041206d before doing a
secondary CreateFile (read mode).
The only possible attack scenario I can imagine may be in case the
server automatically generates logs or other files and this bug will
prevent their creation due to the presence of folders with the same
names, but I don't know the software enough to confirm this scenario.
