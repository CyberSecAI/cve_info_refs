Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-5167:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a heap overflow in the `SetDevNames()` method of the Tidestone Formula One WorkBook OLE Control (`TTF16.ocx`). This occurs due to insufficient bounds checking when handling the input to the `SetDevNames()` function.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper bounds checking. When the attacker provides overly large data to the `SetDevNames` function, it leads to a heap overflow, corrupting memory.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine. The exploit provided uses a heap spray to write shellcode into memory that can then be executed due to the overflow in SetDevNames.
*  **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is remote, utilizing a specially crafted HTML page that includes an ActiveX object to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to serve a malicious HTML page to the victim, typically via a website or email. The victim also needs to have the vulnerable ActiveX control installed and enabled in their browser (likely Internet Explorer).

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable control is `TTF16.ocx` with CLSID `{B0475003-7740-11D1-BDC3-0020AF9F8E6E}` and ProgID `TTF161.TTF1.6`.
*   The provided exploit uses a javascript heap spray technique to fill the heap with a crafted shellcode. This shellcode is designed to add an administrator account to the system and does not seem to be general purpose.
*   The vulnerability is triggered by calling the `SetDevNames()` method with large strings.
*   The vulnerability was verified to be present in Oracle Hyperion Strategic Finance Client 12.x, using version 6.3.5 build 1 of the TTF16.ocx control.
*   The Exploit-DB entry mentions that a copy of `heapLib.js`, which is used in the exploit, can be found at `http://retrogod.altervista.org/heapLib_js.html`.
