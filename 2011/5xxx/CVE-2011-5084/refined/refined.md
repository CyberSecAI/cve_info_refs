Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in Movable Type, stemming from insecure file handling, insufficient input validation and improper escaping of template variables.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Local File Read:** Users with "Create Entries" or "Manage Blog" permissions could read arbitrary files on the local file system under certain conditions.
*   **Shell Command Injection:** The file management system had shell command injection vulnerabilities, which could lead to arbitrary OS command execution.
*   **Session Hijack and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** Vulnerabilities in the commenting and community scripts allowed for session hijacking and CSRF attacks.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Templates that did not properly escape variables and `mt-wizard.cgi` contained XSS vulnerabilities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Attackers could execute arbitrary code in a logged-in user's web browser.
*   **System Compromise:** Attackers could read or modify system files/content.
*   **Session Hijacking:** Attackers could take over user sessions.
*   **CSRF Attacks:** Attackers could perform actions on behalf of a user without their knowledge.
