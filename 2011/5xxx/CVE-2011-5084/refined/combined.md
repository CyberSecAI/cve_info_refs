Is your web page managed by Going Type? If so, what are your thoughts regarding the update and why would you recommend it over competitive techniques.

I think the article may have confused people regarding extensions and plugins. You can extend MT without paying for stuff, though there will be paid extensions available as well - the same is true with a lot of OSS software.

Package        : movabletype-opensource
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
Debian Bug     : 631437 661064

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Movable Type, a blogging
system:

Under certain circumstances, a user who has "Create Entries" or
"Manage Blog" permissions may be able to read known files on the local
file system.

The file management system contains shell command injection
vulnerabilities, the most serious of which may lead to arbitrary OS
command execution by a user who has a permission to sign-in to the
admin script and also has a permission to upload files.

Session hijack and cross-site request forgery vulnerabilities exist in
the commenting and the community script. A remote attacker could
hijack the user session or could execute arbitrary script code on
victim's browser under the certain circumstances.

Templates which do not escape variable properly and mt-wizard.cgi
contain cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 4.3.8+dfsg-0+squeeze2.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 5.1.3+dfsg-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your movabletype-opensource packages.
