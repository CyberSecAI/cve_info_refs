Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2011-5116

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper input sanitization within the SetSeed CMS application. Specifically, the application is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `loggedInUser` cookie.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, where user-controlled input is directly incorporated into SQL queries without proper sanitization or escaping.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Exposure of System Information:** An attacker could gain access to sensitive system information stored in the database.
- **Exposure of Sensitive Information:** Confidential data, such as user credentials and other private information, could be exposed.
- **Manipulation of Data:** An attacker could add, modify, or delete data within the database, potentially leading to data corruption or unauthorized actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote:** This is a remote vulnerability, meaning an attacker does not need local access to the system.
- **HTTP Cookie:** The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious SQL statement within the `loggedInUser` cookie.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web server hosting the vulnerable SetSeed CMS application.
- **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to craft and send HTTP requests with a manipulated `loggedInUser` cookie.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in SetSeed CMS version 5.8.20.
*   The vendor released version 5.11.2, which does not address this vulnerability.
*   A proof-of-concept (PoC) is available demonstrating the vulnerability.
* The exploit can be triggered using the `loggedInUser` cookie. The provided example injects `1'` into the cookie value, causing a SQL error.
