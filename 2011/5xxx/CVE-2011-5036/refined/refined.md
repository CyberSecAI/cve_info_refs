Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-5036:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is the predictable hash collisions in various programming languages' hash table implementations when processing form parameters. This vulnerability arises because the hashing algorithms used do not sufficiently randomize hash functions or limit key collisions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Algorithmic Complexity Vulnerability**: The core issue is that the hash functions used by several languages (Java, JRuby, PHP, Python, Rubinius, Ruby, and others) are susceptible to predictable collisions, meaning an attacker can craft input that forces many keys to hash to the same value. This causes excessive processing time.
*   **Lack of Input Limits:** Many web frameworks and servers do not adequately limit the size or number of POST request parameters. This allows an attacker to send a large number of colliding keys, exacerbating the denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
*   **Non-Constant Time HMAC Comparison:** In the specific case of Rack::Session::Cookie, a timing attack can be used because the HMAC comparison doesn't run in constant time. This allows an attacker to guess session cookies, gain privileges, and execute arbitrary code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial-of-service condition. When an application's hash table is flooded with colliding keys, the application may become unresponsive due to excessive CPU consumption. This can prevent legitimate users from accessing the service.
*   **CPU Exhaustion:**  Exploitation can lead to 100% CPU usage which could last for extended periods.
*   **Potential for Privilege Escalation/Arbitrary Code Execution:** In the case of Rack::Session::Cookie, exploitation can lead to session cookie compromise, potentially leading to privilege escalation and arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted HTTP Requests:** Attackers can generate specially crafted HTTP requests (often POST requests) that contain many parameters with predictable hash collisions.
*   **Large POST Requests:** Exploiting the lack of input size limits, attackers can send large POST requests with numerous colliding keys in the form data.
*   **Timing Attacks**: In the case of Rack::Session::Cookie, by observing the time it takes to compare the HMAC values attackers can guess the value of session cookies.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:** An attacker does not require any authentication and can perform this attack remotely over the network.
*   **Ability to Send HTTP Requests**: The attacker simply needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the targeted application or server.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was publicly detailed in 2003, but research in 2011 highlighted the applicability of the vulnerability to modern languages and frameworks.
*   Patches and workarounds involve:
    *   Randomizing hash functions
    *   Limiting the number of request parameters
    *   Limiting CPU processing time
    *   Limiting POST request sizes
*   The issue affects various software, including web servers (Apache Tomcat), frameworks (Rack), programming languages (PHP, Ruby, Python, JRuby, etc), and other applications (Plone, V8 JavaScript Engine).
*   This issue has been assigned multiple CVEs to capture the effects in different software.
