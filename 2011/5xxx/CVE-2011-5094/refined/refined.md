Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-5094:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the computational cost asymmetry in SSL/TLS handshakes, particularly during renegotiation. The server performs more intensive cryptographic operations (like RSA decryption) compared to the client during a handshake. An attacker can exploit this by initiating numerous renegotiations (or initial handshakes) causing a denial-of-service (DoS) by exhausting the server's CPU resources.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Computational Asymmetry:** TLS/SSL handshake requires significantly more processing power on the server than on the client, especially with RSA-based cipher suites.
*   **Unrestricted Renegotiation:** The ability for a client to trigger repeated renegotiations without limitations exacerbates the computational DoS risk. Even if renegotiation is done as intended, it is still more costly for the server than the client,
*   **Lack of Rate Limiting:** The absence of effective rate limiting mechanisms for TLS handshakes or renegotiations allows attackers to overwhelm the server.
*   **Inefficient Cipher Suites:** Some cipher suites like RSA, require heavy computation by the server and contribute to this vulnerability

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful attack results in a DoS, making the server unavailable to legitimate users due to CPU resource exhaustion. This can be achieved with renegotiation or just by using massive parallel initial handshakes
*   **Resource Exhaustion:** The server's CPU resources are depleted by the cryptographic computations required for the handshakes.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Repeated Renegotiation:** An attacker repeatedly requests SSL/TLS session renegotiations on an established connection to force the server to perform costly cryptographic operations.
*   **Parallel Initial Handshakes:** An attacker can initiate multiple concurrent initial SSL/TLS handshakes to overwhelm server resources, even if renegotiation is disabled.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the targeted server.
*   **Ability to Initiate TLS Connections:** The attacker needs to be able to initiate TLS connections and send handshake requests.
*   **Basic Network Tools:** The attacker can use simple tools to send renegotiation or initial handshake requests, often with canned data.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects various implementations that permit client-initiated renegotiation without proper limits, such as OpenSSL, NSS, and Java JRE.
*   Disabling TLS renegotiation is a simple mitigation but could break legitimate functionality if not done carefully.
*   Rate limiting TLS handshakes and renegotiations using techniques such as iptables (Netfilter) can help mitigate the DoS impact.
*   While the vulnerability is tied to OpenSSL, other TLS/SSL implementations are also affected.
*   The vulnerability exists in the TLS protocol design itself, due to the higher server-side computational cost of the handshake process.
*   The vulnerability is not new but the availability of exploit tools highlighted the problem again.
*   The use of certain cipher suites can make the server more vulnerable.
*   It is often possible for a client to send a bogus key exchange message, because the server must decrypt it before discovering it is bogus.
