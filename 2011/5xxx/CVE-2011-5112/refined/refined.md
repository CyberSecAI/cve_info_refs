- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Joomla! Component Alameda 1.0 is vulnerable to SQL injection. The vulnerability exists because user-supplied input is not properly sanitized before being used in a SQL query. Specifically, the `storeid` parameter in the `comments` controller and `edit` task is vulnerable.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially read sensitive data from the database, modify data, or gain administrative access. The provided exploit specifically aims to extract username and password data from the `jos_users` table.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploitable through HTTP requests targeting the `index.php` file with the `com_alameda` component and specific controller, task, and parameters. Specifically, the `storeid` parameter is injected with SQL code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable Joomla! installation. They do not need to be authenticated.
