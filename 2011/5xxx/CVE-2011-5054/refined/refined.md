Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of input validation of the `service_name` argument passed to the `pam_start()` function in both `kcheckpass` and `OpenPAM`. `kcheckpass`, a setuid root program, allows users to specify an arbitrary PAM service name. `OpenPAM` does not validate this service name, allowing directory traversal and loading of arbitrary shared libraries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of Input Validation:** `kcheckpass` does not validate the `service_name` provided by the user before passing it to `pam_start()`.
*   **OpenPAM Vulnerability:** `OpenPAM` does not sanitize the `service_name`, leading to directory traversal and arbitrary shared library loading.
*  **Abuse of PAM stacks:** kcheckpass allows users to invoke PAM stacks that were not intended for user access.
* **Setuid root:** `kcheckpass` is a setuid root program, so the arbitrary code execution happens with root privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to load arbitrary shared libraries and execute arbitrary code with root privileges, due to the setuid nature of `kcheckpass`.
*   **Unintended PAM Stack Execution:**  Users can invoke PAM stacks that were not intended for them, leading to various side effects like external server connections, log entries, notifications, or resource consumption.
*   **Bypass of System Policy:** Users can circumvent system security policies by selecting PAM stacks that grant them unauthorized access or actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Command-Line Argument:** An attacker can provide a malicious `service_name` as a command-line argument to `kcheckpass`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** The attacker needs to be a local user on the system where `kcheckpass` is installed and setuid root.
*  **Ability to execute kcheckpass:** The attacker must be able to execute the `kcheckpass` binary.
*   **Knowledge of PAM Configuration:** The attacker needs some knowledge of the PAM configuration to exploit the vulnerability effectively.

**Additional Details:**
* The vulnerability exists in OpenPAM as used in FreeBSD or Solaris. It has been tested on FreeBSD 8.1
*  The vulnerability also exists in Squid and Squid3 through their pam helper.
*  OpenPAM has since introduced a filter for the service name
* The service name was not intended to be user input.
* The issue is considered to be a vulnerability in both `kcheckpass` and `OpenPAM`.
