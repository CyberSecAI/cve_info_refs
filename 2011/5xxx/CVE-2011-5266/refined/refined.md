The provided content describes a SQL injection filter bypass vulnerability in Imperva SecureSphere Web Application Firewall (WAF).

**Root cause of vulnerability:** A typo in one of the SQL injection engine rules caused the WAF to misclassify a specific crafted string, leading to the bypass.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   SQL injection filter bypass.
*   The vulnerability stems from an incorrect rule in the WAF's SQL injection detection engine.

**Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can bypass the SQL injection filter, potentially leading to the ability to execute arbitrary SQL commands on the backend database, which could include data exfiltration, modification, or deletion.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The attack vector is remote, specifically through web requests.
*   The vulnerability is triggered when the WAF processes a web request containing a specific malicious payload.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected web application.
*   The attacker needs knowledge of the specific bypass string.

**Technical details:**

*   The specific crafted string that causes the bypass is: `15 and '1'=(SELECT '1' FROM dual) and '0having'='0having'`
*   The bypass is caused by the `and '0having'='0having'` part of the string.

**Additional Information**

*   The vulnerability was fixed on 12th August 2010.
*   The affected software is Imperva SecureSphere Web Application Firewall (WAF).
*   The severity of the vulnerability is considered high.
