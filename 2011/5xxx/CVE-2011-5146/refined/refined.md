Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-5146:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the Bokken application's insecure handling of temporary files. Specifically, it creates a temporary file named `/tmp/graph.dot` without proper checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Predictable Temporary File Creation:** Bokken creates a temporary file with a predictable name (`/tmp/graph.dot`).
*   **Symlink Vulnerability:** The application does not verify if the created `/tmp/graph.dot` is a symlink. This allows an attacker to create a symbolic link to an arbitrary file on the system.
*   **Unsafe File Overwrite:** Bokken overwrites the target of the symlink when writing to `/tmp/graph.dot` and unlinks it later which leads to arbitrary file overwrite.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** An attacker can overwrite arbitrary files on the system that are accessible to the user running Bokken, potentially leading to data loss, system compromise, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** An attacker with local access to a multi-user system where Bokken is installed can exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Account:** The attacker must have a user account on the system where Bokken is installed and the ability to create files and symlinks.
*   **Basic System Knowledge:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of symlinks and how to create them.

**Summary of Exploitation:**
1. Attacker creates a symlink `/tmp/graph.dot` pointing to an arbitrary file.
2. The user runs Bokken.
3. Bokken creates/overwrites the file pointed to by the symlink and then attempts to unlink `/tmp/graph.dot`, overwriting the attacker-specified file with generated dot data.

**Additional Information**

* The vulnerability was reported by a Debian developer and was fixed in Bokken version 1.5-3.
* The fix involved addressing the symlink vulnerability in `/tmp`.
* The provided bug report contains a detailed demonstration of the vulnerability and a trace of the application crashing when trying to unlink the symlinked temporary file.
