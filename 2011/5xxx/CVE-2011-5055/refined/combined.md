# MaraDNS 1 update

[Previous entry](20111229.html) -
[Next entry](20120101.html) -
[Blog index](/blog/idx.html)
## December 30 2011

Looking closely at [the patch I applied yesterday](20111229.html),
I realized that it had a couple of problems:

* Instead of the hash randomization having 24 bits of entropy, it only
  had 2 to 5 bits of entropy* The hash randomization would sometimes not do a good job of
    randomizing the hash buckets chosen, slowing down MaraDNS' performance

This in mind, I have release MaraDNS 1.3.07.13 and MaraDNS 1.4.09
today with both of these issues fixed. The hash randomization now has
31 bits of entropy, and the hash does a fairly good job of choosing a
random hash bucket again.

The tarball files can be found here:
> <http://maradns.org/download/1.3>
>
> <http://maradns.org/download/1.4>
> (also has Windows binary)

The patch is here:
