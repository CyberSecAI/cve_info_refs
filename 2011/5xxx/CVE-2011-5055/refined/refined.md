{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a flaw in MaraDNS's hash generation function. Specifically, the function does not properly restrict the ability to trigger hash collisions predictably.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Inadequate restriction of hash collisions",
      "Insufficient entropy in hash randomization"
    ],
    "impact": "A successful attack can lead to a denial of service (DoS) due to high CPU consumption on the server.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending crafted DNS queries with the Recursion Desired (RD) bit set, triggering hash collisions",
      "Crafted records in zone files, potentially impacting local users"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "Remote attackers can exploit this flaw by sending specific crafted DNS queries with the RD bit set. Local users with access to zone files can also exploit it by inserting crafted records.",
    "additional_details": "The initial patch for this issue had a couple of problems, including insufficient entropy in hash randomization and ineffective randomization of hash buckets. These problems were addressed in later versions (1.3.07.13 and 1.4.09)."
