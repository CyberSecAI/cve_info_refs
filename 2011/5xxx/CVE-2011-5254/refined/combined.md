How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### [Awesome plugin with Great Support](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/awesome-plugin-with-great-support-47/)

January 4, 2024

We decided to use Wordpress for a support site for our online store because the plugins allow adding some quick functionality without too much fuss, expense or programming.
We selected the Connections Business Directory plugin after reading the reviews, the level of author support and the cost. There are quite a few sites that showcased some of what is possible and so we dived in – I should also mention I am not an advanced WP user.
Using the plugin we just finished laying out a number of contractor search portals for our customers which will allow them to search by zipcode radius, or by multiple categories such state and by the types of services offered. We are able to map multiple addresses and the structure is versatile enough that I can see additional uses.
I got stuck in a few places while developing it do to my lack of knowledge but the author was very responsive on the forums and pointed me in the right direction – and in a couple of cases even supplied drop in code.
I am extremely satisfied by this plugin and recommend it for your consideration if you need to build any type of searchable directory.
