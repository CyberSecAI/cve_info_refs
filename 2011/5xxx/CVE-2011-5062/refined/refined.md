## Analysis of CVE-2011-5062

Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-5062:

**1. Verification of Relevance:**

The provided text from multiple sources, including the Debian security advisory, Red Hat Bugzilla entries, and Apache Tomcat security pages, all directly mention CVE-2011-5062. The official description for CVE-2011-5062 is "The HTTP Digest Access Authentication implementation in Apache Tomcat 5.5.x before 5.5.34, 6.x before 6.0.33 and 7.x before 7.0.12 does not check qop values, which might allow remote attackers to bypass intended integrity-protection requirements via a qop=auth value, a different vulnerability than CVE-2011-1184". All provided text confirms that CVE-2011-5062 is a component of a larger issue involving weaknesses in the HTTP DIGEST authentication within Apache Tomcat. Therefore, this content is deemed **RELEVANT**.

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
    *   The vulnerability stems from the fact that the HTTP Digest Access Authentication implementation in Apache Tomcat does not properly validate the "qop" (quality of protection) value provided in the authentication header. Specifically, the implementation fails to verify if a requested `qop` value is actually supported, or if the user is authorized to make the specified request.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper validation for the `qop` value within the HTTP Digest authentication process. The system accepts the `qop=auth` value without checking its validity or the user's permissions leading to a bypass of intended integrity protections.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Bypassing Integrity Protection:** By exploiting this vulnerability, a remote attacker can bypass intended integrity protection mechanisms, potentially performing actions they would not be authorized to do under correct digest authentication process.
    *   The vulnerability would allow a remote attacker to "bypass intended integrity-protection requirements". This suggests a potential for unauthorized modification of data or resources.
    *   The vulnerability is described as "a different vulnerability than CVE-2011-1184", implying that this vulnerability is related to, but distinct from, other issues related to digest authentication.

*  **Attack Vectors:**
  *   The attack vector is remote, as the attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the HTTP Digest authentication process via crafted HTTP requests, manipulating the `qop` parameter to achieve an authentication bypass.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Tomcat server. The attacker needs to have a way to perform the authentication handshake and modify the `qop` header of the HTTP request they are sending to the Tomcat server.
    *   No specific privileged access is required for the attacker to exploit the vulnerability, only access to the network interface exposed by the Tomcat server.
    *   The attacker needs a way to send a specially crafted request including the qop parameter, but not specifically to a service with access to the vulnerable service.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided information highlights that CVE-2011-5062 is not an isolated issue but part of a broader set of vulnerabilities impacting the HTTP Digest authentication in Apache Tomcat. It is specifically described as a distinct issue from CVE-2011-1184 but is related to the same underlying authentication logic, and the root cause is related to insufficient input validation.
*   The fix for this vulnerability involves modifications to the `DigestAuthenticator` class to correctly handle and validate the `qop` value which ultimately implements the proper HTTP Digest authentication mechanism..
*   Multiple vendors have issued security advisories to address this CVE in their products (e.g. Red Hat, Debian, and SUSE).
*   The vulnerability is present across multiple versions of Apache Tomcat (5.5.x, 6.x, and 7.x) suggesting a fundamental problem with the Digest authentication implementation in those versions.

**Summary:**

CVE-2011-5062 allows a remote attacker to bypass intended integrity protections within the Apache Tomcat HTTP DIGEST authentication due to a lack of proper validation of the `qop` value. The attacker can exploit this flaw by providing a `qop=auth` parameter in a crafted HTTP request, potentially resulting in unauthorized actions against a resource. The vulnerability requires no special privileges other than network access to the server. This issue is present in multiple versions of Tomcat and has been addressed by vendor updates.
