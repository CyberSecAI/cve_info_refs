- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `showImg.php` file in EPractize Labs Online Subscription Manager contains a backdoor that allows arbitrary file writes. The script uses `file_get_contents_me` (likely a custom function) to read the content of a file specified by the `db` parameter, then appends the value of the `email` parameter and a timestamp to the file if the `email` parameter's value is not already in the file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  - **Arbitrary file write:** The script allows writing arbitrary content to arbitrary files by manipulating the `db` and `email` parameters.
  - **Insecure file handling:** The script doesn't validate or sanitize the input file name and content, allowing for potential file overwrite or creation of new files with malicious content.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
  - An attacker can write arbitrary PHP code into a file (e.g. a php file on the webserver), and therefore gain full control of the webserver.
  - The script can be used to deface web pages by writing malicious content.
  - An attacker can potentially overwrite system files, which can lead to complete system compromise.
- **Attack vectors:**
  - By sending a crafted HTTP request to `showImg.php` with specific values for the `db` and `email` parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
  - The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable script.
  - The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
