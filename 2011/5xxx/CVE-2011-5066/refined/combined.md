  * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Sensitive Information might be logged   *
  *                      when SIB dumps the                      *
  *                      SibRaRecoverableSiXaResource object.    *
  ****************************************************************
  * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
  ****************************************************************
  The FFDC introspection code, which interrogates classes in
  order to print their private variables, caused the
  sensitive information to be printed within an FFDC, if that
  FFDC is written whilst processing code within the
  SibRaRecoverableSiXaResource class.

  ```

## Problem conclusion

* ```
  The SibRaRecoverableSiXaResource class has been altered to
  prevent the FFDC tool from writing the data to the FFDC.

  APAR PM36685 is currently targeted for inclusion in
  Service Level (Fix Pack) 6.1.0.41 of WebSphere
  Application Server V6.1.
