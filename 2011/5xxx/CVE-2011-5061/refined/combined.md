Security Patch

A security issue has been discovered that we consider to be of a high severity, and as a result we are releasing an immediate patch to address it.

Although not related to the new release, it is unfortunate timing so soon after the release, but we take security very seriously and so if an issue becomes apparent to us, we will always issue a patch for it as our track record with patches in recent years hopefully demonstrates.

Applying the patch is very simple. It's just one file to update. There are separate versions of the file for each release of WHMCS from V4.0 up to the very latest V5.0 release. The patch download consists of a single file which just needs to be unzipped, and then uploaded to the /includes/ folder replacing the existing file. Download links are as follows:

Version 4.0.x -> <http://www.whmcs.com/members/dl.php?type=d&id=107>

Version 4.1.x -> <http://www.whmcs.com/members/dl.php?type=d&id=108>

Version 4.2.x -> <http://www.whmcs.com/members/dl.php?type=d&id=109>

Version 4.3.x -> <http://www.whmcs.com/members/dl.php?type=d&id=110>

Version 4.4.x -> <http://www.whmcs.com/members/dl.php?type=d&id=111>

Version 4.5.x -> <http://www.whmcs.com/members/dl.php?type=d&id=112>

Version 5.0.x -> <http://www.whmcs.com/members/dl.php?type=d&id=113>

If you have any questions or need any assistance applying the patch, please do not hesitate to contact us.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

    > Very very disappointed to see that WHMCS took so long to fix this issue. It seems that the "bug" has been around ever since 4.0? I know that they acted extremely quickly when they saw the issue happening on servers - but that's too late!

    > I think many will make their judgements in a bad light for WHMCS after viewing this thread and quite rightly so. I don't like the way Matt tries to push the real matter (of the hacking) out of the way and argues about WHMCS's level of support with @VN-Ken. The point is, shouldn't this have been fixed months ago in a security patch?

Of course, it's unfortunate that it ever existed in the first place, but the fact is it was not known to either us or other people before now as otherwise we would have had a lot more reports of it being used. We would never sit on an issue knowingly which I think is what you're implying here, and as we've demonstrated a few times in recent years, if an issue comes to light a patch goes out asap for it.

Complaining you are running WHMCS 4.0 unpatched and that you got hacked is like running any version of Windows prior to 2000, giving it internet access, and then complaining it got hacked.

    > I've been hacked too buy this.. And I've applied the patches. I for one.. Also am disappointed WHMCS being the leading software out there is not using mysqli to prevent against SQL injection, and that you can use {php} tags in support tickets..

     > One thing every one can do... We have had attempts but none being successful. So.... If you get the ticket with it, and then you go (don't open the ticket) just copy the subject, go under 'Setup' 'Support' 'Spam Control' and add the subject under blocked phrases. It is an idea that MAY stop future attacks. I cannot guarantee it though. Just an idea that may be passed along...

     > If you are running WHMCS and your main site on its own vps or server, you may be able to also disable the eval() function in php.ini using the disable\_functions setting. WHMCS doesn't require it to work, and it would stop these attempts dead in their tracks regardless of whether you've patched or not.
