{
  "CVE-2011-5271": {
    "Description": "Pacemaker before 1.1.6 configure script creates temporary files insecurely.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The configure script creates temporary files in an insecure way using /tmp, making it vulnerable to race conditions and potential symlink attacks.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Insecure temporary file creation",
      "Race condition vulnerability",
      "Potential symlink attack"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could potentially overwrite arbitrary files or achieve privilege escalation by exploiting the insecure creation of temporary files during the build process. This could lead to unauthorized modification or disclosure of sensitive information, or arbitrary code execution within the build environment.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local exploitation during the build process. An attacker needs to be able to influence the build process.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be in a position to influence the build process or have local access to the system during the build process."
