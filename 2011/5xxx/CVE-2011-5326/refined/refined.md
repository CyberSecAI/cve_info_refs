Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2011-5326:

**CVE-2011-5326**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** A divide-by-zero error occurs when `imlib2` attempts to draw a 2x1 ellipse.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the ellipse drawing logic within `imlib2`, specifically when handling a 2x1 ellipse.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation leads to a denial of service (DoS) through a floating-point exception and application crash.
*  **Attack vectors:** Remote attackers can trigger this vulnerability by providing a crafted input that forces imlib2 to draw a 2x1 ellipse.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attackers need to be able to trigger the ellipse drawing function with specific dimensions (2x1) by providing a malicious input. No authentication is required, as the vulnerability is present in the image processing itself.

**Additional Notes**
* The vulnerability is present in `imlib2` versions prior to 1.4.9, according to the description in most sources.
*   Several sources indicate this issue is related to the drawing of an ellipse with a height of 1.
*   The vulnerability can be triggered via a crafted image file or by directly calling the `imlib_image_draw_ellipse` function with vulnerable parameters.
*   Patches have been made available to address this issue in `imlib2`.
