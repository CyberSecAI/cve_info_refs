{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `par_mktmpdir()` function in PAR::Packer creates temporary directories under `/tmp/par-[username]` without proper security checks.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure temporary directory creation",
      "Lack of ownership verification",
      "Insecure permissions on created directories",
      "Predictable directory names"
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker can potentially modify the cache directory and, possibly, the PAR-packaged program. This could allow for arbitrary code execution or data manipulation.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access to the system",
      "Manipulation of the temporary directory"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Local access to create files/directories with the same name and write to /tmp or other temporary directory"
  },
  "affected_components": [
    "perl-PAR-Packer",
    "perl-PAR"
  ],
  "cve_ids": [
    "CVE-2011-5060"
  ],
  "patch_information": [
    "Upstream fix for perl-PAR in version 1.003.",
     "Upstream fix for PAR-Packer in version 1.011.",
    "Patches for perl-PAR and perl-PAR-Packer were created and applied to Fedora 15 and 16."
  ],
    "additional_notes": [
    "CVE-2011-4114 was originally reported against PAR::Packer, but it also applies to PAR.",
        "The fix involves creating the parent cache directory with mode 0700 and verifying that it's not a symlink, has mode 0700 and owned by the user."
