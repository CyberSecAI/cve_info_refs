Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the identified vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of proper output sanitization in the error handling mechanism. Specifically, the `$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']` was being directly outputted to the 404 error page without being escaped, allowing for the injection of malicious HTML/JavaScript.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. This occurs because user-controlled input (the request URI) is included in the response without proper sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the 404 error page which will be executed in the victim's browser. This can lead to a variety of malicious activities including:
   - Stealing cookies and session tokens.
   - Redirecting users to malicious sites.
   - Defacing the website.
   - Potentially gaining control over the user's browser.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A malicious user craft a URL containing Javascript code.
- The application will return a 404 page, where the injected malicious Javascript code will be executed when the vulnerable page is rendered in a user's browser.
- Attacker could distribute the malicious URL via email, messaging or any means which a user might be enticed to click the link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with the malicious Javascript payload within the URI.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated and can exploit the vulnerability remotely.

**Additional Details:**

The provided commit `59f81ea6bd8ef96c04a706a3ca453cd656284faa` fixes the issue by escaping the `$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']` using `htmlspecialchars()`. This ensures that any HTML or JavaScript code within the URI is rendered as plain text and not executed by the browser, effectively mitigating the XSS vulnerability.
