#### Description

The attacker can inject the given value into session map by clicking following URL.

<http://example.com/SomeAction.action?session.somekey=someValue>

[[A session value is overwrited by demanding a browser. ]]

FROM: hisato.killing@gmail.com

TO: struts-dev

>>>>

1.This problem is caused in struts 2.0.9 and others perhaps.

In that case, it is assumed that it is as follows.

i. SomeAction is implements SessionAware.

ii. And It is defined in struts-default.

iii. devMode is true or false.

["someValue"] of the name of "someKey" enters in SessionMap when the

request shown in that URL is processed.

It is meant that ["someValue"] is an array including "someValue".

This causes ClassCastException in case of almost.

hisato.killing@gmail.com

It is thought that this only has to be my mistake ,setting etc.

Thanks

### Struts 2 Session Tampering via SessionAware/RequestAware WW-3631

*UPDATE: This post was updated on 1/2/2012 to correct the post to take into account the fact that the interfaces mentioned below bind request parameters to String[] rather then String. See the post for exact details.*

*NOTE 1: I am not the original reporter of this issue. The issue below, with regards to the [SessionAware](http://struts.apache.org/2.0.11/struts2-core/apidocs/org/apache/struts2/interceptor/SessionAware.html), was originally reported to the Struts 2 team as [WW-2264](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/WW-2264) by Hisato Killing. At that time, it was decided by the Struts 2 team that this was "Not A Problem". Back in May 2011 I identified the identical issue without previous knowledge of Hisato’s bug report and I reported it to the Struts 2 team as [WW-3631](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/WW-3631) ([CVE-2011-5057](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-5057)). A former colleague of mine, Abraham Kang who is now a Principal Security Researcher at Fortify an HP Company, urged me to include a reference to the [RequestAware](http://struts.apache.org/2.0.11/struts2-core/apidocs/org/apache/struts2/interceptor/RequestAware.html) Interface and also indicated other \*Aware interfaces could also be dangerous.*

*NOTE 2: This issue does not affect every application that uses Struts 2 - only those that have Actions that implement [SessionAware](http://struts.apache.org/2.0.11/struts2-core/apidocs/org/apache/struts2/interceptor/SessionAware.html), [RequestAware](http://struts.apache.org/2.0.11/struts2-core/apidocs/org/apache/struts2/interceptor/RequestAware.html), and possibly other \*Aware interfaces either directly or indirectly, and make no attempt to block the auto-binding of the request or session collections.*

*NOTE 3: Regarding the Secunia Advisor for this issue [47109](http://secunia.com/advisories/47109/) - it is listed as "Not Critical". I completely agree as there are very few Struts 2 applications that implement these interfaces. However, if your application does implement these interfaces it is likely a **big** problem, luckily the solution is fairly easy.*

Apache Struts 2.x contains interfaces [org.apache.struts2.interceptor.SessionAware](http://struts.apache.org/2.0.11/struts2-core/apidocs/org/apache/struts2/interceptor/SessionAware.html) and [org.apache.struts2.interceptor.RequestAware](http://struts.apache.org/2.0.11/struts2-core/apidocs/org/apache/struts2/interceptor/RequestAware.html).

Example implementation of [SessionAware](http://struts.apache.org/2.0.11/struts2-core/apidocs/org/apache/struts2/interceptor/SessionAware.html):
```
public class VulnerableAction extends ActionSupport
implements Action, SessionAware {

  protected Map session;

  @Override
  public void setSession(final Map session) {
    this.session = session;
  }

  ...

```

As one would expect from the auto-binding of Struts2 that if an Action implements either of these interfaces it allows the auto-binding of data to the current session or request using the most common implementation (any changes made via the auto-binding may not persist past this single request, read on for more details). This could allow unexpected data to exist within the session by passing in request parameters such as "?session.key=value" or "?request.session.key=value" - these types of request parameters would be auto-bound to the current requests session map (generally a class level variable). When Struts2 binds these parameters they are bound as String arrays rather then a simple String. As such, the impact of this vulnerability is somewhat reduced - however, it is possible to use this technique to auto-bind to public setters of objects stored in the session.

If an object has a setValue(String) method and is stored within the session using the key "data" ; if one passed the following query string parameter "?session.data.value=authorized"; this would alter the field and set the value to "authorized". Note, when binding to public setters on objects within the session Struts2 does not force them to be String[].

While the two interfaces only require the implementation of the setSession and setRequest respectively, if one also implemented either getSession or getRequest respectively then the changes to the contents of the session will be persisted to users' actual session - rather than just the current request (e.g. the local member variable).

Doing a Google code search will reveal some open source packages that are vulnerable to this:

<http://www.google.com/codesearch#search/&q=%2BgetSession%20org.apache.struts2.interceptor%20SessionAware%20%20lang:%5Ejava$&type=cs>

<http://www.google.com/codesearch#search/&q=org.apache.struts2.interceptor%20RequestAware%20getRequest%20lang:%5Ejava$&type=cs>

Any system that implements Apache 2.x [SessionAware](http://struts.apache.org/2.0.11/struts2-core/apidocs/org/apache/struts2/interceptor/SessionAware.html), [RequestAware](http://struts.apache.org/2.0.11/struts2-core/apidocs/org/apache/struts2/interceptor/RequestAware.html), and/or other \*Aware interfaces is affected by this unless they explicitly implemented something to block the parameter auto-binding to the implemented setters. Implementing getSession, getRequest, or a getter corresponding to the implemented setter makes the problem worse. The impact of this specific vulnerability is completely dependent upon the application that implements the interface and what the application uses the session data for.

There is an easy solution to this problem. Prevent auto-binding of the request and session via the default parameter interceptor by placing them into the ignored parameter list. Second, a warning should be placed in the JavaDoc for [SessionAware](http://struts.apache.org/2.0.11/struts2-core/apidocs/org/apache/struts2/interceptor/SessionAware.html), [RequestAware](http://struts.apache.org/2.0.11/struts2-core/apidocs/org/apache/struts2/interceptor/RequestAware.html), and possibly other \*Aware interfaces indicating the possible issues with implementing this class and recommend that any Action that implements these interfaces also implement [com.opensymphony.xwork2.interceptor.ParameterNameAware](http://struts.apache.org/2.0.14/struts2-core/apidocs/com/opensymphony/xwork2/interceptor/ParameterNameAware.html) interface and checking to ensure that any parameters starting with “session” and/or “request” are not being auto-bound.

This was reported via Apache's JIRA system in May 2011: <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/WW-3631>. The Struts 2 team stated that a fix would be in version 3.x; and they agreed with me that there is an easy fix and any application implementing these interfaces could easily fix the issue themselves. However, as people are obviously using these interfaces in their code and not implementing the fix - I'd like to post this in a little more public fashion to ensure people are aware of the possible issues if they do implement these interfaces.

I should point out a listing of other \*Aware interfaces that are likely of interest:

* org.apache.struts2.interceptor.[ApplicationAware](http://struts.apache.org/2.0.11/struts2-core/apidocs/org/apache/struts2/interceptor/ApplicationAware.html)

+ may lead to application context tampering

* org.apache.struts2.interceptor.[RequestAware](http://struts.apache.org/2.0.11/struts2-core/apidocs/org/apache/struts2/interceptor/RequestAware.html)

+ Request collection and/or Session collection tampering

* org.apache.struts2.interceptor.[ServletRequestAware](http://struts.apache.org/2.0.11/struts2-core/apidocs/org/apache/struts2/interceptor/ServletRequestAware.html)

+ Request collection and/or Session collection tampering and possibly other concerns

* org.apache.struts2.interceptor.[ServletResponseAware](http://struts.apache.org/2.0.11/struts2-core/apidocs/org/apache/struts2/interceptor/ServletResponseAware.html)
* org.apache.struts2.interceptor.[ParameterAware](http://struts.apache.org/2.0.11/struts2-core/apidocs/org/apache/struts2/interceptor/ParameterAware.html)

An additional research item is the [DirectRenderFromEventAction](http://struts.apache.org/2.0.11/struts2-core/apidocs/org/apache/struts2/portlet/dispatcher/DirectRenderFromEventAction.html) as this implements the [SessionAware](http://struts.apache.org/2.0.11/struts2-core/apidocs/org/apache/struts2/interceptor/SessionAware.html) Interface.

This has also been reported under *[CVE-2011-5057](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-5057).*

#### Description

This was previously raised as an issue under [~~WW-2264~~](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/WW-2264 "A session value is overwrited by requesting."). After the discussion it was determined that this is not a bug - I disagree and would like to raise the issue again.

If an Action implements SessionAware the contents of the session are modifiable, this includes the public setters on objects stored in the session.

Ok, for the Action to be able to modify the contents of the session it must also implement a "public Map getSession()". However, even if the Action does not implement a getSession method it is still possible for an attacker to tamper with the contents of the HttpSession and affect the processesing of the Action.

I agree with the solutions previously discussed in [~~WW-2264~~](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/WW-2264 "A session value is overwrited by requesting.") that 'session' should be added to the parameter exclusion list in the struts-default.xml. Additionally, a warning should be added to the JavaDoc for SessionAware indicating the possible issue with exposing the session via the interface and that if the configuration of the intercepters does not explicitly exclude 'session' in the paramExclude node that it is possible for a requester to modify the session.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
