Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of capability checks in the `press-this.php` file when setting the post status. Specifically, the original code directly set the post status to "publish" if the `publish` parameter was present in the POST data, without verifying if the user had the `publish_posts` capability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Inadequate Authorization:** The code did not properly check user capabilities before allowing a post to be published.
- **Direct POST parameter usage:** The code directly used the presence of the 'publish' parameter in POST data to set the post status without proper authorization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Publication:** A user with the 'contributor' role (who normally cannot publish posts directly) could potentially publish a post by manipulating the POST data when using the "Press This" functionality. This bypasses the intended user roles and permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Manipulated POST Request:** An attacker could craft a POST request to the `press-this.php` script with the `publish` parameter set, even if their user role does not have the `publish_posts` capability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have a WordPress user account with at least the 'contributor' role.
- The attacker would need to access and use the "Press This" feature, which is typically available in the WordPress admin interface. They also need to be able to craft a POST request to the relevant endpoint.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix involved adding a check using `current_user_can('publish_posts')` before setting the post status to 'publish'.
- If the user doesn't have 'publish_posts', but sets a review parameter, it will set the status to pending. Otherwise it will set the status to 'draft'.
