Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-5155:

**Verification:**

The content from `www.zeroscience.mk` explicitly mentions CVE-2011-5155 as a reference for the vulnerability it describes, confirming the relevance of this content to the specified CVE.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a DLL hijacking issue within Help & Manual Professional Edition 5.5.1. The application loads the `ijl15.dll` (Intel's library) without proper validation or path specification.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of secure DLL loading, making the application susceptible to DLL hijacking. It attempts to load `ijl15.dll` from a potentially attacker-controlled path.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine. This can result in complete system compromise.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is local or remote, which implies that an attacker could either place a malicious DLL in a location the application will search or deliver a malicious file (like a hmxz, hmxp, hmskin, hmx, hm3, hpj, hlp and chm) that will trigger the vulnerable loading routine.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be able to place or trick the user to place a malicious `ijl15.dll` into a location where the application will find it or trick the user to open a maliciously crafted file.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to Help & Manual Professional Edition version 5.5.1 Build 1296.
*   The vulnerable file extensions include hmxz, hmxp, hmskin, hmx, hm3, hpj, hlp, and chm, which are likely used by the application and trigger the vulnerable code path.
*   A proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit is available and referenced in the provided content `helpmanual_dll.c`.
