Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the security vulnerability fixed in WordPress Sentinel version 1.0.1:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The provided content indicates the presence of "Security vulnerabilities" that were fixed in version 1.0.1 of the WordPress Sentinel plugin. However, the specific nature of these vulnerabilities is not disclosed in the provided text.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

The exact vulnerabilities are not described in detail, but the changelog indicates:

*   "Fixed Security vulnerabilities"

It can be inferred there were potential flaws in the plugin's code that could have been exploited.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

The potential impact of these vulnerabilities is not explicitly stated. However, based on the plugin's function (monitoring file changes for potential hacks), possible impacts of exploiting these vulnerabilities could include:

*   **Bypassing the Sentinel:** Attackers could potentially manipulate the plugin to prevent detection of malicious file changes.
*   **Injection of Malicious code**: Attackers could potentially introduce malicious code within the plugin itself.
*   **Compromise of the System**: Attackers could potentially compromise the entire Wordpress site by leveraging the plugin weaknesses.

**Attack Vectors:**

The attack vectors are not specifically outlined. However, common attack vectors in WordPress plugins include:

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Exploiting vulnerabilities in user input handling to inject malicious scripts.
*   **SQL Injection:** Exploiting flaws in database queries to gain unauthorized access or modify data.
*   **File Inclusion/Disclosure:** Exploiting vulnerabilities to access sensitive files on the server.
*   **Unvalidated input:** Exploiting lack of validation of parameters passed to the plugin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker would need to be able to interact with the vulnerable plugin to trigger the exploit. This could range from having a user account with specific permissions on the targeted WordPress instance, to exploiting publicly accessible entry points.
*   Specific skills for the vulnerability exploited (e.g., ability to craft malicious SQL queries, malicious scripts, etc).
*  Access to a Wordpress site with the vulnerable plugin installed.

**Additional Details:**

*   The fix was implemented in version 1.0.1.
*   The changelog mentions thanks to Julio from boiteaweb.fr, suggesting that the vulnerabilities were reported by them.
*   The plugin's description and changelog point out an additional security improvement was the change of the "Snapshot Everything" button to "Snapshot Everything New", which prevents unintentional overwriting of existing snapshot data. This change suggests that the old "Snapshot Everything" button was a potential attack vector, either by creating a denial of service situation or by erasing legitimate snapshot information, making detecting an intrusion more difficult.

**Summary:**

The provided information indicates the presence of unspecified security vulnerabilities in the WordPress Sentinel plugin that were addressed in version 1.0.1. The vulnerabilities could have potentially been exploited to bypass the sentinel, inject malicious code, or gain unauthorized access. The specific attack vectors and required attacker capabilities were not explicitly outlined, but common web application attack vectors are applicable.
