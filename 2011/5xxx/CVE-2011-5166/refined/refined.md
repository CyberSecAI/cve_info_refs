  "CVE-2011-5166": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "Buffer overflow in KnFTP server due to insufficient bounds checking when processing various FTP commands, including USER, PASS, MKD, LS, ABOR, CD, APPE, REST, and PWD.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
        "Buffer overflow"
      ],
      "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary code execution by overwriting the Extended Instruction Pointer (EIP) or Structured Exception Handler (SEH). Denial of service by crashing the application. Bypassing DEP(Data Execution Prevention) can be achieved by using ROP.",
      "Attack vectors": "Sending crafted FTP commands with oversized arguments to the vulnerable KnFTP server.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to connect to the FTP service on port 21 of the target system."
    },
        {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is triggered by sending an overly long string as a USER command during the authentication process of the FTP server. The application doesn't properly validate the length of the input, leading to a buffer overflow.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
        "Buffer overflow"
      ],
      "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary code execution. This allows an attacker to gain control of the target machine by injecting and executing malicious code.",
       "Attack vectors": "Sending a specially crafted 'USER' command to the server.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Remote attacker with network access to the vulnerable FTP service."
    },
    {
        "Root cause of vulnerability": "Multiple buffer overflows exist in KnFTP server due to lack of proper bounds checking when processing various FTP commands.",
        "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
            "Buffer overflow"
        ],
        "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service due to the application crashing when processing crafted commands that trigger a buffer overflow.",
        "Attack vectors": "Sending oversized arguments with FTP commands like MKD, LS, ABOR, CD, APPE, REST, and PWD.",
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to connect to the FTP service on port 21."
    },
    {
         "Root cause of vulnerability": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the KnFTP server software. This flaw occurs because the software does not properly validate the length of input provided to the USER command. The vulnerable function copies the user supplied data to a fixed sized buffer without bounds checking.",
        "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
            "Buffer overflow"
        ],
        "Impact of exploitation": "Remote Code Execution. An attacker can exploit this to gain control of the target machine by injecting and executing arbitrary code. The vulnerability can also be used to cause a denial of service by causing the application to crash.",
        "Attack vectors": "By sending an overly long string in the USER command. After sending the 'USER' command, sending a 'PASS' command is required to complete the attack.",
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Remote attacker capable of establishing a TCP connection to the target on port 21."
