Alert
# Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) Vulnerable to Brute-Force Attack

Last RevisedJanuary 23, 2013
Alert CodeTA12-006A

### Systems Affected

Most Wi-Fi access points that support Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) are affected.

### Overview

Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) provides simplified mechanisms to configure secure wireless networks. The external registrar PIN exchange mechanism is susceptible to brute-force attacks that could allow an attacker to gain access to an encrypted Wi-Fi network.

WPS uses a PIN as a shared secret to authenticate an access point and a client and provide connection information such as WEP and WPA passwords and keys. In the external registrar exchange method, a client needs to provide the correct PIN to the access point.

An attacking client can try to guess the correct PIN. A design vulnerability reduces the effective PIN space sufficiently to allow practical brute force attacks. Freely available attack tools can recover a WPS PIN in 4-10 hours.

For further details, please see Vulnerability Note [VU#723755](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/723755) and documentation by [Stefan Viehböck](http://sviehb.wordpress.com/2011/12/27/wi-fi-protected-setup-pin-brute-force-vulnerability/) and [Tactical Network Solutions](http://www.tacnetsol.com/news/2011/12/28/cracking-wifi-protected-setup-with-reaver.html).

### Impact

An attacker within radio range can brute-force the WPS PIN for a vulnerable access point. The attacker can then obtain WEP or WPA passwords and likely gain access to the Wi-Fi network. Once on the network, the attacker can monitor traffic and mount further attacks.

### Solution

**Update Firmware**

Check your access point vendor's support website for updated firmware that addresses this vulnerability. Further information may be available in the [Vendor Information](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/723755#vendors) section of VU#723755 and in a Google spreadsheet called [WPS Vulnerability Testing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ags-JmeLMFP2dFp2dkhJZGIxTTFkdFpEUDNSSHZEN3c).

**Disable WPS**

Depending on the access point, it may be possible to disable WPS. Note that some access points may not actually disable WPS when the web management interface indicates that WPS is disabled.

Brute forcing Wi-Fi
Protected Setup

When poor design meets poor implementation.

Introduction
“Wi-Fi Protected Setup™ is an optional certification program from the Wi-Fi Alliance that is designed to
ease the task of setting up and configuring security on wireless local area networks. Introduced by the
Wi-Fi Alliance in early 2007, the program provides an industry-wide set of network setup solutions for
homes and small office (SOHO) environments.

Wi-Fi  Protected  Setup  enables  typical  users  who  possess  little  understanding  of  traditional  Wi-Fi
configuration and security settings to automatically configure new wireless networks, add new devices
and  enable  security.  More  than  200  products  have  been  Wi-Fi  CERTIFIED™  for  Wi-Fi  Protected  Setup
since the program was launced (sic!) in January 2007.”1

The  Wi-Fi  Simple  Configuration  Specification  (WSC)  is  the  underlying  technology  for  the  Wi-Fi
Protected Setup certification.

Almost  all  major  vendors  (including  Cisco/Linksys,  Netgear,  D-Link,  Belkin,  Buffalo,  ZyXEL  and
Technicolor) have WPS-certified devices, other vendors (eg. TP-Link) ship devices with WPS-support
which are not WPS-certified.

WPS is activated by default on all devices I had access to.

Although WPS is marketed as being a secure way of configuring a wireless device, there are design
and  implementation  flaws  which  enable  an  attacker  to  gain  access  to  an  otherwise  sufficiently
secured wireless network.

Configuration Options Overview
WPS  supports  out-of-band  configuration  over  Ethernet/UPnP  (also  NFC  is  mentioned  in  the
specification)  or  in-band  configuration  over  IEEE  802.11/EAP.  Only  in-band  configuration  will  be
covered in this paper.

Terminology2

  The enrollee is a new device that does not have the settings for the wireless network.
  The registrar provides wireless settings to the enrollee.
  The  access  point  provides  normal  wireless  network  hosting  and  also  proxies  messages

between the enrollee and the registrar.

Push-Button-Connect (“PBC”)
The user has to push a button, either an actual or virtual one, on both the Access Point and the new
wireless  client  device.  PBC  on  the  AP  will  only  be  active  until  authentication  has  succeeded  or
timeout after two minutes.

This  Option  is  called  wps_pbc  in  wpa_cli3  (text-based  frontend  program  for  interacting  with
wpa_supplicant).

as enrollee) (Windows 7)

PIN

Internal Registrar
The user has  to enter the  PIN of the  Wi-Fi adapter into the web interface of the access point. The
PIN can either be printed on the label of the adapter or generated by software.

This option is called wps_pin in wpa_cli.

External Registrar
The user has to enter the PIN of the access point into a form on the client device (eg. computer).

This option is called wps_reg in wpa_cli.

Design flaw #2
An attacker can derive information about the correctness of parts the PIN from the AP´s responses.





If the attacker receives an EAP-NACK message after sending M4, he knows that the 1st half
of the PIN was incorrect.
If the attacker receives an EAP-NACK message after sending M6, he knows that the 2nd half
of the PIN was incorrect.

This form of authentication dramatically decreases the maximum possible authentication attempts
needed from 108 (=100.000.000) to 104 + 104 (=20.000).

As the 8th digit of the PIN is always a checksum of digit one to  digit seven, there are at most 104 +
103 (=11.000) attempts needed to find the correct PIN.

Brute Force Methodology

force attack works

Brute Force Implementation
A  proof-of-concept  brute  force  tool  was  implemented  in  Python.  It  uses  the  Scapy5  Library  for
decoding, generating, sending and receiving packets. This tool was used on several routers made by
different vendors.

Results

Authentication attempt duration
One authentication attempt usually took between 0.5 and 3 seconds to complete. It was observed
that the calculation of the Diffie-Hellman Shared Key (needs to be done before generating M3) on
the AP took a big part of the authentication time. This can be speeded up by choosing a very small
DH Secret Number, thus generating a very small DH Public Key and making  Shared Key calculation
on the AP’s side easier.

Implementation Flaws
Some  vendors  did  not  implement  any  kind  of  blocking  mechanism  to  prevent  brute  force  attacks.
This  allows  an  attacker  to  try  all  possible  PIN  combinations  in  less  than  four  hours  (at  1.3
seconds/attempt).

On average an attack will succeed in half the time.

The  Netgear  device  has  lock  down  functionality  implemented,  but  the  lock  down  phases  are  not
long enough to make an attack impractical. In this case an attack will on average succeed in less than
a day (timing data can be found on the next page).

In rare cases devices started to send malformed messages or their web interface and routing did not
work properly anymore. A reboot was needed to solve the problem. This might be evidence of some
kind of corruption, but was not investigated further.

6 WPS-functionality always stopped to work somewhere between 2 and 150 failed authentication
attempts. The functionality did not even return after several hours. I would consider this a bug in
the firmware which causes a DoS rather than lock-down functionality.

Deactivate WPS. This may not always be possible.

Lock down configurations making

Assumed time per attempt: 1.3 seconds

Considering that an AP typically runs for several months, a determined attacker might still be able
to  successfully  attack  a  WPS-enabled  AP.  This  attack  is  low-cost  and  has  a  high  success  guarantee
compared to cracking WPA/WPA2-PSK.

Conclusion
As nearly all major router/AP vendors have WPS-certified devices and WPS – PIN (External Registrar)
is  mandatory  for  certification,  it  is  expected  that  a  lot  of  devices  are  vulnerable  to  this  kind  of
attack.

Having  a  sufficiently  long  lock-down  period  is  most  likely  not  a  requirement  for  certification.
However it might be a requirement in the (new) WSC Specification Version 28. I contacted the Wi-Fi
Alliance about this – they have yet to respond.

Collaboration  with  vendors  will  be  necessary  for  identifying  all  vulnerable  devices.  It  is  up  to  the
vendors to implement mitigations and release new firmware.

Affected end-users will have to be informed about this vulnerability and advised to  disable WPS or
update their firmware to a more secure version (if available).

7 No consistent lock down pattern was found. However on average about 4.20 authentication
attempts per minute were possible.

| | Cisco Security AdvisoryWi-Fi Protected Setup PIN Brute Force Vulnerability Informational   Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-20120111-wps  First Published: 2012 January 11 16:00 GMT  Last Updated:  2012 February 29 20:15 GMT  Version 4.0:  [Final](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#final)            Email      Summary  * On December 27th, 2011 US-CERT released VU#723755 available here:<http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/723755>  The US-CERT Vulnerability Note describes a vulnerability that exists in the Wi-Fi Alliance Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) certification program. The WPS certification program is based on the Wi-Fi Simple Configuration protocol, in which an Access Point (AP) has a static PIN that allows access and configuration from an External Registrar (ER). An AP with WPS enabled and configured to use a static PIN will allow a WPS-capable ER, that provides the correct PIN, to join a properly secured network. A weakness in the protocol affects all APs that have a static PIN, and may allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to use brute force calculations to determine the AP's PIN in a short amount of time.  The vulnerability is due to a flaw that allows an attacker to determine when the first four digits of the eight-digit PIN are known. This effectively reduces the PIN space from 107 or 10,000,000 possible values to 104 + 103, which is 11,000 possible values. The eighth digit of the PIN is utilized as a checksum of the first seven digits and does not contribute to the available PIN space. Because the PIN space has been significantly reduced, an attacker could find the WPS PIN in as little as a few hours.  The affected devices listed below implement a 60-second lockout after three unsuccessful attempts to authenticate to the device. While this does not substantially mitigate this issue, it does increase the time to exploit the protocol weakness from a few hours to at most several days. It is our recommendation to disable the WPS feature to prevent exploitation of this vulnerability.

## WiFi Protected Setup (WPS) PIN brute force vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#723755

Original Release Date: 2011-12-27 | Last Revised: 2012-05-10

---

### Overview

The WiFi Protected Setup (WPS) PIN is susceptible to a brute force attack. A design flaw that exists in the WPS specification for the PIN authentication significantly reduces the time required to brute force the entire PIN because it allows an attacker to know when the first half of the 8 digit PIN is correct. The lack of a proper lock out policy after a certain number of failed attempts to guess the PIN on many wireless routers makes this brute force attack that much more feasible.

### Description

| WiFi Protected Setup (WPS) is a computing standard created by the WiFi Alliance to ease the setup and securing of a wireless home network. WPS contains an authentication method called "external registrar" that only requires the router's PIN. By design this method is susceptible to brute force attacks against the PIN.  When the PIN authentication fails the access point will send an EAP-NACK message back to the client. The EAP-NACK messages are sent in a way that an attacker is able to determine if the first half of the PIN is correct. Also, the last digit of the PIN is known because it is a checksum for the PIN. This design greatly reduces the number of attempts needed to brute force the PIN. The number of attempts goes from 10^8 to 10^4 + 10^3 which is 11,000 attempts in total.It has been reported that many wireless routers do not implement any kind of lock out policy for brute force attempts. This greatly reduces the time required to perform a successful brute force attack. It has also been reported that some wireless routers resulted in a denial-of-service condition because of the brute force attempt and required a reboot. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker within range of the wireless access point may be able to brute force the WPS PIN and retrieve the password for the wireless network, change the configuration of the access point, or cause a denial of service. |
| --- |

### Solution

| We are currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem. Please consider the following workarounds: |
| --- |

| **Disable WPS**Within the wireless router's configuration menu, disable the external registrar feature of WiFi Protected Setup (WPS). Depending on the vendor, this may be labeled as external registrar, router PIN, or WiFi Protected Setup. |

### Vendor Information

The vendor states that Technicolor products use an anti brute-force mechanism: after 5 retries, the access point is locked for 5 minutes. A penetration test performed by the vendor found that to exhaust every possible PIN would take around 189.44 hours (about 7.89 days).

Technicolor will follow the WiFi Alliance (WFA) recommendation concerning the fix for this vulnerability to keep WFA certification for their devices. Technicolor will implement the following:

Access point is locked after 10 faulty PIN code attempts. Then, the end-user resets the access point lock state via the GUI/CLI or a reboot of the access point.

Customers should contact the vendor to inquiry when firmware updates will be available that include this feature.

It is possible to disable WPS completely using the command line interface (when available) by issuing the following command:

### Wi-Fi Protected Setup PIN brute force vulnerability

Filed under: [advisories](https://sviehb.wordpress.com/category/advisories/) — Stefan @ 3:00 am

A few weeks ago I decided to take a look at the [Wi-Fi Protected Setup](http://www.wi-fi.org/wifi-protected-setup/) (WPS) technology. I noticed a few really bad design decisions which enable an efficient brute force attack, thus effectively breaking the security of pretty much all WPS-enabled Wi-Fi routers. As all of the more recent router models come with WPS enabled by default, this affects millions of devices worldwide.

I reported this vulnerability to [CERT/CC](http://www.cert.org/) and provided them with a list of (confirmed) affected vendors. CERT/CC has assigned [VU#723755](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/723755) to this issue.

To my knowledge **none** of the vendors have reacted and released firmware with mitigations in place.

Detailed information about this vulnerability can be found in this paper: **[Brute forcing Wi-Fi Protected Setup](https://sviehb.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/viehboeck_wps.pdf)** – Please keep in mind that the devices mentioned there are just a tiny subset of the affected devices.

I would like to thank the guys at CERT for coordinating this vulnerability.

**Update (12/29/2011 – 20:15 CET)**

As you probably already know, this vulnerability was **independently** discovered by Craig Heffner ([/dev/ttyS0](http://www.devttys0.com/ "/dev/ttyS0"), [Tactical Network Solutions](http://www.tacnetsol.com/)) as well – I was just the one who reported the vulnerability and released information about it first. Craig and his team have now released their tool “Reaver” over at [Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/reaver-wps/).

My PoC Brute Force Tool can be found [here](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/22108808/wpscrack.zip). It’s a bit faster than Reaver, but will not work with all Wi-Fi adapters.

**Update (12/31/2011 – 14:25 CET)**

**Update (04/01/2012 – 17:45 CET)**Tactical Network Solutions has decided to release the code for the commercial version of [Reaver](http://code.google.com/p/reaver-wps/). You might want to check it out.

   * Netgear has a so called Push´N Connect Button on router devices. The WPS function is only working for a short time. So they are probably safe!? The vulnerability needs some time for brute forcing.

3. “will be released once I get around to cleaning up the code”

   For most people this means “never”. I’d rather get a chunk of dirty code and try to figure it out than have to try to re-implement this attack from scratch.

   Please post your messy broken code.

   * Seconded. In fact, since it’s such an important part of the paper, arguably the code “not being ready” means the paper isn’t, either. But even if you disagree with that, then this still leaves people shorthanded verifying a) their devices are vulnerable and b) they’ve successfully mitigated the problem by turning off the feature. Wouldn’t be the first time shoddy firmware says one thing but does another. As such, the only remedy now is to take every last AP offline until someone gets around to releasing a tool to check mitigation.

5. If the code is not ready, in the interim it would at least be useful to have a way to confirm whether a particular access point implements the “External Registrar” method of WPS. Looking at several of the ones in my possession, it was unclear which ones are affected. One device has the Push Button Connect physical button but it does nothing and manufacturer documentation says WPS is not implemented and is reserved for future use. Another device has no physical button but implements the “Internal Registrar” method of WPS through the network admin interface, and may also implement the External Registrar method, but I have no way to easily confirm that.

     elif (self.rcved.is\_set() is False): to elif (self.rcved.set() is False):

     Now I get the same problem as other posts with being stuck at PIN 00000 (even after updating to python-scapy 2.2.0)

21. The other mitigation that should be recommended is to never send EAP-NACK in response to the first half of the PIN. Always send the second half of the negotiation, and send EAP-NACK in response to the second half of the PIN if either half was incorrect. That brings the required number of brute force attempts back up to 10^7, which means it will take over 150 days to search the entire space with your assumed attack time of 1.3 seconds per attack, even without any lock down (or 75 days, on average, to find the PIN).

    Rather than a complete lock down after a few failed attempts, I think it would be better to introduce a delay after receiving a few (5 or 10) failed attempts. A 30-second delay per failed attempt requires 1,811 days (4.9 years) on average to find the PIN, 60 seconds requires 3,547 days (9.7 years). This has the advantage that a legitimate client with the correct PIN can still authenticate, even if the device is under a brute force attack. A 30-second delay strikes me as a good compromise between resistance to brute force attacks and responding to legitimate requests.

    If it’s difficult for the attacker to spoof their MAC address, then a per-MAC-address complete lock down is even better. It can provide a much longer average time to find the PIN (a 60-minute lock down after 5 failed attempts leads to a 114-year average time to find the PIN) while still allowing legitimate clients with a different MAC address to authenticate. But if the attacker can send each request with a different MAC address they can bypass the lock down.

    (All of these average times to find the PIN assume the first countermeasure described above is applied, of course.)

    * MAC spoofing is trivial — so trivial that it should never be used as the basis for security. A network card’s MAC address can be changed in microseconds, and there are about 281,474,976,711,000 addresses to choose from.

    * The no NACK idea is good – thanks … I’ll add this to add this to the WPS 2.1 testplan.

      The current specification and testplans recommend delays and lockouts – it’s just that vendors were lazy and only met the minimum required for certification testing.

      + Some associates pointed out that never sending a NACK does NOT help. If you send a correct next message it exposes the second half PIN. If you send the wrong second half – it’s detectable and just adds a little more work beyond the current attack.

23. Are you sure that all of these routers leave WPS on all the time? WPS is only supposed to be “on” when the person presses the physical or virtual button on the router to start a WPS transaction. What’s supposed to happen is the router only does WPS for a certain window period after the button is pressed on it. It’s not supposed to be doing WPS all the time.

25. Just turn wps off (i guess for some routers don’t hit the button, hated that with linksys routers of old in work settings…someone would eventually hit the button which was the linksys logo that wouldn’t make you think it was a button when someone just needed to move it out of the way because there was shitty locations for wireless routers). I have no idea where it’s handy. The easy-to-use-encryption-for-dumb-people fails.

    Instead of typing in different pins for every device, i always though it was easier to name a wireless network and give it a password with any of the encryption choices offered (just not wps).

27. If an AP supports external PIN registration for an unlimited time, that would be a problem regardless of an efficient brute-force attack.

    However, the claim that this will affect all WPS routers is overreaching. Even in your limited tests you hit one that malfunctioned before letting you in. I know Apple APs don’t support adding clients without taking action on the AP, so the “all of the more recent router models come with WPS” claim also goes too far. You should clean that up.

    * I’m afraid this is fairly accurate. Fellow researcher Craig Heffner agrees: “roughly 95% of modern consumer-grade access points ship with WPS enabled by default” (from <http://www.tacnetsol.com/products/>). The Apple devices are (as always) a bit special because they do only seem to support PIN – Internal Registrar.

37. No doubt the various hardware vendors will take a long time to rollout any firmware update. What really worries me is that some only seem to keep updating firmware for a year or two after release and then completely stop, which leaves a lot of kit vulnerable to old exploits that could and should be easily fixed.

    needed from 10^8 (=100.000.000) to 10^4 + 10^4 (=20.000).

    > As the 8th digit of the PIN is always a checksum of digit one to digit seven, there are at most 10^4 + 10^3 (=11.000) attempts needed to find the correct PIN.

    You forgot that “the 8th digit of the PIN is always a checksum” applies also to the raw brute force combination calculations for the whole PIN, not just the calculations for forcing the two parts of the PIN separately, so the maximum possible authentication attempts figure should only have been 10^7, not 10^8.

121. For all those that are stuck at the timeout, I noticed this, line 481:

     if x.haslayer(Dot11) and x[Dot11].addr1 == self.client\_mac and x[Dot11].addr3 == self.bssid:

     Basically that checks if the incoming packet is for us, but it does a strict case sensitive match (incoming is in lower chars)

     So just use lower case MAC id’s.

223. Is there any way to scan router if the PIN’s feature is enabled or not?

     * Yeah, the guys from reaver made walsh that is supposed to do just that. It is unable to detect my AP (Netgear WNDR 3400) though.

227. This is the error I’m getting when running the python file.

     I’m running the latest kubuntu updates. I know I can put my card into monitor mode because I was able to run “Reaver” without a problem.

251. Hi! Thanks for the tool. I tried it and it doesn’t work, logs are below. As for my config, I’m using the default version of Backtrack 5 R1 with an Intel 5100 card inside a laptop. The driver might be iwlagn but I wouldn’t quote me on that, I’m yet to check in BT 5. OS is running from Live USB.

     Finally, I \*think\* I installed Scapy 2.2.0 properly; only thing I installed. I’m not used to Ubuntu/Backtrack so here’s what I did and you decide if it’s valid: I downloaded the .zip file using Windows, then copied it onto Backtrack’s desktop after a reboot to switch OS, then double clicked the .zip which seemed to do the install automagically. (and indeed I see Scapy files in usr/local/somedirectories, though I’m couldn’t check if it’s really v2.2.0)

     BSSID is on channel 6 and WPS is enabled with PIN set to 00010009, although this AP might be immune to external PIN connection. Commands:

     airmon-ng start wlan0

     airodump-ng –channel 6 mon0

     ./wpscrack.py –iface mon0 –client 00:99:88:77:66:55 –bssid 11:22:33:44:55:66 –ssid SomeSSID -v

       + Before running the script you need to set your wireless device to ‘monitor’ mode. In Linux, this can be achieved using ‘airmon-ng’, a utility included with aircrack-ng when installed on Ubuntu.

         $ airmon-ng start [wireless interface name, like ‘wlan0’] [channel number, e.g. ‘6’]

         # airmon-ng start wlan0 6

         If you’re using a mac80211 driver, this will create a new device called ‘mon0’ which is in monitor mode. If you’re using another driver, it will set ‘wlan0’ to monitor mode. Once this is done, you can do the following from the README:

         iwconfig mon0 channel X

         ./wpscrack.py –iface mon0 –client 94:0c:6d:88:00:00 –bssid f4:ec:38:cf:00:00 –ssid testap -v

         Of course, substitute your own values instead of the ones provided above. Use the –help flag to see an explanation of each.

297. Heya, I was justing wondering if SecureEasySetup is in trouble too?, as I’ve read it’s just a different name for WPS.

     My router (WRT54G v7.0) only has the option to Enable/Disable SecureEasySetup , no mention of PINs.

     I have tried Reaver which couldn’t associate with my AP, but could on others, and its discovery tool “walsh” doesn’t list my router, but that could of course just be because it’s not calling its self WPS, so isn’t logged.

315. No lie – it looks like someone pointed-out most of this design flaw back in 2009, but (a) he didn’t run it to ground, and (b) nobody noticed. True, he ranted about some other stuff, but aside from noting the shortness of the PIN and the inability to change it (or disable WPS on some devices), the basic flaw is there.

     I get this in return-

     * You need to specify also the -client, -ssid arguments on the input loine (hence the message about arguments). The IPv6 message is issued by scapy, just ignore thatN since we are working over IPv4.

     Im having some problems, i would really appreciate if you can help me.

     Im running BT5R1 (gnome-vm-32).

     I’ve installed scapy 2(setup file completed)

     And im trying to run the program, but im getting the same error, over and over again

     This is the command i run: (btw, testing on my own router)

343. I contacted Linksys (Cisco) about WPS issue in my router Linksys WRT120N they reply to me that the router is no longer supported therefore no fix will be ever released. Also the firmware is propietary and because of 2MB of flash doesn’t support dd-wrt. So in other words if you have a WRT120N router like me you are in big trouble.

     GAME OVER!

395. I was using reaver and wpscrack for quite a while now. While reaver does a good job in general, I’m a big fan of python and prefer wpscrack as it’s easier to modify and extend. As the further developement seems to be stopped, I uploaded it at github now ( <https://github.com/ml31415/wpscrack> ) and started to add some tweaks. Anyone who would like to help improving it, feel warmly invited.

413. While there are stories out there of people who started businesses with a dollar and a prayer,

     their success is either unusual (which is why they became

     a big story) or it took much longer than it should

     have. I have seen people use their credit cards to fund a

     business, and this can be done; but the interest you pay on the initial money means

     that you are paying up to three times to

     start your business. If you start out on your own you

     would need to figure everything out alone and you would not have anyone

     to turn to for help.

More people should read this and understand this side of the story. I can’t believe you are not more popular because you most certainly possess the gift.

     I ain’t suggesting your content isn’t good., but suppose you added a headline to possibly grab a person’s attention? I mean Wi-Fi Protected Setup PIN

     brute force vulnerability | .braindump – RE and stuff is kinda boring.

     You could look at Yahoo’s front page and note how they create post titles to get viewers to

     click. You might add a video or a related picture or two to get readers interested about everything’ve written. Just my opinion, it could bring

     your posts a little livelier.
