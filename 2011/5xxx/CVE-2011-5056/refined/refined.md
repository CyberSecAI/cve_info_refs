- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The older MaraDNS 1.x recursive code did not use a randomized hash, making it vulnerable to hash collision denial of service attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of randomized hashing in MaraDNS 1.x recursive code.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker could cause a denial-of-service by exploiting hash collisions, if the conditions are met.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending specially crafted DNS queries to trigger hash collisions.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker must be able to send untrusted recursive queries to a MaraDNS 1.x server where `recursive_acl` is set.
    - The attacker must have the ability to create queries that trigger hash collisions.
