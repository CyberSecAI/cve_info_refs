Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2011-5216:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is SQL injection. The provided content specifically mentions "SQL injection vulnerability fixes" within the commit message related to the fix.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The code was using string concatenation to build SQL queries, making it susceptible to injection attacks where malicious SQL code could be inserted through user-controlled inputs. Specifically, the `ajax.php` file contained several instances where user-provided data was directly included in SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to:
* Read sensitive data from the database.
* Modify or delete data in the database.
* Potentially gain administrative control over the WordPress site if the database user had sufficient privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through HTTP requests to the `ajax.php` file.  Specifically, the vulnerability was present when handling actions such as:
*   Creating new invitations.
*   Updating existing invitations.
*   Retrieving invitations and registrations.
*   Deleting course invitations.
*   Deactivating invitations.
*   Enrolling users in courses through catalog widgets.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker would need to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable `ajax.php` script. This could be achieved by an authenticated or unauthenticated user, depending on the context of the vulnerable code. The attacker would need a basic understanding of SQL to craft malicious payloads.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was fixed by replacing direct string concatenation with parameterized queries using `$wpdb->prepare()` which properly escapes user inputs, thereby preventing SQL injection. The code also began using `$wpdb->insert()` and `$wpdb->update()` for database operations.
- The fix was included in version 1.0.7 of the plugin.
- The vulnerable plugin was closed and is no longer available for download due to the severity of the security issue.
- The patch included a refactor of the plugin that removed a `SCORMAPI` folder and added a `SCORMCloud_PHPLibrary` directory.
