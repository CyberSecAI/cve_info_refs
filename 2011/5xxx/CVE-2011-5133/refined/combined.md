# Exponential Project Update

Posted on [July 3, 2024](https://blog.mybb.com/2024/07/03/exponential-project-update/ "6:56 pm")  by  [MyBB Team](https://blog.mybb.com/author/mybbteam/ "View all posts by MyBB Team")

![mybb-exponential@4x](https://blog.mybb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/mybb-exponential404x.png)

MyBB’s ecosystem spans across several platforms connecting contributors, authors, and users. In this post, we’ll collect a number of recent highlights from around the Project.

## 10³ Stars on GitHub

Software is often divided into [closed- and open-style development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar).

Back in [2009](//blog.mybb.com/2009/08/19/getting-involved-development-site-opens/%29), MyBB switched from the former to the latter, enabling administrators and developers, who tweak their forums in the most random ways, to submit and see their fixes in official releases. The move also opened up the development process and allowed a crowd of enthusiasts to critique any upcoming changes and test them on their own servers, and with custom plugins.

Since then, code from 100+ contributors has made its way into MyBB, and earlier this year, the Project’s [main repository](https://github.com/mybb/mybb) passed the symbolic threshold of **1K stars** from members of the open source community.

If you have patches of your own, or would like to otherwise make MyBB a better forum software, explore some of the options in the [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/mybb/mybb/blob/feature/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) file.

## 10² Stars for Top Extensions

If you’ve been using MyBB, you’ll know that the core package is only a part of its identity: extensions have an important place in the ecosystem that’s been maturing for two decades.

Today, the [Extend platform](https://community.mybb.com/mods.php) hosts over 1300 projects that have published more than five thousand releases downloaded well over two million times, and a pair of extensions have already crossed the **100-star mark** — taking a portion of over 6.5 thousand stars given in total.

Starring projects allows you to find them in a [single place](https://community.mybb.com/mods.php?action=panel&panelaction=stars) when you’re ready to start your new forum, and subscribing to them (which was done more than a thousand times) will notify you of new releases to check out.

As we work to define MyBB as lightweight software with modern features,
we aim to further strengthen extensions as a pillar of the application by [building](https://github.com/orgs/mybb/projects/3/views/3) authoring aids and APIs into the core to make the experience easier and more pleasant for everyone involved.

## 10¹ Development News

In recent months, numerous key elements of the upcoming series have taken shape. Read ten notes about the View system, extending MyBB, merged features, requirements, and upcoming works in the [**1.9 Development Milestone**](https://community.mybb.com/thread-241255.html) thread.

We have also published a [Quick Start](https://community.mybb.com/thread-241225.html) cheatsheet, allowing you to set up the development branch and preview it right away using your favorite workflow.

If you’re ready for some tinkering and a deeper dive, read [Experimenting with Inheritance Basics](https://community.mybb.com/thread-241300.html), where we make use of the new theming system and track how the application handles it so far.

## 10⁰ Familiar-looking Theme

When patrolling the Extend section, we noticed one submission was particularly reminiscent, but we couldn’t put our finger on it. A careful investigation that included, among other methods, reading its documentation revealed that it’s MyBB 1.9’s official theme — for MyBB 1.8.

The [Curves UI](https://community.mybb.com/mods.php?action=view&pid=1594) takes the upcoming series’ look and backports it visually into the current stable version. It is also maintained on GitHub, where you can work with authors to improve it further.

It joins many responsive [Community-maintained themes](https://community.mybb.com/mods.php?action=browse&category=themes), so it’s another good starting point for customization, and if you’re looking to prepare your forum for the style transition into 1.9.x, you can now use its latest build to make the eventual switch extra smooth.

## The Base

With the Community-driven environment giving the Project its *power*, the *base* of organizing work and tying up all loose ends is done by the MyBB Team.

To ensure this exponentiation yields the best product, we’ve recently brushed up and published the [list of Roles](https://mybb.com/about/team/roles/), including ten non[–](https://mermaid.ink/img/pako%3AeNqVlE2P2jAQhv-K5YruBaoE6HaVQ6XCUqmHVbeA2kPTwxAP4DaxU9tZESH--8Y2AZMVK60vieZ9Zub1555mkiFNaK-354KbhOxTQZpxY7ZY4E1CUroCjSnt-3hK_1fAFAgz3YIyKT1leLWUXJgl7swjMMbFxgKD-K4fMm0Fiy1lGZCfPvZfFJsD45W26shrh5MV5_EnKA6rHPVLL4oXoGrbZipzqSyQ0ndRFJ2mcwFOpGKoQhQAOmjrPf7K8_xIrddRtF7H8RV0GKBN79fQ0QVq615Fxx0Dr6CxXYEAv3NjPL7m92346G34-Cp-3N1UHA69Xiouz5nTDDc5kod6MiFLhILMpd124cXdAHZck0clM9SaDAaf7T-rMqM9UHtgqhAMl8IRC1RPPMO2RttzEJNZJnWtDRYdZUi-CYNKQE6-l6hcKd1hRrbzX8wMeQABm-aQCtNBxmSOGkFlW_Ke3OMT5rL0mAfPiQn5HX0YNTeDuM8fr__ClROGLn47bOMzxo1sLkTu1I4Y9HGyLxrImm-EU26Hl9ICs0pxU4diUFWW-tzvbHLx40vQ5xStylKq0MEpYbYzKLRd0bDReQJTWRSVaH20ubRPC1QFcNY8ZO4FOD4N_ogxUP_s6To0HFRGLmqR0cSoCvu0KhkYvOewUVDQZA25xsMzLOh9uw?type=png)management focus areas within the Team. Those now include separate teams for testing and developer relations, in adjustment according to the direction we’d like to take.

While those spots are often filled through invitation, if some of the listed activities pique your interest, [tell us about it](https://community.mybb.com/newthread.php?fid=135&threadprefix=45) (the worst you’ll get is a friendly nudge in the right direction on how to make a positive impact!).

[← Some closure on the 1.6.4 Security Vulnerability](https://blog.mybb.com/2011/10/25/some-closure-on-the-1-6-4-security-vulnerability/) [MyBB Rebranding: New Logo and Mascot →](https://blog.mybb.com/2012/01/12/mybb-rebranding-new-logo-and-mascot/)

# MyBB 1.6.5 Released – Feature Update, Security & Maintenance Release

Posted on [November 25, 2011](https://blog.mybb.com/2011/11/25/mybb-1-6-5-released-feature-update-security-maintenance-release/ "8:33 pm")  by  [Chris Boulton](https://blog.mybb.com/author/surfichris/ "View all posts by Chris Boulton")

MyBB 1.6.5 is now available from the MyBB website and is a feature update, security and maintenance release for the 1.6 series.

#### What’s added/changed in this version?

In 1.6.5, there are **3 vulnerabilities** and over **70 reported issues** fixed. Please be aware that not all of the existing problems have been fixed in this version.

* Vulnerabilities:
  + Non Critical: Unparsed user avatar in the buddy list – reported by labrocca
  + Non Critical: Potential XSS vulnerability validating usernames via AJAX – reported by Will G
  + Low Risk: CSRF vulnerability in ?language – reported by Nathan Malcolm ([Issue #1729](http://dev.mybb.com/projects/mybb/issues/1729))

  Thanks to everyone who helped find and resolve the issues!
* [Fixed issues in 1.6.5](http://dev.mybb.com/projects/mybb/versions/39)
* [Unfixed issues](http://dev.mybb.com/projects/mybb/issues)

There are also over **10 new feature updates** in 1.6.5. These range from the ability to locate spam users from the ACP to reCAPTCHA support. To get a summary of these new updates and for a list of changed files and language pack changes, please see the Wiki on 1.6.5.

> [View 1.6.5 Changes in the Wiki](http://wiki.mybb.com/index.php/1.6.5)

#### Upgrading from 1.6.4 and Other Versions

Before performing any upgrade, please remember to backup your forum’s files and database and store them safely. If you have edited core files, including language files, please make sure you make a changelog for these changes so you can make them again once the upgrade is complete.

If you have any plugins installed that limit signatures or provide reCAPTCHA, or might not be needed because of the new default settings available, it’s suggested to uninstall these before the upgrade. If you’re unsure, create a thread in the General Support section of the Community Forum with your plugin list and a useful member will be able to tell you the plugins that need to be disabled.

To upgrade, follow the Upgrading process. The **upgrade script** is required. There are also **language** and **theme** changes.

> If you’re using MyBB 1.6.4
>
> * Download and use the [Changed Files Package](https://github.com/downloads/mybb/mybb16/1605_changedfiles.zip)
> * [Follow the Wiki Upgrading instructions](http://wiki.mybb.com/index.php/Upgrading#Beginning_the_Upgrade)
>
> If you’re not using MyBB 1.6.4
>
> * Download and use the full [1.6.5 release package](http://www.mybb.com/download/latest)
> * [Follow the](http://mybb.com/downloads/latest/) [Wiki Upgrading instructions](http://wiki.mybb.com/index.php/Upgrading#Beginning_the_Upgrade)

#### Plugin System Changes

In 1.6.5, there are some fundamental changes to the Plugin System. These changes were made to provide greater support for PHP 5.3 and above.

These changes mean that you may need to upgrade some of the plugins you are running on your forum **before** upgrading to 1.6.5. If you are a Plugin Developer, you need to check your plugins to see if you are required to change them so they work with the new version.

Please see the [1.6.5 Plugin System Changes Wiki](http://wiki.mybb.com/index.php/1.6.5#Plugin_System_Changes) for an explanation of the changes. There is also the [Plugin Changes coming in 1.6.5](http://community.mybb.com/thread-106729.html) thread on the Community Forums.

#### MyBB Merge System 1.6.2 Update

For those users who have been using Merge System 1.6.1 and earlier, there is a new update ready for you.

You can read more about it in the [1.6.2 Update Blog Post](https://blog.mybb.com/2011/09/26/mybb-merge-system-1-6-2/).

In the near future, the Merge System will be following the main branch of MyBB – for example, if you’re using MyBB 1.6.8 you’ll need Merge System 1.6.8. This will mean that the Merge System will jump several minor points. These changes have yet to come into effect, so please continue to use Merge System 1.6.2. We’ll announce further details nearer the time of the changes.

#### MyBB 1.6.4 Vulnerability

In October, we found that [a 3rd party had compromised the MyBB server](https://blog.mybb.com/2011/10/25/some-closure-on-the-1-6-4-security-vulnerability/) and the 1.6.4 release was modified to contain a hidden vulnerability. If you’re current using 1.6.4 and have had no prior knowledge of this, then we urge you to upgrade to 1.6.5 as soon as possible.

As a result of the compromise to our systems we **will be hosting our download packages on github**, we will continue to do this until we are confident our systems here are just as secure as what github can offer.

Here are the MD5 checksums for the release packages:

mybb\_1605.zip: 032403cee9d25110370ace935803ab9d

1605\_changedfiles.zip: 91e6055b758c0aa233503a2a7528a7b0

If you think you’ve found a vulnerability in MyBB, we advise you not to publicly post it on these forums or publicly release information about it elsewhere until we’ve had time to prepare and release a patch.

As always, you can send through security related messages on the MyBB website from the [Contact Us](http://mybb.com/contact) page.

Thank you,

MyBB Team

    Very nice update, lots of new features to fight against spam. I like the new post count requirements for some things, should stop the bots from during some of those automated actions.

    Cheers to the MyBB team.

    @uzer: I found one comment by you that was caught by Akismet – I have now approved it. I hope this is the post you were talking about. 🙂

    Please in the future, do not jump to conclusions. Sometimes there are simply mistakes made – this time it was by Akismet.

    Upgraded without any problems, only a few small plugins which was not already updated needed changes which very easy to do. Everything went well and working as it should do.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
