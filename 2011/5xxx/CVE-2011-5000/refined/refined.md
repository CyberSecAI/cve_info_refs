    "related": true,
    "information": {
      "root_cause": "The `ssh_gssapi_parse_ename` function in `gss-serv.c` does not properly validate the length of the name parameter received from the client, which leads to an integer overflow vulnerability.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Integer Overflow: The function uses `get_u32` to read a 32-bit length, and uses that to allocate memory. If an attacker provides a large length, this can lead to an allocation of an extremely large memory chunk."
      ],
      "impact": "A remote, authenticated attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS) by exhausting server memory via a specially crafted GSSAPI token, potentially crashing the server. The vulnerability occurs post-authentication.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "The attack vector is network-based, exploiting the SSH protocol using the GSSAPI authentication mechanism."
      ],
       "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must have valid credentials to successfully authenticate to the server using GSSAPI and initiate the vulnerable code path post-authentication. They then send a malicious GSSAPI token with a crafted length value."
