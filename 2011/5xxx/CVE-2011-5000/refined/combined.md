Name: Useless OpenSSH resources exhausion bug via GSSAPI
Author: Adam Zabrocki ()
Date: 2008-2009 (old useless bug ;P)
Description:
OpenSSH is a FREE version of the SSH connectivity tools
that technical users of the Internet rely on. Users of telnet,
rlogin, and ftp may not realize that their password is transmitted
across the Internet unencrypted, but it is. OpenSSH encrypts all
traffic (including passwords) to effectively eliminate eavesdropping,
connection hijacking, and other attacks. Additionally, OpenSSH
provides secure tunneling capabilities and several authentication
methods, and supports all SSH protocol versions.
The Generic Security Services Application Program Interface (GSSAPI,
also GSS-API) is an application programming interface for programs
to access security services.
The GSSAPI, by itself, does not provide any security. Instead,
security service vendors provide GSSAPI implementations usually
in the form of libraries installed with their security software.
Details:
It is possible to provide any value to the xmalloc()
function, which is simple wrapper to the malloc() function.
This open an windows to force an application to alocate a huge
amount of the memory (4GB?) and naturally exhause avaibale
resources. Repeating this attack, by simple open many session,
can kill the server.
Implementation of the xmalloc() function can be found here:
"xmalloc.c"
void \*
xmalloc(size\_t size)
{
void \*ptr;
if (size == 0)
fatal("xmalloc: zero size");
ptr = malloc(size);
if (ptr == NULL)
fatal("xmalloc: out of memory (allocating %lu bytes)", (u\_long) size);
return ptr;
}
This wrapper check what is the return value from the malloc()
- error supports, and check if it is not passed 0 (zero) value
for the argument. Its very clever because a lot of bugs are
based on misscalculation and passing 0 value for the argument
can be exploited in some situation. Especially this is exploitable
situation at Windows systems.
The bug exists in this code:
"./gss-serv.c"
static OM\_uint32
ssh\_gssapi\_parse\_ename(Gssctxt \*ctx, gss\_buffer\_t ename, gss\_buffer\_t name)
{
u\_char \*tok;
OM\_uint32 offset;
OM\_uint32 oidl;
tok = ename->value;
...
...
if (ename->length < 6 || memcmp(tok, "\x04\x01", 2) != 0)
return GSS\_S\_FAILURE;
...
...
oidl = get\_u16(tok+2); /\* length including next two bytes \*/
oidl = oidl-2; /\* turn it into the \_real\_ length of the variable OID \*/
...
...
if (tok[4] != 0x06 || tok[5] != oidl ||
ename->length < oidl+6 ||
!ssh\_gssapi\_check\_oid(ctx, tok+6, oidl))
return GSS\_S\_FAILURE;
offset = oidl+6;
if (ename->length < offset+4)
return GSS\_S\_FAILURE;
[1] name->length = get\_u32(tok+offset);
offset += 4;
[2] if (ename->length < offset+name->length)
return GSS\_S\_FAILURE;
[3] name->value = xmalloc(name->length+1);
[4] memcpy(name->value, tok+offset, name->length);
[5] ((char \*)name->value)[name->length] = 0;
return GSS\_S\_COMPLETE;
}
It is possible to set a huge value at line [1] which can
bypass len check at line [2] and cause to allocate our
value +1 at line [3]. Function xmalloc() protect from
the situation described before about passing 0 (zero)
value to the argument a make nice working exploit via
calling at line [4] and [5]. Anyway it is still possible
to force an resources exhausion attack.
Going furhter, definition of the structure which is
interested for us is here:
"/usr/include/gssapi/gssapi.h"
size\_t length;
void \*value;
} gss\_buffer\_desc, \*gss\_buffer\_t;
Function ssh\_gssapi\_parse\_ename() is called here:
"./gss-serv.c"
/\* Privileged (called from accept\_secure\_ctx) \*/
OM\_uint32
ssh\_gssapi\_getclient(Gssctxt \*ctx, ssh\_gssapi\_client \*client)
{
int i = 0;
gss\_buffer\_desc ename;
...
...
if ((ctx->major = ssh\_gssapi\_parse\_ename(ctx,&ename,
&client->exportedname))) {
return (ctx->major);
}
...
...
}
and this function is called here:
"./gss-serv.c"
OM\_uint32
ssh\_gssapi\_accept\_ctx(Gssctxt \*ctx, gss\_buffer\_desc \*recv\_tok,
gss\_buffer\_desc \*send\_tok, OM\_uint32 \*flags)
{
OM\_uint32 status;
gss\_OID mech;
[1] ctx->major = gss\_accept\_sec\_context(&ctx->minor,
&ctx->context, ctx->creds, recv\_tok,
GSS\_C\_NO\_CHANNEL\_BINDINGS, &ctx->client, &mech,
send\_tok, flags, NULL, &ctx->client\_creds);
if (GSS\_ERROR(ctx->major))
ssh\_gssapi\_error(ctx);
if (ctx->client\_creds)
debug("Received some client credentials");
else
debug("Got no client credentials");
status = ctx->major;
/\* Now, if we're complete and we have the right flags, then
\* we flag the user as also having been authenticated
\*/
if (((flags == NULL) || ((\*flags & GSS\_C\_MUTUAL\_FLAG) &&
(\*flags & GSS\_C\_INTEG\_FLAG))) && (ctx->major == GSS\_S\_COMPLETE)) {
[2] if (ssh\_gssapi\_getclient(ctx, &gssapi\_client))
fatal("Couldn't convert client name");
}
return (status);
}
What is important here? Call for the vuln code is at line [2].
Whole this code is reponsible for authentication. At line [1]
is function which do REAL authentication. So vuln code is called
directly after REAL auth. So (un)fortunately this bug is directly
post-auth :( This is the reason why this bug is useless in fact
and public now ;)
Going furhter:
"auth2-gss.c"
static void
input\_gssapi\_token(int type, u\_int32\_t plen, void \*ctxt)
{
...
...
...
maj\_status = PRIVSEP(ssh\_gssapi\_accept\_ctx(gssctxt, &recv\_tok,
&send\_tok, &flags));
...
...
}
Next:
/\*
\* We only support those mechanisms that we know about (ie ones that we know
\* how to check local user kuserok and the like)
\*/
static int
userauth\_gssapi(Authctxt \*authctxt)
{
...
...
...
dispatch\_set(SSH2\_MSG\_USERAUTH\_GSSAPI\_TOKEN, &input\_gssapi\_token);
...
...
}
and this methos is registered here:
Authmethod method\_gssapi = {
"gssapi-with-mic",
userauth\_gssapi,
&options.gss\_authentication
};
Affected Software:
Any OpenSSH server which support "gssapi-with-mic" auth.
In fact every modern Linux distro support it by default.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=809938#c0)  Vincent Danen    2012-04-04 17:19:40 UTC  ``` Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures assigned an identifier [CVE-2011-5000](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-5000) to the following vulnerability:  Name: [CVE-2011-5000](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-5000) URL: <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-5000> Assigned: 20111224 Reference: FULLDISC:20110801 Useless OpenSSH resources exhausion bug via GSSAPI Reference: <http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2011/Aug/2> Reference: <http://site.pi3.com.pl/adv/ssh_1.txt>  The ssh_gssapi_parse_ename function in gss-serv.c in OpenSSH 5.8 and earlier, when gssapi-with-mic authentication is enabled, allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via a large value in a certain length field.  NOTE: there may be limited scenarios in which this issue is relevant.   The upstream fix for this is here:  <http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/usr.bin/ssh/gss-serv.c.diff?r1=1.22;r2=1.23>  Also note that this is a POST-authentication bug, meaning that an attacker would need to have valid credentials to successfully authenticate to the server in order to exploit this.  If a user already has the ability to log into the server, there are a number of other mechanisms that could be exploited (arguably easier) to consume excessive resources on the server.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=809938#c1)  Vincent Danen    2012-04-04 17:21:31 UTC  ``` Statement:  (none)   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=809938#c2)  Vincent Danen    2012-04-04 17:22:10 UTC  ``` Created openssh tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 809939](show_bug.cgi?id=809939 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2011-5000 openssh: post-authentication resource exhaustion bug via GSSAPI [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=809938#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-06-20 07:17:43 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2012:0884 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0884.html>   ``` |  |

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

## Topic

Updated openssh packages that fix one security issue, several bugs, and add
various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

## Description

OpenSSH is OpenBSD's Secure Shell (SSH) protocol implementation. These
packages include the core files necessary for the OpenSSH client and
server.

A denial of service flaw was found in the OpenSSH GSSAPI authentication
implementation. A remote, authenticated user could use this flaw to make
the OpenSSH server daemon (sshd) use an excessive amount of memory, leading
to a denial of service. GSSAPI authentication is enabled by default
("GSSAPIAuthentication yes" in "/etc/ssh/sshd\_config"). (CVE-2011-5000)

These updated openssh packages also provide fixes for the following bugs:

* SSH X11 forwarding failed if IPv6 was enabled and the parameter

X11UseLocalhost was set to "no". Consequently, users could not set X
forwarding. This update fixes sshd and ssh to correctly bind the port for
the IPv6 protocol. As a result, X11 forwarding now works as expected with
IPv6. (BZ#732955)

* The sshd daemon was killed by the OOM killer when running a stress test.

Consequently, a user could not log in. With this update, the sshd daemon
sets its oom\_adj value to -17. As a result, sshd is not chosen by OOM
killer and users are able to log in to solve problems with memory.
(BZ#744236)

* If the SSH server is configured with a banner that contains a backslash

character, then the client will escape it with another "\" character, so it
prints double backslashes. An upstream patch has been applied to correct
the problem and the SSH banner is now correctly displayed. (BZ#809619)

In addition, these updated openssh packages provide the following
enhancements:

* Previously, SSH allowed multiple ways of authentication of which only one

was required for a successful login. SSH can now be set up to require
multiple ways of authentication. For example, logging in to an SSH-enabled
machine requires both a passphrase and a public key to be entered. The
RequiredAuthentications1 and RequiredAuthentications2 options can be
configured in the /etc/ssh/sshd\_config file to specify authentications that
are required for a successful login. For example, to set key and password
authentication for SSH version 2, type:

echo "RequiredAuthentications2 publickey,password" >> /etc/ssh/sshd\_config

For more information on the aforementioned /etc/ssh/sshd\_config options,
refer to the sshd\_config man page. (BZ#657378)

* Previously, OpenSSH could use the Advanced Encryption Standard New

Instructions (AES-NI) instruction set only with the AES Cipher-block
chaining (CBC) cipher. This update adds support for Counter (CTR) mode
encryption in OpenSSH so the AES-NI instruction set can now be used
efficiently also with the AES CTR cipher. (BZ#756929)

* Prior to this update, an unprivileged slave sshd process was run as

the sshd\_t context during privilege separation (privsep). sshd\_t is the
SELinux context used for running the sshd daemon. Given that the
unprivileged slave process is run under the user's UID, it is fitting to
run this process under the user's SELinux context instead of the privileged
sshd\_t context. With this update, the unprivileged slave process is now run
as the user's context instead of the sshd\_t context in accordance with the
principle of privilege separation. The unprivileged process, which might be
potentially more sensitive to security threats, is now run under the user's
SELinux context. (BZ#798241)

Users are advised to upgrade to these updated openssh packages, which
contain backported patches to resolve these issues and add these
enhancements. After installing this update, the OpenSSH server daemon
(sshd) will be restarted automatically.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

Name:                 Useless OpenSSH resources exhausion bug via GSSAPI
Author:               Adam Zabrocki (<pi3 () itsec pl>)
Date:                 2008-2009 (old useless bug ;P)

   Description:

        OpenSSH is a FREE version of the SSH connectivity tools
that technical users of the Internet rely on. Users of telnet,
rlogin, and ftp may not realize that their password is transmitted
across the Internet unencrypted, but it is. OpenSSH encrypts all
traffic (including passwords) to effectively eliminate eavesdropping,
connection hijacking, and other attacks. Additionally, OpenSSH
provides secure tunneling capabilities and several authentication
methods, and supports all SSH protocol versions.

The Generic Security Services Application Program Interface (GSSAPI,
also GSS-API) is an application programming interface for programs
to access security services.
The GSSAPI, by itself, does not provide any security. Instead,
security service vendors provide GSSAPI implementations usually
in the form of libraries installed with their security software.

   Details:

        It is possible to provide any value to the xmalloc()
function, which is simple wrapper to the malloc() function.
This open an windows to force an application to alocate a huge
amount of the memory (4GB?) and naturally exhause avaibale
resources. Repeating this attack, by simple open many session,
can kill the server.

Implementation of the xmalloc() function can be found here:

"xmalloc.c"
void *
xmalloc(size_t size)
{
        void *ptr;

        if (size == 0)
                fatal("xmalloc: zero size");
        ptr = malloc(size);
        if (ptr == NULL)
                fatal("xmalloc: out of memory (allocating %lu bytes)",
(u_long) size);
        return ptr;
}

This wrapper check what is the return value from the malloc()
- error supports, and check if it is not passed 0 (zero) value
for the argument. Its very clever because a lot of bugs are
based on misscalculation and passing 0 value for the argument
can be exploited in some situation. Especially this is exploitable
situation at Windows systems.

The bug exists in this code:

"./gss-serv.c"
static OM_uint32
ssh_gssapi_parse_ename(Gssctxt *ctx, gss_buffer_t ename, gss_buffer_t
name)
{
        u_char *tok;
        OM_uint32 offset;
        OM_uint32 oidl;

        tok = ename->value;
...
...

        if (ename->length < 6 || memcmp(tok, "\x04\x01", 2) != 0)
                return GSS_S_FAILURE;

...
...

        oidl = get_u16(tok+2); /* length including next two bytes */
        oidl = oidl-2; /* turn it into the _real_ length of the variable
OID */

...
...
        if (tok[4] != 0x06 || tok[5] != oidl ||
            ename->length < oidl+6 ||
            !ssh_gssapi_check_oid(ctx, tok+6, oidl))
                return GSS_S_FAILURE;

        offset = oidl+6;

        if (ename->length < offset+4)
                return GSS_S_FAILURE;

 [1]    name->length = get_u32(tok+offset);
        offset += 4;

 [2]    if (ename->length < offset+name->length)
                return GSS_S_FAILURE;

 [3]    name->value = xmalloc(name->length+1);
 [4]    memcpy(name->value, tok+offset, name->length);
 [5]    ((char *)name->value)[name->length] = 0;

        return GSS_S_COMPLETE;
}

It is possible to set a huge value at line [1] which can
bypass len check at line [2] and cause to allocate our
value +1 at line [3]. Function xmalloc() protect from
the situation described before about passing 0 (zero)
value to the argument a make nice working exploit via
calling at line [4] and [5]. Anyway it is still possible
to force an resources exhausion attack.

Going furhter, definition of the structure which is
interested for us is here:

"/usr/include/gssapi/gssapi.h"
      size_t length;
      void *value;
} gss_buffer_desc, *gss_buffer_t;

Function ssh_gssapi_parse_ename() is called here:

"./gss-serv.c"
/* Privileged (called from accept_secure_ctx) */
OM_uint32
ssh_gssapi_getclient(Gssctxt *ctx, ssh_gssapi_client *client)
{
        int i = 0;

        gss_buffer_desc ename;

       ...
       ...

       if ((ctx->major = ssh_gssapi_parse_ename(ctx,&ename,
            &client->exportedname))) {
                return (ctx->major);
        }

       ...
       ...
}

and this function is called here:

"./gss-serv.c"
OM_uint32
ssh_gssapi_accept_ctx(Gssctxt *ctx, gss_buffer_desc *recv_tok,
    gss_buffer_desc *send_tok, OM_uint32 *flags)
{
        OM_uint32 status;
        gss_OID mech;

 [1]    ctx->major = gss_accept_sec_context(&ctx->minor,
            &ctx->context, ctx->creds, recv_tok,
            GSS_C_NO_CHANNEL_BINDINGS, &ctx->client, &mech,
            send_tok, flags, NULL, &ctx->client_creds);

        if (GSS_ERROR(ctx->major))
                ssh_gssapi_error(ctx);

        if (ctx->client_creds)
                debug("Received some client credentials");
        else
                debug("Got no client credentials");

        status = ctx->major;

        /* Now, if we're complete and we have the right flags, then
         * we flag the user as also having been authenticated
         */

        if (((flags == NULL) || ((*flags & GSS_C_MUTUAL_FLAG) &&
            (*flags & GSS_C_INTEG_FLAG))) && (ctx->major ==
GSS_S_COMPLETE)) {
 [2]            if (ssh_gssapi_getclient(ctx, &gssapi_client))
                        fatal("Couldn't convert client name");
        }

        return (status);
}

What is important here? Call for the vuln code is at line [2].
Whole this code is reponsible for authentication. At line [1]
is function which do REAL authentication. So vuln code is called
directly after REAL auth. So (un)fortunately this bug is directly
post-auth :( This is the reason why this bug is useless in fact
and public now ;)

Going furhter:

"auth2-gss.c"
static void
input_gssapi_token(int type, u_int32_t plen, void *ctxt)
{
   ...

   ...
   ...
        maj_status = PRIVSEP(ssh_gssapi_accept_ctx(gssctxt, &recv_tok,
            &send_tok, &flags));
   ...
   ...
}

Next:

/*
 * We only support those mechanisms that we know about (ie ones that we
know
 * how to check local user kuserok and the like)
 */
static int
userauth_gssapi(Authctxt *authctxt)
{
   ...

   ...
   ...
        dispatch_set(SSH2_MSG_USERAUTH_GSSAPI_TOKEN,
&input_gssapi_token);
   ...
   ...
}

and this methos is registered here:

Authmethod method_gssapi = {
        "gssapi-with-mic",
        userauth_gssapi,
        &options.gss_authentication
};

   Affected Software:

        Any OpenSSH server which support "gssapi-with-mic" auth.
In fact every modern Linux distro support it by default.
