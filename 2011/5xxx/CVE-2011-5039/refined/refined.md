Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-5039:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a failure to properly sanitize user-supplied input within the `login.php` script of the Infoproject Biznis Heroj application. Specifically, the `username` and `password` POST parameters are vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. By crafting malicious input in the `username` and `password` fields, an attacker can manipulate SQL queries, bypassing authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass the login procedure and gain unauthorized access to the application.
*   **Administrative Privileges:** The attacker can potentially gain administrative privileges, enabling them to perform a wide range of actions within the application, depending on the applicationâ€™s permissions model and the capabilities of the database user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector involves sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `login.php` script.
*   **Malicious Input:** The malicious input is injected into the `username` and `password` POST parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the application's server to send the malicious POST request.
*   **Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL to craft the injection payload.
*   **No Prior Authentication:** The vulnerability exists in the login process itself, so no prior authentication is needed to attempt the exploit.

**Additional details:**

* The exploit-db entry groups this vulnerability with CVE-2011-5040 which covers XSS and SQLi in different files.
* The advisory ZSL-2011-5065 specifically covers the authentication bypass vulnerability in `login.php`.
* The PoC provided shows that using `' or 1=1--` for both `username` and `password` bypasses the login.
