{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Multiple vulnerabilities exist due to insufficient input validation and insecure coding practices in Support Incident Tracker (SiT).",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type: The application does not properly filter file extensions during uploads, allowing arbitrary files to be uploaded.",
      "CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection'): The application fails to properly sanitize the attachment file name leading to SQL injection.",
      "CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting'): Multiple scripts are vulnerable to XSS by injecting arbitrary script through file names, links, or translations.",
       "CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): Most SiT scripts lack CSRF protection, making them susceptible to attacks that can trick logged-in users into performing unintended actions."
    ],
    "impact": "Attackers can execute arbitrary script, execute commands as a logged-in user, upload malicious files to the web server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Malicious file uploads through the 'incident_attachments.php' and 'ftp_upload_file.php' scripts.",
      "SQL injection via the 'incident_attachments.php' script by manipulating the attachment filename.",
      "Cross-site scripting through the 'incident_attachments.php', 'link_add.php', and 'translate.php' scripts.",
      "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) by tricking logged-in users to visit malicious URLs on many pages (excluding config.php, edit_user_permissions.php, forgotpwd.php, user_add.php, and user_profile_edit.php)."
    ],
     "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would need user access to the website and may need to guess or obtain the path to the attachments directory. For CSRF attacks the attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into visiting a malicious URL."
