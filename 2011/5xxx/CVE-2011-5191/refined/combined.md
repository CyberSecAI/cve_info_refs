## Description

PrettyLinks helps you shrink, beautify, track, manage and share any URL on or off of your WordPress website. Create links that look how you want using your own domain name!

### PrettyLinks 🌠

PrettyLinks enables you to shorten links using your own domain name (as opposed to using tinyurl.com, bit.ly, or any other link shrinking service)! In addition to creating clean links, PrettyLinks tracks each hit on your URL and provides a full, detailed report of where the hit came from, the browser, OS, and host. PrettyLinks is a killer plugin for people who want to clean up their affiliate links, track clicks from emails, their links on Twitter to come from their own domain, or generally increase the reach of their website by spreading these links on forums or comments on other blogs.

### Examples 👇

This is a link setup using PrettyLinks that redirects to the PrettyLinks Homepage where you can find more info about this Plugin:

http://blairwilliams.com/pl

Here’s a named pretty link (I used the slug ‘aweber’) that does a 307 redirect to my affiliate link for aweber.com:

http://blairwilliams.com/aweber

Here’s a link that PrettyLinks generated a random slug for (similar to what bit.ly or tinyurl would do):

http://blairwilliams.com/w7a

### Features ✔️

**[🔗 Create clean, simple URLs that redirect to any other URL](https://prettylinks.com/about#pl-link-setup?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=lite_plugin_listing&utm_content=features)**

**[🔃 Supports 301, 302, and 307 redirects](https://prettylinks.com/about#pl-redirect-types?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=lite_plugin_listing&utm_content=features)**

Redirect users using one of our three redirect types: 301 (Permanent), 302 (Temporary), and 307 (Temporary).

**[📊 Generate Highly Customizable Reports](https://prettylinks.com/about#pl-dashboard?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=lite_plugin_listing&utm_content=features)**

Create reports where you can see a configurable chart of clicks per day. The report can be filtered by the specific link clicked, date range, and/or unique clicks.

**[💡 Extremely Intuitive Admin User Interface](https://prettylinks.com/about#pl-dashboard?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=lite_plugin_listing&utm_content=features)**

No need to guess where everything is located. PrettyLinks makes the setup and link management process as simple as possible.

**[⬇️ Download Click Details](https://prettylinks.com/about#pl-dashboard?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=lite_plugin_listing&utm_content=features)**

  Click Tracking

## Installation

1. Upload ‘pretty-link.zip’ to the ‘/wp-content/plugins/’ directory
2. Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ menu in WordPress
3. Make sure you have changed your permalink Common Settings in Settings -> Permalinks away from “Default” to something else. I prefer using custom and then “/%year%/%month%/%postname%/” for the simplest possible URL slugs with the best performance.

## FAQ

### Who will find PrettyLinks useful?

PrettyLinks is particularly useful to affiliate marketers. It helps them to clean up, brand, group, organize, and track their links. In addition to affiliate marketing, PrettyLinks is also useful to bloggers, podcasters, merchants, social media marketers, and anyone else who wants to easily take control of their link strategy.

### Can I use PrettyLinks with any WordPress theme?

Absolutely! PrettyLinks operates mainly in the WordPress admin, but the front end features should be totally compatible with any WordPress theme.

### How do I get started with PrettyLinks?

Getting started with PrettyLinks is incredibly easy. Everything you need to know you can find on our [Getting Started page](https://prettylinks.com/doc-categories/getting-started/).

### Is PrettyLinks Translatable?

Yes! PrettyLinks is ready for translation. See our [Translating PrettyLinks](https://prettylinks.com/docs/translating-pretty-link-pro/) documentation for more information on how you can translate the plugin into your language.

### What are the differences in redirect types?

301 (Permanent) redirects are used to tell search engines that a requested URL has been permanently moved to another URL. If you’re confident that your target URL will never change, then use this redirect type. 302 and 307 (Temporary) redirects tell search engines that the requested URL has been moved temporarily, but will be back eventually.
