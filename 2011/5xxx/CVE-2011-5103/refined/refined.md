- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the `video_tags` component of the PHP video script, where user-supplied input is not properly sanitized before being used in SQL queries, specifically in the `id` parameter of the `index.php` script.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to database information disclosure, modification, or even complete compromise of the database server.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted URL containing a malicious SQL query in the `id` parameter of the `index.php` script. Specifically, the `'` character is used to break out of the original SQL query and inject new clauses.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application, and does not require any prior authentication. They can be any remote user.
