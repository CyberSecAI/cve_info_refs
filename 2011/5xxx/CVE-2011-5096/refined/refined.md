Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the `cstore.exe` component of the Nortel Media Application Server.
*   Specifically, when handling a `CONTENT_STORE_ADMIN_REQ` packet, the process trusts the length value provided by the `cs_anams` parameter.
*   It then blindly copies user-supplied data, based on this length, into a fixed-length buffer on the stack, leading to a buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stack-based Buffer Overflow:** The primary weakness is the stack-based buffer overflow due to insufficient bounds checking of user-supplied length when copying data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code.
*   **SYSTEM User Context:** The code execution occurs under the context of the SYSTEM user, granting the attacker full control over the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is over the network.
*   **TCP Port 52005:** The vulnerable `cstore.exe` component listens on TCP port 52005 by default.
*   **Unauthenticated:** Exploitation does not require prior authentication. The attacker can send a crafted `CONTENT_STORE_ADMIN_REQ` packet containing the overflow payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the target system on port 52005.
*   **Packet Crafting:** The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious `CONTENT_STORE_ADMIN_REQ` packet with an oversized `cs_anams` parameter.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is identified as ZDI-11-260 and ZDI-CAN-1096 by the Zero Day Initiative.
*   Avaya (which acquired Nortel's assets) has released a patch to fix this vulnerability.
*   Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS provides a protection filter (ID 11580) against this vulnerability.
*   Avaya considers the vulnerability to be of medium risk due to the mutual TLS authentication typically required for accessing the affected service, and further restrictions via ACLs in Media Application Server 2.0.

This vulnerability is a classic stack-based buffer overflow which is used for remote code execution and has a CVSS score of 10.0, meaning that it is critical.
