## Nortel Media Application Server cstore.exe cs\_anams Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-11-260ZDI-CAN-1096

| CVE ID |  |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 10.0, [AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=2.0&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | Nortel |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | Media Application Server |
| TREND MICRO CUSTOMER PROTECTION | Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID ['11580']. For further product information on the TippingPoint IPS: <http://www.tippingpoint.com> |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Nortel Media Application Server. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.  The flaw exists within the cstore.exe component which listens by default on TCP port 52005. When handling a CONTENT\_STORE\_ADMIN\_REQ packet type the process trusts length value provided by the 'cs\_anams' parameter and blindly copies user supplied data into a fixed-length buffer on the stack. A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of the SYSTEM user. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | Nortel has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at:  <https://support.avaya.com/css/P8/documents/100146108> |

Media Application Server Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

Original Release Date: August 2, 2011

Last Revised: August 30, 2011

Number: ASA-2011-213

Risk Level: Medium

Advisory Version: 2.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

A flaw was found in one of the Media Application Server listening processes. If a remote attacker was able to successfully establish a connection to this listening process, it would be possible to execute arbitrary code under the context of the SYSTEM user. The Zero Day Initiative project (www.zerodayinitiative.com) has assigned the name [ZDI-11-260](http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-11-260/) to this issue.

Avaya would like to thank the Zero Day Initiative and AbdulAziz Hariri of ThirdEyeTesters for responsibly reporting this vulnerability.

## 2. Avaya System Products with affected components/packages installed: | Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | Avaya Aura® Application Server 5300: * Media Application Server | 1.0, 2.0 | Medium | MAS 2.0 users install Patch Bundle 10 or later. MAS 1.0 users upgrade to 1.0.2 (MCP\_11.0.0.0\_2011-01-07-1526 with MAS QFE patch: QFE-platform-6.0.244-0001.zip), or upgrade to MAS 2.0 with Patch Bundle 10 or later. |

**Recommended Actions for System Products:**
Avaya strongly recommends that customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place, risk to Avaya
products and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as an Avaya provided
product update or the recommended Avaya action is applied.
Further restrictions as deemed necessary based on the
customer's security policies may be required during this
interim period, but customers should not modify the System Product
operating system or application unless the change is approved by Avaya.
Making changes that are not approved may void the Avaya product service contract.

### Mitigating Factors:

When determining risk, Avaya takes into account many factors as
outlined by Avaya's
[Security Vulnerability Classification Policy](https://support.avaya.com/css/P8/documents/100066674).
The following table describes factors that mitigate the risk of specific
vulnerabilities for affected Avaya products:

| Vulnerability | Mitigating Factors |
| --- | --- |
| ZDI-CAN-1096 | This is a medium risk because all known deployments of Media Application Server require mutual TLS authentication to access the service affected by this vulnerability. Media Application Server 2.0 further limits access to the affected service with the use of ACLs. |

## 3. Additional Information:

Additional information may also be available via the Avaya support
[website](http://support.avaya.com) and through your Avaya
account representative. Please contact your Avaya product support
representative, or dial 1-800-242-2121, with any questions.
