      "vulnerability": "GatewayService integer overflow",
      "root_cause": "The GatewayService uses a 32-bit value from the header to specify the size of the data to be received. This value is added to 0x34, and the resulting amount of memory is allocated. An integer overflow occurs because the addition can result in a small value that can cause a heap overflow when the program attempts to copy the data.",
