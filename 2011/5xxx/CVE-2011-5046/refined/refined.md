Okay, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2011-5046 from the provided content:

**1. Microsoft Security Bulletin MS12-008:**

*   **Vulnerability:** GDI Access Violation Vulnerability - CVE-2011-5046
*   **Root Cause:** Improper validation of input passed from user mode to the kernel component of GDI (Graphics Device Interface). The Win32k.sys driver fails to properly validate the input.
*   **Weaknesses:** Lack of proper input validation in the Windows kernel-mode driver (win32k.sys) when handling user-mode calls to GDI.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (Critical). An attacker could execute arbitrary code in kernel mode and gain complete control of the affected system. This includes:
    *   Installing programs
    *   Viewing, changing, or deleting data
    *   Creating new accounts with full administrative rights.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Web-based:**  Attacker hosts a website with malicious content that exploits the vulnerability. Users must be convinced to visit this website, typically through links in emails or instant messages.
    *  **Email:** Attacker sends a specially crafted email and convinces the user to preview or open the email.
    *   **Local:**  Attacker with valid logon credentials can run a specially crafted application locally.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   For web and email attacks: Ability to host a website or send a crafted email, plus social engineering skills to convince users to visit/open the malicious content.
    *   For local attacks: Valid logon credentials to the target system.
*   **Affected Systems:** A wide range of Windows versions are affected, including:
    *   Windows XP SP3
    *   Windows XP Professional x64 Edition SP2
    *   Windows Server 2003 SP2
    *   Windows Server 2003 x64 Edition SP2
    *   Windows Server 2003 with SP2 for Itanium-based Systems
    *   Windows Vista SP2
    *   Windows Vista x64 Edition SP2
    *   Windows Server 2008 SP2 (32-bit, x64, Itanium) - Server Core installations have a lower severity.
    *   Windows 7 SP1 (32-bit and x64)
    *   Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 (x64 and Itanium) - Server Core installations have a lower severity.
*   **Mitigation:** Reading emails in plain text can help reduce the attack vector.

**2. US-CERT Alert (TA12-045A):**

*   Confirms the presence of multiple vulnerabilities in Microsoft products, including the one described in MS12-008.
*   States that a remote, unauthenticated attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code, cause denial of service, or gain unauthorized access.
*   Recommends applying Microsoft's security updates.

**3. Exploit-DB Entry (18275):**

*   This entry provides proof-of-concept code that triggers a Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) in Windows due to this vulnerability.
*   The exploit is triggered within Apple Safari due to the GDI call being improperly handled.
*   Confirms the vulnerability affects Windows_x86-64 platforms.
*   Provides a code snippet, and stack trace that results in the BSOD.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is publicly disclosed (as stated in MS12-008)
*   Microsoft had seen proof of concept code published, but no evidence of exploitation in the wild before the patch was released.
*   The security bulletin mentions that the update modifies the way the Windows kernel-mode driver handles user-mode calls to GDI.

In summary, CVE-2011-5046 is a critical remote code execution vulnerability due to improper input validation within the Windows GDI kernel-mode driver. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability via a website, email, or a local application to gain complete control of the system. The provided content confirms the existence, impact, and exploitation methods of this vulnerability.
