Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2011-5278

**Vulnerability Description:**

*   The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw found in the `signature.php` file of the "MyBB Advanced Forum Signatures" plugin, specifically version `afsignatures-2.0.4`.

**Root Cause:**

*   The application fails to properly sanitize user input, specifically within the `afs_bar_right` parameter. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the database query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, which can allow an attacker to manipulate database queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the database, potentially enabling them to:
    *   Read sensitive information (e.g., usernames, passwords, user data).
    *   Modify data within the database.
    *   Potentially execute arbitrary code on the server (depending on the database system's capabilities and configuration).
    *   Bypass authentication.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is exploitable through a POST request to `signature.php`.
*   The vulnerable parameter is `afs_bar_right`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the target server hosting the vulnerable MyBB forum with the vulnerable plugin.
*   The attacker must be able to craft a malicious POST request containing the SQL injection payload in the `afs_bar_right` parameter.

**Technical Details:**

* The exploit content provides an example POST request:

```
POST -> afs_html=<a+href="http://localhost/mybb"><img+src="http://localhost/mybb/signature.php?uid=1"+alt=""+/></a>&afs_bbcode=[url=http://localhost/mybb][img]http://localhost/mybb/signature.php?uid=1[/img][/url]&afs_type=bar&afs_background=Default_Blue&afs_showonline=1&afs_full_line1=username&afs_full_line2=usergroup&afs_full_line3=postcount&afs_full_line4=registrationdate&afs_full_line5=reputation&afs_full_line6=blank&afs_bar_left=username&afs_bar_center=usergroup&afs_bar_right=postcount' , `password`= '65a1447de8e73ae67a938ae997ad4ed4', `salt`= 'NPOvUCXg'  WHERE `uid`='1';--
```
* This payload targets the `afs_bar_right` parameter.
*  The payload contains malicious SQL code injected after the `postcount` parameter, which attempts to modify the query and potentially extract password and salt data.

**Additional Notes**
* The exploit-db entry also lists CVE-2011-5277, however, this particular entry is specifically targeting the described SQL injection in `signature.php` as identified in CVE-2011-5278.
