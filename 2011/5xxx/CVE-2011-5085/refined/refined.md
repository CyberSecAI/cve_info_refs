Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2011-5085:

**Root Cause of Vulnerabilities:**

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in Movable Type, stemming from issues in file handling, command execution, session management, and template rendering. These issues exist due to a combination of insufficient input validation, insecure file handling, and improper escaping of output.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Local File Inclusion/Disclosure:** Users with "Create Entries" or "Manage Blog" permissions could potentially read arbitrary files on the local file system.
*   **Shell Command Injection:** Vulnerabilities in the file management system allow attackers to execute arbitrary operating system commands. This requires a logged-in user with file upload permissions.
*   **Session Hijacking:** Session hijack vulnerabilities exist in the commenting and community scripts.
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The commenting and community scripts are vulnerable to CSRF attacks.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Templates not properly escaping variables, and mt-wizard.cgi are vulnerable to XSS attacks, allowing for arbitrary script execution within a victim's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code on the server by exploiting the command injection flaw, which could lead to full system compromise.
*   **Data Disclosure:** Attackers can access sensitive local files on the server, potentially including configuration files or other sensitive data.
*   **Session Hijacking:** Attackers could gain control of a user's session, allowing them to perform actions as that user.
*   **CSRF Attacks:** Attackers can force users to perform unwanted actions on the web application.
*  **XSS Attacks:** Attackers could execute malicious scripts in a victim's browser, possibly leading to session hijacking, information theft, or further exploitation of the user's computer.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Interface:** All attacks are carried out through the web interface of the Movable Type application.
*   **File Uploads:** Shell command injection vulnerabilities are present in the file upload functionality.
*   **Commenting and Community Scripts:** Session hijacking and CSRF vulnerabilities can be exploited through interactions with the commenting and community features.
*   **Template Rendering:** XSS vulnerabilities can be exploited by injecting malicious code into templates.
*   **mt-wizard.cgi:** XSS vulnerabilities are present in mt-wizard.cgi.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication (for some vulnerabilities):** For the command injection vulnerability, the attacker needs to be a logged-in user with the permission to upload files. For some of the file disclosure vulnerabilities, the attacker needs "Create Entries" or "Manage Blog" permissions.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Movable Type instance.
*   **Browser for XSS:** The attacker needs a victim to load a vulnerable web page for the XSS vulnerability.
*   **Victim Interaction for CSRF:** The attacker needs to trick a victim into visiting a malicious web page for CSRF exploitation.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerabilities affect multiple versions of Movable Type, including both open-source and commercial editions.
*   The provided information indicates that the vulnerabilities were addressed in Movable Type versions 4.3.6, 5.05, and 5.1 and later. Debian also released an update to address the issue in their distribution.
*   The information provides more detail than the official CVE description by specifying the exact vulnerabilities, their causes, and the required conditions for exploitation.
