  "CVE-2011-5064": {
    "Metadata": {
      "ID": "CVE-2011-5064",
      "Description": "DigestAuthenticator.java in the HTTP Digest Access Authentication implementation in Apache Tomcat 5.5.x before 5.5.34, 6.x before 6.0.33, and 7.x before 7.0.12 uses Catalina as the hard-coded server secret (aka private key), which makes it easier for remote attackers to bypass cryptographic protection mechanisms by leveraging knowledge of this string, a different vulnerability than CVE-2011-1184."
    },
    "Analysis": {
      "Root cause": "The DigestAuthenticator in Apache Tomcat uses a hardcoded string ('Catalina') as the server secret (private key) for HTTP DIGEST authentication.",
      "Vulnerabilities": [
        "Weak HTTP DIGEST Authentication Implementation",
        "Hardcoded server secret"
      ],
      "Impact": "Remote attackers can bypass cryptographic protection mechanisms by leveraging the known server secret.",
      "Attack vector": "Remote. The vulnerability is exploitable by sending specially crafted HTTP requests.",
        "Attacker capabilities": "A remote attacker needs to have knowledge of the hard-coded server secret used by the vulnerable JBoss Web/Apache Tomcat instance.",
      "Details": "The vulnerability stems from the fact that the DigestAuthenticator class uses the hardcoded string 'Catalina' as a server-side secret for generating authentication credentials. This effectively weakens the authentication protocol and exposes it to session replay attacks."
