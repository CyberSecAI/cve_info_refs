The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities in 3S CoDeSys versions <= 3.4 SP4 Patch 2, specifically in the GatewayService and CmpWebServer components.

**A] GatewayService integer overflow:**
*   **Root cause:** An integer overflow occurs when calculating the memory allocation size. The program takes a 32-bit size value from the header, adds 0x34, and uses the result for memory allocation.
*   **Weaknesses:** Integer overflow leading to a small allocation.
*   **Impact:**  Potential heap overflow due to insufficient memory allocation which could lead to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack vector:** Sending a crafted packet to GatewayService with a large size in the header.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Network access to the GatewayService.

**B] CmpWebServer stack overflow:**
*   **Root cause:**  A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the function responsible for handling HTTP requests. The function copies the input URI into a limited stack buffer.
*   **Weaknesses:** Stack buffer overflow
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution due to overwriting the return address on the stack.
*   **Attack vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP GET request with an overly long URI.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Network access to the CmpWebServer service (port 8080).

**C] CmpWebServer Content-Length NULL pointer:**
*   **Root cause:** A NULL pointer dereference occurs when processing an HTTP POST request. The program trusts the provided Content-Length value and doesn't check if the memory allocation is valid, leading to a crash.
*   **Weaknesses:** NULL pointer dereference.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service due to a crash.
*  **Attack vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP POST request with an overly large Content-Length value.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Network access to the CmpWebServer service (port 8080).

**D] CmpWebServer invalid HTTP request NULL pointer:**
*   **Root cause:**  A NULL pointer dereference happens when processing an HTTP request with an unexpected method different from GET, POST, or HEAD.
*  **Weaknesses:** NULL pointer dereference.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service due to a crash.
*   **Attack vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP request with an invalid method.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Network access to the CmpWebServer service (port 8080).

**E] CmpWebServer folders creation:**
*   **Root cause:**  The webserver calls CreateDirectory before doing a secondary CreateFile (read mode)
*   **Weaknesses:** Unconventional folder creation behavior.
*   **Impact:**  Potential denial of service if logs or other files can't be created because the path exists as a directory, not a file. This is less likely, and considered a low risk issue.
*   **Attack vector:** Sending a series of crafted HTTP requests with directory traversal characters in the URI.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Network access to the CmpWebServer service (port 8080).
