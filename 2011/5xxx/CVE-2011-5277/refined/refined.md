Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-5277:

**Verification:**
The exploit-db entry explicitly mentions CVE-2011-5277 alongside CVE-2011-5278, indicating a relationship between the described exploit and this CVE.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is an SQL injection vulnerability in the 'afsignatures-2.0.4' plugin for MyBB.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, occurring via the `afs_bar_right` parameter in the `signature.php` file of the MyBB plugin. This parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database compromise:** By injecting malicious SQL queries, an attacker could potentially read, modify, or delete data in the MyBB database. This could lead to:
    - Data theft (user credentials, personal information)
    - Defacement of the forum.
    - Complete compromise of the forum and its associated data.
    - Creation of new administrative accounts

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending a POST request to the `signature.php` file of the vulnerable plugin.
- The malicious SQL code is injected through the `afs_bar_right` parameter within this POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the target MyBB forum.
- **No Authentication Required**: The exploit doesn't seem to require any kind of prior authentication on the target forum.
- **Understanding of SQL Injection:** The attacker must know how to craft SQL injection payloads.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable plugin**: The attacker must know the target is using the vulnerable plugin

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided exploit code targets the `afs_bar_right` parameter with a crafted SQL injection.
- The exploit example provided demonstrates how to inject a malicious SQL query by using a single quote to break out of the intended SQL command. The payload attempts to modify a password and salt where uid='1'.
- The exploit information also includes additional parameters, such as `afs_html`, `afs_bbcode`, `afs_type`, etc., but the vulnerability lies within `afs_bar_right`.

In summary, this exploit targets a SQL injection vulnerability in a MyBB plugin to gain unauthorized access to the database.
