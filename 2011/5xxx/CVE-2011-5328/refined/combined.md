This plugin has made 3 plugins superfluous for me. It can create and restrict new backend user roles. It can also hide menu items individually etc. Great work!

Easy to use. Restrict some categories went smooth. For me, it replaced PublishPress Capabilities.

Hello,
This is a great plugin for Wordpress. I am very curious if this plugin is still supported.
I mean is the developer(s) still active?
Because is it posible to set the inlog widget to dutch, and is it possible
When user A logs in he sees menu A and when user B logs in he sees menu B.

With new update they demand to have at least php 7.3 and then the site crashes. Why not just approve to use the plugin with 7.2 as well, not that big difference
