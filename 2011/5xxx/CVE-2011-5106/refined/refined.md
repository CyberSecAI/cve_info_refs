The provided content relates to a vulnerability in the "Flexible Custom Post Type" WordPress plugin. The vulnerability is related to a lack of sanitization of the `$_GET['id']` parameter when deleting custom post types or taxonomies, potentially leading to an arbitrary SQL injection.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The plugin directly uses the `$_GET['id']` parameter in SQL queries without proper sanitization when deleting custom post types or taxonomies.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   SQL Injection: The plugin is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the lack of sanitization of the `$_GET['id']` parameter.
*   Direct use of user-provided input in SQL queries without sanitization

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries, leading to data breaches, data manipulation, and denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**

*   By crafting a malicious URL with a manipulated 'id' parameter when trying to delete custom post types or taxonomies.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker would need to be able to access the WordPress admin interface.
*   The attacker would need to have privileges to access the manage custom post type interface of the vulnerable plugin.

**Technical Details:**

*   The code changes in the provided diff highlight the vulnerability. The original code used the unsanitized `$_GET['id']` directly within the `delete_post_type` and `delete_taxonomy` functions. The fix involves casting the `$_GET['id']` parameter to an integer `(int)$_GET['id']` before using it in queries.
*   Specifically, these lines were modified:
    *   `$this->delete_post_type($_GET['id']);` changed to `$this->delete_post_type($id);` where `$id = (int) $_GET['id'];`
    *   `$this->delete_taxonomy($_GET['id']);` changed to `$this->delete_taxonomy($id);` where `$id = (int) $_GET['id'];`
*   The code also had multiple instances where the `$_GET['id']` was not being typecasted to an integer. These have been fixed by typecasting the value to integer (`$id = (int) $_GET['id']`) prior to any usage.
* Additionally, the code change includes a check to prevent direct access to the included php files via direct browser navigation.
