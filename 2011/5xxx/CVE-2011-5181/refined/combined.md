### [Cancelled in 2017 still being charged](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/cancelled-in-2017-still-being-charged/)

Wrote an email of cancellation in 2017 – plugin was not used and not even installed on our site. Cancellation ignored and charged us again in 2018 and 2019. Click Desk are refusing to refund us for the 3 years they have charged us without authorisation. I would encourage everyone to find an alternative plugin that does not take your money without an agreement

Good experience with this plugin.
We needed some more CSS adaptation options but overall it does what it should.

It is great to have clickdesk as a partner for our business. It helped me grow my business in a short time.
