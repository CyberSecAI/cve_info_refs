How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Learn about all the improvements in the Plant SCADA 2023 release

[Learn more](/en/perspectives/blog/whats-new-in-aveva-plant-scada-2023-r2/)

## Empowering operators on the plant floor

Plant SCADA keeps taking on data sets as you add them. A context-aware consolidated view of operations and enhanced visualization capabilities let operators use them efficiently.

![/content/dam/aveva/images/products/w009/W009-Screen3-PlantSCADA-Scheduling-22-07.png](/content/dam/aveva/images/products/w009/W009-Screen3-PlantSCADA-Scheduling-22-07.png)

### Increase operator awareness

* Context-aware [SCADA](/en/solutions/operations/scada/) visualization with an out-of-the-box situational awareness layout provides flexible, consistent and rich context for operators.
* Equipment-driven interface gives operators real-time, holistic situational context that helps them improve efficiency and take timely corrective action.
* A single interface seamlessly integrates alarming, trending, interlocks and control data together across multiple monitors without the need for coding.
* Minimal visual distractions let operators make timely decisions that mitigate risk and operational downtime.

![/content/dam/aveva/images/products/w009/W009-PlantSCADAAccessAnywhere-3-12-21.jpg](/content/dam/aveva/images/products/w009/W009-PlantSCADAAccessAnywhere-3-12-21.jpg)

### Advanced alarm management

* Alarm indicators quickly draw operators' attention and help locate the source of anomalies and their severity.
* Alarm shelving lets you temporarily silence alarms for a specific duration or until a specified time—with the ability to re-shelve as needed.
* Define up to 8 causes, responses and consequences for your alarms to give your operators the information they need to deal with abnormal situations.
* An instant visual alarm summary shows the highest priority alarm for each piece of equipment, focusing operators on abnormal situations.

![/content/dam/aveva/images/products/w009/W009-PlantSCADAAccessAnywhere-4-12-21.jpg](/content/dam/aveva/images/products/w009/W009-PlantSCADAAccessAnywhere-4-12-21.jpg)

### Engineering simplicity

* A wide selection of configurable symbols follows industry best practices for situational awareness and abnormal situation management.
* Inclusive symbol library significantly reduces time you spend building graphics while still letting you customize objects for your unique needs.
* Integrated development environment, modern graphics system and workspace concept reduce the time you spend building complex layouts.
* Equipment templates simplify design by reusing, duplicating and propagating changes.
* Deploy changes live without interrupting operations, stopping data gathering or taking systems offline.
* Centralized project deployment provides controlled transfer of project changes to servers and clients, native version control with local and remote rollback, and delta-only transfer.
* Unique Cicode programming language gives you deep customization and flexibility in design and scripting.

### Additional capabilities

* HTML5 web client (local network)
* Plant SCADA Access Anywhere extension (external network)
* Real-time reporting
* Process analyst trending
* Statistical process control module (SPC)
* Architectural flexibility for centralized or distributed systems, inclusive of clustering
* Client and server redundancy
* 150+ communication drivers, including native integration to Schneider Electric devices
* Role-based user security permissions
* Multi-language support

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
