Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-5139:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause of the vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw in the `page.php` script of the Pre Studio Business Cards Designer application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input within the `id` parameter, which is then used in a SQL query, thus allowing an attacker to manipulate the query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database Compromise:** A successful SQL injection can allow an attacker to:
    - Read sensitive data from the database (e.g., user credentials, personal information)
    - Modify or delete data
    - Potentially gain control over the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploitable through a crafted HTTP GET request to `page.php`, with the malicious SQL injection payload injected into the `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Accessibility:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application.
- **Understanding SQL:** Basic understanding of SQL syntax and common SQL injection techniques is needed to craft the malicious payload.
- **No Authentication Needed:** The provided information does not specify any authentication requirements to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The exploit is quite basic and targets a generic SQL injection vector in the `id` parameter within the application's `page.php` script.
- The vulnerable application is identified as "Pre Studio Business Cards Designer" and the specific vulnerable file is "page.php" using the id parameter for the SQL injection.
