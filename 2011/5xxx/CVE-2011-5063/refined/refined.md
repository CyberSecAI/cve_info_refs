  "CVE-2011-5063": {
    "description": "The HTTP Digest Access Authentication implementation in Apache Tomcat 5.5.x before 5.5.34, 6.x before 6.0.33, and 7.x before 7.0.12 does not check realm values, which might allow remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging the availability of a protection space with weaker authentication or authorization requirements, a different vulnerability than CVE-2011-1184.",
    "root_cause": "The HTTP Digest Access Authentication implementation in Apache Tomcat does not check realm values.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper validation of realm values in HTTP Digest Authentication."
    ],
    "impact": "Remote attackers may bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging a weaker protection space.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "An attacker can exploit the lack of realm validation in HTTP Digest authentication to access resources intended for other protection spaces."
    ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable server with crafted realm values, and have knowledge of a protection space with weaker authentication or authorization requirements.",
    "additional_details": "This vulnerability is related to but distinct from CVE-2011-1184. The vulnerability can allow an attacker to bypass intended access restrictions."
