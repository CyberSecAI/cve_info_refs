The provided content is related to CVE-2011-5079. It's a collective security bulletin (TYPO3-EXT-SA-2012-001) detailing vulnerabilities found in multiple third-party TYPO3 extensions.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Found in `mv_cooking`, `toi_category`, `mm_whtppr`, `rtg_files`, `bc_post2facebook`,
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Found in `toi_category`, `rtg_files`, `bc_post2facebook`, `css_filelinks`, `irfaq`, `skt_eurocalc`, `ya_googlesearch`, `terminal`, `beuserswitch`, `jftcaforms`, `aeurltool`.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Found in `sysutils`, `beuserswitch`.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Found in `typo3_webservice`
*  **Open Redirection:** Found in `irfaq`
*  **Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** Found in `terminal`

**Impact:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Could allow attackers to manipulate or extract data from the database.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting:** Could allow attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages, potentially leading to user session hijacking or data theft.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Could expose sensitive information to unauthorized users.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Open Redirection:** Could redirect users to malicious sites.
*   **Cross Site Request Forgery:** Could allow attacker to perform unwanted actions on behalf of authenticated users.

**Affected Extensions and Versions:**
*   `mv_cooking`: Versions 0.4.0 and below
*   `toi_category`: Versions 0.6.0 and below
*   `mm_whtppr`: Versions 0.0.4 and below
*   `rtg_files`: Versions 1.5.1 and below
*   `bc_post2facebook`: Versions 0.2.1 and below
*   `sysutils`: Versions 1.0.3 and below
*    `typo3_webservice`: Versions 0.3.7 and below
*   `css_filelinks`: Versions 0.2.18 and below
*   `irfaq`: Versions 1.1.2 and below
*   `skt_eurocalc`: Version 0.0.1
*   `ya_googlesearch`: Versions 0.3.9 and below
*   `terminal`: Versions 0.3.2 and below
*   `beuserswitch`: Version 0.0.1
*   `jftcaforms`: Versions 0.2.0 and below
*   `aeurltool`: Version 0.1.0

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vectors are generally through web requests to vulnerable parts of the mentioned extensions. The specific vulnerabilities are exploited through user-supplied data.
*   For `typo3_webservice`, the access is only available to authenticated backend users, this limits the attack vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities:**

*   For most vulnerabilities, no authentication is required.
*   For `typo3_webservice`, the attacker needs to be an authenticated backend user.

**Solutions:**

*   Updates for vulnerable extensions are provided where available, mentioned by version number and link to the extension repository.
*   Some extensions had their vulnerable versions removed from the TYPO3 Extension Repository due to the authors not providing security fixes. Users are advised to uninstall and delete these extensions (`toi_category`, `mm_whtppr`, `skt_eurocalc`, `terminal`, `beuserswitch`, `aeurltool`).

**Additional Information:**

*   The bulletin classifies the severity of the vulnerabilities as critical, high, medium and low based on CVSS v2.0 scores.
*   The bulletin mentions that the SQL injection vulnerability in `mv_cooking` is known to be exploited in the wild.
*   The bulletin also emphasizes that these are third-party extensions and are not part of the default TYPO3 installation.
