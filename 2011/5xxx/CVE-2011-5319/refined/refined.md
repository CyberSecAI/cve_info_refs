{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "An application with access to accelerometer readings on a mobile phone can use this information to recover text entered on a nearby keyboard.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The accelerometer on modern mobile phones samples at near the Nyquist rate, allowing for the detection and decoding of keystrokes by measuring the relative physical position and distance between each vibration.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can recover text entered on a nearby keyboard, potentially leading to the compromise of sensitive information such as passwords or private messages.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through a malicious application installed on the victim's mobile phone, which has access to the phone's accelerometer.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the victim's mobile phone. The attacker does not need physical access to the keyboard itself, but the phone needs to be within range to pick up the keyboard vibrations."
