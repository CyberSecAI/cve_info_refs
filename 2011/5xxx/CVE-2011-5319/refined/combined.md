## Abstract

Mobile phones are increasingly equipped with a range of highly responsive sensors. From cameras and GPS receivers to three-axis accelerometers, applications running on these devices are able to experience rich interactions with their environment. Unfortunately, some applications may be able to use such sensors to monitor their surroundings in unintended ways. In this paper, we demonstrate that an application with access to accelerometer readings on a modern mobile phone can use such information to recover text entered on a nearby keyboard. Note that unlike previous emanation recovery papers, the accelerometers on such devices sample at near the Nyquist rate, making previous techniques unworkable. Our application instead detects and decodes keystrokes by measuring the relative physical position and distance between each vibration. We then match abstracted words against candidate dictionaries and record word recovery rates as high as 80%. In so doing, we demonstrate the potential to recover significant information from the vicinity of a mobile device without gaining access to resources generally considered to be the most likely sources of leakage (e.g., microphone, camera).

Release updates from the Chrome team

## [Stable Channel Update](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2015/03/stable-channel-update.html "Stable Channel Update")

Tuesday, March 3, 2015

The Chrome team is delighted to announce the promotion of Chrome 41 to the stable channel for Windows, Mac and Linux. Chrome 41.0.2272.76 contains a number of fixes and improvements, including:

* A number of new apps/extension APIs
* Lots of under the hood changes for stability and performance

A list of changes is available in the [log](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2Blog/40.0.2214.115..41.0.2272.76?pretty=fuller&n=10000).

Security Fixes and Rewards

Note: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed.

This update includes [51 security fixes](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/list?can=1&q=type%3Abug-security+label%3ARelease-0-M41&sort=id+-security_severity+-secseverity+-owner+-modified&colspec=ID+Pri+Status+Summary+Modified+OS+M+Security_severity+Security_impact+Owner+Reporter&cells=tiles). Below, we highlight fixes that were contributed by external researchers. Please see the [Chromium security page](http://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security) for more information.

We would also like to thank all security researchers that worked with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel. The total value of additional rewards and their recipients will be updated here when all reports have gone through the reward panel.

As usual, our ongoing internal security work was responsible for a wide range of fixes:

* [[463349](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=463349)] CVE-2015-1231: Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives.
* Multiple vulnerabilities in V8 fixed at the tip of the 4.1 branch (currently 4.1.0.21).

Many of the above bugs were detected using [AddressSanitizer](http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer) or [MemorySanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/wiki/MemorySanitizer).
