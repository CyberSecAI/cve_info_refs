How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

     (PT-2011-25) Positive Technologies Security Advisory

     SQL injection vulnerabilities in Support Incident Tracker

----------------------------------------------------------------------

---[ Vulnerable software ]

        SiT!
        Version 3.63p1 and earlier

        Application link:
        <http://www.sitracker.org/>

---[ Severity level ]

        Severity level:                High
        Impact:                        SQL injection
        Access Vector:                 Network exploitable

        CVSS v2:
                Base Score:     6.5
                Vector:         (AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P)

        CVE:   not assigned

---[ Software description ]

Support Incident Tracker (or SiT!) is a free software/open source (GPL) web-based application.

---[ Vulnerability description ]

Positive Research Center has discovered multiply SQL injection vulnerabilities in OneOrZero AIMS. Application
incorrectly validates input data, which allows attackers to conduct an SQL injection attack.

"SQL Injection" is a way to bypass network protection and attack the database. Settings transferred to the database
through Web applications are specially crafted to modify executable SQL query. For example, an attacker could execute
an additional query along with the first one by adding different symbols to a setting.

Vulnerable scripts:
report_marketing.php
tasks.php

The attack can be used to reach the following goals:
Gain access to data that is normally unavailable or obtain system configuration data that can be used for further
attacks. For example, a modified query may return hashed user passwords which could be decrypted with the brute-force
method.

Vulnerable scripts:
billable_incidents.php
search.php

--[ How to fix ]

Update your software up to the latest version.
<http://sitracker.org/wiki/ReleaseNotes>

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
