Debian Bug     : 637469 637477 637485 637584 637629 637630 637618 637537 637487 637632 637669

Ansgar Burchardt, Mike O'Connor and Philipp Kern discovered multiple
vulnerabilities in DTC, a web control panel for admin and accounting
hosting services:

CVE-2011-3195

    A possible shell insertion has been found in the mailing list
    handling.

CVE-2011-3196

    Unix rights for the apache2.conf were set incorrectly (world
    readable).

CVE-2011-3197

    Incorrect input sanitising for the $_SERVER["addrlink"] parameter
    could lead to SQL insertion.

CVE-2011-3198

    DTC was using the -b option of htpasswd, possibly revealing
    password in clear text using ps or reading /proc.

CVE-2011-3199

    A possible HTML/javascript insertion vulnerability has been found
    in the DNS & MX section of the user panel.

This update also fixes several vulnerabilities, for which no CVE ID
has been assigned:

It has been discovered that DTC performs insufficient input sanitising
in the package installer, leading to possible unwanted destination
directory for installed packages if some DTC application packages
are installed (note that these aren't available in Debian main).

DTC was setting-up /etc/sudoers with permissive sudo rights to
chrootuid.

Incorrect input sanitizing in the package installer could lead to
SQL insertion.

A malicious user could enter a specially crafted support ticket
subject leading to an SQL injection in the draw_user_admin.php.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.29.18-1+lenny2

The stable distribution (squeeze) doesn't include dtc.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.34.1-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your dtc packages.

I'm grouping the above two together.

Let's call this "multiple XSS flaws"
CVE-2011-3199

Thanks for sorting the original list.

Subject: Re: CVE request: multiple vulnerabilities in dtc

We are discussing the issues with Philippe Kern. While there are issues
that were discovered, I am claiming that some of what you see below
shouldn't be in the list.

On 08/13/2011 05:26 AM, Jonathan Wiltshire wrote:

That's not more a security vulnerability than /etc/mysql/debian.cnf
(both file are readable by root only). This has been in the BTS for a
long time, and it makes no sense to assign a CVE now.

That's not relevant and isn't a vulnerability. I have closed the bug a
long time ago, writing that I wont fix it, and explaining why. Please
see the BTS entry for it. dtc-xen isn't supposed to run stand-alone, and
the only client for dtc-xen is dtc itself. If you gain access to it,
then there is an issue somewhere else, and "fixing" things here wont
make things better.

This is fixed in the Git, and has already been discussed. While it's a
serious issue (which has been carefully worked on), it didn't deserve a
CVE 6 months ago, and it shouldn't right now.

The above should be fixed and are real issues, but what I commented
don't deserve a CVE.

Absolutely all of them need a user to be logged indeed.

The two logPushlet.php pages do not sanitize input allowing for SQL injection.

as an example, going to a url like:

<http://127.0.0.1/dtcadmin/logPushlet.php?vps_node='%20or%201%20into%20outfile%20'/tmp/kilroy>

will create a /tmp/kilroy file on the server using the mysql server credentials.
