Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities in Subrion CMS, as reported by the exploit author:

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection (SQLi):**
    *   **Root Cause:**  The application is vulnerable to SQL injection via the login mechanism.
    *   **Weakness:** Improper input sanitization when handling user-supplied credentials.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Exploited through the username and password input fields during login.
    *  **Attacker Capability**: No special capabilities required. Can be done remotely
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can bypass authentication and gain access to the admin panel.
    *   **Exploit:** The provided exploit uses `' or 0=0 #` as both username and password, which bypasses authentication due to the logical nature of SQL queries.

*   **Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   **Root Cause:** Input is not sanitized in the "title" field of the Poll module, specifically in the "Manage Pages" section.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of output encoding when displaying the title field allows execution of injected Javascript.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious JavaScript into the "title" field.
    *   **Attacker Capability**: Requires the attacker to access the admin panel to inject malicious code.
    *   **Impact:** When the page is rendered, the injected JavaScript executes within the victim's browser. This can lead to session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, or other malicious actions.
    *   **Exploit:** The exploit uses an `IFRAME` tag with a JavaScript alert: `"><IFRAME SRC="javascript:alert('XSS');"></IFRAME>`.

*   **Affected Products:** It's stated that other Subrion CMS products (Auto Classifieds, Articles Script, Real Estate Script, Web Directory) are also vulnerable because they are based on the same CMS.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The report emphasizes that the CMS is a combined platform of several different functionalities, so vulnerabilities affect all components.
*   The blog post also includes a disclaimer against the misuse of the exploit and encourages ethical hacking.
* The report provides two CVE IDs, 2011-5212 and 2011-5211.

**Summary:**
The provided text details SQL injection and persistent XSS vulnerabilities in Subrion CMS, allowing attackers to bypass authentication and execute malicious scripts. The SQLi can be used to access admin panel and the persistent XSS can be used to perform actions in the context of a logged in user by an attacker.
