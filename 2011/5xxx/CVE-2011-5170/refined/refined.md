```
- Root cause of vulnerability: Stack-based buffer overflow when processing a .m3u playlist file with a long track name.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The application fails to properly validate the length of track names when parsing a .m3u playlist file, allowing an attacker to overwrite the stack. Specifically, the SEH (Structured Exception Handling) record can be overwritten.
- Impact of exploitation: Arbitrary code execution by overwriting the SEH record, allowing the attacker to redirect program flow and execute attacker-supplied shellcode.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability is triggered by opening a specially crafted .m3u playlist file with CCMPlayer 1.5. The malicious .m3u file contains an overly long track name designed to overwrite the stack and SEH record.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious .m3u file and have the user open it with the vulnerable CCMPlayer 1.5 application. This is a local attack.
