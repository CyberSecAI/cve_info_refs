{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Integer overflows in float rendering.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": "Integer overflow",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Likely memory corruption leading to arbitrary code execution, as integer overflows can cause out-of-bounds writes and reads, use-after-free conditions and heap corruption. This is a high severity vulnerability.",
  "Attack vectors": "Web page content that triggers the float rendering with crafted values can trigger the overflow.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be able to serve a web page to the victim's browser or somehow trick the victim into opening a malicious page"
