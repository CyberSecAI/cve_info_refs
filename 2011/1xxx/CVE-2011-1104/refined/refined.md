Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in the CERT vulnerability note VU#136612, which is likely related to CVE-2011-1104, although no CVE number is directly mentioned.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper validity checks in the HTTP requests made by the Mutare Software Enabled VoiceMail (EVM) system's web interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1.  **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The web interface is susceptible to CSRF attacks because it doesn't properly validate the source of the requests, allowing an attacker to forge requests on behalf of a user.
2.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** While not explicitly detailed in the description, the note mentions that the web interface is also susceptible to XSS attacks. This suggests that the application might not be properly sanitizing user-supplied data, allowing for injection of malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to:

1.  **Change a user's EVM PIN:** This would effectively lock the user out of their voicemail account.
2.  **Delete a user's voice messages:** This results in a loss of potentially important information for the user.
3.  **Add or modify the email delivery address for voicemails:** This can redirect voicemail notifications to an attacker's email, allowing them to potentially intercept sensitive information or be used in further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector involves tricking a user into visiting a specially crafted link. This link would contain a malicious HTTP request targeting the vulnerable web interface. When the user accesses the link (e.g., through a phishing email), the browser will send the request, potentially causing the unintended actions to be performed on the user's account.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
1.  **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to be able to trick the user into clicking a malicious link.
2.  **Basic Web Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL that exploits the vulnerabilities of the EVM web interface.
3.  **No need for prior authentication:** If the user is already authenticated on the EVM web interface and is tricked to click the malicious link, the forged request will be executed with the privileges of the logged in user.

**Additional Details:**
*   The CERT note mentions that there is no practical solution available at the time, however they recommend restricting network access to the web interface.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Travis Lee.
*   The vendor (Mutare Software) was notified on November 22, 2010, and updated on January 6, 2011, but no statement was received.
