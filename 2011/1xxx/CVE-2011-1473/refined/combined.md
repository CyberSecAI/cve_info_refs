Some days ago, a hacker group, THC, released a
[denial of service tool](https://web.archive.org/web/2011/http%3A//www.thc.org/thc-ssl-dos/ "THC-SSL-DOS tool") for TLS web servers. As stated in its
description, the problem is not really new: a complete TLS handshake
implies costly cryptographic computations.

There are two different aspects in the presented attack:

* The computation cost of a handshake is more important for the
  server than for the client. The advisory explains that a server
  will require 15 times the processing power of a client. This means
  a single average workstation could challenge a multi-core high-end
  server.
* [TLS renegotiation](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5746 "RFC 5746: TLS Renegotiation Indication Extension") allows you to trigger hundreds of
  handshakes in the same TCP connection. Even a client behind a DSL
  connection can therefore bomb a server with a lot of renegotiation
  requests.

Update (2015-02)

While the content of this article is still
technically sound, ensure you understand it was written by the end of
2011 and therefore doesn’t take into account many important aspects,
like the fall of RC4 as an appropriate cipher.

# Mitigation techniques[#](#mitigation-techniques "Permanent link")

There is no definitive solution to this attack but there exists some
workarounds. Since the DoS tool from THC relies heavily on
renegotiation, the most obvious one is to disable this mechanism on
the server side but we will explore other possibilities.

## Disabling TLS renegotiation[#](#disabling-tls-renegotiation "Permanent link")

Tackling the second problem seems easy: just disable TLS
renegotiation. It is hardly needed: a server can trigger a
renegotiation to ask a client to present a certificate but a client
usually does not have any reason to trigger one. Because of a
[past vulnerability in TLS renegotiation](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2009-3555 "CVE-2009-3555"), recent
versions of *Apache* and *nginx* just forbid it, even when the
[non-vulnerable version](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5746 "RFC 5746: TLS Renegotiation Indication Extension") is available.

`openssl s_client` can be used to test if TLS renegotiation is really
disabled. Sending `R` on an empty line trigger renegotiation. Here is
an example where renegotiation is disabled (despite being advertised
as supported):

```
$ openssl s_client -connect www.luffy.cx:443 -tls1
[…]
New, TLSv1/SSLv3, Cipher is DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA
Server public key is 2048 bit
Secure Renegotiation IS supported
Compression: zlib compression
Expansion: zlib compression
[…]
R
RENEGOTIATING
140675659794088:error:1409E0E5:SSL routines:SSL3_WRITE_BYTES:ssl handshake failure:s3_pkt.c:591:

```

Disabling renegotiation is not trivial with OpenSSL. As an example, I
have pushed a [patch to disable renegotiation in *stud*](https://github.com/bumptech/stud/pull/47 "CVE-2009-3555 fix for stud"),
the scalable TLS unwrapping daemon.

## Rate limiting TLS handshakes[#](#rate-limiting-tls-handshakes "Permanent link")

Disabling TLS renegotiation on the client side is not always
possible. For example, your web server may be too old to propose such
an option. Since these renegotiations should not happen often, a
workaround is to limit them.

When the flaw was first advertised, [F5 Networks](https://www.f5.com "F5 Networks website") provided a way
to configure such a limitation with an iRule on their load-balancers.
We can do something similar with Netfilter. We can spot most TCP
packets triggering such a renegotiation by looking for encrypted TLS
handshake record. They may happen in a regular handshake but in this
case, they usually are not at the beginning of the TCP payload. There
is no field saying if a TLS record is encrypted or not (TLS is
stateful for this purpose). Therefore, we have to use some heuristics.
If the handshake type is unknown, we assume that this is an encrypted
record. Moreover, renegotiation requests are usually encapsulated in a
TCP packet flagged with “push.”

```
# Access to TCP payload (if not fragmented)
payload="0 >> 22 & 0x3C @ 12 >> 26 & 0x3C @"
iptables -A LIMIT_RENEGOTIATION \
    -p tcp --dport 443 \
    --tcp-flags SYN,FIN,RST,PSH PSH \
    -m u32 \
    --u32 "$payload 0 >> 8 = 0x160300:0x160303 && $payload 2 & 0xFF = 3:10,17:19,21:255" \
    -m hashlimit \
    --hashlimit-above 5/minute --hashlimit-burst 3 \
    --hashlimit-mode srcip --hashlimit-name ssl-reneg \
    -j DROP

```

The use of `u32` match is a bit difficult to read. The
[manual page](https://manpages.debian.org/unstable/iptables/iptables.8.en.html "Manual page of iptables(8)") gives some insightful examples. `$payload`
allows us to seek for the TCP payload. It only works if there is no
fragmentation. Then, we check if we have a handshake (`0x16`) and if
we recognise TLS version (`0x0300`, `0x0301`, `0x0302` or
`0x0303`). At least, we check if the handshake type is not a known
value.

1

Handling TLS state in Netfilter is quite hard. The first
solution is using the fact that renegotiation requests are
encapsulated in a TCP segment flagged with “push.” This is not
always the case and it is trivial to workaround. With the
second solution, we assume that the first encrypted handshake
record is packed in the same TCP segment than the client key
exchange. If it comes in its own TCP segment, it would be seen
as a renegotiation while it is not. The state machine needs to
be improved to detect the first encrypted handshake at the
beginning of a TLS record or in the middle of it.

There is a risk of false positives but since we use `hashlimit`, we
should be safe. This is not a bullet proof solution: TCP fragmentation
would allow an attacker to evade detection. Another equivalent
solution would be to use `CONNMARK` to record the fact the initial
handshake has been done and forbid any subsequent handshakes.[1](#fn-noo)

If you happen to disable TLS renegotiation, you can still use some
Netfilter rule to limit the number of TLS handshakes by limiting the
number of TCP connections from one IP:

```
iptables -A LIMIT_TLS \
    -p tcp --dport 443 \
    --syn -m state --state NEW \
    -m hashlimit \
    --hashlimit-above 120/minute --hashlimit-burst 20 \
    --hashlimit-mode srcip --hashlimit-name ssl-conn \
    -j DROP

```

2

However, since this rule relies on source IP to identify the
attacker, the risk of false positive is real. You can slow down
legitimate proxies, networks NATed behind a single IP, mobile
users sharing an IP address or people behind a CGN.

Your servers will still be vulnerable to a large botnet but if there
is only a handful of source IP, this rule will work just fine.[2](#fn-a)

I have made all these solutions available in a
[single file](https://github.com/vincentbernat/ssl-dos/blob/master/iptables.sh "Firewall rules to mitigate TLS DoS").

## Increasing server-side power processing[#](#increasing-server-side-power-processing "Permanent link")

TLS can easily be scaled up and out. Since
[TLS performance increases linearly with the number of cores](/en/blog/2011-ssl-benchmark "First round of TLS benchmarks"),
scaling up can be done by throwing in more CPU or more cores per
CPU. Adding expensive TLS accelerators would also do the
trick. Scaling out is also relatively easy but you should care about
[TLS session resume](/en/blog/2011-ssl-session-reuse-rfc5077 "Speeding up TLS: enabling session reuse").

## Putting more work on the client[#](#putting-more-work-on-the-client "Permanent link")

In their presentation of the [denial of service tool](https://web.archive.org/web/2011/http%3A//www.thc.org/thc-ssl-dos/ "THC-SSL-DOS tool"), THC explains:

> Establishing a secure SSL connection requires 15× more processing
> power on the server than on the client.

I don’t know where this figure comes from. To check it, I built a
[small tool to measure CPU time of a client and a server doing 1000 handshakes](https://github.com/vincentbernat/ssl-dos/blob/master/server-vs-client.c "Tool compare processing power needed by client and server")
with various parameters (cipher suites and key sizes). The results are
summarized on the following plot:

![Plot to compare computational power required by servers and clients](https://d2pzklc15kok91.cloudfront.net/images/benchs-ssl/server-vs-client.8147f11d0277d8.png)

Comparison of computational power needed by servers and clients

Update (2011-11)

Adam Langley announced [Google HTTPS sites now
support forward secrecy](https://www.imperialviolet.org/2011/11/22/forwardsecret.html "Forward secrecy for Google HTTPS") and `ECDHE-RSA-RC4-SHA` is now the
preferred cipher suite thanks to fast, constant-time implementations
of elliptic curves P-224, P-256 and P-521 in OpenSSL. The tests above
did not use these implementations.

For example, with 2048-bit RSA certificates and a cipher suite like
`AES256-SHA`, the server needs 6 times more CPU power than the
client. However, if we use `DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA` instead, the server
needs 34% less CPU power. The most efficient cipher suite from the
server point of view seems to be something like `DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA`
where the server needs half the power of the client.

However, you can’t really use only these shiny cipher suites:

3

Cipher suites supported by all browsers are `RC4-MD5`, `RC4-SHA`
and `3DES-SHA`. ~~Support for `DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA` requires TLS
1.2~~ ~~(not supported by any browser).~~

1. Some browsers do not support them: they are limited to RSA cipher
   suites.[3](#fn-1)
2. Using them will increase your regular load a lot. Your servers may
   collapse with just legitimate traffic.
3. They are expensive for some mobile clients: they need more memory,
   more processing power and will drain battery faster.

Let’s dig a bit more on why the server needs more computational power
in the case of RSA. Here is a TLS handshake when using a cipher suite
like `AES256-SHA`:

![TLS full handshake](https://d2pzklc15kok91.cloudfront.net/images/benchs-ssl/ssl-handshake.10d4a774bb0983.svg)

Full TLS handshake

When sending the *Client Key Exchange* message, the client will
**encrypt** TLS version and 46 random bytes with the public key of the
certificate sent by the server in its *Certificate* message. The
server will have to **decrypt** this message with its private
key. These are the two most expensive operations in the
handshake. Encryption and decryption are done with [RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rivest_Shamir_Adleman "Article on Wikipedia for RSA") (because
of the selected cipher suite). To understand why decryption is more
expensive than encryption, let me explain how RSA works.

First, the server needs a public and a private key. Here are the main
steps to generate them:

1. Pick two random distinct [prime numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number "Article on Wikipedia for prime numbers") ppp and qqq, each
   roughly the same size.
2. Compute n=pqn=pqn=pq. It is the *modulus*.
3. Compute φ(n)=(p−1)(q−1)\varphi(n)=(p-1)(q-1)φ(n)=(p−1)(q−1).
4. Choose an integer eee such that 1<e<φ(n)1<e<\varphi(n)1<e<φ(n) and
   gcd⁡(φ(n),e)=1\gcd(\varphi(n),e) = 1gcd(φ(n),e)=1 (i.e. eee and φ(n)\varphi(n)φ(n) are
   [coprime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coprime "Article on Wikipedia for coprime numbers")). It is the *public exponent*.
5. Compute d=e−1 mod φ(n)d=e^{-1}\bmod\varphi(n)d=e−1modφ(n). It is the *private key
   exponent*.

The **public key** is (n,e)(n,e)(n,e) while the **private key** is (n,d)(n,d)(n,d). A
message to be encrypted is first turned into an integer m<nm<nm<n (with
some appropriate padding). It is then encrypted to a ciphered message
ccc with the public key and should only be decrypted with the private
key:

* c=me mod nc=m^e\bmod nc=memodn  (encryption)
* m=cd mod nm=c^d\bmod nm=cdmodn  (decryption)

So, why is decryption more expensive? In fact, the key pair is not
really generated like I said above. Usually, eee is a small fixed
prime number with a lot of 0, like 17 (`0x11`) or 65537 (`0x10001`)
and ppp and qqq are chosen such that φ(n)\varphi(n)φ(n) is coprime with
eee. This allows encryption to be fast using
[exponentiation by squaring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation_by_squaring "Article on Wikipedia for exponentiation by squaring"). On the other hand, its inverse
ddd is a big number with no special property and therefore,
exponentiation is more costly and slow.

Instead of computing ddd from eee, it is possible to choose ddd and
compute eee. We could choose ddd to be small and coprime with
φ(n)\varphi(n)φ(n) and then compute e=d−1 mod φ(n)e=d^{-1}\bmod\varphi(n)e=d−1modφ(n) and get
blazingly fast decryption. Unfortunately, there are two problems with
this:

* Most TLS implementations expect eee to be a 32-bit integer.
* If ddd is too small (less than one-quarter as many bits as the
  modulus nnn), it can be
  [computed efficiently from the public key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener%27s_Attack "Article on Wikipedia for Wiener's attack").

Therefore, we cannot use a small private exponent. The best we can do
is to choose the public exponent to be e′=4294967291e'=4294967291e′=4294967291 (the biggest
prime 32-bit number and it contains only one 0). However, there is no
change as you can see on our comparative plot.

To summarize, no real solution here. You need to allow RSA cipher
suites and there is no way to improve the computational ratio between
the server and the client with such a cipher suite.

Eric is one of the author of several RFC related to TLS. He knows his stuff.

Shortly after the release the [denial of service tool](https://web.archive.org/web/2011/http%3A//www.thc.org/thc-ssl-dos/ "THC-SSL-DOS tool"), Eric
Rescorla[4](#fn-0) published a
[good analysis on the impact of such a tool](https://web.archive.org/web/2011/http%3A//www.educatedguesswork.org/2011/10/ssltls_and_computational_dos.html "Educated Guesswork: SSL/TLS and Computational DoS"). He asks
himself about the efficiency to use renegotiation for such an attack:

> What you should be asking at this point is whether a computational DoS
> attack based on renegotiation is any better for the attacker than a
> computational DoS attack based on multiple connections. The way we

I have written a
[quick proof of concept of such a tool](https://github.com/vincentbernat/ssl-dos/blob/master/brute-shake.c "Tool to emit massive parallel TLS handshakes"). To avoid any
abuse, it will only work if the server supports `NULL-MD5`
cipher suite. No sane server in the wild will support such a
cipher. You need to configure your web server to support it before
using this tool.

While Eric explains that there is no need to parse any TLS
messages, I have found that if the key exchange message is sent before
the server sends the answer, the connection will be aborted. Therefore,
I quickly parse the server’s answer to check if I can continue. Eric
also says a bogus key exchange message can be sent since the server
will have to decrypt it before discovering it is bogus. I have chosen
to build a valid key exchange message during the first handshake
(using the certificate presented by the server) and replay it on
subsequent handshakes because I think the server may dismiss the
message before the computation is complete (for example, if the size
does not match the size of the certificate).

Update (2011-11)

Michał Trojnara has written
sslsqueeze, a similar tool. It uses `libevent2` library
and should display better performance than mine. It does not compute
a valid key exchange message but ensure the length is correct.

With such a tool and 2048-bit RSA certificate, a server is using 100
times more processing power than the client. Unfortunately, this means
that most solutions, except rate limiting, exposed on this page
may just be ineffective.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=707065#c0)  Vincent Danen    2011-05-23 21:01:10 UTC  ``` It was reported [1] that a flaw exists in how openSSL handles SSL renegotiation.  Because of the processing power required to handle an SSL/TLS handshake, with renegotiation enabled, a user can send multiple handshakes per second due to the renegotiation request being permitted.  This could allow a malicious user to send multiple renegotiation requests and exhaust server resources.  Note that this is not the only way to cause a denial of service on an SSL-enabled service; there are many other ways to accomplish the same thing, this just makes it easier.  What makes this bug even more confusing is that this report is recent, with a 2011 CVE, however the recommended fix in the report is to upgrade to OpenSSL 0.9.8l, which is what disabled renegotiation, however it was subsequently re-enabled when OpenSSL added support for RFC5746 in OpenSSL 0.9.8m (which the reporter seems to imply isn't sufficient).  I'm not sure where the CVE assignment came from; on MITRE's site is is reserved yet and I have not seen this discussed anywhere else but in a Nessus scan report [2].  As an aside, and to reference something we may need to look at, there seems to be some concern with Apache and how it works with SSL renegotiation disabled [3], so we will need to look into cases where disabling SSL renegotiation may impact expected behaviour of currently released products.  [1] <http://orchilles.com/2011/03/ssl-renegotiation-dos.html> [2] <https://discussions.nessus.org/message/10629> [3] <http://old.nabble.com/TLS-renegotiation-disabling-%3A-mod_ssl-and-OpenSSL--0.9.8l-td26285568.html>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=707065#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2011-05-23 23:27:16 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=707065#c0)) > It was reported [1] that a flaw exists in how openSSL handles SSL > renegotiation.  The referenced write-up of the issue describes this as a SSL/TLS protocol issue that may affect various implementations that permit client-initiated renegotiation without arbitrary limits to restrict renegotiation rate.  This is more likely to affect applications using SSL libraries that handle renegotiations without requiring applications support (OpenSSL, NSS, Java JRE).  > Note that this is not the only way to cause a denial of service on an > SSL-enabled service; there are many other ways to accomplish the same thing, > this just makes it easier.  This issue was raised on the IETF TLS working group mailing list: <http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/tls/current/msg07553.html>  Several replies in the discussion indicate that this attack offers limited advantages over an attack were only one (initial) negotiation is performed over one connection.  Using renegotiation allows making this attack more efficient by using single connection for several handshakes.  However, the use of SSL implies that server needs to perform certain time-expensive computations for its normal operation.  > What makes this bug even more confusing is that this report is recent, with a > 2011 CVE, however the recommended fix in the report is to upgrade to OpenSSL > 0.9.8l, which is what disabled renegotiation, however it was subsequently > re-enabled when OpenSSL added support for RFC5746 in OpenSSL 0.9.8m (which the > reporter seems to imply isn't sufficient).  Renegotiation was disabled in 0.9.8l as a temporary fix for [CVE-2009-3555](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-3555) issue, rather than to address this DoS attack.  It was re-enabled in the next version that provided a better fix for [CVE-2009-3555](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-3555) - an implementation of the RFC5746.  > As an aside, and to reference something we may need to look at, there seems to > be some concern with Apache and how it works with SSL renegotiation disabled > [3], so we will need to look into cases where disabling SSL renegotiation may > impact expected behaviour of currently released products.  This problem would not affect recent httpd packages at all.  As a mitigation for [CVE-2009-3555](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-3555), httpd's mod_ssl was modified to reject all client-initiated renegotiations.  This change was backported to Red Hat Enterprise Linux httpd packages: <https://access.redhat.com/kb/docs/DOC-20491#Clientinitiated_renegotiations_disabled_in_mod_ssl>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=707065#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2011-05-30 12:46:21 UTC  ``` Adding NSS folks too.  It should be noted that NSS already provides a mechanism that can be used by applications to easily instruct the library to reject session renegotiations by changing the value of the SSL_ENABLE_RENEGOTIATION option.  It's default can be controlled by the NSS_SSL_ENABLE_RENEGOTIATION environment variable.  Additional details can be found in the kbase article related to the CVE-2009-3555:  <https://access.redhat.com/kb/docs/DOC-20491#The_RFC_5746_implementation_in_NSS_Network_Security_Services>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=707065#c3)  Tomas Hoger    2011-07-08 13:08:57 UTC  ``` Similar change to that added to httpd's mod_ssl was added to tomcat-native as well to mitigate [CVE-2009-3555](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-3555).  TLS implementation in IBM JDK allows disabling all renegotiations using the com.ibm.jsse2.renegotiate system property.   As previous comments, and the linked IETF TLS WG mailing list discussion indicate, there currently isn't a conclusion whether this issue should be addressed in the TLS protocol and the libraries implementing it, as it's inherent property of the protocol that client can "DoS" the server by making it perform CPU expensive cryptographic operations. Therefore, we do not plan to release update addressing this problem at this time.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=707065#c4)  chris    2011-10-26 06:15:59 UTC  ``` There's new input: The hacker group THC released a tutorial how to DoS SSL application, again accelerated by renegotiation:  <http://www.thc.org/thc-ssl-dos/>  RH/Centos 5.7 still provides OpenSSL 0.9.8e, which does not allow to disable renegotiation system wide as a work around. I guess the only choice is then to disable it on a per application basis, which may not be for some applications.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=707065#c5)  Tomas Hoger    2011-11-09 13:57:11 UTC  ``` Few decent write-ups on the topic:  <http://www.educatedguesswork.org/2011/10/ssltls_and_computational_dos.html> <http://vincent.bernat.im/en/blog/2011-ssl-dos-mitigation.html>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=707065#c6)  Vincent Danen    2012-06-18 16:07:25 UTC  ``` MITRE has assigned [CVE-2011-5094](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-5094) to nss, and this CVE is specific to openssl.

This is (it appears) a trivially exploited threat to availability of services. Why is the status still 'new', over a year after an exploit to the vulnerability has been published?   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=707065#c17)  Product Security DevOps Team    2021-06-11 21:04:26 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.

Subject: SSL renegotiation DoS CVE-2011-1473

Hi!

FYI, as this has a nessus test, and likely to be seen and reported by
users.

CVE-2011-1473 is used seemingly for the SSL protocol issue.  Most
TLS/SSL implementations handle session renegotiation by default, client
may trigger high CPU use by renegotiating repeatedly and taking
advantage of the fact that there's more work to do on the server side
than on the client side.  Similar problem affects initial handshake
too, renegotiation allows achieving the same over single / few
connections.

This should affect most server apps using openssl and nss, but not
recent httpd/mod_ssl.

Original blog post is not accessible, but TLS WG list post has all the
relevant info.
