Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-1473:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the computational cost of TLS/SSL handshakes, particularly the server-side decryption of the Client Key Exchange message.  The TLS renegotiation feature, if enabled, allows a client to initiate multiple handshakes within a single connection.  This difference in computational effort between the client and server can be exploited to cause a denial of service by forcing the server to perform many expensive cryptographic operations, which can exhaust server resources.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Computational asymmetry:** The server expends significantly more computational resources than the client during TLS handshakes, especially when RSA is used for key exchange. The server needs to decrypt the client's key exchange message which is more computationally intensive.
*   **Unrestricted renegotiation:** Allowing clients to freely initiate TLS renegotiation enables an attacker to trigger multiple handshakes within a single TCP connection, amplifying the impact of the computational asymmetry.
*   **Lack of rate limiting:**  Without proper rate limiting, a malicious client can send a large number of renegotiation requests, overwhelming the server.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Attackers can exhaust server resources (CPU, memory) by forcing it to process numerous expensive TLS handshakes and/or renegotiations. This can lead to legitimate users being unable to access the service.
*   **Resource exhaustion:** The attack can cause the server to become unresponsive due to the overload of cryptographic computations.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Network-based:** The attack is carried out over the network via standard TLS/SSL connections.
*   **Client-initiated:** The attacker acts as a malicious client, initiating TLS handshakes and/or renegotiations.
*   **Exploitation of renegotiation:** The primary attack vector involves abusing the TLS renegotiation mechanism.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to connect to the server over the network.
*   **TLS client:** The attacker needs to have the ability to act as a TLS client, capable of initiating handshakes and renegotiations.
*   **No authentication:** The attack does not require any specific level of authentication.

**Additional Technical details:**
*   **RSA operations:** The content explains in detail that RSA decryption (server side) is more expensive than RSA encryption (client side). The server's private key exponent is significantly larger than the client's public key, making the decryption process slower.
*   **Mitigation Techniques:** The documents also describe different mitigation techniques, such as disabling TLS renegotiation, rate-limiting TLS handshakes, increasing server-side processing power and putting more work on the client via the use of specific cipher suites.
*   **Tools:** The content mentions and links to tools developed to exploit the vulnerability like THC-SSL-DOS and brute-shake and sslsqueeze. It highlights that these tools can force a server to use 100x more processing power than the client.
*   **Netfilter rules:** The content provides examples of iptables rules to detect and drop TLS renegotiation requests based on packet inspection and rate limiting.
*   **OpenSSL versions**: The bug report states that the vulnerability exists in OpenSSL versions prior to 0.9.8l, where renegotiation was disabled as a temporary fix for a different issue and re-enabled in 0.9.8m when support for RFC5746 was implemented.
*   **Impact on various services:** The vulnerability was shown to affect services like vsftpd, which led to the bug being still present on 6.2 RHEL systems using the default package. The bug reports also indicate that httpd/mod_ssl and tomcat-native were patched to mitigate this issue.
