Subject: CVE request: tinyproxy runs as an open proxy when attempting to
 restrict allowable IP ranges

A bug in tinyproxy prior to 1.8.3 would turn it into an open proxy if it
were defined with an "Allow" statement including an IP address range
(i.e. 192.168.0.0/24).

Could a CVE be assigned to this?

Subject: tinyproxy: allows everyone if using network addresses in Allow rule
Date: Thu, 07 Apr 2011 13:58:28 +0200
```
Package: tinyproxy
Version: 1.8.2-1
Severity: grave
Tags: upstream security squeeze patch
Justification: user security hole

When including a line like

Allow 192.168.0.0/16

to allow a network of ip addresses instead of only one ip
address per line the access to tinyproxy
is actually allowed for all ip addresses.

This makes tinyproxy usable as an open proxy from everywhere
in the internet.

This bug was reported upstream nearly a year ago:

<https://banu.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=90>

and includes a fix there.

Package        : tinyproxy
Vulnerability  : incorrect ACL processing
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-1499
Debian Bug     : 621493

Christoph Martin discovered that incorrect ACL processing in TinyProxy,
a lightweight, non-caching, optionally anonymizing http proxy could
lead to unintended network access rights.

The oldstable distribution (lenny) is not affected.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.8.2-1squeeze1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.8.2-2

We recommend that you upgrade your tinyproxy packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=694658#c0)  Vincent Danen    2011-04-07 21:11:40 UTC  ``` It was reported [1] that tinyproxy prior to version 1.8.3, when configured to allow a network range (i.e. "Allow 192.168.0.0/24" versus the default "Allow 127.0.0.1"), would allow any connections from any IP address, turning it into an open proxy.  If tinyproxy were configured with one or more Allow statements that use an IP range, this would occur.  This has been fixed upstream [2] and affects the versions of tinyproxy as provided by Fedora and EPEL.  [1] <https://banu.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=90> [2] <https://banu.com/cgit/tinyproxy/commit/?id=e8426f6662dc467bd1d827100481b95d9a4a23e4>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=694658#c1)  Vincent Danen    2011-04-08 20:49:56 UTC  ``` This was assigned the name [CVE-2011-1499](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1499).   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=694658#c2)  Vincent Danen    2011-05-03 15:03:30 UTC  ``` Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures assigned an identifier [CVE-2011-1843](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1843) to the following vulnerability:  Name: [CVE-2011-1843](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1843) URL: <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-1843> Assigned: 20110502 Reference: <https://banu.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=90> Reference: <https://banu.com/cgit/tinyproxy/diff/?id=97b9984484299b2ce72f8f4fc3706dab8a3a8439>  Integer overflow in conf.c in Tinyproxy before 1.8.3 might allow remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions in opportunistic circumstances via a TCP connection, related to improper handling of invalid port numbers.   The above is a related but slightly different issue (note the same bug, but different commits).   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=694658#c3)  Vincent Danen    2011-05-03 15:04:22 UTC  ``` Created tinyproxy tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 701687](show_bug.cgi?id=701687 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2011-1499 CVE-2011-1843 tinyproxy: multiple flaws corrected in version 1.8.3 [fedora-all]")] Affects: epel-all [[bug 701688](show_bug.cgi?id=701688 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2011-1499 CVE-2011-1843 tinyproxy: multiple flaws corrected in version 1.8.3 [epel-all]")]   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=694658#c4)  Fedora Update System    2013-09-21 08:33:42 UTC  ``` tinyproxy-1.8.3-1.fc19 has been pushed to the Fedora 19 stable repository.
