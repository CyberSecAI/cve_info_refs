  "CVE-2011-1227": {
    "Metadata": {
      "Source": "docs.microsoft.com_2b0cf2e5_20250124_132324.html",
      "Version": "1.0",
      "Publish Date": "April 12, 2011"
    },
    "Vulnerability Description": "An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists due to the way that Windows Kernel-mode drivers manage pointers to kernel-mode driver objects. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in kernel mode. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.",
    "Root Cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a Null pointer de-reference due to the way kernel-mode drivers keep track of pointers to certain kernel-mode driver objects.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Null pointer dereference",
      "Improper management of kernel-mode driver object pointers"
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution in kernel mode, enabling the attacker to gain complete control of the system, install programs, view, change, or delete data, and create new accounts with full administrative rights.",
    "Attack Vectors": "The attacker would need to log on to the system locally and then run a specially crafted application.",
    "Required Capabilities": "The attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to the system."
