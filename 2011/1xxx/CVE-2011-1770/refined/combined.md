vmxnet3: Fix inconsistent LRO state after initialization
commit ebde6f8acba92abfc203585198a54f47e83e2cd0 upstream.
During initialization of vmxnet3, the state of LRO
gets out of sync with netdev->features.
This leads to very poor TCP performance in a IP forwarding
setup and is hitting many VMware users.
Simplified call sequence:
1. vmxnet3\_declare\_features() initializes "adapter->lro" to true.
2. The kernel automatically disables LRO if IP forwarding is enabled,
so vmxnet3\_set\_flags() gets called. This also updates netdev->features.
3. Now vmxnet3\_setup\_driver\_shared() is called. "adapter->lro" is still
set to true and LRO gets enabled again, even though
netdev->features shows it's disabled.
Fix it by updating "adapter->lro", too.
The private vmxnet3 adapter flags are scheduled for removal
in net-next, see commit a0d2730c9571aeba793cb5d3009094ee1d8fda35
"net: vmxnet3: convert to hw\_features".
Patch applies to 2.6.37 / 2.6.38 and 2.6.39-rc6.

commit d9a5ac9ef306eb5cc874f285185a15c303c50009 upstream.
b may be added to a list, but is not removed before being freed
in the case of an error. This is done in the corresponding
deallocation function, so the code here has been changed to
follow that.

x86, apic: Fix spurious error interrupts triggering on all non-boot APs
commit e503f9e4b092e2349a9477a333543de8f3c7f5d9 upstream.
This patch fixes a bug reported by a customer, who found
that many unreasonable error interrupts reported on all
non-boot CPUs (APs) during the system boot stage.
According to Chapter 10 of Intel Software Developer Manual
Volume 3A, Local APIC may signal an illegal vector error when
an LVT entry is set as an illegal vector value (0~15) under
FIXED delivery mode (bits 8-11 is 0), regardless of whether
the mask bit is set or an interrupt actually happen. These
errors are seen as error interrupts.
The initial value of thermal LVT entries on all APs always reads
0x10000 because APs are woken up by BSP issuing INIT-SIPI-SIPI
sequence to them and LVT registers are reset to 0s except for
the mask bits which are set to 1s when APs receive INIT IPI.
When the BIOS takes over the thermal throttling interrupt,
the LVT thermal deliver mode should be SMI and it is required
from the kernel to keep AP's LVT thermal monitoring register
programmed as such as well.
This issue happens when BIOS does not take over thermal throttling
interrupt, AP's LVT thermal monitor register will be restored to
0x10000 which means vector 0 and fixed deliver mode, so all APs will
signal illegal vector error interrupts.
This patch check if interrupt delivery mode is not fixed mode before
restoring AP's LVT thermal monitor register.

tick: Clear broadcast active bit when switching to oneshot
commit 07f4beb0b5bbfaf36a64aa00d59e670ec578a95a upstream.
The first cpu which switches from periodic to oneshot mode switches
also the broadcast device into oneshot mode. The broadcast device
serves as a backup for per cpu timers which stop in deeper
C-states. To avoid starvation of the cpus which might be in idle and
depend on broadcast mode it marks the other cpus as broadcast active
and sets the brodcast expiry value of those cpus to the next tick.
The oneshot mode broadcast bit for the other cpus is sticky and gets
only cleared when those cpus exit idle. If a cpu was not idle while
the bit got set in consequence the bit prevents that the broadcast
device is armed on behalf of that cpu when it enters idle for the
first time after it switched to oneshot mode.
In most cases that goes unnoticed as one of the other cpus has usually
a timer pending which keeps the broadcast device armed with a short
timeout. Now if the only cpu which has a short timer active has the
bit set then the broadcast device will not be armed on behalf of that
cpu and will fire way after the expected timer expiry. In the case of
Christians bug report it took ~145 seconds which is about half of the
wrap around time of HPET (the limit for that device) due to the fact
that all other cpus had no timers armed which expired before the 145
seconds timeframe.
The solution is simply to clear the broadcast active bit
unconditionally when a cpu switches to oneshot mode after the first
cpu switched the broadcast device over. It's not idle at that point
otherwise it would not be executing that code.
[ I fundamentally hate that broadcast crap. Why the heck thought some
folks that when going into deep idle it's a brilliant concept to
switch off the last device which brings the cpu back from that
state? ]
Thanks to Christian for providing all the valuable debug information!

Override clocksource acpi\_pm is not HRT compatible.
Cannot switch while in HRT/NOHZ mode.
The watchdog code is what enables CLOCK\_SOURCE\_VALID\_FOR\_HRES, but we
actually end up selecting the clocksource before we enqueue it into
the watchdog list, so that's why we see the warning and fail to switch
to acpi\_pm timer as requested. That's particularly bad when we want to
debug timekeeping related problems in early boot.
Put the selection call last.

x86, AMD: Fix ARAT feature setting again
commit 14fb57dccb6e1defe9f89a66f548fcb24c374c1d upstream.
Trying to enable the local APIC timer on early K8 revisions
uncovers a number of other issues with it, in conjunction with
the C1E enter path on AMD. Fixing those causes much more churn
and troubles than the benefit of using that timer brings so
don't enable it on K8 at all, falling back to the original
functionality the kernel had wrt to that.

Revert "x86, AMD: Fix APIC timer erratum 400 affecting K8 Rev.A-E processors"
commit 328935e6348c6a7cb34798a68c326f4b8372e68a upstream.
This reverts commit e20a2d205c05cef6b5783df339a7d54adeb50962, as it crashes
certain boxes with specific AMD CPU models.
Moving the lower endpoint of the Erratum 400 check to accomodate
earlier K8 revisions (A-E) opens a can of worms which is simply
not worth to fix properly by tweaking the errata checking
framework:
\* missing IntPenging MSR on revisions < CG cause #GP:
http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=130541471818831
\* makes earlier revisions use the LAPIC timer instead of the C1E
idle routine which switches to HPET, thus not waking up in
deeper C-states:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2011/4/24/20
Therefore, leave the original boundary starting with K8-revF.

libertas: fix cmdpendingq locking
commit 2ae1b8b35faba31a59b153cbad07f9c15de99740 upstream.
We occasionally see list corruption using libertas.
While we haven't been able to diagnose this precisely, we have spotted
a possible cause: cmdpendingq is generally modified with driver\_lock
held. However, there are a couple of points where this is not the case.
Fix up those operations to execute under the lock, it seems like
the correct thing to do and will hopefully improve the situation.

A length of zero (after subtracting two for the type and len fields) for
the DCCPO\_{CHANGE,CONFIRM}\_{L,R} options will cause an underflow due to
the subtraction. The subsequent code may read past the end of the
options value buffer when parsing. I'm unsure of what the consequences
of this might be, but it's probably not good.

ptrace: Prepare to fix racy accesses on task breakpoints
commit bf26c018490c2fce7fe9b629083b96ce0e6ad019 upstream.
When a task is traced and is in a stopped state, the tracer
may execute a ptrace request to examine the tracee state and
get its task struct. Right after, the tracee can be killed
and thus its breakpoints released.
This can happen concurrently when the tracer is in the middle
of reading or modifying these breakpoints, leading to dereferencing
a freed pointer.
Hence, to prepare the fix, create a generic breakpoint reference
holding API. When a reference on the breakpoints of a task is
held, the breakpoints won't be released until the last reference
is dropped. After that, no more ptrace request on the task's
breakpoints can be serviced for the tracer.

commit 87dc669ba25777b67796d7262c569429e58b1ed4 upstream.
While the tracer accesses ptrace breakpoints, the child task may
concurrently exit due to a SIGKILL and thus release its breakpoints
at the same time. We can then dereference some freed pointers.
To fix this, hold a reference on the child breakpoints before
manipulating them.

cifs: check for bytes\_remaining going to zero in CIFS\_SessSetup
commit fcda7f4578bbf9717444ca6da8a421d21489d078 upstream.
It's possible that when we go to decode the string area in the
SESSION\_SETUP response, that bytes\_remaining will be 0. Decrementing it at
that point will mean that it can go "negative" and wrap. Check for a
bytes\_remaining value of 0, and don't try to decode the string area if
that's the case.

A length of zero (after subtracting two for the type and len fields) for
the DCCPO\_{CHANGE,CONFIRM}\_{L,R} options will cause an underflow due to
the subtraction. The subsequent code may read past the end of the
options value buffer when parsing. I'm unsure of what the consequences
of this might be, but it's probably not good.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
