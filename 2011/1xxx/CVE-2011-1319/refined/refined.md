{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "When WebSphere creates LTPA tokens, user data is parsed and allocated in memory. The same strings, such as realm names, were allocated multiple times in memory and not freed until the LTPA token expired. Additionally, when LTPA token data handles user data, references to original data remained, causing the original data to stay in memory until the token expired.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Inefficient memory management leading to memory leaks.",
        "Lack of proper garbage collection of user data associated with LTPA tokens"
    ],
    "impact": "Memory exhaustion due to the accumulation of unused string data. This could lead to performance degradation or potentially service unavailability, especially when dealing with large amounts of group data or many servers propagating security information.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker could potentially cause a denial of service by sending a high number of requests, each with unique user data, leading to the accumulation of memory.",
      "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to authenticate to the WebSphere server and generate LTPA tokens."
  },
  "fixes": [
    "Code was updated to ensure that the same string is allocated only once in memory when a token is being processed. References to original data are removed so userdata is cleaned up by Java garbage collector sooner."
