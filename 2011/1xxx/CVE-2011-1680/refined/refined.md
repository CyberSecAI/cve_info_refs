      "details": "The email discusses issues with suid mount helpers and their handling of RLIMIT_FSIZE. Specifically, it mentions that 'ncpmount' should be fixed to edit a temporary file instead of /etc/mtab directly and have both 'ncpmount' and 'ncpumount' clean up properly on 'addmntent' failure. It also suggests that these utilities could stop shipping with a suid bit due to past security issues."

      "details": "The email provides a survey of suid mount helpers. 'ncpmount' edits /etc/mtab directly with no cleanup on failure and doesn't remove the lock file. 'ncpumount' edits /etc/mtab.tmp but doesn't check the return code of addmntent(). Additionally, it mentions the underlying issue is that addmntent() returns success even if the write was truncated, which occurs when the resource limit is exceeded. It then suggests that all helpers should make edits to a temporary file and have proper error handling. "

       "details": "This email discusses the initial assessment that the issue lies within the return code of 'fprintf()', which is used by 'addmntent()', but the return code of 'fprintf()' is always correct due to stdio buffering. Therefore the issue lies within how 'addmntent()' fails to report truncation issues when the write is not fully complete due to resource limits. The email proposes using 'fflush()' to properly detect these errors. It also states a bug will be opened in glibc bugzilla."

The report mentions that addmntent() doesn't report errors when writes are truncated due to file size limits. It also lists affected software such as mount.cifs, fusermount, mount, ncpmount, and vmware-hgfsmounter. The resolution involves fixing glibc and individual mount helpers, and  identifies CVE-2011-1089 as the main issue and CVE-2011-1680 as specific to ncpmount not removing the /etc/mtab~ lock file. It also mentions that the glibc issue was resolved upstream and that the fix was released in Red Hat Enterprise Linux."

    "rootCause": "The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the `addmntent()` function in glibc, which does not report an error when it fails to write the entire mount entry to `/etc/mtab` due to a low `RLIMIT_FSIZE`. This allows attackers to write truncated entries to `/etc/mtab`",

        "Lack of proper cleanup in mount helpers on failure."

    "impact": "Unprivileged users can corrupt the `/etc/mtab` file by exploiting the behavior of setuid mount helpers, potentially leading to manipulation of mountpoint options, unauthorized unmounting, or other system instability.",
