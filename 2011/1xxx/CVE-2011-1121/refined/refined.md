The provided content includes information about CVE-2011-1121.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
A memory corruption issue exists in WebKit. Specifically, it is a stale pointer issue in SVG animations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The vulnerability is characterized by the presence of a stale pointer. This type of vulnerability occurs when a program attempts to access a memory location that has been deallocated or is no longer valid.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution. An attacker could potentially execute malicious code on the victim's system by exploiting this flaw.

**Attack Vectors:**
The primary attack vector is through visiting a maliciously crafted website that contains SVG animations triggering the vulnerability. This indicates a remote attack vector where the attacker doesn't need direct access to the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to craft a malicious website that exploits the stale pointer issue in WebKit's SVG animation handling. The attacker would then need to entice the victim to visit the malicious site, either by direct URL or via other methods like phishing or malicious advertisements. The attack can be performed remotely with no prior access to the targeted system.
