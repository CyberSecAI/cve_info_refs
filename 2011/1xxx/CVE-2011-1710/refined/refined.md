{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The HTTP server component in the Novell XTier framework did not properly limit user-supplied header length variables, leading to integer overflow vulnerabilities.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploit could lead to a denial of service (service crash) or potentially arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": "Remote attackers can send crafted HTTP requests with manipulated header length variables to trigger the integer overflows.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker can be unauthenticated and does not need any special position on the network."
