Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-1281:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a memory corruption condition that occurs when multiple console objects are associated with a single process within the Client/Server Run-time Subsystem (CSRSS). When such a process exits, the extra console objects are orphaned. This orphaned object handle can then be obtained by another spawned process, potentially with higher privileges than intended.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Corruption:** The core issue is a memory corruption due to improper handling of console objects.
- **Incorrect Object Association:** The system allows multiple console objects to be associated with a single process, which is an abnormal condition leading to the vulnerability.
- **Lack of Proper Cleanup:** When a process exits, the system fails to clean up all associated console objects correctly, leading to orphaned objects.
- **Inadequate Privilege Checks:** The system doesn't adequately prevent a lower-privileged process from accessing handles to orphaned objects, potentially leading to privilege escalation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Elevation of Privilege:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to run arbitrary code in kernel mode.
- **Full System Control:**  An attacker can gain complete control of the affected system.
- **Malicious Activities:** Once the system is compromised, an attacker can install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access Required:** The attacker needs to have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to the target system.
- **Specially Crafted Application:** The attacker must run a specially crafted application to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have a valid user account on the target system.
- The attacker must have the ability to log on to the target system locally.
- The attacker must be able to execute code on the target system.
