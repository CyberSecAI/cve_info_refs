    "attack_vectors": [
      "Convincing a user to open a legitimate file located in the same network directory as a specially crafted DLL file.",

       "Network attack: placing a legitimate file and a malicious DLL in a network share (UNC or WebDAV), and convincing the user to open the legitimate file."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a specially crafted DLL file and place it in a location accessible to the user, typically a network share or WebDAV location. The attacker also needs to convince the user to open a legitimate file from the same location."
