1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- NetworkManager
dbus-glib allowed local users to write properties that were exported
read-only via dbus (CVE-2010-1172).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.2-11.3
- OpenOffice\_org
Maintenance update to LibreOffice-3.3.1. It adds some interesting
features, fixes many bugs, including several security vulnerabilities.
The previous OpenOffice\_org packages are also renamed to libreoffice.
LibreOffice is continuation of the OpenOffice.org project. This update
replaces the OpenOffice.org installation, including helper packages,
e.g. dictionaries, templates. The new stuff is backward compatible.
Together with the maintenance update, the following security issues have
been fixed:
- PowerPoint document processing (CVE-2010-2935, CVE-2010-2936)
- extensions and filter package files (CVE-2010-3450)
- RTF document processing (CVE-2010-3451, CVE-2010-3452)
- Word document processing (CVE-2010-3453, CVE-2010-3454)
- insecure LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH usage (CVE-2010-3689)
- PDF Import extension resulting from 3rd party library XPD
(CVE-2010-3702, CVE-2010-3704)

for SUSE Lifecycle Management Server 1.1. The update should be applied
also in case of upgrade from SUSE Lifecycle Management Server 1.0,
before reconfiguring the product for the new version.
Together with the maintenance update, the following security issues have
been fixed:
- don't log password also if error happen
(never inspect unfiltered parameters) (bnc#644855)
- Fix world-readable postgres credentials (bnc#684499) (CVE-2011-0993)

read-only via dbus (CVE-2010-1172).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.2-11.3
- dhcp/dhcpcd/dhcp6
A rogue dhcp server could instruct clients to use a host name that
contains shell meta characters. Since many scripts in the system do
not expect unusal characters in the system's host name the dhcp
client needs to sanitize the host name offered by the server
(CVE-2011-0996, CVE-2011-0997).

corruption of arbitrary files. CVE-2011-0460 has been assigned to this
issue.
Affected Products: SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.2-11.3
- krb5
A remote attacker may be able to make kadmind free an invalid pointer,

Affected Products: openSUSE 11.2-11.4
- libcgroup
libcgroup suffered from a heap based buffer overflow (CVE-2011-1006).
The cgrulesengd daemon did not verify the origin of netlink messages,
allowing local users to spoof events (CVE-2011-1022).
Affected Products: SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.2-11.3

- CVE-2011-0991: use-after-free due to DynamicMethod resurrection
- CVE-2011-0992: information leak due to improper thread finalization
Affected Products: SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.3-11.4
- nbd
A buffer overflow in the mainloop function the nbd server could
allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code (CVE-2011-0530).
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE10-SP4, openSUSE 11.2-11.4
- openldap2
Master/slave configurations with enabled "ppolicy\_forward\_updates"
option potentially allowed users to log in with an invalid password
(CVE-2011-1024).
Unauthenticated users could crash the ldap server (CVE-2011-1081).
Affected Products: SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.2-11.4
- pure-ftpd
pure-ftpd was updated to fix a security issue with a Open Enterprise
Server specific patch.
- CVE-2011-0988: A worldwriteable directory created and used by the OES

overwrite system files and so gain privileges.
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE10-SP4
- python-feedparser
Various issues in python-feedparser have been fixed, including
fixes for crashes due to missing input sanitizaion and a XSS

CVE-2009-5065 have been assigned to these issues.
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.2-11.4
- rsyslog

that could crash the syslog daemon (CVE-2011-1488, CVE-2011-1489,
CVE-2011-1490).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.4
- telepathy-gabble
This update of telepathy-gabble is validating the origin of a
google:jingleinfo update message now. Not validating the origin could be
used to intercept calls.
CVE-2011-1000: CVSS v2 Base Score: 6.4 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N):
Input Validation (CWE-20)
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.2-11.3

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=694122#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-04-06 14:17:08 UTC  ``` A memory leak was found in the way rsyslog system log deamon processed log messages when the request to reduce the repeated messages ($RepeatedMsgReduction configuration directive) was enabled. A local attacker could use this flaw to cause denial of the rsyslogd daemon service (excessive memory use and potential abort) via sequence of repeated log messages, sent within short time period.

# CVE-2011-1488

| --- | --- |
| **Description** | A memory leak in rsyslog before 5.7.6 was found in the way deamon processed log messages are logged when $RepeatedMsgReduction was enabled. A local attacker could use this flaw to cause a denial of the rsyslogd daemon service by crashing the service via a sequence of repeated log messages sent within short periods of time. |

### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.
