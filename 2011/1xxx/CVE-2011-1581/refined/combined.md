| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=696029#c0)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2011-04-13 05:46:23 UTC  ``` Backport of upstream commit: fd0e435b0fe85622f167b84432552885a4856ac8 bonding: Incorrect TX queue offset  By default bonding only allocates 16 queues.  This patch will prevent devices that have more than 16 receive queues (82599 has 128) from blowing out the tx queue index for the bonding device.  For proper queue allocation, in the bonding driver and down to the devices, they should probably add the following line to one of the files in /etc/modprobe.d/  options bonding tx_queues=N  where N>= number of processors that show up in /proc/cpuinfo.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=696029#c3)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2011-04-13 05:59:14 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect the versions of Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5, and Red Hat Enterprise MRG as they did not backport the upstream commit bb1d9123 that introduced this issue. A future kernel update in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 may address this flaw.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=696029#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-05-19 11:58:37 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2011:0542 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0542.html>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=696029#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-05-23 20:54:26 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2011:0542 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0542.html>   ``` |  |

Subject: CVE request - kernel: bonding: Incorrect TX queue offset

Backport of upstream commit:
fd0e435b0fe85622f167b84432552885a4856ac8 bonding: Incorrect TX queue offset

By default bonding only allocates 16 queues. Devices that have more than
16 receive queues will exceed the tx queue index for the bonding device,
resulting in at least a denial of service (BUG: unable to handle kernel
paging request at...).

For proper queue allocation, in the bonding driver and down to the
devices, they should probably add the following line to one of the files
in /etc/modprobe.d/

options bonding tx_queues=N

where N>= number of processors that show up in /proc/cpuinfo.

Thanks, Eugene
