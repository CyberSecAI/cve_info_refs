Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2011-1581:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an incorrect calculation of the transmit (TX) queue offset within the Linux kernel's bonding driver.
*   By default, the bonding driver allocates only 16 TX queues.
*   Devices with more than 16 receive queues (e.g., the 82599 which has 128) can cause the TX queue index for the bonding device to be exceeded.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect TX Queue Index Calculation:** The bonding driver does not properly account for devices with a large number of receive queues, leading to an out-of-bounds index.
*   **Insufficient Default Queue Allocation:** The default allocation of 16 TX queues is insufficient for some modern network devices.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exceeding the TX queue index leads to a kernel panic with a "BUG: unable to handle kernel paging request at..." message, effectively crashing the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Interface Configuration:** The vulnerability is triggered by using a network interface with a large number of receive queues in a bonding configuration, exceeding the default number of TX queues allocated by the bonding driver.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to configure the network interfaces and bonding parameters on a vulnerable system.
*   This typically requires root or administrative privileges on the system.
*   It is likely not exploitable remotely unless the attacker already has access to the system configuration.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The issue was introduced in an upstream commit `bb1d9123` which was not backported to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5 or MRG.
*   A suggested workaround is to manually configure the number of transmit queues in `/etc/modprobe.d/` using `options bonding tx_queues=N`, where N should be greater or equal to the number of processors as shown in `/proc/cpuinfo`.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 with the RHSA-2011:0542 errata.
