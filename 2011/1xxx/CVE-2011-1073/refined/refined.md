Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2011-1073:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the FreeBSD's `crontab` utility making calls to the `stat()` function on user-controlled temporary files while retaining root privileges (euid of 0).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Information Leakage via `stat()`:** The `stat()` function, when called on a symbolic link pointing to a non-existent file, returns `ENOENT`. This behavior allows an attacker to probe the existence of files or directories by creating a symbolic link to a target, then triggering `stat()` with root privileges, thus bypassing directory search permissions.

2.  **Race Condition:** In one instance, a race condition exists where a temporary file is created by `crontab`, then quickly chowned to the user's ID. A malicious user can exploit the window between the ownership change and the privileged `stat()` call to remove the temporary file and replace it with a symlink to the file whose existence they wish to verify.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can determine the existence of arbitrary files or directories on the system, regardless of the directory search permissions. This constitutes a minor discretionary access control (DAC) bypass.
*   The MD5 comparison vulnerability is not related to CVE-2011-1073

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **`crontab` Utility:** The attacker exploits the `crontab` utility by creating symlinks to the target file or directory.
*   **Timing and Race Conditions:** For the `stat()` call on line 366 of crontab.c, the attacker needs to exploit a race condition by quickly replacing the temporary file with a symbolic link.
*   **Editor Interaction:** For the `stat()` call on line 436, the vulnerability can be triggered while editing a crontab by removing the temporary file while the editor is open.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be a local user on the vulnerable system.
*   They must have the ability to execute the `crontab` utility.
*   The attacker must be able to create and remove symlinks and files in the `/tmp` directory.

The content also mentions that Mac OS X is affected by the `stat()` call vulnerabilities but that the `realpath()` vulnerability is #ifdef'd out in the Mac OS X source code.

The content also makes clear that this is a minor vulnerability, intended for system administrators and developers of FreeBSD-based systems and is not a major risk.
