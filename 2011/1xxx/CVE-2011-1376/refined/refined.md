Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-1376:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Incorrect native file permissions for WebSphere Application Server on IBM i operating systems.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The primary weakness is the misconfigured file permissions. This implies that files related to WebSphere Application Server on IBM i have overly permissive access controls.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The content mentions "Possible security exposure," indicating that the incorrect permissions could potentially allow unauthorized access, modification, or deletion of files.
*   The specific nature of the security exposure is not detailed, but it implies a risk to the integrity and confidentiality of the WebSphere Application Server installation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability exists within the file system of the IBM i operating system where the WebSphere Application Server is installed.
*   Attackers would likely need some level of access to the system (local access or remote access depending on the specific configuration) to leverage the incorrectly set file permissions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker would need some form of access to the IBM i system where the affected WebSphere Application Server instance is running. The level of access required is unclear but could be as low as local access on the machine. The attacker may also need to have some understanding of the file system and permissions for IBM i systems.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The fix is associated with APAR PM49712. This suggests that the identified vulnerability was addressed via a patch in the corresponding APAR.
*   The affected versions include WebSphere Application Server versions 8.0, 7.0 and 6.1 on IBM i.
*   The content does not specify which specific files have incorrect permissions, which limits the understanding of the scope of the vulnerability.

This analysis is based on the information available, and further details would be needed to fully understand the specific impact and exploitation of this vulnerability.
