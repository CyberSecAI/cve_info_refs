Message-ID: <20110302015646.GK5871@ksplice.com>
Date: Tue, 1 Mar 2011 20:56:46 -0500
From: Nelson Elhage <nelhage@...lice.com>

Subject: CVE request: kernel: Multiple DoS issues in epoll

Two requests for bugs in epoll:

(1) The epoll subsystem in Linux did not prevent users from creating circular
epoll file structures, potentially leading to a denial of service (kernel
deadlock).

Reference: <https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/2/5/220>
Upstream commit: <http://git.kernel.org/linus/22bacca48a1755f79b7e0f192ddb9fbb7fc6e64e>

(2) The epoll subsystem allows users to create large nested epoll structures,
which the kernel will then to walk with preemption disabled, causing a denial of
service via excessive CPU consumption in the kernel.

References:
<http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1105744>
[http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1105744/focus=1105888](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1105744/focus%3D1105888)

No upstream fix yet for this one.

An update that solves 8 vulnerabilities and has 60 fixes is
now available. It includes one version update.
Description:
The SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 SP1 kernel have been updated
to the 2.6.32.59 stable release to fix a lot of bugs and
security issues.
The following security issues have been fixed:
\* CVE-2012-2133: A use after free bug in hugetlb
support could be used by local attackers to crash the
system.
\* CVE-2012-1097: A null pointer dereference bug in the
regsets proc file could be used by local attackers to
perhaps crash the system. With mmap\_min\_addr is set and
enabled, exploitation is unlikely.
\* CVE-2012-0879: A reference counting issue in CLONE\_IO
could be used by local attackers to cause a denial of
service (out of memory).
\* CVE-2012-1090: A file handle leak in CIFS code could
be used by local attackers to crash the system.
\* CVE-2011-1083: Large nested epoll chains could be
used by local attackers to cause a denial of service
(excessive CPU consumption).
\* CVE-2011-4622: When using KVM, programming a PIT
timer without a irqchip configuration, can be used to crash
the kvm guest. This likely can be done only by a privileged
guest user.
\* CVE-2012-0045: A KVM 32bit guest crash in "syscall"
opcode handling was fixed that could be caused by local
attackers.
\* CVE-2011-4086: Fixed a oops in jbd/jbd2 that could be
caused by specific filesystem access patterns.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**".

Hi Junyi, Dor,   It's my fault that I didn't keep my eye on the cli, but I tried 3 times without virtio devices, vnc still shows a black screen when resuming from S4 with kvm-clock but didn't complains "(qemu) Guest moved used index from 36574 to 0".

The guest needs to be able to survive an S4 suspend of the HOST, but here we are doing S4 suspend of the GUEST.  Not sure why that is being done, but I'm pretty sure that has never been tested before with KVM clock.  There are a number of possible things that could go wrong here, we may be failing to re-register the kvm clock on boot and then end up using stale data.  In all probability, this is a guest bug and not going to be fixable from the hypervisor (which can't detect that the guest is doing an S4 resume).   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=694801#c14)  Rik van Riel    2011-09-12 13:43:45 UTC  ``` Time to figure out how exactly suspend & resume interact with the clock code.

It takes about 15 seconds on my testing for the guest to resume after the hibernation image is loaded.  The guest's timekeeping does go off after resume, though.  Also, a second s4 attempt freezes the resumed guest for a very long period.  I gave up waiting for the guest to unstall after about 20 minutes.  However, the stall vs hang thing clarifies things a lot.   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=694801#c20)  Dor Laor    2012-02-08 21:34:56 UTC  ``` Amit, Marcelo said that the page that the guest & host share for the pvclock is not being synced post resume - so its a basic issue we need to first to start w/   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=694801#c21)  Amit Shah    2012-02-09 12:23:47 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #20](show_bug.cgi?id=694801#c20)) > Amit, Marcelo said that the page that the guest & host share for the pvclock is > not being synced post resume - so its a basic issue we need to first to start > w/  I just saw Marcelo's patch upstream but that's not enough; I have a similar patch cooked up for a while but it still doesn't solve the issue for me completely.

I thought that the limits were higher than anybody would hit in practice but perhaps not. I can re-spin a 'debug' patch that will print more info in this situation, if you are willing to test that. Otherwise, if have a re-producer that I can try, that would be appreciated. Do you have any sense of how many epoll fds are required per fd?  Thanks,  -Jason   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=681578#c20)  Jason Baron    2012-02-26 15:52:49 UTC  ``` Another question here is that I see that this was caused in the context of a ksplice update. I'm wondering if this issue can be re-produced without ksplice too? So we can narrow down if this is ksplice or not.  Thanks,  -Jason   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=681578#c21)  David Castro    2012-02-27 20:28:22 UTC  ``` Hi Jason,  Thanks for getting back to us on this.  We're going to be attempting to see if the latest EL5 kernel will have an issue sans-ksplice, since the dovecot folks also recommended doing that.  Will let you know what we find.  If we do still see the issue, we'd definitely be willing to re-produce with the debug patch to get more info.  Thanks, David   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=681578#c22)  Jason Baron    2012-03-05 14:59:46 UTC  ``` Hi David,  Just wondering if you got a chance to test this?  Thanks!  -Jason   ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=681578#c23)  David Castro    2012-03-06 08:29:18 UTC  ``` Hey Jason,  We haven't been able to tackle it yet, however I should get to testing it this week.  We have to verify that we can reproduce the problem with enough generated traffic using ksplice in a test environment, then swap out with the kernel update to see if the issue persists.  Will provide an update soon on the results.

I have a kernel patch that doubles the limits, and should print to the log when we would have hit the old soft limits. If its possible can you apply this patch to latest RHEL5 kernel and report back? If you can't re-build the kernel I can look into supplying you with a re-built kernel. Thanks!  -Jason   ```  [Comment 26](show_bug.cgi?id=681578#c26)  David Castro    2012-03-13 20:36:31 UTC  ``` Thanks Jason.  I'll try to give the patch a whirl later this week.  David   ```  [Comment 27](show_bug.cgi?id=681578#c27)  Timo Sirainen    2012-03-16 17:14:10 UTC  ``` Dovecot master process creates one pipe whose read side it passes to all the child processes. All of the Dovecot child processes listen on this pipe to find out when the master process dies. There are systems with tens of thousands of Dovecot child processes, so simply increasing the limit to 2000 won't help.  Postfix behaves in a similar way by polling on a pipe fd shared by all the same service processes. So if e.g. Postfix starts up over 1000 smtp or smtpd processes it'll fail in the same way.  I'd think there are also other software using a pipe to find out when the other side is dead.  Can this shared pipe be handled as a special case somehow?   ```  [Comment 28](show_bug.cgi?id=681578#c28)  Timo Sirainen    2012-03-16 17:20:16 UTC  ``` Sorry, I meant write side of the pipe is passed to Dovecot child processes. They are listening for EPOLLERR | EPOLLHUP from the pipe.   ```  [Comment 29](show_bug.cgi?id=681578#c29)  Jason Baron    2012-03-16 19:41:15 UTC  ``` Just so I understand, you're saying that all of the 'child' processes will do an epoll_create followed by an epoll_ctl() to attach to a single pipe? And then they are all woken up at once?  If so, this bug fix is about preventing deep nesting. So in this case it sounds like the depth is '1'. We could probably increase the level '1' nesting really large - and then leave the level '2' and beyond where they currently are, to fix this.  Thanks!  -Jason   ```  [Comment 30](show_bug.cgi?id=681578#c30)  Jason Baron    2012-03-16 19:43:10 UTC  ``` Or maybe there is no level '1' limit?   ```  [Comment 31](show_bug.cgi?id=681578#c31)  Jason Baron    2012-03-16 19:57:53 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 570690](attachment.cgi?id=570690&action=diff "allow unlimited number of depth 1 paths") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=570690&action=edit "allow unlimited number of depth 1 paths") allow unlimited number of depth 1 paths  Here's a simple patch, which allows all depth 1 paths. The argument being that you are limited to the number of open files and processes that you can create by the sysadmin. This should still prevent the nasty infinite wakeup paths. Do the limits seem sane then?  unlimited depth 1 paths (limited by open files and processes you can create) 500 depth 2 100 depth 3 50 depth 4 10 depth 5  I didn't think there were any apps with > 1000 depth 1 paths. But I guess I was wrong :(   ```  [Comment 32](show_bug.cgi?id=681578#c32)  Timo Sirainen    2012-03-16 20:02:12 UTC  ``` Yes, tons of processes doing a single epoll_create() and adding epoll_ctl() to a single pipe in it, all woken up at once when the read end of the pipe closes. A depth of 1 sounds like it, but I don't really understand what the nesting stuff in this bug is about.   ```  [Comment 33](show_bug.cgi?id=681578#c33)  Jason Baron    2012-03-16 20:10:33 UTC  ``` So this bug is about the ability to attach epoll fds to other fds. So even though the max depth of these paths is 4. you can get 1000^5  or more wakeups, which effectively brings down the box.  The fix is to limit these deep paths, such that you can't get all these wakeups. So we probably could be ok with an unlimited number of depth 1 paths. And impose the limitations just on deeper paths.  The other point here is that sane software can't be creating these 'infinite' wakeup problems, b/c otherwise they wouldn't work. So fundamentally, there has to be a sane limit we can impose.   ```  [Comment 34](show_bug.cgi?id=681578#c34)  Jason Baron    2012-03-16 20:15:08 UTC  ``` Also, if somebody could verify the patch from [comment #31](show_bug.cgi?id=681578#c31), that would be greatly appreciated. This is an important fix, which should probably be included asap. Thanks!  -Jason   ```  [Comment 35](show_bug.cgi?id=681578#c35)  David Castro    2012-03-16 23:18:16 UTC  ``` Jason,  I'll be sure to test with the [comment #33](show_bug.cgi?id=681578#c33) patch in as well.  I'm hoping to get to it over the weekend.  David   ```  [Comment 36](show_bug.cgi?id=681578#c36)  Jason Baron    2012-03-16 23:36:35 UTC  ``` Thanks David.   Just to be clear, I think we just want to test the patch from [comment #31](show_bug.cgi?id=681578#c31). I wouldn't bother with the patch from [comment #25](show_bug.cgi?id=681578#c25).  -Jason   ```  [Comment 37](show_bug.cgi?id=681578#c37)  David Castro    2012-03-19 11:13:01 UTC  ``` Jason,  Good news.  It does indeed appear that dovecot is happier, at the same load tested as before, with this new patch.  FYI, I simply built the patched kernel with the following options, the patch in #31 added to the spec file, using configs/kernel-2.6.18-x86_64.config and the kernel-2.6.18-308.el5 kernel source:    rpmbuild -bb --with baseonly --target=`uname -m` kernel.spec  So, as for the issues that were causing us problems (Panic: epoll_ctl...), this patch looks to prevent them.    Many thanks,  David   ```  [Comment 38](show_bug.cgi?id=681578#c38)  Jason Baron    2012-03-19 18:49:18 UTC  ``` Hi David,  Thanks for taking the time to confirm the fix. Thanks for helping us get to the bottom of this issue!  Thanks,  -Jason   ```  [Comment 39](show_bug.cgi?id=681578#c39)  Jason Baron    2012-03-19 18:52:01 UTC  ``` I've created a new bug:  [Bug 804778](show_bug.cgi?id=804778) - Excessive epoll nesting fix too restrictive  For tracking purposes. Please re-direct all future comments about this to that bz.  Thanks!  -Jason   ```  [Comment 40](show_bug.cgi?id=681578#c40)  Jonathan Peatfield    2012-04-10 19:47:27 UTC  ``` Hmm trying to read [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=804778](show_bug.cgi?id=804778) gives me an Access Denied error.

It should be released shortly (I realize that this is a critical issue). The fixed as mentioned is being tracked under [bz #804778](show_bug.cgi?id=804778). Thanks.   ```  [Comment 47](show_bug.cgi?id=681578#c47)  Jonathan Peatfield    2012-05-25 21:14:12 UTC  ``` It would probably avoid repeated questions if either [bz #804778](show_bug.cgi?id=804778) was readable/public or an brief comment as to why it isn't visible...   ```  [Comment 48](show_bug.cgi?id=681578#c48)  Jason Baron    2012-05-25 21:22:56 UTC  ``` There really isn't any additional info in 804778, I was only referring to it b/c it should be updated to indicate when the fix is released. There is no reason for it not to be more public short of my lack of knowledge on how to make bugzillas more visible. I just tried to open it up more. Let me know if you can't view it. Thanks.   ```  [Comment 49](show_bug.cgi?id=681578#c49)  Jonathan Peatfield    2012-05-25 21:27:51 UTC  ``` Sorry for the noise.  Sadly #804778 still shows "You are not authorized to access [bug #804778](show_bug.cgi?id=804778)." it doesn't give any reasons.   ```  [Comment 50](show_bug.cgi?id=681578#c50)  Akemi Yagi    2012-06-02 15:33:55 UTC  ``` I can see that the patch is now in the latest kernel 2.6.18-308.8.1.el5 released on 2012-05-29.  * Mon Apr 30 2012 Alexander Gordeev <agordeev> [2.6.18-308.7.1.el5] - [fs] epoll: Don't limit non-nested epoll paths (Jason Baron) [809380 804778]   ```  [Comment 51](show_bug.cgi?id=681578#c51)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-06-20 07:38:01 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2012:0862 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0862.html>   ```  [Comment 53](show_bug.cgi?id=681578#c53)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-07-31 20:06:34 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.2 EUS - Server Only  Via RHSA-2012:1129 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1129.html>   ``` |  |

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).

## Synopsis

Moderate: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 kernel security, bug fix and enhancement update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A0862)

## Topic

Updated kernel packages that fix two security issues, address several
hundred bugs and add numerous enhancements are now available as part of the
ongoing support and maintenance of Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 6. This
is the third regular update.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

This update fixes the following security issues:

* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's Event Poll (epoll)

subsystem handled large, nested epoll structures. A local, unprivileged
user could use this flaw to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2011-1083,
Moderate)

* A malicious Network File System version 4 (NFSv4) server could return a

crafted reply to a GETACL request, causing a denial of service on the
client. (CVE-2011-4131, Moderate)

Red Hat would like to thank Nelson Elhage for reporting CVE-2011-1083, and
Andy Adamson for reporting CVE-2011-4131.

This update also fixes several hundred bugs and adds enhancements. Refer to
the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.3 Release Notes for information on the most
significant of these changes, and the Technical Notes for further
information, both linked to in the References.

All Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 users are advised to install these updated
packages, which correct these issues, and fix the bugs and add the
enhancements noted in the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.3 Release Notes and
Technical Notes. The system must be rebooted for this update to take
effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata

To install kernel packages manually, use "rpm -ivh [package]". Do not
use "rpm -Uvh" as that will remove the running kernel binaries from
your system. You may use "rpm -e" to remove old kernels after
determining that the new kernel functions properly on your system.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

An update that solves 9 vulnerabilities and has 82 fixes is
now available. It includes one version update.
Description:
The SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 SP2 kernel has been updated to
3.0.26, which fixes a lot of bugs and security issues.
The following security issues have been fixed:
\* CVE-2012-1179: A locking problem in transparent
hugepage support could be used by local attackers to
potentially crash the host, or via kvm a privileged guest
user could crash the kvm host system.
\* CVE-2011-4127: A potential hypervisor escape by
issuing SG\_IO commands to partitiondevices was fixed by
restricting access to these commands.
\* CVE-2012-1146: A local attacker could oops the kernel
using memory control groups and eventfds.
\* CVE-2011-1083: Limit the path length users can build
using epoll() to avoid local attackers consuming lots of
kernel CPU time.
\* CVE-2012-1097: The regset common infrastructure
assumed that regsets would always have .get and .set
methods, but necessarily .active methods. Unfortunately
people have since written regsets without .set method, so
NULL pointer dereference attacks were possible.
\* CVE-2011-2494: Access to the /proc/pid/taskstats file
requires root access to avoid side channel (timing
keypresses etc.) attacks on other users.
\* CVE-2011-4086: Fixed a oops in jbd/jbd2 that could be
caused by specific filesystem access patterns.
\* CVE-2011-4131: A malicious NFSv4 server could have
caused a oops in the nfsv4 acl handling.
\* CVE-2011-4132: Fixed a oops in jbd/jbd2 that could be
caused by mounting a malicious prepared filesystem.
(Also included are all fixes from the 3.0.14 -> 3.0.25
stable kernel updates.)

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

I thought that the limits were higher than anybody would hit in practice but perhaps not. I can re-spin a 'debug' patch that will print more info in this situation, if you are willing to test that. Otherwise, if have a re-producer that I can try, that would be appreciated. Do you have any sense of how many epoll fds are required per fd?

All of the Dovecot child processes listen on this pipe to find out when the master process dies. There are systems with tens of thousands of Dovecot child processes, so simply increasing the limit to 2000 won't help.  Postfix behaves in a similar way by polling on a pipe fd shared by all the same service processes. So if e.g. Postfix starts up over 1000 smtp or smtpd processes it'll fail in the same way.  I'd think there are also other software using a pipe to find out when the other side is dead.  Can this shared pipe be handled as a special case somehow?   ```  [Comment 28](show_bug.cgi?id=681578#c28)  Timo Sirainen    2012-03-16 17:20:16 UTC  ``` Sorry, I meant write side of the pipe is passed to Dovecot child processes. They are listening for EPOLLERR | EPOLLHUP from the pipe.   ```  [Comment 29](show_bug.cgi?id=681578#c29)  Jason Baron    2012-03-16 19:41:15 UTC  ``` Just so I understand, you're saying that all of the 'child' processes will do an epoll_create followed by an epoll_ctl() to attach to a single pipe? And then they are all woken up at once?  If so, this bug fix is about preventing deep nesting. So in this case it sounds like the depth is '1'. We could probably increase the level '1' nesting really large - and then leave the level '2' and beyond where they currently are, to fix this.  Thanks!  -Jason   ```  [Comment 30](show_bug.cgi?id=681578#c30)  Jason Baron    2012-03-16 19:43:10 UTC  ``` Or maybe there is no level '1' limit?   ```  [Comment 31](show_bug.cgi?id=681578#c31)  Jason Baron    2012-03-16 19:57:53 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 570690](attachment.cgi?id=570690&action=diff "allow unlimited number of depth 1 paths") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=570690&action=edit "allow unlimited number of depth 1 paths") allow unlimited number of depth 1 paths  Here's a simple patch, which allows all depth 1 paths. The argument being that you are limited to the number of open files and processes that you can create by the sysadmin. This should still prevent the nasty infinite wakeup paths. Do the limits seem sane then?  unlimited depth 1 paths (limited by open files and processes you can create) 500 depth 2 100 depth 3 50 depth 4 10 depth 5  I didn't think there were any apps with > 1000 depth 1 paths. But I guess I was wrong :(   ```  [Comment 32](show_bug.cgi?id=681578#c32)  Timo Sirainen    2012-03-16 20:02:12 UTC  ``` Yes, tons of processes doing a single epoll_create() and adding epoll_ctl() to a single pipe in it, all woken up at once when the read end of the pipe closes. A depth of 1 sounds like it, but I don't really understand what the nesting stuff in this bug is about.   ```  [Comment 33](show_bug.cgi?id=681578#c33)  Jason Baron    2012-03-16 20:10:33 UTC  ``` So this bug is about the ability to attach epoll fds to other fds. So even though the max depth of these paths is 4. you can get 1000^5  or more wakeups, which effectively brings down the box.  The fix is to limit these deep paths, such that you can't get all these wakeups. So we probably could be ok with an unlimited number of depth 1 paths. And impose the limitations just on deeper paths.  The other point here is that sane software can't be creating these 'infinite' wakeup problems, b/c otherwise they wouldn't work. So fundamentally, there has to be a sane limit we can impose.   ```  [Comment 34](show_bug.cgi?id=681578#c34)  Jason Baron    2012-03-16 20:15:08 UTC  ``` Also, if somebody could verify the patch from [comment #31](show_bug.cgi?id=681578#c31), that would be greatly appreciated.

It does indeed appear that dovecot is happier, at the same load tested as before, with this new patch.  FYI, I simply built the patched kernel with the following options, the patch in #31 added to the spec file, using configs/kernel-2.6.18-x86_64.config and the kernel-2.6.18-308.el5 kernel source:    rpmbuild -bb --with baseonly --target=`uname -m` kernel.spec  So, as for the issues that were causing us problems (Panic: epoll_ctl...), this patch looks to prevent them.
