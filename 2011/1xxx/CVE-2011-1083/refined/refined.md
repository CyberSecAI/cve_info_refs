{
  "CVE-2011-1083": {
    "Description": "The epoll subsystem allows users to create large nested epoll structures, which the kernel will then walk with preemption disabled, causing a denial of service via excessive CPU consumption in the kernel.",
    "Root cause": "The Linux kernel's epoll subsystem does not limit the depth or complexity of nested epoll structures, leading to excessive CPU consumption when these structures are traversed.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Lack of limits on nested epoll structures",
       "Walking of large nested structures with preemption disabled"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service due to excessive CPU consumption, potentially leading to a kernel deadlock.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Local user"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to have the ability to create nested epoll structures, which can be done by a local, unprivileged user.",
    "Additional Information": "This vulnerability was present in several Linux distributions, and required a kernel patch to limit the depth of the nested structures. Some applications such as dovecot and postfix were found to be affected. This vulnerability is similar to CVE-2011-1082, which involves circular epoll structures.",
    "Affected_products": [
