| [Description](#c0)  Paweł Hajdan, Jr. (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2011-02-28 21:05:09 UTC  ``` The lack of symlink checks while doing installation and upgrades, which initiate various system write operations, can cause privileged users unknowingly to overwrite critical system files.  Details:    To be vulnerable, a non-privileged user that has access to the system must explicitly create a symlink from a predictable location, to which PEAR will write, with an end point at a system critical file such as /etc/passwd.  A non-privileged user is not required to have permission to the symlink endpoint, the required privileges are obtained by asking a privileged user to perform a routine task, such as installation or upgrade of packages, which will in turn write to a predictable location; the whole process is transparent for the privileged user and will in turn write to the symbolically linked endpoint.  It is not possible to inject arbitrary information with this approach, it is only possible to overwrite symlinked files with one of the files coming from the PEAR package being installed/updated. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Paweł Hajdan, Jr. (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2011-02-28 21:06:58 UTC  ``` Maintainers, is it OK to stabilize =dev-php/PEAR-PEAR-1.9.2? ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Ole Markus With (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2011-03-01 08:50:13 UTC  ``` Please go ahead. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Paweł Hajdan, Jr. (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2011-03-01 09:41:57 UTC  ``` Thank you.

Not sure it is fixable, or maybe using a lock on the symbolic link
while fetching its target (to be tested to be sure that such locks
cannot be overridden from shell).

Hard link are not detectable (lstat), they are treated like normal files.

SECURITY VULNERABILITY ANNOUNCEMENT
February 28, 2011
Advisory: PEAR installer symlink vulnerability
Release Date: 2011/02/28
Last Modified: 2011/02/28
Author: Helgi Thormar Thorbjoernsson [helgi@php.net]
Application: PEAR installer <= 1.9.1
Risk: Medium
Vendor Status: The PEAR project has released an updated version
References: http://pear.php.net/advisory-20110228.txt
ID: PSA 20110228-01
Overview:
The PEAR installer is available from http://pear.php.net/package/PEAR.
The PEAR installer is used to install PHP-based software packages
distributed from pear.php.net and PHP extensions from pecl.php.net. As
of version 1.4.0, the PEAR installer can also install software packages
from other sources, known as "channels."
The lack of symlink checks while doing installation and upgrades, which
initiate various system write operations, can cause privileged users
unknowingly to overwrite critical system files.
Details:
To be vulnerable, a non-privileged user that has access to the system must
explicitly create a symlink from a predictable location, to which PEAR will
write, with an end point at a system critical file such as /etc/passwd.
A non-privileged user is not required to have permission to the symlink
endpoint, the required privileges are obtained by asking a privileged
user to perform a routine task, such as installation or upgrade of packages,
which will in turn write to a predictable location; the whole process is
transparent for the privileged user and will in turn write to the symbolically
linked endpoint.
It is not possible to inject arbitrary information with this approach, it is
only possible to overwrite symlinked files with one of the files coming from
the PEAR package being installed/updated.
The following steps have been taken to fix the problem at hand:
\* tmpnam has been put in use to ensure fairly non-predictible paths
\* Proper symlink checks have been put in place and a warning is issued
if a write operation happens on a symlink as well as the operation is
cancelled
Further information about how symlink attacks work can be found at
http://www.infosecwriters.com/texts.php?op=display&id=159
Recommendation:
We strongly recommend to upgrade to the new version
PEAR 1.9.2 or higher
pear upgrade PEAR-1.9.2
http://pear.php.net/get/PEAR-1.9.2.tgz
Thanks to Raphael Geisert, Ondrej Sury and rest of the Debian team.

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

The PEAR installer does use /tmp (and whatever the Windows equivalent is) by default unless the user opts into a local installation or does indeed change the configuration to use other temp/download/cache directories so users can guard themselves with a good setup.

A flag like that would be handy but doesn't exist (yet) in PHP.

I moved over to using the O_CREAT|O_EXCL equivalent in PHP when creating new files and lstat + fopen + fstat and comparing mode/ino/dev before writing to an existing file for the cache. I could add an nlink check to that as well.
The current version I've been playing around with is located at <https://gist.github.com/848371> - It is missing the nlink part but it should be able to deal with TOCTOU problems. That code snippet hasn't been committed as I consider it work-in-progress still.

Any comments / suggestions are welcome, I did write that one quite late last night :-)

Subject: Re: CVE Request: PEAR Installer 1.9.1 <= - Symlink Attack

I'm not familiar with this code or any of the context surrounding this
fix, but it appears to be an incomplete fix.  Checking for existence
of a symlink and then opening the resource leaves open a window during
which a legitimate file can be replaced with a symlink.  Also, I don't
see a reason why a hard link couldn't be used for exploitation
instead.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: php-pear: refuses to install anything
Date: Fri, 11 Sep 2009 12:35:38 +0200
```
Package: php-pear
Version: 5.2.10.dfsg.1-2.2
Severity: normal

Hi,

Having a package like [1] unpacked at /home/fgimenez/php-net-sieve, the command

  pear install -O /home/fgimenez/php-net-sieve/NET_Sieve-1.1.7/package.xml

gives:

  download directory "/home/aba/php5-5.2.10.dfsg.1/pear-build-download" is not writeable.  Change download_dir config variable to a writeable dir
  Cannot download non-local package "/home/fgimenez/php-net-sieve/NET_Sieve-1.1.7/package.xml"
  install failed

This prevents also the building of pear packages (tested with cdbs and dh-make-php, probably with debhelper).

Cheers,
Federico

To be more precise, the command issued to install as a common user is:

  pear -d include_path=/usr/share/php -d php_dir=/home/fgimenez/php-net-sieve -d data_dir=/home/fgimenez/php-net-sieve -d doc_dir=/home/fgimenez/php-net-sieve -d test_dir=/home/fgimenez/php-net-sieve install -O -P /home/fgimenez/php-net-sieve /home/fgimenez/php-net-sieve/Net_Sieve-1.1.7/package.xml

and it gives the same result:

  download directory "/home/aba/php5-5.2.10.dfsg.1/pear-build-download" is not writeable.  Change download_dir config variable to a writeable dir

  Cannot download non-local package "Net_Sieve-1.1.7/package.xml"

  install failed

If the command is executed by root, a /home/aba/php5-5.2.10.dfsg.1/pear-build-download is created.

tags 546164 patch
thanks

Hi,

This seems to be related to the definition of the PHP_PEAR_DOWNLOAD_DIR
constant at the build-pear-stamp rule in the debian/rules file,
moreover, the definition seems to be somehow misplaced (but it is taken
into account anyway!). I've attached a patch that removes that
definition (and the creation of the related directory), don't know if
this could have any negative side effects.

Hope this helps. Cheers,
Federico

That's right. It was needed so that multiple users could build the package on
the same machine, but it was never meant to be propagated to the config file
(until recently the config file was never read).

It isn't, that's the way to set env vars.

That would reintroduce the bug that originally lead us to change the download
directory.

The report was ok, the patch wasn't, and as you may guess the work for the
maintainer is more or less the same whether it is a private mail or not.
You should always file the bug reports :)

No, not merged. This bug should be marked as affecting (see the 'affects' BTS
keyword) the other package.

I guess I'll be uploading a fixed package tonight, although I don't like the
sort of changes we have to make to workaround pear's brokenness.

great, thanks for letting us know.  it's a bit odd since i don't think
we did anything explicitly for this, nor was there anything in the
upstream changelog mentioning the problem/fix... but hey, i'll take a
free fix :)

Nah, it was not fixed. It stopped being an RC issue because the tmpdir path is
now set to something under /tmp, which an unprivileged user can create. I
have a patch to workaround it by restoring the value originally set by
PEAR::Config, but this still doesn't solve the real issue (and it is also
open to symlink attacks[1]).

[1] I don't remember the exact test conditions I used to test the symlink
attack, though, as I did it in a rush.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=681982#c0)  Vincent Danen    2011-03-03 19:05:25 UTC  ``` Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures assigned an identifier [CVE-2011-1072](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1072) to the following vulnerability:  Name: [CVE-2011-1072](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1072) URL: <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-1072> Assigned: 20110224 Reference: <http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/02/28/3> Reference: <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=546164> Reference: <http://news.php.net/php.pear.cvs/61264> Reference: <http://pear.php.net/advisory-20110228.txt> Reference: <http://pear.php.net/bugs/bug.php?id=18056> Reference: <http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1072> Reference: <http://svn.php.net/viewvc?view=revision&revision=308687> Reference: <http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/46605> Reference: <http://secunia.com/advisories/43533> Reference: <http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/65721>  The installer in PEAR before 1.9.2 allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack on the package.xml file, related to the (1) download_dir, (2) cache_dir, (3) tmp_dir, and (4) pear-build-download directories, a different vulnerability than [CVE-2007-2519](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2007-2519).   Note that PEAR 1.9.2 did not fully correct the issue, and MITRE assigned [CVE-2011-1144](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1144) to that:  The installer in PEAR 1.9.2 and earlier allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack on the package.xml file, related to the (1) download_dir, (2) cache_dir, (3) tmp_dir, and (4) pear-build-download directories.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for [CVE-2011-1072](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1072).  References to the incomplete fix:  <http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/03/01/9>  So if we do update to 1.9.2 without the full fix, then [CVE-2011-1144](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1144) applies as 1.9.2 contains an incomplete fix.  It also does not look like older versions of PEAR (e.g. 1.4.9 as found in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5) are vulnerable as there is no specific download directory or temporary directory specifications used (download_dir, temp_dir), and the default cache directory is /var/cache/php-pear which is owned root:root and mode 0755 (not a world-writable /tmp).   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=681982#c1)  Vincent Danen    2011-03-03 19:09:31 UTC  ``` Created php-pear tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 681983](show_bug.cgi?id=681983 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2011-1072 php-pear: symlink vulnerability in PEAR installer [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=681982#c2)  Vincent Danen    2011-03-12 00:11:22 UTC  ``` This has been further fixed upstream (so this would be the fix for [CVE-2011-1144](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1144)):  <http://svn.php.net/viewvc?view=revision&revision=309042>  This, in addition to the previous changes, would be required to fully fix [CVE-2011-1072](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1072).   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=681982#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-12-06 18:43:54 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2011:1741 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-1741.html>   ``` |  |

I assume you are referring to the parts for REST.php in the patch in question?
At a second look, that part could do with improvements; I wrote up a function which takes TOCTOU into consideration.
I'll have that patch done by the end of the day.

For other situations I am using tempnam() (via the System class) as those files are only temporary and were being extracted from compressed archives; The predictability of their end destination where the centre part of the reported security problem.

The easiest way is to just open the target with the O_NOFOLLOW flag to
avoid following symlinks and abort on failure.  If you need to support
systems that don't have this flag, then perhaps you could consider
using an application-specific temporary directory instead of operating
in the world-writable /tmp.

Sure they are - just open the file, fstat() it, and check the st_nlink
field.  If it's more than one, you know there's hard linking going on.
 Sometimes this kind of check introduces a race condition of its own
where the file can be removed by the attacker after a file descriptor
is obtained but before the fstat(), but in this case since an attacker
would be creating a hard link to a victim's file, he wouldn't be able
to remove it since it's in a sticky-bit /tmp directory.

**[2010-11-14 20:26 UTC] [ondrej](/user/ondrej)**
(Ond?ej Surý)Description:
------------
There's symlink vulnerability when doing PEAR install. PEAR
should really be using $(mktemp) for it's directories like
download\_dir, cache\_dir and tmp\_dir, and check whether the
directory doesn't exists.
Test script:
---------------
# pear config-show | grep /tmp
PEAR Installer cache directory cache\_dir /tmp/pear/cache
PEAR Installer download download\_dir /tmp/buildd/php5-5.3.3/pear-build-download
PEAR Installer temp directory temp\_dir /tmp/pear/temp
# ls -ld /tmp/buildd/php5-5.3.3/pear-build-download
drwxr-xr-x 2 ondrej ondrej 4096 Nov 14 14:17 /tmp/buildd/php5-5.3.3/pear-build-download
# su - ondrej
$ cd /tmp/buildd/php5-5.3.3/pear-build-download
$ ln -s /etc/passwd package.xml
$ cat package.xml
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
[...]
$ logout
# pear install Net\_Socket
downloading Net\_Socket-1.0.10.tgz ...
Starting to download Net\_Socket-1.0.10.tgz (5,429 bytes)
.....done: 5,429 bytes
install ok: channel://pear.php.net/Net\_Socket-1.0.10
# head /etc/passwd
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<package packagerversion="1.9.1" version="2.0" xmlns="[http://pear.php.net/dtd/package-2.0"](http://pear.php.net/dtd/package-2.0%22) xmlns:tasks="[http://pear.php.net/dtd/tasks-1.0"](http://pear.php.net/dtd/tasks-1.0%22) xmlns:xsi="[http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"](http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance%22) xsi:schemaLocation="<http://pear.php.net/dtd/tasks-1.0> <http://pear.php.net/dtd/tasks-1.0.xsd> <http://pear.php.net/dtd/package-2.0> [http://pear.php.net/dtd/package-2.0.xsd"](http://pear.php.net/dtd/package-2.0.xsd%22)>
<name>Net\_Socket</name>
<channel>pear.php.net</channel>
<summary>Network Socket Interface</summary>
<description>Net\_Socket is a class interface to TCP sockets. It provides blocking
and non-blocking operation, with different reading and writing modes
(byte-wise, block-wise, line-wise and special formats like network
byte-order ip addresses).</description>
<lead>
Expected result:
----------------
Not overwriting system files. Not vulnerable to symlink attack.
Actual result:
--------------
Overwritten /etc/passwd just by creating right directories and
symlinks.

(Ond?ej Surý)This should probably get a CVE.
It's already tracked under:
<http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=546164>
<http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/TEMP-0546164-014755>
Bug first reported by Raphael Geisert (one of Debian php5 maintainers).

(Helgi Þormar Þorbjörnsson)A fix is coming soon, sorry for the delays. As for the CVE, is that something you (or
any of the Debian people) want to take care of?

**[2010-12-29 18:21 UTC] [ondrej](/user/ondrej)**
(Ond?ej Surý)Hi, thanks for working on the fix.
You should probably request a CVE, since you are the owner of the project. I guess
you can ask on internals how to do that.

-Status: Assigned
+Status: Closed
This bug has been fixed in SVN.
If this was a documentation problem, the fix will appear on pear.php.net by the end of next Sunday (CET).
If this was a problem with the pear.php.net website, the change should be live shortly.
Otherwise, the fix will appear in the package's next release.
Thank you for the report and for helping us make PEAR better.
The fixes have been committed and an advisory will be posted when the release
happens, in the next day or two.
Look for the 1.9.2 release when it gets posted.
