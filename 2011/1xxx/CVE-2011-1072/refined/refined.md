  "CVE-2011-1072": {
    "Description": "The installer in PEAR before 1.9.2 allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack on the package.xml file, related to the (1) download_dir, (2) cache_dir, (3) tmp_dir, and (4) pear-build-download directories, a different vulnerability than CVE-2007-2519.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The PEAR installer did not perform adequate checks for symlinks when writing to predictable directories during installation or upgrades. This allows a local, unprivileged attacker to create a symlink from a predictable location to a system-critical file. When a privileged user runs the PEAR installer, it writes to the symlinked location, thus overwriting the target.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Inadequate symlink checks",
      "Predictable write locations",
      "Privilege escalation through a privileged user performing a routine task"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary file overwrite, potentially leading to system compromise if critical files are targeted, such as /etc/passwd.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local exploitation through symlink manipulation in the file system.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local access to the system with the ability to create symlinks. The attacker also requires a privileged user to execute PEAR installation or upgrade tasks.",
     "Additional Information": "It's important to note that the initial fix in PEAR 1.9.2 was incomplete and led to CVE-2011-1144. The full fix included additional checks for symlinks and usage of `tmpnam` for non-predictable paths.",
