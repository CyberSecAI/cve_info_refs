{
  "vulnerability": {
    "cve": "CVE-2011-1939",
    "description": "SQL injection vulnerability in Zend Framework 1.10.x before 1.10.9 and 1.11.x before 1.11.6 when using non-ASCII-compatible encodings in conjunction PDO_MySql in PHP before 5.3.6.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises due to improper handling of character sets in the PDO_MYSQL driver when used with non-ASCII compatible encodings prior to PHP 5.3.6. Specifically, the charset parameter in the DSN string was not being used by the PDO_MYSQL driver, leading to incorrect quoting and subsequent SQL injection.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "SQL injection"
     ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can inject arbitrary SQL statements, potentially leading to unauthorized access, modification, or deletion of data in the database.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through a crafted SQL query where a vulnerable parameter is not properly sanitized due to the incorrect character set handling. This could be through user-supplied input into a web application that uses PDO with a non-ASCII encoding such as GBK or others.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious SQL code through application parameters and the application must use PDO with a non-ASCII compatible encoding in conjunction with the MySQL database, on a PHP version prior to 5.3.6 or without setting the charset via the DSN parameter in newer versions."
