It should be  backported and re-released as a security fix for 5.2.x.  As it stands now, PDO::quote() does not protect against security vulnerabilities  without the ability to set the character set in the C api.  5.3.6 closes this  hole when supplied with the optional charset parameter (by appropriately setting  the character set).  However this will need to be expressed in the documentation  (I will file another issue on this topic).  Proof Of Concept Code:  $dsn = 'mysql:dbname=INFORMATION_SCHEMA;host=127.0.0.1;charset=GBK'; $pdo = new PDO($dsn, $user, $pass); $pdo->exec('SET NAMES GBK'); $string = chr(0xbf) . chr(0x27) . ' OR 1 = 1; /*'; $sql = "SELECT TABLE_NAME              FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES              WHERE TABLE_NAME LIKE ".$pdo->quote($string).";"; $stmt = $pdo->query($sql); var_dump($stmt->rowCount());  Expected: int(0) Actual: the number of tables on the server  ``` **[2011-04-18 22:38 UTC] [colder@php.net](//people.php.net/colder)** -Status: Closed +Status: Re-Opened **[2011-04-18 22:38 UTC] [colder@php.net](//people.php.net/colder)** ``` Re-opening because of 5_2 backport request by some user.  ``` **[2011-04-19 01:07 UTC] [johannes@php.net](//people.php.net/johannes)** -Status: Re-Opened +Status: To be documented -Assigned To: kalle +Assigned To: **[2011-04-19 01:07 UTC] [johannes@php.net](//people.php.net/johannes)** ``` If a developer shots himself it is noting we can prevent. Tis does not justify a security release of PHP as the only one who can exploit this is the one writing code ...  This should however be made clear in the documentation: Executing SET NAMES doesn't tell anything to the client library (libmysql / mysqlnd used by PHP) so they can't do proper encoding. Therefore only Latin 1, Utf-8 and other encodings using lower 7 bits in an ASCII compatible way can be used safely. For other encodings the mentioned option, introduced later in 5.3.6 should be used.  ``` **[2011-04-19 01:58 UTC] ircmaxell at gmail dot com** ``` I won't argue the decision, but I'd like to clarify one point.  Right now, in  5.2.x (and <=5.3.5) it's impossible to write a secure query using PDO::quote.  So  if you use another character set, it would automatically make all code vulnerable  to SQL Injection (with no built-in method to fix it).  So that leaves existing  the code 3 options: Switch to MySQLi, Implement their own quoting mechanism, or  switch to prepared statements (the best solution).  But as it stands, the API  does not deliver its promise.   Just an observation...  ``` **[2011-04-19 11:38 UTC] [johannes@php.net](//people.php.net/johannes)** ``` You can write secure code - if you are using a supported encoding (iso-8859-1/latin1, utf-8, ...)  ``` **[2012-03-06 01:44 UTC] [johannes@php.net](//people.php.net/johannes)** -Status: Open +Status: Closed -Assigned To: +Assigned To: mysql **[2012-03-06 01:44 UTC] [johannes@php.net](//people.php.net/johannes)** ``` Thank you for your bug report. This issue has already been fixed in the latest released version of PHP, which you can download at  <http://www.php.net/downloads.php>    ``` |

| [Description](#c0)  Tim Sammut (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2011-05-29 04:01:35 UTC  ``` From the upstream advisory at $URL:  ZF2011-02: Potential SQL Injection Vector When Using PDO_MySql Executive Summary  Developers using non-ASCII-compatible encodings in conjunction with the MySQL PDO driver of PHP may be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. Developers using ASCII-compatible encodings like UTF8 or latin1 are not affected by this PHP issue, which is described in more detail here:      * <http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=47802>  The PHP Group included a feature in PHP 5.3.6+ that allows any character set information to be passed as part of the DSN in PDO to allow both the database as well as the C-level driver to be aware of which charset is in use which is of special importance when PDO's quoting mechanisms are utilized, which Zend Framework also relies on. Action Taken  Zend_Db was patched to ensure that any charset information provided to the PDO MySQL adapter will be sent to PDO both as part of the DSN as well as in a SET NAMES query. This ensures that any developer using ZF on PHP 5.3.6+ while using non-ASCII compatible encodings is safe from SQL injection while using the PDO's quoting mechanisms or emulated prepared statements.  The patch has been applied starting in versions 1.11.6 and 1.10.9 of Zend Framework. Recommendations  If you are using non-ASCII compatible encodings, such as GBK, in conjunction with PDO's MySQL adapter, we strongly urge you to consider upgrading to at least PHP 5.3.6 and use Zend Framework version 1.11.6 or greater, or 1.10.9 if still using the 1.10 series of releases. Other Information Acknowledgments  The Zend Framework team thanks the following for working with us to help protect its users:      * Anthony Ferrara ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Bjarke Istrup Pedersen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2011-05-29 10:32:47 UTC  ``` Do fell free to bump and stabilize the new version :) Would make me happy to be able to get rid of the old versions, once the new version is stable :) (So that would be a bonus) ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Ole Markus With (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2011-05-29 11:08:21 UTC  ``` Ebuild committed.

## Security Advisory: ZF2011-02

# ZF2011-02: Potential SQL Injection Vector When Using PDO\_MySql

## Executive Summary

Developers using non-ASCII-compatible encodings in conjunction with the MySQL
PDO driver of PHP may be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. Developers using
ASCII-compatible encodings like UTF8 or latin1 are not affected by this PHP
issue, which is described in more detail here:

* <http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=47802>

The PHP Group included a feature in PHP 5.3.6+ that allows any character set
information to be passed as part of the DSN in PDO to allow both the database as
well as the C-level driver to be aware of which charset is in use which is of
special importance when PDO's quoting mechanisms are utilized, which Zend
Framework also relies on.

## Action Taken

`Zend_Db` was patched to ensure that any charset information provided to the PDO
MySQL adapter will be sent to PDO both as part of the DSN as well as in a SET
NAMES query. This ensures that any developer using ZF on PHP 5.3.6+ while using
non-ASCII compatible encodings is safe from SQL injection while using the PDO's
quoting mechanisms or emulated prepared statements.

The patch has been applied starting in versions 1.11.6 and 1.10.9 of Zend
Framework.

## Recommendations

If you are using non-ASCII compatible encodings, such as GBK, in conjunction
with PDO's MySQL adapter, we strongly urge you to consider upgrading to at least
PHP 5.3.6 and use Zend Framework version 1.11.6 or greater, or 1.10.9 if still
using the 1.10 series of releases.

# Zend Framework: SQL injection — GLSA **201408-01**

A vulnerability in Zend Framework could allow a remote attacker to
inject SQL commands.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-php/ZendFramework** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.11.6** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.11.6** |

### Background

Zend Framework is a high quality and open source framework for
developing Web Applications.

### Description

Developers using non-ASCII-compatible encodings in conjunction with the
MySQL PDO driver of PHP may be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.

### Impact

A remote attacker could use specially crafted input to execute arbitrary
SQL statements.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All ZendFramework users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-php/ZendFramework-1.11.6"

```

NOTE: This is a legacy GLSA. Updates for all affected architectures have
been
available since 2011-06-07. It is likely that your system is already
updated
to no longer be affected by this issue.

| [Description](#c0)  Tod M. Neidt    2002-01-04 02:42:49 UTC  ``` Hi!  Please find attached poedit-1.1.5.ebuild.  poedit is a cross-platform gettext catalogs (.po files) editor.  It requires wxGTK submitted earlier.  Although not required, it will automagically detect gnome or kde if they are installed and fit in the desktop, i.e. with gnome you will find it in the development menu.  I suggest dev-utils/poedit.  tod ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Tod M. Neidt    2002-01-04 02:44:14 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1](attachment.cgi?id=1 "poedit-1.1.5.ebuild") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=1&action=edit "poedit-1.1.5.ebuild")] poedit-1.1.5.ebuild ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Mikael Hallendal (hallski) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-10 07:52:36 UTC  ``` had some issues and had to set GNOME_DATA_DIR manually when doing make install. Otherwise it installed outside tmp-dir causing a sandbox violation.  This has to be solved for KDE too.  Dan can you take a look at this. I'm commiting it now to dev-util/poedit and will mask it. So can you merge this under KDE and unmask it when you have tested it with the sandbox.  ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Dan Armak (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-10 13:26:26 UTC  ``` I'll look at it tomorrow.  ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Dan Armak (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-19 11:46:59 UTC  ``` 'tomorrow' didn't work out. Now I've tried it I can't emerge wxGtk which is a  dep for poedit.  ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Dan Armak (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-25 08:49:20 UTC  ``` OK, patch added and it now works in the sandbox. Unmasking. This took so long because of the wxGK problem (solved yesterday).  ``` |  |
