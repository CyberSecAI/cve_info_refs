Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2011-1997:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory after they have been deleted. Specifically, when accessing an object that has already been deleted, it can corrupt memory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-after-free vulnerability. The software attempts to access memory that has already been freed, leading to memory corruption.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the same privileges as the logged-on user.
- If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker could gain full control of the affected system. This includes the ability to install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new user accounts with full rights.

**Attack vectors:**
- Web-based attacks: An attacker could host a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability and trick users into visiting it.
- Embedding malicious code: Attackers can embed malicious ActiveX controls (marked as "safe for initialization") within applications or Microsoft Office documents that use the Internet Explorer rendering engine.
- Compromised websites: Attackers can inject malicious content into compromised or user-content-hosting websites.
- Phishing attacks: Attackers can use email or instant messaging to convince users to click on a malicious link or open a compromised attachment.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to host a website or distribute a document with the crafted exploit.
- The attacker needs to convince the user to interact with the malicious content, usually by visiting a website, opening a document, or clicking a link.
- No user interaction can be forced. The attacker must rely on social engineering to trick a user into opening the attack vector.

**Additional notes:**
- This vulnerability specifically affects Internet Explorer 6 on Windows XP and Windows Server 2003.
- Internet Explorer 7, 8 and 9 are not affected.
- The document provides workarounds involving disabling or restricting ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting.
- The vulnerability was not publicly disclosed before the release of the security bulletin and no exploitation was known at the time of release.
