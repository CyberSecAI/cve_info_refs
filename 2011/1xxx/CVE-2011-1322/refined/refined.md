- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The IBM implementation of SAAJ (SOAP with Attachments API for Java) failed to remove a prior instance of a SOAPElement when a new SOAPElement was added as a child. This resulted in a SOAPElement containing a large number of child SOAPElements representing the same data.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper handling of child SOAPElement objects, leading to a memory leak. Specifically, the SAAJ implementation failed to remove the prior child node when a new child node with the same data is added, causing a buildup of redundant objects in memory.

- **Impact of exploitation:**  The excessive accumulation of `com.ibm.ws.webservices.engine.xmsoap.SOAPElement` objects eventually leads to an `OutOfMemoryError`, which can cause the application server to crash or become unresponsive. This can result in denial of service.

- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered when a SOAP message is processed, especially when using Spring framework for message decryption. It does not appear to be a direct network-based attack vector. Instead, it occurs when a specific sequence of SOAPElement manipulation takes place through the application.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need to be able to send SOAP messages that cause the described SOAPElement manipulation to occur, and thus trigger the memory leak and potentially lead to the OutOfMemoryError. The attacker would need to understand the message structure and the operations that cause the redundant elements to build up. This may require internal knowledge of the application's message structure if custom Spring logic is in use. It is not clear if an attacker can intentionally construct specific SOAP messages to trigger the vulnerability without some level of familiarity with the web service.
