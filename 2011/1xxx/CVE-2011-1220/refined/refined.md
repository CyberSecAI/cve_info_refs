  "CVE-2011-1220": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in IBM Tivoli Endpoint's lcfd.exe process. The process listens on TCP port 9495 and requires authentication. An attacker can leverage a built-in account to bypass authentication and then trigger a stack buffer overflow by sending a crafted POST variable. This allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a stack buffer overflow when the `lcfd.exe` process blindly copies a POST variable's content into a fixed-size (256-byte) stack buffer.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Stack buffer overflow",
        "Insufficient input validation",
        "Default credentials/easily bypassed authentication"
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges.",
        "attack_vector": "Remote. An attacker sends a crafted POST request to the vulnerable service after bypassing authentication using a built-in account.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable service and requires knowledge of a built-in account's credentials."
