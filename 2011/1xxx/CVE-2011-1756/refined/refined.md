Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2011-1756:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The Jabber server component of Citadel does not prevent entity expansion on received data. This means that it processes XML data without limiting the expansion of entities defined within the XML.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper handling of XML entity expansion, specifically the lack of prevention of entity expansion. This leads to a vulnerability known as the "billion laughs" attack.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS). By sending specially crafted XML data with deeply nested entity references, an attacker can cause the server to consume excessive resources (CPU and/or memory), leading to a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote attack via the Jabber interface. An attacker sends malicious XML data to the Jabber server component of Citadel.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send XML data to the Jabber interface of the Citadel server. They do not need to be authenticated.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is described as a "billion laughs" attack, which is a type of XML denial-of-service attack that leverages excessive entity expansion.
- Debian provided patches for their `lenny` and `squeeze` distributions to address this issue.
