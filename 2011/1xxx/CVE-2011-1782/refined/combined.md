Package        : gimp
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2010-4540 CVE-2010-4541 CVE-2010-4542 CVE-2010-4543
                 CVE-2011-1782 CVE-2011-2896

Several vulnerabilities have been identified in GIMP, the GNU Image
Manipulation Program.

CVE-2010-4540
	Stack-based buffer overflow in the load_preset_response
	function in plug-ins/lighting/lighting-ui.c in the "LIGHTING
	EFFECTS > LIGHT" plugin allows user-assisted remote attackers
	to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly
	execute arbitrary code via a long Position field in a plugin
	configuration file.

CVE-2010-4541
	Stack-based buffer overflow in the loadit function in
	plug-ins/common/sphere-designer.c in the SPHERE DESIGNER
	plugin allows user-assisted remote attackers to cause a denial
	of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary
	code via a long "Number of lights" field in a plugin
	configuration file.

CVE-2010-4542
	Stack-based buffer overflow in the gfig_read_parameter_gimp_rgb
	function in in the GFIG plugin allows user-assisted remote
	attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or
	possibly execute arbitrary code via a long Foreground field in a
	plugin configuration file.

CVE-2010-4543
	Heap-based buffer overflow in the read_channel_data function in
	file-psp.c in the Paint Shop Pro (PSP) plugin allows remote
	attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or
	possibly execute arbitrary code via a PSP_COMP_RLE (aka RLE
	compression) image file that begins a long run count at the end
	of the image.

CVE-2011-1782
	The correction for CVE-2010-4543 was incomplete.

CVE-2011-2896
	The LZW decompressor in the LZWReadByte function in
	plug-ins/common/file-gif-load.c does not properly handle code
	words that are absent from the decompression table when
	encountered, which allows remote attackers to trigger an
	infinite loop or a heap-based buffer overflow, and possibly
	execute arbitrary code, via a crafted compressed stream.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.6.10-1+squeeze3.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 2.6.11-5.

We recommend that you upgrade your gimp packages.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=704512#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-05-13 14:01:00 UTC  ``` Originally Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures assigned an identifier of [CVE-2010-4543](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-4543) to the following vulnerability:  Heap-based buffer overflow in the read_channel_data function in file-psp.c in the Paint Shop Pro (PSP) plugin in GIMP 2.6.11 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a PSP_COMP_RLE (aka RLE compression) image file that begins a long run count at the end of the image. NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.  Upstream bug report: [1] <https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=639203>  Original patch proposal from Vincent Untz: [2] <https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=639203#c12>  And final patch applied by Gimp upstream was: [3] <http://git.gnome.org/browse/gimp/commit/?id=48ec15890e1751dede061f6d1f469b6508c13439>  Later it was recognized by Nils Philippsen this patch to be incomplete due the following reasoning:  I've looked at this a bit further and found that even Vincent Untz's patch didn't take into account that the code that did runlength decoding actually advances by bytespp through the buffer into which it writes, so the runcount needs to be clamped to "(endq - q) / bytespp"(*) in order that subsequent loops don't advance past the end of the buffer.  (*): This division is actually safe as bytespp is set by the plugin to one of several known values, therefore can't be 0.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=704512#c3)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-05-13 14:07:55 UTC  ``` Proposed patch from Nils Philippsen to address this problem:  diff --git a/plug-ins/common/file-psp.c b/plug-ins/common/file-psp.c index 7e620fb..9ae5395 100644 --- a/plug-ins/common/file-psp.c +++ b/plug-ins/common/file-psp.c @@ -1200,7 +1200,7 @@ read_channel_data (FILE       *f,              fread (buf, runcount, 1, f);             /* prevent buffer overflow for bogus data */ -          runcount = MIN (runcount, endq - q); +          runcount = MIN (runcount, (endq - q) / bytespp);             if (bytespp == 1)              {   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=704512#c6)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-05-13 14:38:04 UTC  ``` The CVE identifier of [CVE-2011-1782](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1782) has been assigned to this issue.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=704512#c8)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-05-23 14:42:29 UTC  ``` Created gimp tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 706939](show_bug.cgi?id=706939 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2010-4540 CVE-2010-4541 CVE-2010-4542 CVE-2010-4543 CVE-2011-1782 CVE-2010-4543 gimp various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
