Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2011-1546:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw in the `a_viewusers.php` file of Andy's PHP Knowledgebase.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The primary weakness is the lack of proper sanitization or validation of the 's' query parameter in `a_viewusers.php`. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
- Specifically, the `s` parameter is directly used in a SQL query without proper escaping or parameterization, making it susceptible to injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to perform various malicious actions on the database.
- An attacker could potentially:
    - Extract sensitive data from the database (e.g., usernames, passwords, other application data).
    - Modify or delete data within the database.
    - Potentially gain further access to the server by using database functionalities like `load_file()` to read server files (as shown in the provided exploit example), which may contain sensitive configuration files.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is via HTTP GET requests to the `a_viewusers.php` file.
- The attacker manipulates the 's' parameter in the URL to inject SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable application.
- The attacker does not require authentication. They can exploit the vulnerability without logging into the application.
- The attack can be performed remotely.

**Technical Details:**
- The specific exploit example provided is: `http://www.example.com/aphpkb/a_viewusers.php?s=1%20UNION%20SELECT%20load_file(0x2f6574632f706173737764),null,null,null,null,null,null%20limit%200`
- This exploit uses a `UNION SELECT` SQL injection technique, attempting to read the `/etc/passwd` file on the server using the `load_file()` function, and demonstrates the potential for arbitrary file access.

**Affected Software:**
- Andy's PHP Knowledgebase version 0.95.2

**Fix Information:**
- The vulnerability is addressed in version 0.95.3 and above. Users should upgrade to the latest version available

**CVSS Score:**
- The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 7.5, indicating high risk, due to the remote attack vector and potential for confidentiality, integrity, and availability impact.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vendor was notified of the vulnerability, and a patch was released shortly after.
- The vulnerability is listed as CWE-89, which is "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')."
