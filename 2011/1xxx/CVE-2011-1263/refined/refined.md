Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2011-1263:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue in Remote Desktop Web Access.
- The vulnerability is triggered by improper validation of a URL parameter in the Remote Desktop Web Access logon page.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject a client-side script into the user's instance of Internet Explorer.
- This script can:
    - Spoof content
    - Disclose information
    - Take actions the user could take on the Remote Desktop Web Access site.
- Successful exploitation could lead to elevation of privilege on the affected system.

**Attack vectors:**
- A user can be enticed to click on a malicious link, typically received via email or instant message.
- The link redirects to a specially crafted page that exploits the vulnerability in the Remote Desktop Web Access logon page.
- Compromised or user-content-accepting websites could be used to host the malicious page.
- Browsing to a malicious URL that includes script in a parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send a link to a user.
- The attacker needs to entice the user to click the malicious link.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- The attacker doesn't need to be on the same network as the victim, if the RDP web access server is exposed to the internet.

**Additional details:**
- The XSS filter in Internet Explorer 8 and 9 provides some protection when browsing in the Internet Zone, but it is not enabled by default in the Intranet Zone.
- Remote Desktop Web Access is not installed by default, requiring manual setup.
- The vulnerability affects Windows Server 2008 R2.
- Server core installations are not affected.
