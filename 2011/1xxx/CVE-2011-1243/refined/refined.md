An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user.",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to the way the ActiveX control is used in Internet Explorer, which may allow an attacker to corrupt the system state, resulting in arbitrary code execution.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Use of vulnerable ActiveX control.",
         "Improper handling of data within the ActiveX control leading to memory corruption."
      ],

      "attack_vector": "The attack vector is a specially crafted web page. An attacker could host such a page and convince a user to view it via social engineering or a compromised website.",
      "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious webpage and convince the victim to visit it using Internet Explorer."
