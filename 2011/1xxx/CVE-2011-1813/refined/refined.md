Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-1813:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a stale pointer within the extension framework of the Google Chrome browser.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stale Pointer: The core issue is the presence of a stale pointer, which refers to a memory location that has been freed or is no longer valid. Accessing this pointer can lead to unpredictable behavior and security issues.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  The provided description doesn't specify a concrete impact, but the existence of a stale pointer could potentially lead to a use-after-free condition. A successful exploit could result in:
    - Arbitrary code execution: By corrupting memory through the stale pointer, an attacker might be able to execute code.
    - Denial of service: Accessing invalid memory could cause the browser to crash.
    - Other unexpected behavior: The specific outcome can vary based on how the stale pointer is used.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is present within the extension framework. Thus, an attacker would likely need to utilize an extension or exploit a weakness within an extension to trigger the stale pointer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to influence or interact with the extension framework. This might involve:
  - Creating and distributing a malicious Chrome extension.
  - Exploiting a vulnerability within a legitimate extension.
  - Tricking a user into installing a vulnerable extension.

**Additional Details:**

- **Credit:** The vulnerability was discovered by the Google Chrome Security Team (Inferno).
- **Severity:**  The vulnerability is rated as "High" severity.
- **Fix:** The vulnerability was addressed in Chrome version 12.0.742.91.
