Based on the provided texts, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-1160:

*   **Root Cause:** Uninitialized usage of the data buffer in the TPM (Trusted Platform Module) driver within the Linux kernel. The `data_buffer` was not initialized to zero, leading to potential information leakage.

*   **Weakness:** Information Leak. The driver could expose sensitive information from kernel memory to userspace.

*   **Impact:** An attacker could potentially read sensitive information from the kernel memory.

*   **Attack Vector:** A local attacker could exploit this vulnerability via the TPM driver.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system to interact with the TPM driver.

*   **Resolution:** The vulnerability was resolved by initializing the `data_buffer` to zero using `kzalloc` instead of `kmalloc`.

*   **Affected Products (From Red Hat Bugzilla):**
    *   MRG for RHEL-6 v.2
    *   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6
    *   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5
    *   Fedora (all versions)
