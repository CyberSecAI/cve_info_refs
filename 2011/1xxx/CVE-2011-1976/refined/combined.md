# Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Microsoft Exploitability Index helps customers prioritize security update deployment by providing information on the likelihood that a vulnerability addressed in a Microsoft security update will be exploited.

## The Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Exploitability Index may help customers evaluate risk for a vulnerability. Microsoft evaluates the potential exploitability of each vulnerability associated with a Microsoft security update and then publishes the exploitability information as part of the monthly Microsoft security update details. If after publishing the details Microsoft determines that the Exploitability Index Assessment warrants a change, it will change the assessment and notify customers through technical security notifications. The company will not update the assessment when exploit code is posted that matches the existing exploitability information.

The Exploitability Index uses one of four values to communicate to customers the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited, based on the vulnerabilities addressed by the Microsoft security update.

| Exploitability index assessment | Short definition |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Exploitation detected |
| 1 | Exploitation more likely \* |
| 2 | Exploitation less likely \*\* |
| 3 | Exploitation unlikely \*\*\* |

### 0 – Exploitation Detected

Microsoft is aware of an instance of this vulnerability being exploited. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with the highest priority.

### 1 – Exploitation More Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that exploit code could be created in such a way that an attacker could consistently exploit this vulnerability. Moreover, Microsoft is aware of past instances of this type of vulnerability being exploited. This would make it an attractive target for attackers, and therefore more likely that exploits could be created. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with a higher priority.

### 2 – Exploitation Less Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that while exploit code could be created, an attacker would likely have difficulty creating the code, requiring expertise and/or sophisticated timing, and/or varied results when targeting the affected product. Moreover, Microsoft has not recently observed a trend of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the wild. This makes it a less attractive target for attackers. That said, customers who reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should still treat this as a material update. If they are prioritizing against other highly exploitable vulnerabilities, they could rank this lower in their deployment priority.

### 3 – Exploitation Unlikely

Microsoft analysis shows that successfully functioning exploit code is unlikely to be utilized in real attacks. This means that while it might be possible for exploit code to be released that could trigger the vulnerability and cause abnormal behavior, the full impact of exploitation will be more limited. Moreover, Microsoft has not observed instances of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the past. Thus, the actual risk of being exploited from this vulnerability is significantly lower. Therefore, customers who have reviewed the security update to determine its applicability within their environment could prioritize this update below other vulnerabilities within a release.

In those scenarios where multiple product series are affected, for instance a vulnerability that affects both Windows and Office, the rating reflects the highest risk level across both products. Likewise, the rating reflects the highest risk present across all versions of the product.  In this case, if the Exploitability Assessment on the latest version of Office is "1," and on the latest version of Windows is "2," the rating will reflect "1."  If the XI rating for Windows 10 version 2004 is “2” and the rating for Windows 7 is “1”, the rating will reflect “1”.

## Important Terms and Definitions

**Exploit Code** – A software program or sample code that, when executed against a vulnerable system, uses the vulnerability to spoof attacker identity, tamper with user or system information, repudiate attacker action, disclose user or system information on the server side, deny service to valid users, or elevate privileges for the attacker. For example, if a vulnerability had a security impact of remote code execution, Exploit Code could cause remote code execution to occur when run against a target system.

**Trigger a Vulnerability** – The ability to reach the vulnerable code, but not always achieving the maximum impact. For example, it may be easy to trigger a remote code execution vulnerability, but the resulting effect may only be a denial of service.

* ### What is the Microsoft Exploitability Index?

  The Microsoft Exploitability Index provides additional information to help customers prioritize their deployment of the monthly security updates. Microsoft designed this index to provide customers guidance concerning the likelihood of exploitation, based on each vulnerability addressed by Microsoft security updates.
* ### Why did Microsoft create the Exploitability Index?

  Customers asked for more information to help them prioritize their deployment of Microsoft security updates each month, specifically requesting details about the likelihood of exploitation for the vulnerabilities addressed in security updates. The Exploitability Index provides guidance about the actual risk of exploitation of a vulnerability at the time of the security update’s release.
* ### How are vulnerabilities rated?

  Microsoft Exploitability Index focuses on two aspects of a vulnerability to build its ratings:
  1. Current exploitation trends, based on telemetry data and awareness of exploitation of a particular type of vulnerability in a particular product,
  2. The cost and reliability of building a working exploit for the vulnerability, based on a technical analysis of the vulnerability.
* ### Is this a truly reliable rating system?

  While reliably predicting activity within the security ecosystem is always difficult, there are three reasons why this system should be useful. First, over the last few years we have realized that many security researchers analyze the updates associated with Microsoft's security updates the day they are released to create and evaluate protections. In doing so, many of these researchers also create exploit code to test them. The methodology used to develop this exploit code is like the one Microsoft uses to determine the likelihood of exploit code release. Microsoft analyzes the updates themselves, the nature of the vulnerability, and the conditions that must be met for an exploit to execute successfully. Second, not all vulnerabilities resolved by our security updates are exploited. A vulnerability may well be technically exploitable with a high degree of reliability, but it may never be exploited. We continuously monitor and track exploitation activity to keep up to date with current trends. This in turn informs our opinion of what constitutes a more attractive vulnerability over similar vulnerabilities, and enables us to more accurately communicate an actual risk, rather than a potential one from the vulnerabilities we patch.
  Finally, we are also partnering with protection providers through the Microsoft Active Protections Program (MAPP), working with them to help validate our predictions each month – thereby using a community approach to ensure better accuracy through information sharing.
* ### How is the Exploitability Index different from the Security Update Severity Rating system?

  The Security Update Severity Rating System assumes that exploitation will be successful. For some vulnerabilities where exploitability is high, this assumption is very likely to be true for a broad set of attackers. For other vulnerabilities where exploitability is low, this assumption may only be true when a dedicated attacker puts a lot of resources into ensuring their attack is successful. Regardless of the Severity or Exploitability Index rating, Microsoft always recommends that customers deploy all applicable and available updates; however, this rating information can assist sophisticated customers in prioritizing their approach to each month's release.
* ### How are Denial of Service, Tampering, Information Disclosure, or Spoofing issues rated?

  The Exploitability Index does not differentiate between vulnerability types. It focuses on the likelihood of exploitation of each vulnerability within the range of their full impact potential. Thus, any vulnerability, whether it is Remote Code Execution, Tampering or other, could be rated any of the Exploitability Index ratings.
* ### What happens when newly emerging information requires an update to the Exploitability Index rating?

  The ability to rate the possible exploitation of vulnerabilities is an evolving science, and new techniques for exploitation in general, or unique techniques specific to a vulnerability, or new trends in detected exploits of particular products may be discovered that could change the Exploitability Index rating. However, the goal of the Exploitability Index is to help customers prioritize those updates for the most current monthly release. Therefore, if there is information that would change an assessment released in the first month of a security release, Microsoft will update the Exploitability Index. If information becomes available in subsequent months, after most customers have made their prioritization decisions, the Exploitability Index will not be updated as it is no longer useful to the customer. When an Exploitability Index rating is corrected in a way that reflects increased risk to customers, the security update revision is incremented at a major version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 2.0). When risk is adjusted downwards, the update revision is incremented at a minor version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 1.1).
* ### How does the Exploitability Index relate to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and other rating systems?

  The Exploitability Index is separate and not related to other rating systems. However, the MSRC is a contributing member to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), and Microsoft shares its experience and customer feedback in building and releasing the Exploitability Index with the working group in order to help ensure the CVSS is effective and actionable.

## Report Viewer Controls XSS Vulnerability - CVE-2011-1976

An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the way that the Microsoft Report Viewer control improperly validates parameters within a data source. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could inject a client-side script in the user's browser. The script could then be used to spoof content or disclose sensitive information. Note that this vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code outside of the browser or to elevate their user rights directly, but it could be used to produce information that could be used to try to further compromise the affected system.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2011-1976](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-1976).

#### Mitigating Factors for Report Viewer Controls XSS Vulnerability - CVE-2011-1976

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted Web site that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the Web site. An attacker could also embed an ActiveX control marked "safe for initialization" in an application or Microsoft Office document that hosts the IE rendering engine. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These Web sites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by clicking a link in an e-mail message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site, or by opening an attachment sent through e-mail.
* The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful, a user must click on a URL that is sent in an e-mail message.
* By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd883248%28ws.10%29.aspx). This mode mitigates this vulnerability. See the FAQ section of this security update for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.
* By default, all supported versions of Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Outlook Express, and Windows Mail open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone, which disables script and ActiveX controls, helps reduce the risk of an attacker being able to use this vulnerability to execute malicious code. If a user clicks a link in an e-mail message, the user could still be vulnerable to exploitation of this vulnerability through the Web-based attack scenario.

#### Workarounds for Report Viewer Controls XSS Vulnerability - CVE-2011-1976

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to "High" to block ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting in these zones**

  You can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to block ActiveX controls and Active Scripting. You can do this by setting your browser security to High.

  To raise the browsing security level in Internet Explorer, perform the following steps:

  1. On the Internet Explorer **Tools** menu, click **Internet Options**.
  2. In the **Internet Options** dialog box, click the **Security** tab, and then click the **Internet** icon.
  3. Under **Security level for this zone**, move the slider to **High**. This sets the security level for all Web sites you visit to High.

  **Note** If no slider is visible, click **Default Level**, and then move the slider to **High**.

  **Note** Setting the level to High may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the security setting set to High.

  **Impact of workaround.** There are side effects to blocking ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX or Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX Controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Blocking ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. If you do not want to block ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting for such sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone".

  **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**

  After you set Internet Explorer to block ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect yourself from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, perform the following steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this Web site to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are **\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com** and **\*.update.microsoft.com**. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.
* **Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone**

  You can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone. To do this, perform the following steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Internet Options** on the **Tools** menu.
  2. Click the **Security** tab.
  3. Click **Internet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  4. Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click \*\*Prompt \*\*or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  5. Click **Local intranet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  6. Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click \*\*Prompt \*\*or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  7. Click **OK** two times to return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Disabling Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zones may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly.

  **Impact of workaround.** There are side effects to prompting before running Active Scripting. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use Active Scripting to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click **Yes** to run Active Scripting. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone".

  **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**

  After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, perform the following steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this Web site to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are **\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com** and **\*.update.microsoft.com**. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.

#### FAQ for Report Viewer Controls XSS Vulnerability - CVE-2011-1976

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

There is an information disclosure vulnerability due to a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run client-side script on behalf of a user. The script could then be used to spoof content or disclose sensitive information.

**What is reflected cross-site scripting (XSS)?**

A reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) is a class of security vulnerabilities that can enable an attacker to inject script into the response to a Web page request. This script is then run by the requesting application, often times a Web browser. The script could then spoof content or disclose sensitive information.

**What is the difference between stored and reflected XSS?**

A stored XSS is on a static page or pulled from a database and displayed to the user directly. A reflected XSS comes from the user in the form of a request (usually constructed by an attacker), and then gets run in the victimâs browser when the results are returned from the site.

**What is the Microsoft Report Viewer Control?**

Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 includes report design functionality and ReportViewer controls so that you can add full-featured reports to custom applications. Reports may contain tabular, aggregated, and multidimensional data. ReportViewer controls are provided so that you can process and display the report in your application. There are two versions of the control. The ReportViewer Web server control is used to host reports in ASP.NET projects. The ReportViewer Windows Forms control is used to host reports in Windows application projects. For more information, see the MSDN article, ReportViewer Controls.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could inject a client-side script in the user's browser. The script could then be used to spoof content or disclose sensitive information.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

In order for an attack to be successful, a user would have to click on an attacker-provided, specially crafted link to an affected server.

In an e-mail attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending an e-mail message containing the specially crafted link to the user of the targeted affected server and by convincing the user to click on the specially crafted link.

In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a specially crafted link to the targeted affected server that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to convince them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes them to the attacker's Web site, and then convince them to click on the specially crafted link.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**I am running Internet Explorer for Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, or Windows Server 2008 R2. Does this mitigate this vulnerability?**

Yes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd883248%28ws.10%29.aspx). Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured settings in Internet Explorer that can reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running specially crafted Web content on a server. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the manner in which the Microsoft Report Viewer control validates parameters within a data source.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability** **was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

## Penetration Testing Services

We deliver proactive identification and exploitation of vulnerabilities across applications and networks to produce actionable guidance to improve your security posture.

[Talk to Our Team](/en/contact-us)

#### What is Penetration Testing?

Penetration Testing â also known as pen testing â evaluates the security controls of applications and infrastructure using the same tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) that attackers may use to identify and exploit vulnerabilities. The objective of testing is to identify vulnerabilities and deviations from security best practices that can result in unauthorized access and compromise of sensitive data or systems. Results from testing are provided to clients with action points to help improve the overall security posture and harden environments against attack.

#### Penetration Testing: The Why and When

Explore the research and data points below to learn more about why penetration testing can be an important value-add for organizations at time of rising cyber security risk:

Applications, networks and employees create a significant attack surface for an organizationâs environment. More recently, with the increasing adoption of a remote workforce and new technologies, including cloud computing, the Internet of Things and blockchain, the attack surface has significantly grown at many businesses. It is critical that organizations perform penetration testing to help identify vulnerabilities and deviations from best practices.

#### How Aon Can Help

* ###### Application Penetration Testing

  Application Penetration Testing helps an organization determine whether their websites, APIs, thick clients and other custom applications are resilient to application-specific attacks and vulnerabilities, including those outlined in the OWASP Top Ten, OWASP Code Review Guide, CWE/SANS Top 25 Most Dangerous Software Errors and others.

  Manual penetration testing techniques are supplemented with a blend of tools and methodologies â proprietary, open-source and commercial â to help identify vulnerabilities within applications. Testing is performed from the perspective of both unauthenticated and authenticated users across various application roles. Our testing services include:

  **Dynamic Application Penetration Testing.** The Aon team tests a running instance of an application for vulnerabilities including:

  + Injection vulnerabilities (cross-site scripting, SQL injection, command injection, etc.)
  + Sensitive data exposure and cryptographic failures
  + Broken access control
  + Authentication failures
  + Security misconfigurations
  + Vulnerable and outdated components
  + Security logging and monitoring failures
  + Application / business logic flaws

  **Secure Code Review.** The Aon team reviews source code and configurations of web and mobile applications, APIs, thick clients, firmware, operating systems and more. Our methodology incorporates checks using a variety of industry standards and best practices. When a vulnerability is identified, the codebase is searched for additional occurrences and similar patterns. Secure code reviews can help organizations identify systemic security vulnerabilities and root causes in source code developed during the software development lifecycle (SDLC), enabling development teams to catch vulnerabilities sooner, before they are exploited by attackers.

  **Hybrid Application Penetration Testing.** This is a combination of Dynamic Application Penetration Testing and Secure Code Review techniques. Clients benefit from having both a live running instance of the application to develop proof-of-concept exploits and source code to pinpoint root causes. These assessments allow for broader and deeper coverage â along with a higher degree of confidence in the vulnerabilities discovered.
* ###### Mobile Penetration Testing

  Aon performs Mobile Penetration Testing for iOS and Android devices and applications. This testing is guided by the OWASP Mobile Top 10 and extends Aonâs Application Penetration Testing methodology. Mobile application penetration testing activities include identifying vulnerabilities in server-side APIs that the mobile applications communicate with, as well as identifying client-side vulnerabilities in the mobile applications themselves (e.g., improper use of mobile platform security controls, insecure storage of sensitive data on the mobile device, weak client-side security controls, etc.). Aon can employ a combination of static and dynamic analysis using manual testing techniques supplemented by proprietary, open-source and commercial tools.
* ###### Network Penetration Testing

  Network Penetration Testing focuses on identifying vulnerabilities within different types of networks and scenarios:

  **External Network Penetration Testing.** This testing focuses on internet-facing infrastructure, hosts, services and applications. Our team can simulate an attacker aiming to breach perimeter controls and gain access to the internal network and sensitive information.

  **Internal Network Penetration Testing.** This testing simulates an attacker who has already gained access and is moving laterally within the network. It evaluates how well security controls impede internal movement. While many organizations focus on hardening the external perimeter, most attacks originate from phishing, insider threats, zero-day exploits or other attacks that bypass external security controls to gain access to the internal network. Results from internal penetration testing help harden the internal environment to aid in defending against such attacks.

  **Wireless Network Penetration Testing.** This testing is designed to evaluate networks for both common and sophisticated wireless security vulnerabilities, including access point discovery, RF signal range testing, traffic analysis, vulnerability profiling, vulnerability exploitation, rogue device detection, encryption evaluation, weak authentication methods and insecure configurations.

  **Network Device Security Review.** This review includes analyzing the configuration of firewalls, routers and switches used in the network to validate secure configurations of authentication protocols, password strength, routing rules, VLAN security, security zones and more.
* ###### Cloud Security Services

  Cloud Security Services from Aon aim to help evaluate an organizationsâ cloud environments that are hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). Aon can provide an open-box assessment where configurations for the platformâs microservices are audited to help identify vulnerabilities, and prioritized recommendations are provided for hardening the cloud environment. Additionally, the impact of certain misconfigurations can be evaluated through proof-of-concept exploits during Network Penetration Testing. Aonâs methodology aligns with industry standard best practices including platform-specific recommendations, CIS Benchmarks, NIST and others.
* ###### Social Engineering

  Social engineering attacks target the human factor in an organizationâs overall security posture, making employees the primary target. These attacks use psychological manipulation to deceive employees into divulging sensitive information, granting unauthorized access, or taking actions that may compromise the organizationâs security. Social Engineering testing evaluates an organization's susceptibility to these types of attacks. By identifying weaknesses in security defenses and employee awareness, this can help to build a more robust security posture and reduce the risk of a breach or incident.

  To combat the persistent risk of social engineering attacks, realistic campaigns can be created in collaboration with clients to improve employee cyber awareness and organizational security controls:

  **Phishing.** Aon performs real-life phishing campaigns targeting high-value employees. These campaigns help to evaluate the willingness of employees to provide sensitive information on a look-alike website, open malicious attachments or run malware.

  **Vishing (voice phishing).** Campaigns that include vishing incorporate techniques, such as spoofed caller ID, automated recordings and live calls, with the intent of coercing employees to divulge sensitive information or grant unauthorized access.

  **Physical Penetration Testing.** Aon simulates an onsite attacker attempting to gain physical access to high-value targets such as corporate offices, manufacturing facilities or data centers. This type of assessment evaluates covert entry and tailgating possibilities, badge cloning attacks and social engineering attacks to gain access to restricted areas. Once inside, activities can include identifying high value and sensitive locations, unlocked computers, network access, paths to confidential data or other predefined goals. By evaluating an organizationâs detection and response to such scenarios, it is possible to better identify weaknesses in physical security controls, such as access control systems, physical barriers, surveillance coverage and security personnel.
* ###### Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Security Testing

  Blockchain and cryptocurrency are relatively new technologies at most organizations and assessing their security requires a highly technical team with diverse knowledge and skills. The Aon team can customize a clientâs Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Security Testing which includes these elements:

  **Blockchain application review.** This review assesses the software holistically by employing a combination of web application security testing, network penetration testing, cloud and host configuration review and security source code review. Special attention is given to components that communicate with blockchain networks or wallets (e.g., a web API that communicates with a hot wallet) and custom test cases can be crafted to reflect the design.

  **Cryptocurrency custody assessment.** This service can measure an organizationâs ability to safely store and move cryptocurrency using custom threat modeling exercises and technical testing. The Aon team can hold workshops with the client team, conduct one-on-one interviews with key business stakeholders, analyze technical documentation and review the implementation of hot and cold storage. This allows Aon to better outline a detailed inventory and profile of custodial assets and further help to identify associated potential risks of accidental loss, insider threats and external compromise.

  **Custom blockchain review.** This review assesses the security of a custom blockchain solution â either built from scratch or using popular frameworks such as HyperLedger Fabric and Cosmos SDK. The Aon team uses a variety of manual and automated security code review methodologies and tools.

  **Smart contract code review.** Using Aonâs proprietary, industry-proven methodologies and tools, smart contracts can be evaluated for potential security vulnerabilities and deviations from best practices. The Aon team can identify obscure weaknesses and the lines of code where security flaws may occur. By using techniques such as fuzzing and symbolic execution, Aon can verify the correctness of smart contracts to a degree that traditional security source code reviews cannot. Aon works to help identify smart contractsâ key invariants â properties that should not be violated â and write formal tests to help validate them.
