Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-1976:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the Microsoft Report Viewer control improperly validating parameters within a data source.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Specifically, a reflected XSS vulnerability exists due to improper parameter validation. This allows an attacker to inject client-side scripts into a user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: An attacker can potentially use the injected script to spoof content or disclose sensitive information.
- Client-Side Script Execution: Successful exploitation allows arbitrary client-side script to run within the user's browser.
- Potential for Further Compromise: While direct code execution outside the browser or privilege escalation isn't possible, the information obtained could be used to further compromise the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Web-based Attack: An attacker can host a specially crafted web page designed to exploit the vulnerability. They would then need to convince the user to visit the malicious page.
- Email Attack: An attacker can send a crafted email containing a link to the malicious page. The user must click the link for the attack to succeed.
- Compromised Websites: Attackers can inject malicious content into compromised websites or websites that allow user-generated content, which will trigger the vulnerability on the affected client visiting it.
- Active X Control: An attacker can embed a malicious ActiveX control marked "safe for initialization" in an application or MS Office document hosting the IE rendering engine, exploiting the vulnerability by having the user open it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create a specially crafted URL/link.
- The attacker needs to be able to host a webpage or send an email containing the malicious URL.
- The attacker needs to convince the user to visit the crafted URL/link. The attacker cannot force a user to visit the malicious page.
