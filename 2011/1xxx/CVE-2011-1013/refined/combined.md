| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=679925#c0)  Petr Matousek    2011-02-23 21:21:40 UTC  ``` Description: It has been found that drm_modeset_ctl() did not properly validate input parameters. The issue is that the crtc variable there is signed. So a large enough value passed in the modeset parameter structure will be treated as negative, escaping the check for proper range later. This variable is later used as an index variable effectively allowing out of bounds writes of zero integers.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=679925#c3)  Petr Matousek    2011-02-23 21:24:51 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 480579](attachment.cgi?id=480579&action=diff "OpenBSD proposed patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=480579&action=edit "OpenBSD proposed patch") OpenBSD proposed patch   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=679925#c4)  Petr Matousek    2011-02-23 21:29:09 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect the versions of the Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5 as they did not include the affected functionality. A future update in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG may address this flaw.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=679925#c6)  Petr Matousek    2011-02-23 22:47:09 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 480596](attachment.cgi?id=480596&action=diff "Linux proposed patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=480596&action=edit "Linux proposed patch") Linux proposed patch   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=679925#c7)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2011-02-24 06:17:48 UTC  ``` <http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/sys/dev/pci/drm/drm_irq.c.diff?r1=1.41;r2=1.42;f=h>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=679925#c9)  Petr Matousek    2011-04-11 08:55:06 UTC  ``` Upstream commit: <http://git.kernel.org/linus/1922756124ddd53846877416d92ba4a802bc658f>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=679925#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-05-10 17:20:30 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    MRG for RHEL-5  Via RHSA-2011:0500 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0500.html>   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=679925#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-05-10 18:11:36 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2011:0498 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0498.html>   ``` |  |
