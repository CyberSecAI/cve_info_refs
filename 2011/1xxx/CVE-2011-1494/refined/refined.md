Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-1494:

**1. Root cause of vulnerability:**
   - The root cause is an integer overflow vulnerability within the `_ctl_do_mpt_command` function of the `mpt2sas` driver in the Linux kernel. This function uses a user-supplied length value without proper bounds checking, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.

**2. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
   - **Heap-based buffer overflow:** The primary weakness is the lack of validation of user-supplied length values used in memory allocation, leading to a heap buffer overflow.
   - **Integer overflow:** The vulnerability is triggered by providing a length value that results in an integer overflow before memory allocation.

**3. Impact of exploitation:**
   - **Privilege escalation:** A local user could exploit this vulnerability to gain elevated privileges.
   - **Denial of service (DoS):** Exploitation could lead to memory corruption, causing a denial of service condition, system crash or hang.

**4. Attack vectors:**
   - **Local access:** The attack vector requires local access to the `/dev/mpt2sas` device file, which is created by the kernel with `root-root 660` permissions. However, this file may have more open permissions in live systems.
   - **Crafted ioctl calls:** An attacker needs to use crafted `ioctl` calls specifying a malicious length value that will trigger the integer overflow and resulting heap overflow.

**5. Required attacker capabilities/position:**
   - **Local, unprivileged user access:** The attacker needs to have access to the system as an unprivileged user.
   - **Device file access:** The attacker needs to have access to read and write on the `/dev/mpt2sas` device file.

**Additional information from the provided content:**

*   The vulnerability affects the `mpt2sas` driver, specifically in versions prior to Linux kernel 2.6.39.
*   The vulnerability is described in multiple sources such as openwall, RedHat and SUSE security advisories.
*   Red Hat identified the vulnerability as "important" and assigned a CVSS score of 6.9, while SUSE rated the issue as "moderate" with a CVSS base score of 6.9
*   Patches were released to address this vulnerability in various Linux distributions and their associated products (e.g. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6 and MRG; SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, etc).

**Summary:**

CVE-2011-1494 represents a critical security flaw in the Linux kernel's `mpt2sas` driver, allowing local attackers to achieve privilege escalation and denial of service through a heap-based buffer overflow. Successful exploitation requires local access to a specific device file and the ability to craft specific `ioctl` calls.
