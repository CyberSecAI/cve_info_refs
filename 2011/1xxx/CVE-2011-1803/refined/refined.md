{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability occurs because when a SMIL (Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language) element is removed, it is not properly removed from the target's animation elements list. This leads to a dangling pointer.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free",
      "Dangling pointer"
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability could lead to a crash when attempting to access a removed SMIL element in the animated elements list.",
    "attack_vectors": "The specific attack vector involves manipulating the SVG animation such that a SMIL element is removed, and then the code attempts to access the removed element, resulting in a crash.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to manipulate the SVG document, specifically the removal of SMIL animation elements."
