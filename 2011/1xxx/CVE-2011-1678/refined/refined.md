Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-1678:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The content directly relates to CVE-2011-1678. Multiple sources, including the Red Hat Bugzilla entry (Bug 688980) and the oss-security mailing list discussions, explicitly mention this CVE ID in the context of issues with mount helpers and their handling of RLIMIT_FSIZE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The core issue stems from the `addmntent()` function in glibc not reporting errors when it fails to write the full contents to `/etc/mtab` due to resource limits (specifically, `RLIMIT_FSIZE`). This allows for a local user to truncate writes to `/etc/mtab` by setting a low `RLIMIT_FSIZE` value.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incomplete Write Handling:** The `addmntent()` function in glibc returns success even if the write to `/etc/mtab` is truncated due to exceeding `RLIMIT_FSIZE`.
*   **Lack of Error Handling in Mount Helpers:** Several suid mount helpers (like `mount.cifs`, `ncpmount`, and `vmware-hgfsmounter`) directly edit `/etc/mtab` or a temporary file without properly checking the return code of `addmntent()` or handling failures.
*   **Direct Editing of /etc/mtab:** Some mount helpers directly edit `/etc/mtab` instead of a temporary file. This can lead to corruption of the file if the process is terminated mid-write.
*   **Inadequate Temporary File Handling:** Some helpers use temporary files but don't handle errors properly, potentially leading to additional corruption or leaving stale lockfiles.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **`/etc/mtab` Corruption:** An unprivileged user can corrupt `/etc/mtab` by repeatedly invoking a vulnerable mount helper with a small `RLIMIT_FSIZE`. The truncated writes will append to the file without newlines which can lead to malformed entries.
*   **Mount Point Manipulation:** With creative manipulation of the truncated output, attackers could potentially modify mount options, leading to unauthorized unmounting, remounting with different options, or other malicious activities.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Suid Mount Helpers:** The attack involves invoking suid mount helpers that use the vulnerable `addmntent()` function (or a similar implementation) and directly edit `/etc/mtab` or a temporary file without proper error checking.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unprivileged User:** An unprivileged user can exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Ability to Set Resource Limits:** The attacker must be able to set resource limits, specifically RLIMIT_FSIZE.
*   **Access to vulnerable suid mount helpers:**  The user must be able to invoke the vulnerable mount helpers.

**Summary of Affected Software:**

The following software was identified as being affected:

*   `mount.cifs` (samba)
*   `mount` (util-linux)
*   `ncpmount` (ncpfs)
*   `vmware-hgfsmounter` (open-vm-tools)
*   `umount` variants of the above

**Additional Notes:**
*  The initial proposed solution was to fix glibc to either raise the rlimit or correctly handle the error condition
*  The final fix was to have glibc's addmntent return an error on truncated writes and have the mount helpers properly handle this return value. Additionally, mount helpers were modified to write to temp files and handle errors, lockfiles, and temp files
*  Some discussions on replacing `/etc/mtab` with a symlink to `/proc/mounts` came up, but this was not feasible because /proc/mounts does not store user mount options.
