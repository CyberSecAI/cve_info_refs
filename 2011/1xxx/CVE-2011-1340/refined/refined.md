Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-1340:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of this vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue present in Plone, an open source content management system (CMS). The specific location or method of the vulnerability is not detailed beyond the fact that it occurs "at rendering".

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary vulnerability is Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This means the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before displaying it on a webpage.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary scripts within the web browser of a logged-in user. This can lead to various malicious activities, such as:
* Stealing cookies or session tokens
* Defacing the website
* Redirecting the user to malicious sites
* Performing actions on behalf of the victim

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the network, meaning the attacker can exploit this vulnerability over the internet via network packets. The vulnerability does not require any authentication and is triggered by user interaction. The user needs to be convinced to perform a standard action (e.g., click a link or view a file). The action, however, must be difficult or suspicious for the exploit to be successful.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker can be remote (over the internet).
*   The attacker does not need prior authentication.
*   The attacker needs to convince the user to interact with a malicious link or file.
*   The exploit is considered complex because the user must take a somewhat suspicious action.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability affects Plone versions 2.5.2 and earlier.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Daiki Fukumori of Cyber Defense Institute, Inc.
*   The issue has been resolved in Plone version 2.5.3.
*   The vulnerability is tracked under JVNDB-2011-000056.
*  The CVSS v2 score is 2.6, which is considered low, but the JPCERT analysis considers the severity as High, due to network accessibility.
