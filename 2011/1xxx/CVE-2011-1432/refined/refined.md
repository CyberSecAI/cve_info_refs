{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by the switch from plaintext to TLS being implemented below the application's I/O buffering layer.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "STARTTLS command injection vulnerability: Some STARTTLS implementations do not properly clear the application's I/O buffer when switching from a plaintext connection to an encrypted TLS or SSL connection. This allows for command injection."
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker with the ability to pose as a man-in-the-middle may be able to inject commands for the corresponding protocol (e.g., SMTP, POP3, etc.) during the plaintext protocol phase, that will then be executed during the ciphertext protocol phase.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-middle attack"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify network traffic between a client and server using STARTTLS."
