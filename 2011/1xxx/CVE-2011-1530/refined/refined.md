{
  "CVE-2011-1530": {
    "Official Description": "PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval",
    "Root cause": "The KDC can crash due to a null pointer dereference in code that handles TGS requests. Specifically, the `process_tgs_req()` function in the KDC improperly handles errors returned by the `find_alternate_tgs()` function, resulting in a null pointer dereference when trying to access a server principal.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper error handling in `process_tgs_req()`. ",
      "Logic flaw in `process_tgs_req()` which does not validate the server variable after `find_alternate_tgs()` returns a non-`KRB5_KDB_NOENTRY` error."
    ],
    "Impact": "An authenticated remote attacker can crash a KDC via null pointer dereference, leading to denial of service.",
    "Attack vectors": "Network-based attack. An attacker needs to send a crafted TGS request to the KDC.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker must have valid Kerberos credentials for the target realm to authenticate with the KDC before triggering the vulnerability. The vulnerability is triggered in the handling of TGS requests, which requires prior authentication to even reach that point.",
    "Additional Details": "The vulnerability exists in krb5-1.9 and later releases due to interface changes in the `krb5_db_get_principal()` function which led to flaws in the error handling logic within `process_tgs_req()` when handling errors from `find_alternate_tgs()`."
