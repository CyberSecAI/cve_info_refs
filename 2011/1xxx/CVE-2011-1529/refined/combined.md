## Multiple MIT KRB5 KDC daemon vulnerabilities

#### Vulnerability Note VU#659251

Original Release Date: 2011-10-24 | Last Revised: 2011-10-24

### Overview

MIT's KRB5 KDC version 1.8 and 1.9 contain multiple vulnerabilities.

### Description

| The MIT krb5 [Security Advisory 2011-006](http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/advisories/MITKRB5-SA-2011-006.txt) states:  *CVE-2011-1527: In releases krb5-1.9 and later, the KDC can crash due to a null pointer dereference if configured to use the LDAP back end. A trigger condition is publicly known but not known to be widely circulated.CVE-2011-1528: In releases krb5-1.8 and later, the KDC can crash due to an assertion failure. No exploit is known to exist, but there is public evidence that the unidentified trigger condition occurs in the field.CVE-2011-1529: In releases krb5-1.8 and later, the KDC can crash due to a null pointer dereference. No exploit is known to exist.**CVE-2011-4151: In releases krb5-1.8 through krb5-1.8.4, the KDC can crash due to an assertion failure if configured to use the Berkeley DB ("db2") back end.* |

SUMMARY
=======
CVE-2011-1527: In releases krb5-1.9 and later, the KDC can crash due
to a null pointer dereference if configured to use the LDAP back end.
A trigger condition is publicly known.
CVE-2011-1528: In releases krb5-1.8 and later, the KDC can crash due
to an assertion failure if configured to use the LDAP back end. No
exploit is known to exist, but there is public evidence that the
unidentified trigger condition occurs in the field.
CVE-2011-1529: In releases krb5-1.8 and later, the KDC can crash due
to a null pointer dereference. No exploit is known to exist.
CVE-2011-4151: In releases krb5-1.8 through krb5-1.8.4, the KDC can
crash due to an assertion failure if configured to use the Berkeley DB
("db2") back end.
IMPACT
======
CVE-2011-1527: An unauthenticated remote attacker can crash a KDC
daemon via null pointer dereference if the KDC is configured to use
the LDAP back end. (This is not the default configuration.)
CVE-2011-1528: An unauthenticated remote attacker can crash a KDC
daemon via assertion failure if the KDC is configured to use
the LDAP back end. (This is not the default configuration.).
CVE-2011-1529: An unauthenticated remote attacker can crash a KDC
daemon via null pointer dereference.
CVE-2011-4151: An unauthenticated remote attacker can crash a KDC
daemon via assertion failure if the KDC is configured to use the
Berkeley DB ("db2") back end.
AFFECTED SOFTWARE
=================
\* The KDC in krb5-1.9 and later is vulnerable to CVE-2011-1527 when
configured with the LDAP back end. Earlier releases had different
code that masked this bug and did not crash under these conditions.
\* The KDC in krb5-1.8 and later is vulnerable to CVE-2011-1528 when
configured with the LDAP back end.
\* The KDC in krb5-1.8 and later is vulnerable to CVE-2011-1529 when
configured with either the Berkeley DB ("db2") or the LDAP back end.
\* The KDC in krb5-1.8 through krb5-1.8.4 is vulnerable to
CVE-2011-4151 when configured with the Berkeley DB ("db2") back end.
Releases krb5-1.9 and later no longer have the assertion in the db2
back and are not vulnerable.
FIXES
=====
\* Workaround: restart the KDC when it crashes, possibly using an
automated monitoring process.
\* An upcoming release in the krb5-1.9.x series will fix CVE-2011-1527.
\* Upcoming releases in the krb5-1.8.x and krb5-1.9.x series will fix
CVE-2011-1528 and CVE-2011-1529.
\* An upcoming release in the krb5-1.8.x series will fix CVE-2011-4151.
\* The patch for krb5-1.9.x is available at
http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/advisories/2011-006-patch.txt
A PGP-signed patch is available at
http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/advisories/2011-006-patch.txt.asc

DETAILS
=======
CVE-2011-1527: null pointer dereference in KDC LDAP back end
Under certain error conditions, krb5\_ldap\_get\_principal() in the KDC
LDAP back end can return success yet leave the client principal entry
as a null pointer. Subsequently executed code attempts to dereference
this null pointer.
CVE-2011-1528: assertion failure in KDC LDAP back end
In the KDC LDAP back end in releases krb5-1.8 and later,
krb5\_ldap\_lockout\_audit() calls assert() with an expression that could
be false under as-yet unidentified conditions. There is a report that
the assertion failure occurs in the field, but there is insufficient
information to identify the actual vector. The related vulnerability
in the db2 back end is CVE-2011-4151.
CVE-2011-1529: null pointer dereference in multiple KDC back ends
In releases krb5-1.8 and later, lookup\_lockout\_policy() in both the
Berkeley DB ("db2") and LDAP KDC back ends fails to check that the
principal entry pointer is non-null prior to dereferencing it. This
can happen if an error condition such as KRB5KDC\_ERR\_PREAUTH\_FAILED or
KRB5KRB\_AP\_ERR\_BAD\_INTEGRITY occurs in process\_as\_req() before it
retrieves the principal database entry for the requested client.
CVE-2011-4151: assertion failure in KDC db2 back end
In the KDC Berkeley DB ("db2") back end in releases krb5-1.8 through
krb5-1.8.4, krb5\_db2\_lockout\_audit() calls assert() with an expression
that could be false under as-yet unidentified conditions. The db2
back end no longer has this assertion in releases krb5-1.9 and later,
and is therefore not vulnerable. The related vulnerability in the
LDAP back end is CVE-2011-1528.

An update that fixes three vulnerabilities is now available.
Description:
The following issues have been fixed:
- CVE-2011-1528: In releases krb5-1.8 and later, the KDC
can crash due to an assertion failure.
- CVE-2011-1529: In releases krb5-1.8 and later, the KDC
can crash due to a null pointer dereference.
Both bugs could be triggered by unauthenticated remote
attackers. Additionally CVE-2011-1526 was fixed that
allowed authenticated users to access files via krb5 ftpd
they should not have access to.
