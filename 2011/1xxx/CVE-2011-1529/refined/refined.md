Based on the provided documents, here's the breakdown of CVE-2011-1529:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A null pointer dereference in the `lookup_lockout_policy()` function within the Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC) code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The code in the Berkeley DB ("db2") and LDAP KDC backends does not check if the principal entry pointer is non-null before dereferencing it.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The KDC daemon crashes, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS).

**Attack vectors:**
-  An unauthenticated remote attacker can trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to send requests that lead to an error condition during `process_as_req()` before the client's principal entry is retrieved (e.g.,  `KRB5KDC_ERR_PREAUTH_FAILED` or `KRB5KRB_AP_ERR_BAD_INTEGRITY`). This causes the principal entry pointer to be null.
- No specific attacker position is required, as the attack can be done remotely over a network.

**Additional Details:**
- This vulnerability affects krb5 versions 1.8 and later.
- Both the Berkeley DB ("db2") and LDAP KDC backends are susceptible to this issue.
- The vulnerability can be triggered if an error condition such as KRB5KDC_ERR_PREAUTH_FAILED or KRB5KRB_AP_ERR_BAD_INTEGRITY occurs in process_as_req() before it retrieves the principal database entry for the requested client.
- There is no known exploit for this specific vulnerability, but it is known to be triggered.
- Patches have been made available for krb5-1.8.x and krb5-1.9.x.
- The vulnerability can be mitigated by restarting the KDC when it crashes, possibly using an automated monitoring process.
