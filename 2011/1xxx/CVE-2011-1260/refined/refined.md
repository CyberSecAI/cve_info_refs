Based on the provided information, here's a summary of the vulnerability described in CVE-2011-1260:

*   **Title:** Layout Memory Corruption Vulnerability
*   **Affected Software:** Internet Explorer
*   **Vulnerability:** A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Internet Explorer accesses an object that has not been correctly initialized or has been deleted.
*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability occurs when Internet Explorer attempts to access a memory object that has already been freed or was never properly initialized.
*   **Weakness:** Use-after-free condition leading to memory corruption.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the security context of the currently logged-on user. This could lead to complete system compromise if the user has administrative privileges.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker could host a specially crafted website that exploits the vulnerability when viewed in Internet Explorer. Alternatively, compromised websites or those hosting user-provided content/advertisements could also be used. The attacker needs to convince the user to visit the malicious website (e.g., through phishing links).
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs the ability to host a specially crafted website and lure victims to visit it.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Enable Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration on Windows Servers.
    *   Configure Internet Explorer to block ActiveX controls and Active Scripting, or to prompt before running them.

The provided Metasploit module information offers additional technical details regarding exploitation, including target-specific memory addresses and techniques like heap spraying and Return-Oriented Programming (ROP) to bypass security mitigations like DEP.
