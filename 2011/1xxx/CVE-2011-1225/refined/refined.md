Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2011-1225:

**1. Verification of Relevance:**

*   The provided content from `docs.microsoft.com` explicitly mentions CVE-2011-1225 as part of Microsoft Security Bulletin MS11-034.
*   The content from `support.avaya.com` references the same Microsoft Security Bulletin (MS11-034) and lists CVE-2011-1225 as one of the vulnerabilities addressed.
*   The content from `www.us-cert.gov` refers to Microsoft Security Bulletin MS11-034 which addresses multiple vulnerabilities, including CVE-2011-1225

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a **Win32k Null Pointer De-reference Vulnerability**.
*   It is caused by the way that Windows kernel-mode drivers manage pointers to kernel-mode driver objects. Specifically, improper handling of pointers can lead to a null pointer dereference.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Null Pointer De-reference:** The core weakness is a failure to properly validate pointers before they are used. This allows for a null pointer to be dereferenced which results in a crash.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Elevation of Privilege:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to run arbitrary code in kernel mode.
*   **Full System Control:** Once in kernel mode, the attacker can gain complete control of the system, including the ability to install programs, view, change, or delete data, and create new accounts with full administrative rights.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access Required:** The attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to the affected system.
*   **Specially Crafted Application:** The attacker must run a specially crafted application that triggers the vulnerability.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Valid Logon Credentials:** The attacker needs to have a valid user account on the target system.
*   **Local Access:**  The attacker must be able to log on to the system directly, or through remote access.
*   **Ability to Run Programs:** The attacker needs to be able to execute arbitrary programs.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

*   **Affected Systems:** The vulnerability affects various versions of Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2.
*  **Mitigation:** The vulnerability cannot be exploited remotely or by anonymous users.
*   **Patching:** Microsoft has released a security update to address this vulnerability. The update corrects the way kernel-mode drivers keep track of pointers to kernel-mode driver objects.
*   The vulnerability is addressed in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS11-034

**Summary:**

CVE-2011-1225 is a critical vulnerability that could allow a local attacker to gain full control of the system by exploiting a null pointer dereference in Windows kernel-mode drivers.
