  "cveId": "CVE-2011-1005",
  "description": "Ruby Exception methods can bypass $SAFE",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": [
    {
      "rootCause": "The `Exception#to_s` method in Ruby can be used to bypass the `$SAFE` level security mechanism.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The `Exception#to_s` method can destructively modify an untainted string to a tainted one.",
        "The safe level mechanism can be tricked by this method."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can modify arbitrary untainted strings by using the `Exception#to_s` method within an untrusted code block (safe level 4). This can lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.",
       "attackVectors": [
         "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by creating a new exception object with an untainted string, and call `to_s` within the scope of $SAFE=4."
       ],
      "requiredCapabilities": "Ability to execute Ruby code with a safe level of 4."
    }
