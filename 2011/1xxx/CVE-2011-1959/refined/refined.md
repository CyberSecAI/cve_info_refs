Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-1959:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   A stack-based buffer over-read occurs in Wireshark when processing snoop capture files. This is related to how Wireshark manages testy, virtualizable buffers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stack-based buffer over-read:** The vulnerability stems from improper handling of buffers on the stack, leading to a potential read beyond the allocated memory.
*   **Improper Input Validation:** The snoop file format parser does not adequately check for malformed or corrupted data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Application Crash (Denial of Service):** Exploiting this vulnerability leads to a crash of the Wireshark application. 
*   **Potential for further exploitation (unspecified):** While primarily a crash, the possibility of further exploitation isn't explicitly ruled out in some of the documents.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Capture File:** An attacker crafts a malicious snoop capture file.
*  **User Interaction:** The victim must open the crafted capture file in Wireshark to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **File Creation:** An attacker needs to be able to create or modify a snoop capture file.
*   **Social Engineering or File Transfer:** The attacker needs a way to deliver the malicious snoop file to the victim, typically by convincing the user to open the file.
* **No Network Access Needed**: The vulnerability is triggered by opening the file locally, therefore no network access is needed.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to the snoop capture file format.
*   Versions of Wireshark from 1.2.0 to 1.2.16 and 1.4.0 to 1.4.6 are affected.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Huzaifa Sidhpurwala of the Red Hat Security Response Team.
*   The vulnerability can be triggered via a local, unsuspecting user.
*  The issue was resolved in Wireshark versions 1.2.17 and 1.4.7.
