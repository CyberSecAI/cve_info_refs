## Details

### Description

Wireshark 1.2.17 fixes the following vulnerabilities:

* Large/infinite loop in the DICOM dissector.

  ([Bug
  5876](https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=5876))

  Versions affected: 1.2.0 to 1.2.16 and 1.4.0 to 1.4.6.

    that a corrupted Diameter dictionary file could crash Wireshark.

    Versions affected: 1.2.0 to 1.2.16 and 1.4.0 to 1.4.6.
    [CVE-2011-1958](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-1958)* Huzaifa Sidhpurwala of the Red Hat Security Response Team discovered
      that a corrupted snoop file could crash Wireshark.

      ([Bug
      5912](https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=5912))

      Versions affected: 1.2.0 to 1.2.16 and 1.4.0 to 1.4.6.
      [CVE-2011-1959](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-1959)* David Maciejak of Fortinet's FortiGuard Labs discovered that
        malformed compressed capture data could crash Wireshark.

        ([Bug
        5908](https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=5908))

        Versions affected: 1.2.0 to 1.2.16 and 1.4.0 to 1.4.6.
        [CVE-2011-2174](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-2174)* Huzaifa Sidhpurwala of the Red Hat Security Response Team discovered
          that a corrupted Visual Networks file could crash Wireshark.

          ([Bug
          5934](https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=5934))

          Versions affected: 1.2.0 to 1.2.16 and 1.4.0 to 1.4.6.
          [CVE-2011-2175](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-2175)

## Impact

It may be possible to make Wireshark crash by injecting a series of malformed
packets onto the wire or by convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace
file.

## Resolution

Upgrade to Wireshark 1.2.17 or later.
Due to the nature of these bugs we do not recommend trying to work around the
problem by disabling individual dissectors.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Topic

Updated wireshark packages that fix several security issues, three bugs,
and add one enhancement are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Wireshark, previously known as Ethereal, is a network protocol analyzer. It
is used to capture and browse the traffic running on a computer network.

A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way Wireshark handled
Endace ERF (Extensible Record Format) capture files. If Wireshark opened a
specially-crafted ERF capture file, it could crash or, possibly, execute
arbitrary code as the user running Wireshark. (CVE-2011-4102)

Several denial of service flaws were found in Wireshark. Wireshark could
crash or stop responding if it read a malformed packet off a network, or
opened a malicious dump file. (CVE-2011-1958, CVE-2011-1959, CVE-2011-2175,
CVE-2011-2698, CVE-2012-0041, CVE-2012-0042, CVE-2012-0066, CVE-2012-0067,
CVE-2012-4285, CVE-2012-4289, CVE-2012-4290, CVE-2012-4291)

The CVE-2011-1958, CVE-2011-1959, CVE-2011-2175, and CVE-2011-4102 issues
were discovered by Huzaifa Sidhpurwala of the Red Hat Security Response
Team.

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* When Wireshark starts with the X11 protocol being tunneled through an SSH

connection, it automatically prepares its capture filter to omit the SSH
packets. If the SSH connection was to a link-local IPv6 address including
an interface name (for example ssh -X [ipv6addr]%eth0), Wireshark parsed
this address erroneously, constructed an incorrect capture filter and
refused to capture packets. The "Invalid capture filter" message was
displayed. With this update, parsing of link-local IPv6 addresses is fixed
and Wireshark correctly prepares a capture filter to omit SSH packets over
a link-local IPv6 connection. (BZ#438473)

* Previously, Wireshark's column editing dialog malformed column names when

they were selected. With this update, the dialog is fixed and no longer
breaks column names. (BZ#493693)

* Previously, TShark, the console packet analyzer, did not properly analyze

the exit code of Dumpcap, Wireshark's packet capturing back end. As a
result, TShark returned exit code 0 when Dumpcap failed to parse its
command-line arguments. In this update, TShark correctly propagates the
Dumpcap exit code and returns a non-zero exit code when Dumpcap fails.
(BZ#580510)

* Previously, the TShark "-s" (snapshot length) option worked only for a

value greater than 68 bytes. If a lower value was specified, TShark
captured just 68 bytes of incoming packets. With this update, the "-s"
option is fixed and sizes lower than 68 bytes work as expected. (BZ#580513)

This update also adds the following enhancement:

* In this update, support for the "NetDump" protocol was added. (BZ#484999)

All users of Wireshark are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
which contain backported patches to correct these issues and add this
enhancement. All running instances of Wireshark must be restarted for the
update to take effect.

## Summary

**Name:** Multiple vulnerabilities in Wireshark

**Docid:** wnpa-sec-2011-08

**Date:** May 31, 2011

**Affected versions:** 1.4.0 up to and including
1.4.6

**Fixed versions:** 1.4.7

## Details

### Description

Wireshark 1.4.7 fixes the following vulnerabilities:

* Large/infinite loop in the DICOM dissector.

  ([Bug
  5876](https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=5876))

  Versions affected: 1.2.0 to 1.2.16 and 1.4.0 to 1.4.6.
  [CVE-2011-1957](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-1957)* Huzaifa Sidhpurwala of the Red Hat Security Response Team discovered
    that a corrupted Diameter dictionary file could crash Wireshark.

    Versions affected: 1.2.0 to 1.2.16 and 1.4.0 to 1.4.6.
    [CVE-2011-1958](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-1958)* Huzaifa Sidhpurwala of the Red Hat Security Response Team discovered
      that a corrupted snoop file could crash Wireshark.

      ([Bug
      5912](https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=5912))

      Versions affected: 1.2.0 to 1.2.16 and 1.4.0 to 1.4.6.
      [CVE-2011-1959](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-1959)* David Maciejak of Fortinet's FortiGuard Labs discovered that
        malformed compressed capture data could crash Wireshark.

        ([Bug
        5908](https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=5908))

        Versions affected: 1.2.0 to 1.2.16 and 1.4.0 to 1.4.6.
        [CVE-2011-2174](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-2174)* Huzaifa Sidhpurwala of the Red Hat Security Response Team discovered
          that a corrupted Visual Networks file could crash Wireshark.

          ([Bug
          5934](https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=5934))

          Versions affected: 1.2.0 to 1.2.16 and 1.4.0 to 1.4.6.
          [CVE-2011-2175](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-2175)

## Impact

It may be possible to make Wireshark crash by injecting a series of malformed
packets onto the wire or by convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace
file.

## Resolution

Upgrade to Wireshark 1.4.7 or later.
Due to the nature of these bugs we do not recommend trying to work around the
problem by disabling individual dissectors.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=710039#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-06-02 10:20:46 UTC  ``` A stack-based buffer over-read flaw was found in the way Wireshark performed management of testy, virtualizable buffers. A remote attacker could create a specially-crafted capture file, which once opened, by a local, unsuspecting user could lead to wireshark application crash.

This is a memory corruption flaw caused by using a custom config files.
You will normally have to social engineer the victim to use a malicious

Subject: CVE request for Wireshark 1.4.6/1.2.16 Multiple DoS issues

I didn't see any CVE's in the Wireshark Bug tracking/advisory nor
could I find these in the Red Hat Bugzilla (but I'm guessing as a CNA
they have CVE #'s assigned?)

Wireshark 1.2.17 fixes the following vulnerabilities:

Large/infinite loop in the DICOM dissector. (Bug 5876)
Versions affected: 1.2.0 to 1.2.16 and 1.4.0 to 1.4.6.

Huzaifa Sidhpurwala of the Red Hat Security Response Team discovered
that a corrupted Diameter dictionary file could crash Wireshark.
Versions affected: 1.2.0 to 1.2.16 and 1.4.0 to 1.4.6.

Huzaifa Sidhpurwala of the Red Hat Security Response Team discovered
that a corrupted snoop file could crash Wireshark. (Bug 5912)
Versions affected: 1.2.0 to 1.2.16 and 1.4.0 to 1.4.6.

David Maciejak of Fortinet's FortiGuard Labs discovered that malformed
compressed capture data could crash Wireshark. (Bug 5908)
Versions affected: 1.2.0 to 1.2.16 and 1.4.0 to 1.4.6.

Huzaifa Sidhpurwala of the Red Hat Security Response Team discovered
that a corrupted Visual Networks file could crash Wireshark. (Bug
5934)
Versions affected: 1.2.0 to 1.2.16 and 1.4.0 to 1.4.6.
