Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2011-1500:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Pithos application stored the username and password for external services (Pandora) in plain text within a configuration file (`$HOME/.config/pithos.ini`).
*   This configuration file was, by default, world-readable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Plaintext Storage:** Sensitive user credentials (username and password) were stored without encryption or hashing.
*   **Insecure File Permissions:** The configuration file containing the credentials had world-readable permissions, allowing any local user to access the contents.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Local users could easily access and steal the stored usernames and passwords, resulting in a loss of user privacy.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers could potentially gain access to the user's Pandora account.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The primary attack vector was local access to the user's machine. Any user with an account on the same system could read the vulnerable configuration file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Account:** The attacker needed to have a user account on the same machine where Pithos was installed.
*   **Basic File System Knowledge:** The attacker needed to know the location of the configuration file ( `$HOME/.config/pithos.ini`).

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in Pithos version 0.3.8-1, which corrected the file permissions and addressed the plaintext storage issue by setting the file permission to 600 on the next run of pithos.
*   The developers considered using gnome-keyring or python-keyring for more secure password storage, but initially chose to address the immediate issue with file permissions.
*   The communication between Pithos and Pandora was also noted to use a publicly known blowfish key for encryption, indicating a potential vulnerability even if passwords were not stored in plaintext.
*   The issue was initially reported by Ian Daniher.
