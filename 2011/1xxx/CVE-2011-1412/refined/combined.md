| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=725951#c0)  Simon McVittie    2011-07-27 07:12:24 UTC  ``` Two security vulnerabilities in the ioquake3 engine may affect your quake3 and/or openarena packages. I will comment with more details when I have confirmed that this bug is not public.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=725951#c1)  Simon McVittie    2011-07-27 07:16:48 UTC  ``` Passing on a message from upstream developer Thilo Schulz <thilo>, who should be contacted for further details if required:  Dear Sir or Madam,  I am informing you about two security vulnerabilities that were recently found by a user with the handle "devhc" in ioquake3, an open source project dedicated to the maintenance of the dated quake3 engine, see <http://www.ioquake3.org> for more information. It is my understanding, that your distributions or games are packaging or based on recent revisions of ioquake3.  The first bug was introduced in svn revision 1773 and does not exist in ioquake3's last official release (version 1.36), however, several projects that are based on more recent svn revisions of our source tree might be afflicted, like "World of Padman". The first bug is a shell injection vulnerability which allows server admins to execute arbitrary shell commands on connecting clients. It can be triggered by setting the fs_game cvar to something like "`echo <insert 250 chars here> > inject.txt`" This bug was fixed in revision 2097, see : <http://svn.icculus.org/quake3?view=rev&revision=2097>  [[CVE-2011-1412](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1412) has been assigned to the vulnerability fixed in r2097 -smcv]  The second bug is not as severe, but was already introduced in revision 1499, thus ioquake3 1.36 is afflicted. Here, a file extension check is broken and malicious game code might execute arbitrary code outside its Virtual Machine context by writing to DLL files that are loaded by the quake3 engine during gameplay. This bug was fixed in revision 2098, see: <http://svn.icculus.org/quake3?view=rev&revision=2098>  [[CVE-2011-2764](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-2764) has been assigned to the vulnerability fixed in r2098 -smcv]  We intend to go public with this information around Thursday noon (European time), so please do not disclose these details until our official posting to bugtraq or Full Disclosure.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=725951#c2)  Simon McVittie    2011-07-27 07:20:27 UTC  ``` These are bugs in the ioquake3 engine, not in particular game code. I don't know how you handle this engine in Fedora; the upstreams of various games each have their own outdated "official" ioquake3 builds, but in Debian we use a shared engine binary for OpenArena and Quake III Arena.  I believe that who is and isn't vulnerable goes like this:                             engine | based on | [CVE-2011-1412](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1412) | [CVE-2011-2674](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-2674) | ----------------------------------+----------+-------+-------+---------------+ ioQuake3 1.36                     | r1520    | -             | vulnerable    | OpenArena engine 0.8.x-13 (0.8.5) | r1759    | -             | vulnerable    | OpenArena engine 0.8.x-14 (0.8.5) | r1759    | -             | vulnerable    | OpenArena engine 0.8.x-15         | r1783    | vulnerable    | vulnerable    | OpenArena engine 0.8.x-16         | r1788    | vulnerable    | vulnerable    | ioUrbanTerror 2007-12-20 server   | r1240    | -             | no check      | ioUrbanTerror 2007-12-20 client   | r1142    | -             | no check      | World of Padman 1.2 non-Windows   | r1202    | -             | no check      | World of Padman 1.2 Windows-only  | r1142    | -             | no check      | World of Padman first standalone  | r1051    | -             | no check      | Tremulous 1.1.0                   | ?        | -             | no check      | ----------------------------------+----------+-------+-------+---------------+  Engines marked "no check" for [CVE-2011-2674](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-2674) don't have the regression from r1499, but also don't have the check as originally added (r1405) at all, so the only way to use them safely is to turn off auto-downloading, or not allow native-code gamecode (or preferably, both). Engines this old probably aren't safe to use on untrusted bytecode anyway, though.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=725951#c3)  Rahul Sundaram    2011-07-27 07:46:09 UTC  ``` Hans,  can you help with this?   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=725951#c4)  Hans de Goede    2011-07-27 09:01:52 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=725951#c3)) > Hans,  can you help with this?  Yes :)  Fedora is shipping ioquake3 svn r1802 in all supported releases + some patches to allow using a single ioquake3 binary with all of quake3 / openarena / UrbanTerror / World of Padman (these patches come from Debian and have been submitted upstream).  This means that what we are vulnerable to both CVE-s. I'll prepare an update for this tonight (on my local system), and commit, build, and create an update in bodhi for this as soon as this goes public.

Yes and no, openarena uses the quake3 package for the ioquake3 engine, but tremulous / tremfusion and alienarena use and ship with a fork of the ioquake3 engine.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=725951#c11)  Simon McVittie    2011-07-28 09:53:29 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #10](show_bug.cgi?id=725951#c10)) > tremulous / tremfusion and alienarena use and ship with a fork of the ioquake3 > engine  The version of Tremulous in Debian (1.1.0) is based on ioquake3, but is too old to suffer from [CVE-2011-1412](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1412) (the more serious and easily-exploitable of these vulnerabilities). If your version is different, the pattern to grep for is 'system *('.   I believe Alien Arena is based on Quake *2*, possibly with some code from ioquake3 added. In any case, the version in Debian (7.51) doesn't seem to have [CVE-2011-1412](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1412).  Upstream consider [CVE-2011-2764](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-2764) to be a less serious vulnerability. It's only significant if you allow your Q3 engine to run untrusted bytecode (either by enabling auto-downloading, or by installing untrusted mods in your home directory) *and* you allow it to run native-code DLLs (+set vm_cgame 0, +set vm_game 0, +set vm_ui 0, or Debian's patch to let bytecode be replaced by a request to load the equivalent native code so we don't rely on pre-built bytecode that we can't rebuild - I don't think you apply that particular patch in Fedora?).  In Debian's OpenArena, I'm treating -2764 as a vulnerability, due to that patch; but if you're using the unmodified bytecode in pak*.pk3, it's not exploitable under a normal configuration.  Older ioQuake3 forks like Tremulous are probably not safe to use with untrusted bytecode in any case (there have been crash bugs, although as far as I know, none are thought to be exploitable beyond DoS) so auto-downloading isn't a good idea anyway. I believe it's off by default, but can be enabled through the GUI.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=725951#c12)  Simon McVittie    2011-07-28 13:37:56 UTC  ``` Now public, <http://lists.grok.org.uk/pipermail/full-disclosure/2011-July/082070.html>   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=725951#c13)  Hans de Goede    2011-07-28 14:23:20 UTC  ``` Hi,  (In reply to [comment #12](show_bug.cgi?id=725951#c12)) > Now public, > <http://lists.grok.org.uk/pipermail/full-disclosure/2011-July/082070.html>  Thanks for this, as well as for all your other work on this and your input wrt the (non)vulnerability of alienarena and tremulous.

(I suspect that this would be fixed with the same patch used to fix [CVE-2011-2764](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-2764), but I'm not sure... can someone more familiar with it check to make sure this is the case?)   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=725951#c18)  Hans de Goede    2011-08-10 07:19:56 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #17](show_bug.cgi?id=725951#c17)) > (I suspect that this would be fixed with the same patch used to fix > [CVE-2011-2764](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-2764), but I'm not sure... can someone more familiar with it check to > make sure this is the case?)  This should only impact configurations where execution of native compiled (rather then the standard quake3 byte code format) game logic is allowed. We don't ship any such configurations.  Simon, can you confirm my analysis?   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=725951#c19)  Simon McVittie    2011-08-10 09:01:14 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #17](show_bug.cgi?id=725951#c17)) > The ioQuake3 engine, as used in World of Padman 1.2 and earlier, > Tremulous 1.1.0, and ioUrbanTerror 2007-12-20, does not check for > dangerous file extensions before writing to the quake3 directory, > which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted > third-party addon that creates a Trojan horse DLL file, a different > vulnerability than [CVE-2011-2764](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-2764).  How does this differ from [CVE-2011-2764](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-2764), except by claiming to be different? This is exactly how you'd exploit -2764, and all of the references in [Comment #17](show_bug.cgi?id=725951#c17) discuss -1412 and -2764. The upstream advisory from Thilo Schulz, posted to Full Disclosure and SecurityFocus, specifically states that -2764 was allocated for what Thilo calls "Issue #2" (the one fixed in r2098).  (I can't currently reach securityfocus.com for some reason, but it seems liveweb.archive.org can... meanwhile, cve.mitre.org just gives me an error, but that seems to be normal for recent vulnerabilities.)  I obtained the two CVE IDs -1412 and -2764 from the Debian security team while helping Thilo to coordinate this advisory.  If there is a separate vulnerability not fixed in r2098, please contact me and Thilo privately.  (In reply to [comment #18](show_bug.cgi?id=725951#c18)) > This should only impact configurations where execution of native compiled > (rather then the standard quake3 byte code format) game logic is allowed.  This is true for [CVE-2011-2764](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-2764), at least: Fedora should only be vulnerable if a user sets one of the vm_ui, vm_game or vm_cgame cvars to "0". (OpenArena in Debian was vulnerable, because we avoid using the bytecode for licensing reasons.)  I haven't seen any description of [CVE-2011-3012](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-3012) that explains how it differs from -2764, so I can't say anything about -3012.   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=725951#c20)  Tomas Hoger    2011-08-10 09:21:44 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #19](show_bug.cgi?id=725951#c19)) > (I can't currently reach securityfocus.com for some reason, but it seems > liveweb.archive.org can... meanwhile, cve.mitre.org just gives me an error, > but that seems to be normal for recent vulnerabilities.)  Yes, it does take some time.  Even when Mitre creates descriptions, they appear on cve.mitre only after some delay.  Nist's NVD site has them earlier:  <http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2011-2764> <http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2011-3012>  > I haven't seen any description of [CVE-2011-3012](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-3012) that explains how it differs > from -2764, so I can't say anything about -3012.  Looking at the full-disclosure post, and given the experience with how CVEs are split some times, this is most likely related to:    To prevent this from happening, ioquake3 introduced a file extension check   in r1499 which denied writing files with certain names. However, this check   was broken and corrected in r2098 only.  [CVE-2011-3012](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-3012) seems to be for "ioquake3 does not check file extensions before writing file, r1499" and [CVE-2011-2764](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-2764) for "previous fix for [CVE-2011-3012](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-3012) was incomplete and did not correctly prevent creating files with arbitrary extension, r2098".  HTH   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=725951#c21)  Vincent Danen    2012-02-22 18:21:29 UTC  ``` According to this Debian bug report, tremulous is also affected by these flaws:  <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=660827>   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=725951#c22)  Jan Kaluža    2012-02-23 08:35:58 UTC  ``` Note that we're using Tremulous 1.2beta because 1.1 has problems running on x86_64 architecture and upstream doesn't want to fix it in version 1.1. There are no functions mentioned in second and third attached patch. I will fix just "DLL overwriting" issue from the first patch + other CVEs.   ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=725951#c23)  Simon McVittie    2012-02-23 08:59:59 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #22](show_bug.cgi?id=725951#c22)) > Note that we're using Tremulous 1.2beta because 1.1 has problems running on > x86_64 architecture and upstream doesn't want to fix it in version 1.1.  (I worked around that in Debian by patching out the (broken?) x86-64 JIT and using the generic interpreter used by unsupported architectures, which seems to be OK.)  If by "1.2beta" you mean GPP1 ("gameplay preview 1"), I believe it's only vulnerable to [CVE-2011-2764](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-2764) (see <<http://seclists.org/bugtraq/2012/Feb/118>>), but please do double-check that.  [CVE-2011-2764](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-2764) has the mitigation that it's only a threat if you run untrusted bytecode, and if you run untrusted bytecode, you have worse problems:  (In reply to [comment #11](show_bug.cgi?id=725951#c11)) > Older ioQuake3 forks like Tremulous are probably not safe to use with untrusted > bytecode in any case (there have been crash bugs, although as far as I know, > none are thought to be exploitable beyond DoS) so auto-downloading isn't a good > idea anyway. I believe it's off by default, but can be enabled through the GUI.  In Debian's Tremulous I've patched out auto-downloading altogether. I'm tempted to do the same in our ioquake3 packages.   ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
