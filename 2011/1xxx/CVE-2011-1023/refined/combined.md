Message-ID: <4D6FAA10.6050603@redhat.com>
Date: Thu, 03 Mar 2011 22:47:44 +0800
From: Eugene Teo <eugene@...hat.com>

CC: "Steven M. Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org>
Subject: CVE-2011-1023 kernel: rds: prevent BUG_ON triggering on congestion
 map updates

This was discovered internally when testing CVE-2010-3904.

<http://marc.info/?l=linux-netdev&m=129908332903057&w=2>

"Tracked it down to a flaw in the xmit methods for the loop and ib
transports. Those two transports, when called with an rds message that
has the RDS_FLAG_CONG_BITMAP set, execute a rds_cong_map_updated call
and return.  Since the xmit method requires that the number of bytes
sent be returned, and a congestion map update doesn't really send any
data, it just returns the sizeof an rds_header plus the defined size of
the congestion map.  This is problematic because the caller of these
methods (rds_send_xmit), validates that we didn't send more data than
was available in the passed rds_message.  If the return value from
->xmit() is larger than the remaining data in the message, we bug halt,
which is exactly what we get above.  We could add a check to skip the
bug on check if the RDS_FLAG_CONG_BITMAP flag is set, but I think the
check is otherwise valid, so I've fixed it with this patch, which limits
the return value in the effected transports to not be more than the
remainig space in the rds_message."

Thanks, Eugene

Tracked it down to a flaw in the xmit methods for the loop and ib transports. Those two transports, when called with an rds message that has the RDS_FLAG_CONG_BITMAP set, execute a rds_cong_map_updated call and return.  Since the xmit method requires that the number of bytes sent be returned, and a congestion map update doesn't really send any data, it just returns the sizeof an rds_header plus the defined size of the congestion map.  This is problematic because the caller of these methods (rds_send_xmit), validates that we didn't send more data than was available in the passed rds_message.  If the return value from ->xmit() is larger than the remaining data in the message, we bug halt, which is exactly what we get above.  We could add a check to skip the bug on check if the RDS_FLAG_CONG_BITMAP flag is set, but I think the check is otherwise valid, so I've fixed it with this patch, which limits the return value in the effected transports to not be more than the remainig space in the rds_message.  <http://marc.info/?l=linux-netdev&m=129908332903057&w=2>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=680345#c3)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2011-03-09 00:48:46 UTC  ``` <http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/davem/net-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=6094628bfd94323fc1cea05ec2c6affd98c18f7f>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=680345#c4)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2011-03-15 03:03:58 UTC  ``` Statement:  The Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG did not include support for the RDS Protocol, and therefore are not affected by this issue. The Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 are not affected as they did not backport upstream commit 2e7b3b99 and 77dd550e that introduced this issue.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=680345#c5)  Chuck Ebbert    2011-05-02 22:52:17 UTC  ``` Upstream commit:  <http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=6094628bfd94323fc1cea05ec2c6affd98c18f7f>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=680345#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-05-19 11:58:45 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2011:0542 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0542.html>   ``` |  |
