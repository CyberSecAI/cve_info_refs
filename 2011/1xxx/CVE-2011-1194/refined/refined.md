- **[73026](http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=73026)**: "Use of corrupt out-of-bounds structure in video code".
- **[73716](http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=73716)**: "Leak of heap address in XSLT".

Here's a breakdown:

**Vulnerability 1:**

*   **Root cause:** Improper handling of navigation or closing actions within sandboxed frames.
*   **Weakness:**  Sandboxed frame restrictions are not fully enforced, allowing a sandboxed frame to potentially manipulate or close the top-level frame.
*   **Impact:** Could lead to unexpected behavior, potential information disclosure, or manipulation of the parent page from within a sandboxed iframe.
*   **Attack vector:**  Malicious content embedded in a sandboxed iframe.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need to be able to embed a crafted iframe in a webpage.

**Vulnerability 2:**

*   **Root cause:** An out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists within the OGG container handling code.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of proper bounds checking when handling OGG data.
*   **Impact:** Memory corruption, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack vector:**  Maliciously crafted OGG file processed by the browser.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to provide a maliciously crafted OGG file which can be processed by the browser.

**Vulnerability 3:**

*   **Root cause:** A corrupt out-of-bounds structure is used within video code processing.
*   **Weakness:** Missing bounds checks or incorrect structure usage in video decoding.
*   **Impact:**  Memory corruption, possibly leading to a browser crash or arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack vector:**  Malicious video content.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to provide a maliciously crafted video file which can be processed by the browser.

**Vulnerability 4:**

*   **Root cause:** A heap address leak within XSLT processing.
*   **Weakness:** Improper handling of memory addresses within XSLT transformation, which could expose heap information.
*   **Impact:** Heap address leak, possibly weakening ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization) and making it easier for other exploits to succeed.
*   **Attack vector:** Processing a crafted XSLT stylesheet.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to supply a crafted XSLT stylesheet that can be processed.
