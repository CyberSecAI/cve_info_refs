Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-1229:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a **Null Pointer Dereference** in the Windows kernel-mode driver (win32k.sys). This occurs due to the way the kernel-mode drivers manage pointers to kernel-mode driver objects.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Null Pointer Dereference:** The core issue is that the driver attempts to access memory through a pointer that is NULL or invalid, leading to a crash or unexpected behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Elevation of Privilege:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to run arbitrary code in kernel mode. This effectively grants them complete control over the affected system.
*   **System Compromise:** The attacker could then install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full administrative rights.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack requires the attacker to have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to the system.
*   **Malicious Application:** The attacker needs to execute a specially crafted application that triggers the null pointer dereference vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** The attacker must be a local user with valid logon credentials.
*   **Ability to execute code:** The attacker needs to be able to execute a malicious application on the target system.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   The vulnerability is located within the `win32k.sys` driver.
*   The issue stems from improper tracking of pointers to kernel-mode driver objects.
*   This vulnerability is grouped with other similar vulnerabilities as part of the Microsoft Security Bulletin MS11-034.
*   The provided content includes a list of affected Windows versions, which range from Windows XP to Windows Server 2008 R2.
*   The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the way the kernel-mode drivers keep track of pointers to kernel-mode driver objects.

In summary, CVE-2011-1229 is a locally exploitable vulnerability that allows for privilege escalation via a null pointer dereference in the Windows kernel driver. An attacker needs local access and the ability to run a specially crafted program. Successful exploitation results in the ability to execute arbitrary code in the kernel, leading to full system compromise.
