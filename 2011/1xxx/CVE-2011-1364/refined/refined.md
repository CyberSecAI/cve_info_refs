Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2011-1364:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The primary root cause is the presence of CSRF vulnerabilities in the Google App Engine SDK's Admin Console, specifically the Interactive Console. This allows an attacker to make requests on behalf of an authenticated user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) in Admin Console:** The SDK's admin interface (e.g., `http://localhost:8080/_ah/admin`) lacks proper CSRF protection. This allows a remote attacker to redirect a victim's browser to the admin console and perform actions as the victim.
2.  **Code Execution via Interactive Console:** The Interactive Console (e.g., `http://localhost:8080/_ah/admin/interactive`) allows execution of arbitrary Python code within the server's context.
3.  **Improper Security Restrictions in FakeFile Object:** The `FakeFile` object, used to restrict file access, can be modified to allow writing to arbitrary directories by changing its `ALLOWED_MODES` and `ALLOWED_DIRS` attributes.
4.  **Direct Access to Original `os` Object:** The Google App Engine's code retains a reference to the original `os` module, bypassing intended restrictions and allowing execution of system commands using `os.popen`. This bypasses the intended restrictions.
5.  **Access to `os` Object via `google.appengine.api.blobstore.os`:** Similar to the previous point, the original `os` module was accessible through the `file_blob_storage.os` attribute, again allowing for command execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary Python code on the developer's machine, and subsequently, execute system commands. This can lead to complete control of the victim's machine, including:
    *   Creating/modifying files
    *   Executing arbitrary applications (e.g., calc.exe)
    *   Potentially establishing persistence by modifying system startup files.
*   **Data Theft/Manipulation:** The attacker can read, modify, or delete any data accessible to the compromised account.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **CSRF Attack:** The attacker lures a victim to visit a malicious website. While the victim is running a local Google App Engine server, the malicious site redirects the victim's browser to the vulnerable SDK Console. This executes crafted requests to the victim's server.
*   **Malicious Web Page:** The attacker hosts an HTML page that contains malicious forms and JavaScript to send requests to the victim's local App Engine server.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker may need to trick the victim into visiting a malicious site or clicking on a malicious link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have a way to send HTTP requests to the victim's machine running the local App Engine development server (e.g., over the network if the port is exposed, or via a web browser if it's accessed on the same machine).
*   **Victim Running Local App Engine Server:** The victim must be actively running a local Google App Engine development server with the vulnerable SDK version.
*   **Basic HTML/JavaScript Knowledge:**  The attacker needs basic knowledge to create the malicious web page to trigger the exploit.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory highlights that the vulnerabilities in accessing the original `os` object might also exist on the appspot.com servers.
*   The vulnerabilities were fixed in Google App Engine version 1.5.4, released on September 12, 2012.
