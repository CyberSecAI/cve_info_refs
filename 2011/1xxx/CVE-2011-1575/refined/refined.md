Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-1575:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a STARTTLS command injection issue within the pure-ftpd software. It is similar to the vulnerability described in CVE-2011-0411, which affected postfix.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability exists when switching from a plaintext FTP session to a TLS encrypted session using the STARTTLS command. It involves a failure to properly flush the command buffer after the switch to TLS, allowing an attacker to inject additional commands that are processed within the TLS session.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- By injecting commands into the TLS session, an attacker could potentially execute arbitrary FTP commands with the privileges of the FTP server.
- This could lead to unauthorized access to files, data exfiltration, or modification of server configurations.
- The impact is classified as moderate, with potential for information disclosure, data modification, and service disruption.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based.
- An attacker would need to establish a connection with the vulnerable FTP server over the network using the FTP protocol.
- The attacker can then issue the STARTTLS command and inject their malicious commands before the TLS session is fully initialized.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to connect to the FTP server over the network.
- The attacker does not need any prior authentication to the server before injecting the commands.
- An understanding of the FTP protocol and the STARTTLS command is needed to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects several versions of openSUSE (11.2, 11.3, 11.4) and has also been identified in Fedora and EPEL.
- A patch has been released to address this vulnerability in pure-ftpd version 1.0.30 and higher by flushing the command buffer before switching to TLS.
- This issue is not a vulnerability in the STARTTLS protocol itself but an implementation flaw within the affected programs.
