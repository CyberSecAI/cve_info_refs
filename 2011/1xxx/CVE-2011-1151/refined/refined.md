Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-1151:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within Joomla! 1.6.0. Specifically, the `filter_order` and `filter_order_Dir` parameters were not sanitized before being used in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The core weakness is a SQL injection vulnerability. By injecting malicious SQL code through the unsanitized parameters, an attacker could manipulate or disclose sensitive data in the back-end database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Manipulation:** Attackers could modify data stored in the database.
- **Data Disclosure:** Attackers could gain unauthorized access to sensitive information stored in the database. This could include user credentials, application data, etc.
- **Arbitrary SQL query execution**: The attacker could execute arbitrary SQL queries against the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET parameters:** The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating specific parameters (`filter_order` and `filter_order_Dir`) within the HTTP GET request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Joomla! installation.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable parameters:** The attacker must know about the specific vulnerable parameters (`filter_order` and `filter_order_Dir`) and how to inject SQL.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided exploit examples demonstrate how to inject SQL code through the vulnerable parameters.
- The issue was initially present in Joomla! 1.5.21, was fixed in 1.5.22 but reintroduced in 1.6.0.
- The vulnerability was reported by Aung Khant from YGN Ethical Hacker Group.
- Joomla! 1.6.1 is a fixed version.
