{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The language-selector D-Bus backend did not properly check for PolicyKit authorization before modifying system-wide locale configuration.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper authorization check",
      "Lack of input validation allowing for shell command injection"
    ],
    "impact": "Local privilege escalation, allowing any authenticated user to gain root access by injecting shell commands into `/etc/default/locale`.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access",
      "Exploitation of the D-Bus interface of `language-selector`"
     ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs to be a local user who is able to interact with the system via dbus.",
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability exists due to the `language-selector` D-Bus backend not verifying PolicyKit authentication results, and not validating input arguments to `SetSystemDefaultLanguageEnv` and `SetSystemDefaultLangEnv` methods. This allowed bypassing the authentication check by simply canceling the authentication dialog and injecting shell commands. Patches were made to check the PolicyKit result and to reject locale names with invalid characters."
