Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2011-1895:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is caused by improper handling of script within specially crafted requests by Microsoft Forefront Unified Access Gateway (UAG) server, allowing malicious content to be reflected back to the user. This is an HTTP response splitting vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary weakness is the presence of a reflected XSS vulnerability where user-supplied input in a crafted URL is not properly sanitized, leading to the injection of malicious JavaScript into the response. This is also described as an HTTP Response Splitting vulnerability.
- The vulnerability allows JavaScript to be injected back to the user in the resulting page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Elevation of Privilege:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to perform actions with the privileges of the victim user.
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could read content that they are not authorized to access.
- **Malicious Content Injection:** Attackers can inject arbitrary malicious content in the browser of the victim. This could include redirecting the user to phishing sites, stealing cookies, and performing other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **E-mail Attack:** An attacker could send an email message containing a crafted URL to a UAG user, convincing them to click it.
- **Web-Based Attack:** An attacker could host a website containing the crafted URL, or inject the crafted URL into compromised websites.
- The attacker has no way to force users to visit the malicious site, the user must be convinced to click the link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to create a specially crafted URL containing malicious script targeting a UAG server.
- The attacker needs to trick an authorized user into clicking on the malicious URL.
- The attacker can be remote and does not require any prior access to the UAG server.

**Additional Details:**

- Microsoft Intelligent Application Gateway (IAG) 2007 Service Pack 2 is also affected by this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is addressed by modifying how UAG handles crafted requests, preventing the reflection of content back to the user.
- The vulnerability was privately reported and not publicly disclosed before the patch release. There were no known reports of active exploitation at the time of the bulletin.
- The affected software includes various versions of Microsoft Forefront Unified Access Gateway 2010.
