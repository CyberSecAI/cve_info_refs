      "text": "The provided content includes details on CVE-2011-1246, specifically within the context of Microsoft Security Bulletin MS11-050. It is described as a MIME Sniffing Information Disclosure Vulnerability.\n\n- Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability is caused when Internet Explorer incorrectly renders Web pages during certain processes, specifically related to how Internet Explorer enforces content settings supplied by the Web server.\n\n- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Information disclosure, allowing an attacker to view content from a different domain or Internet Explorer zone than the attacker's Web page.\n\n- Impact of exploitation: An attacker could force the browser to perform unexpected actions, potentially viewing content from a different domain or Internet Explorer zone. In the context of other vulnerabilities in the bulletin, an attacker may gain the same rights as the local user, potentially leading to remote code execution if chained.\n\n- Attack vectors: An attacker could host a website with a specially crafted web page or take advantage of compromised websites, user-provided content, or advertisements, to trigger the vulnerability. The attacker would need to convince the user to download specially crafted content.\n\n- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to host a specially crafted webpage that, when viewed by the user via a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer, triggers the vulnerability. No specific user credentials or system access is needed beyond this. The attacker needs to trick the user to visiting their malicious page or downloading their crafted content."
