Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-1483:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from JBossWS native not properly protecting against recursive entity resolution with embedded DTDs (Document Type Definitions).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  **Recursive Entity Resolution:** The core issue is the lack of proper protection against recursive entity resolution, allowing an attacker to construct a malicious XML document with deeply nested DTD entities.
-  **XML External Entity (XXE) processing:** Although not explicitly stated, the vulnerability relies on the parser's processing of external entities defined in a DTD, which can be abused to cause a denial of service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial-of-Service (DoS):** A remote attacker can cause a Denial of Service by exhausting CPU resources on the server. This occurs when the server tries to resolve the recursively defined entities, leading to excessive processing and resource consumption.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely.
- **Crafted POST Request:** The attack is performed by sending a carefully crafted POST request to a deployed web service. The request contains a malicious XML payload with recursively defined DTD entities.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to a vulnerable JBoss web service.
- **XML Crafting Knowledge:** The attacker needs to have knowledge of XML, DTDs, and entity definitions to create the malicious payload.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was addressed in multiple JBoss products and versions.
- The fix was delivered via Red Hat Security Advisories (RHSAs).
- Upstream patches are available, refer to the provided links for commit details.
