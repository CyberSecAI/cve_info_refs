  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in OpenSSL's implementation of Montgomery's ladder for scalar multiplication of points on elliptic curves over binary fields. The timing of the scalar multiplication operation is not constant, and is dependent on the bit length of the scalar. The execution time of the ladder algorithm is directly correlated with the logarithm of the scalar.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Timing attack vulnerability in the Montgomery Ladder implementation in OpenSSL for binary curves.",
       "Non-constant time execution of the scalar multiplication due to a dependency on the bit-length of the scalar."
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can recover the private key of a TLS server that uses ECDSA signatures and binary curves, enabling them to impersonate the server and decrypt communications.",
    "attack_vectors": [
        "Remote timing attack over TLS handshake.",
        "Local timing attack by direct invocation of OpenSSL ECDSA routines."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Ability to initiate TLS connections with a server using ECDSA and binary curves.",
      "Ability to measure the time elapsed during TLS handshake or ECDSA signature generation with reasonable accuracy.",
       "Ability to collect sufficient number of signatures.",
       "Ability to perform a lattice attack."
    ],
    "additional_details": "The attack involves two phases:\n1. Collection phase: The attacker collects ECDSA signatures from the target server and exploits the time dependency to filter signatures likely generated using nonces with leading zero bits. The filtering is done based on the measured time to produce the signature, with faster signatures being favored. The collection process can occur locally or remotely (over TLS handshake). The remote attack relies on timing the TLS handshake process rather than the exact signature operation.\n2. Lattice attack: Using the filtered set of signatures, a lattice attack is performed to recover the private key. The success of the lattice attack depends on the number of 'false positives' in the filtered set (signatures where the nonce didn't have enough leading zeros), as well as the accuracy of timings.  \n\nA countermeasure involving padding the scalar to fix the bit length is also described.",
