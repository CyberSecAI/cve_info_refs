Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2011-1883:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from improper management of kernel-mode driver objects within the Windows kernel. Specifically, the vulnerability is a "use-after-free" issue, meaning that memory is accessed after it has been freed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Use-After-Free:** The core issue is that the win32k.sys driver, which handles window management and graphics, is not properly managing memory allocated for kernel objects. A freed object's memory is accessed causing a fault.
-   **Elevation of Privilege:** The vulnerability enables an attacker to escalate privileges, gaining the ability to execute code within the kernel.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in kernel mode.
-   **Full System Control:** With kernel-level access, an attacker can take complete control of the system.
-   **Malicious Activities:** This control enables the attacker to install programs, view/modify/delete data, and create new accounts with administrative rights.
-   **Information Disclosure:** In some cases, the exploitation of related vulnerabilities could lead to access of sensitive information, such as contents of the SAM file.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Local Access:**  The primary attack vector requires the attacker to have valid logon credentials and local access to the system. Remote exploitation is not possible for this particular vulnerability.
-   **Specially Crafted Application:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability by running a specially crafted application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Valid Logon Credentials:** An attacker must have valid credentials to log onto the system.
-   **Local System Access:** The attacker must be able to execute code on the target system.
-   **Technical Skill:** The attacker needs the technical knowledge to create an application capable of exploiting the use-after-free condition.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability resides in the `win32k.sys` driver, a core component of the Windows OS.
- The provided information comes from Microsoft Security Bulletin MS11-054, which addresses multiple similar vulnerabilities, including CVE-2011-1883, and is not a single patch targeted for this single CVE.
- Microsoft states the vulnerability was privately reported and not publicly known at the time of the security bulletin release.
- Workstations and terminal servers are most at risk, servers could be at risk if user logins are allowed.
