# RHSA-2011:1507 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Moderate: libarchive security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2011%3A1507)

## Topic

Updated libarchive packages that fix two security issues are now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The libarchive programming library can create and read several different
streaming archive formats, including GNU tar and cpio. It can also read ISO
9660 CD-ROM images.

Two heap-based buffer overflow flaws were discovered in libarchive. If a
user were tricked into expanding a specially-crafted ISO 9660 CD-ROM image
or tar archive with an application using libarchive, it could cause the
application to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running the application. (CVE-2011-1777,
CVE-2011-1778)

All libarchive users should upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues. All running
applications using libarchive must be restarted for this update to take
effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/kb/docs/DOC-11259>

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=705849#c0)  Vincent Danen    2011-05-18 17:20:03 UTC  ``` A number of flaws have been corrected in upstream libarchive that have not yet been included in a public release of libarchive (latest version is 2.8.4).  A buffer overflow at reading bit lengths of huffman code of LZX when reading a broken CAB file ([CVE-2010-4666](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-4666)) [1].  Buffer overflows in various functions related to reading archives (in archive_read_support_format_iso9660.c) ([CVE-2011-1777](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1777)) [2].  Buffer overflow in reading tar archives ([CVE-2011-1778](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1778)) [3].

These three patches are way too far from the 2.8.4 release and don't apply; the internal structure of the particular source files have changed a lot and even if we somehow make the patches apply, I don't trust the resulting functionality.  We probably can't even rebase to latest snapshot as long as the API has changed in preparation to the 3.x series.  I suggest to close this bugreport or make someone to look deep in the sources and come up with working patches.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=705849#c5)  Vincent Danen    2011-09-02 03:46:20 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=705849#c4)) > (In reply to [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=705849#c0)) > > A buffer overflow at reading bit lengths of huffman code of LZX when reading a > > broken CAB file ([CVE-2010-4666](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-4666)) [1]. > Doesn't apply for libarchive-2.8.4, no CAB support yet  Ok, this works in our favour.   > > Buffer overflows in various functions related to reading archives (in > > archive_read_support_format_iso9660.c) ([CVE-2011-1777](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1777)) [2]. > >  > > Buffer overflow in reading tar archives ([CVE-2011-1778](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1778)) [3]. > >  > > Use-after-free bugs ([CVE-2011-1779](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1779)) [4]. >  > These three patches are way too far from the 2.8.4 release and don't apply; the > internal structure of the particular source files have changed a lot and even > if we somehow make the patches apply, I don't trust the resulting > functionality. >  > We probably can't even rebase to latest snapshot as long as the API has changed > in preparation to the 3.x series. >  > I suggest to close this bugreport or make someone to look deep in the sources > and come up with working patches.  I don't see closing this as an option.  You are effectively saying that, because it's difficult, we won't do it.  Maybe the impact is low enough that it won't matter if we don't fix it, but we need to look into it.  At a quick glance, there are a few important packages that link to libarchive: PackageKit, kdeutils, gvfs-archive, and anaconda (the last probably isn't very significant in this context).  If none of these packages use the vulnerable functionality, then I have no problem with closing this (once it is corrected in Fedora).  If they do, however, then we will need to come up with our own fix and backport what is applicable to close the hole.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=705849#c6)  Tomáš Bžatek    2011-09-02 12:13:05 UTC  ``` Okay, let's keep this open. I'm flooded with work, perhaps somebody else could come up with the patches.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=705849#c7)  Vincent Danen    2011-09-03 00:25:30 UTC  ``` Fair enough.  This isn't a high-impact flaw, so we don't need to worry about this right away, but we will probably want to take care of it at some point.  Thanks.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=705849#c8)  Ramon de C Valle    2011-09-15 19:48:33 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=705849#c0)) > A number of flaws have been corrected in upstream libarchive that have not yet > been included in a public release of libarchive (latest version is 2.8.4). >  > A buffer overflow at reading bit lengths of huffman code of LZX when reading a > broken CAB file ([CVE-2010-4666](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-4666)) [1]. >  > Buffer overflows in various functions related to reading archives (in > archive_read_support_format_iso9660.c) ([CVE-2011-1777](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1777)) [2]. >  > Buffer overflow in reading tar archives ([CVE-2011-1778](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1778)) [3]. >  > Use-after-free bugs ([CVE-2011-1779](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1779)) [4]. >  > [1] <http://code.google.com/p/libarchive/source/detail?r=2842> Ark, PackageKit, and GVFS archive mounter currently don't support cab format.  > [2] > <http://code.google.com/p/libarchive/source/detail?r=3158&path=/trunk/libarchive/archive_read_support_format_iso9660.c> Ark, and PackageKit don't support ISO9660 format.

Not anytime in the short term unfortunately, my TODO list is quite long these days with higher-priority things. Last time I checked the patched didn't apply cleanly on 2.8.5 release which would involve further work. I'd be happy to package new patches however.   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=705849#c22)  Vincent Danen    2011-12-02 17:48:00 UTC  ``` The RHEL6 update was to patch 2.8.3.. would not the same patch apply to 2.8.4/2.8.5?  (I don't know, I've not looked).  I don't know what changed between 2.8.5 and 3.0.0, so perhaps rebasing may be out of the question of it introduces some ABI changes.  But if we're able to patch 2.8.3, surely that patch should apply to the other releases with minimal fuss?  Having said that, this isn't a high impact security flaw, so some delay is not a problem.   ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=705849#c23)  Anssi Hannula    2012-01-01 01:32:17 UTC  ``` The [CVE-2011-1777](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1777).patch attached to this report ([attachment #523601](attachment.cgi?id=523601&action=diff "CVE-2011-1777.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=523601&action=edit "CVE-2011-1777.patch")) is broken and breaks ISO support (found out by Mageia QA, <https://bugs.mageia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3941> ).  The upstream commit added braces to several 'if' statements, but in two places those are missing from this patch, causing the execution to enter the parent 'else' code blocks which are now wrongly associated with the added 'if' statements.  Additionally, the patch adds a return value to the heap_add_entry() function. However, there is an additional return statement in the function which should also now be changed to return ARCHIVE_OK, but this was missed.  For the record, here are the changes I made to the patch: <http://svnweb.mageia.org/packages/updates/1/libarchive/current/SOURCES/libarchive-CVE-2011-1777.diff?r1=188950&r2=189404>   ```  [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=705849#c24)  Niels de Vos    2012-01-06 20:45:52 UTC  ``` EPEL5 contains libarchive-2.8.4-3.el5, this package does not contain any patches against the CVE's, can someone confirm it is vulnerable?

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=705849#c0)  Vincent Danen    2011-05-18 17:20:03 UTC  ``` A number of flaws have been corrected in upstream libarchive that have not yet been included in a public release of libarchive (latest version is 2.8.4).  A buffer overflow at reading bit lengths of huffman code of LZX when reading a broken CAB file ([CVE-2010-4666](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-4666)) [1].  Buffer overflows in various functions related to reading archives (in archive_read_support_format_iso9660.c) ([CVE-2011-1777](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1777)) [2].  Buffer overflow in reading tar archives ([CVE-2011-1778](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1778)) [3].

These three patches are way too far from the 2.8.4 release and don't apply; the internal structure of the particular source files have changed a lot and even if we somehow make the patches apply, I don't trust the resulting functionality.  We probably can't even rebase to latest snapshot as long as the API has changed in preparation to the 3.x series.  I suggest to close this bugreport or make someone to look deep in the sources and come up with working patches.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=705849#c5)  Vincent Danen    2011-09-02 03:46:20 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=705849#c4)) > (In reply to [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=705849#c0)) > > A buffer overflow at reading bit lengths of huffman code of LZX when reading a > > broken CAB file ([CVE-2010-4666](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-4666)) [1]. > Doesn't apply for libarchive-2.8.4, no CAB support yet  Ok, this works in our favour.   > > Buffer overflows in various functions related to reading archives (in > > archive_read_support_format_iso9660.c) ([CVE-2011-1777](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1777)) [2]. > >  > > Buffer overflow in reading tar archives ([CVE-2011-1778](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1778)) [3]. > >  > > Use-after-free bugs ([CVE-2011-1779](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1779)) [4]. >  > These three patches are way too far from the 2.8.4 release and don't apply; the > internal structure of the particular source files have changed a lot and even > if we somehow make the patches apply, I don't trust the resulting > functionality. >  > We probably can't even rebase to latest snapshot as long as the API has changed > in preparation to the 3.x series. >  > I suggest to close this bugreport or make someone to look deep in the sources > and come up with working patches.  I don't see closing this as an option.  You are effectively saying that, because it's difficult, we won't do it.  Maybe the impact is low enough that it won't matter if we don't fix it, but we need to look into it.  At a quick glance, there are a few important packages that link to libarchive: PackageKit, kdeutils, gvfs-archive, and anaconda (the last probably isn't very significant in this context).  If none of these packages use the vulnerable functionality, then I have no problem with closing this (once it is corrected in Fedora).  If they do, however, then we will need to come up with our own fix and backport what is applicable to close the hole.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=705849#c6)  Tomáš Bžatek    2011-09-02 12:13:05 UTC  ``` Okay, let's keep this open. I'm flooded with work, perhaps somebody else could come up with the patches.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=705849#c7)  Vincent Danen    2011-09-03 00:25:30 UTC  ``` Fair enough.  This isn't a high-impact flaw, so we don't need to worry about this right away, but we will probably want to take care of it at some point.  Thanks.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=705849#c8)  Ramon de C Valle    2011-09-15 19:48:33 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=705849#c0)) > A number of flaws have been corrected in upstream libarchive that have not yet > been included in a public release of libarchive (latest version is 2.8.4). >  > A buffer overflow at reading bit lengths of huffman code of LZX when reading a > broken CAB file ([CVE-2010-4666](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-4666)) [1]. >  > Buffer overflows in various functions related to reading archives (in > archive_read_support_format_iso9660.c) ([CVE-2011-1777](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1777)) [2]. >  > Buffer overflow in reading tar archives ([CVE-2011-1778](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1778)) [3]. >  > Use-after-free bugs ([CVE-2011-1779](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1779)) [4]. >  > [1] <http://code.google.com/p/libarchive/source/detail?r=2842> Ark, PackageKit, and GVFS archive mounter currently don't support cab format.  > [2] > <http://code.google.com/p/libarchive/source/detail?r=3158&path=/trunk/libarchive/archive_read_support_format_iso9660.c> Ark, and PackageKit don't support ISO9660 format.

Not anytime in the short term unfortunately, my TODO list is quite long these days with higher-priority things. Last time I checked the patched didn't apply cleanly on 2.8.5 release which would involve further work. I'd be happy to package new patches however.   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=705849#c22)  Vincent Danen    2011-12-02 17:48:00 UTC  ``` The RHEL6 update was to patch 2.8.3.. would not the same patch apply to 2.8.4/2.8.5?  (I don't know, I've not looked).  I don't know what changed between 2.8.5 and 3.0.0, so perhaps rebasing may be out of the question of it introduces some ABI changes.  But if we're able to patch 2.8.3, surely that patch should apply to the other releases with minimal fuss?  Having said that, this isn't a high impact security flaw, so some delay is not a problem.   ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=705849#c23)  Anssi Hannula    2012-01-01 01:32:17 UTC  ``` The [CVE-2011-1777](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1777).patch attached to this report ([attachment #523601](attachment.cgi?id=523601&action=diff "CVE-2011-1777.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=523601&action=edit "CVE-2011-1777.patch")) is broken and breaks ISO support (found out by Mageia QA, <https://bugs.mageia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3941> ).  The upstream commit added braces to several 'if' statements, but in two places those are missing from this patch, causing the execution to enter the parent 'else' code blocks which are now wrongly associated with the added 'if' statements.  Additionally, the patch adds a return value to the heap_add_entry() function. However, there is an additional return statement in the function which should also now be changed to return ARCHIVE_OK, but this was missed.

Package        : libarchive
Vulnerability  : buffer overflows
Problem type   : remote/local
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-1777 CVE-2011-1778

Two buffer overflows have been discovered in libarchive, a library
providing a flexible interface for reading and writing archives in
various formats. The possible buffer overflows while reading is9660
or tar streams allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary
code depending on the application that makes use of this functionality.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.8.4-1+squeeze1.

For the testing (wheezy) and unstable (sid) distributions,
this problem has been fixed in version 2.8.5-5.

We recommend that you upgrade your libarchive packages.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.
