Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2011-1938:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability**

*   The vulnerability stems from a stack-based buffer overflow in the `socket_connect()` function within the PHP programming language. The overflow occurs due to the improper handling of long path names for UNIX sockets.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**

*   **Stack Buffer Overflow:** The `socket_connect()` function allocates a fixed-size buffer on the stack to hold the path for a UNIX socket. When a path longer than this buffer is supplied, a buffer overflow occurs.

**3. Impact of Exploitation**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to overwrite parts of the stack and execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the PHP process.
*  **Denial of Service (DoS):** Sending specially crafted, long path names can cause a buffer overflow leading to a crash or denial of service.

**4. Attack Vectors**

*   **Local Attack Vector:** The initial reports and the exploit code indicate a local attack vector using UNIX sockets.
*  **Remote Attack Vector (Indirect):** As stated in the Debian advisory, a remote attacker could trigger a buffer overflow via a long path name, suggesting an indirect remote attack could be possible.
**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs the ability to execute code on the target machine to exploit the vulnerability directly. In the context of a local attack, the attacker can control the path passed to the `socket_connect()` function.
*  **Remote Capabilities (Indirect):**  The attacker needs to be able to trigger the `socket_connect()` function with a crafted path, which could be achieved through a PHP application processing user-supplied data, including long pathnames.

**Additional Details from the Content**

*   **Affected Versions:** The vulnerability affects PHP versions 5.3.3 to 5.3.6.
*   **Exploit Code:** The provided exploit code demonstrates how a long pathname, along with a specially crafted address, can be used to achieve arbitrary code execution.
*   **Patch:** The fix involves proper handling of UNIX socket paths within the `socket_connect()` function to avoid the stack-based buffer overflow.
*  **CVE Assignment:** The CVE ID CVE-2011-1938 was assigned to this vulnerability.
*  **Affected Software:**  Multiple software products were mentioned that used vulnerable versions of PHP, including:
   + HP Secure Web Server (SWS) for OpenVMS
   + Debian php5 package
   + Mandriva Linux
   + OS X Lion
*   **CVSS:** The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 7.5, indicating a high risk.
* **CWE:** The identified CWE is CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer)
