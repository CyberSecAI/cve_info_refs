Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2011-1147:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the incorrect handling of UDPTL packets during decoding within the Asterisk software. Specifically, multiple stack and heap-based arrays within the UDPTL decoding routines can be overflowed by specially crafted packets.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Array Overflows:** The core issue is the presence of multiple stack and heap-based array overflows in the UDPTL decoding logic. These overflows occur when the software attempts to write data beyond the allocated boundaries of these arrays.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The vulnerability exists because the software does not properly validate the size or content of incoming UDPTL packets before processing them, which allows specially crafted packets to trigger the overflows.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The most direct impact of exploiting this vulnerability is a denial-of-service condition. The array overflows can cause the Asterisk process to crash, making the telephony system unavailable.
- **Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution:** The description also notes the possibility of "arbitrary code execution," meaning that a sophisticated attacker might be able to leverage the overflow to inject and execute malicious code on the server, gaining control over the system. This is a more severe outcome but isn't explicitly detailed on how to achieve.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote, Unauthenticated:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable by sending specially crafted UDPTL packets to a vulnerable Asterisk server. Authentication is not required to trigger the vulnerability.
- **UDPTL Packets:** The attack vector is specifically through manipulation of the content of the UDPTL packets.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** An attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the target Asterisk server.
- **Knowledge of UDPTL:** An attacker needs a certain level of understanding of how to craft malicious UDPTL packets to trigger the overflows.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects systems configured for T.38 pass-through or termination.
- The advisory provides mitigation steps, including disabling T.38 support or the chan_ooh323 module, and advises upgrading to patched versions of Asterisk.
- The advisory lists the affected versions, including various Asterisk Open Source, Business Edition, and related products.
- The vulnerability was reported by Matthew Nicholson.
