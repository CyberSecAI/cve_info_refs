Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2011-1990:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by Microsoft Excel failing to properly check the sign of an integer used as an index in an array. This lack of bounds checking allows an out-of-bounds write.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds array indexing:** The core vulnerability lies in the improper handling of array indices within Microsoft Excel's code. This allows a crafted Excel file to access memory locations beyond the intended array boundaries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to remote code execution.
*   **Full System Control:** An attacker could gain complete control of the affected system.
*   **Malicious Actions:** This control would allow the attacker to install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Specially Crafted Excel Files:** The primary attack vector involves a user opening a specially crafted Excel file.
*   **Email:** An attacker could send the malicious file as an email attachment, tricking the user into opening it.
*   **Web-based Attacks:** An attacker could host a website containing the malicious file. They would have to convince the user to visit the site and open the file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Craft Malicious Files:** The attacker needs the technical skills to create an Excel file specifically designed to trigger the out-of-bounds array indexing flaw.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker must convince a user to open the malicious file either through email or by visiting a malicious website.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is rated as "Important".
*   The vulnerability was not publicly disclosed prior to the release of the security bulletin and was reported through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.
*   There were no reports of exploitation before the security bulletin was issued.
*   The vulnerability primarily affects systems where Microsoft Excel is used, such as workstations.
*   The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Microsoft Excel conducts bounds checking on array index values.

**Mitigation and Workarounds**

*   **File Block Policy:** Use Microsoft Office File Block policy to block the opening of Office 2003 and earlier documents from untrusted sources.
*   **MOICE:** Use the Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment (MOICE) when opening files from unknown or untrusted sources.
*   **User Awareness:** Do not open Office files from untrusted sources or that are received unexpectedly from trusted sources.
