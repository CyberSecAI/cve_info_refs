Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-1485:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a race condition in PolicyKit's `pkexec` utility. `pkexec` was incorrectly checking the effective user ID of its parent process instead of the real user ID when making authorization requests. It uses `/proc/PID` to determine the parent's UID, which can be manipulated via `setuid` binaries to show an incorrect (effective) UID of 0 (root).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Race Condition:** There was a small window of time where an attacker could alter the parent process's effective user ID to 0 (root) after `pkexec` had checked it, before `pkexec` proceeded to execute the requested command.
*   **Incorrect UID Check:** `pkexec` used `/proc/PID` which returned the effective UID instead of the real UID. This allowed a user to spoof the UID check by using `setuid` binaries in a parent process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** A local attacker could exploit this race condition to trick `pkexec` into running applications or commands with root privileges, allowing for complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **`pkexec` Utility:** The attacker must be able to execute commands using the `pkexec` utility, which is part of PolicyKit.
*   **Setuid Binary:** An attacker needs to execute a setuid binary to create a parent process with effective UID 0.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   A standard, non-root user account on the target system.
*   The ability to execute a command using `pkexec`.
*   The ability to execute a setuid binary.

**Additional Details from the provided content:**

*   **Ubuntu:** Ubuntu's USN-1117-1 advisory provides clear instructions on the vulnerability, its impact, and the necessary package updates for Ubuntu 9.10, 10.04, and 10.10. This details how PolicyKit did not correctly verify the user, allowing for local privilege escalation using `pkexec`.
*   **Debian:** Debian Security Advisory DSA-2319-1 confirms the race condition vulnerability and provides the corrected package versions for stable (squeeze), testing (wheezy), and unstable (sid) distributions.
*   **Red Hat:** Red Hat's Bugzilla entry 692922 describes the vulnerability as a `polkitd/pkexec` issue. It mentions that the patches were created by David Zeuthen and that Red Hat would like to thank Neel Mehta of Google for reporting the issue. Red Hat also released RHSA-2011:0455 to address this vulnerability.
*  **Gentoo:** Gentoo's GLSA 201204-06 mentions that the `pkexec` utility initially checks the effective user ID of its parent process for authorization, instead of checking the real user ID, and provides the affected and unaffected versions.
*   **Patches:** The included patches show the fixes implemented in PolicyKit to address the vulnerability, focusing on obtaining the real UID.

In summary, CVE-2011-1485 is a critical local privilege escalation vulnerability caused by a race condition and incorrect UID checking in PolicyKit's `pkexec` utility. It allows an attacker to gain root privileges by exploiting a short window during `pkexec` execution.
