The advisory Timo posted mentioned ldm_frag_add() so it's public for all
practical purposes at this point:

static bool ldm_frag_add (const u8 *data, int size, struct list_head
*frags)
{
...
        f = kmalloc (sizeof (*f) + size*num, GFP_KERNEL);
        if (!f) {
                ldm_crit ("Out of memory.");
                return false;
        }
...
        memcpy (f->data+rec*(size-VBLK_SIZE_HEAD)+VBLK_SIZE_HEAD, data,
size);
        return true;
}

# PRE-CERT Security Advisory #
\* Advisory: PRE-SA-2011-01
\* Released on: 23 Feb 2011
\* Last updated on: 24 Feb 2011
\* Affected product: Linux Kernel 2.4 and 2.6
\* Impact: - privilege Escalation
- denial-of-service
- disclosure of sensitive information
\* Origin: storage devices
\* CVE Identifier: - CVE-2011-1010
- CVE-2011-1012
- CVE-2011-1017
## Summary ##
Timo Warns (PRESENSE Technologies GmbH) reported some vulnerabilities in
the Linux kernel that may lead to privilege escalation,
denial-of-service, or information leakage via corrupted partition
tables. Exploiting these vulnerabilities has been demonstrated by a "USB
Stick of Death" that crashes the Linux kernel upon connecting the stick.
The kernel automatically evaluates partition tables of storage devices.
Note that this happens independently of whether auto-mounting is enabled
or not. The code for evaluating MAC and LDM partition tables contains the
following vulnerabilities:
\* CVE-2011-1010
A buffer overflow bug in mac\_partition in fs/partitions/mac.c (for MAC
partition tables) allows to cause a denial-of-service (kernel panic)
via a corrupted MAC partition table.
For a patch, see
http://git.kernel.org/linus/fa7ea87a057958a8b7926c1a60a3ca6d696328ed
\* CVE-2011-1012
A division-by-zero bug in ldm\_get\_vblks in fs/partitions/ldm.c (for
LDM partition tables) allows to cause a denial-of-service (kernel
oops) via a corrupted LDM partition table.
For a patch, see
http://www.spinics.net/lists/mm-commits/msg82429.html
\* CVE-2011-1017
A buffer overflow bug in ldm\_frag\_add in fs/partitions/ldm.c (for LDM
partition tables) may allow to escalate privileges or to disclose
sensitive information via a corrupted LDM partition table.
## Workaround ##
Compile and use a kernel that does not evaluate MAC and LDM partition
tables. The corresponding configuration keys are CONFIG\_MAC\_PARTITION
and CONFIG\_LDM\_PARTITION.
## References ##
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show\_bug.cgi?id=679282
When further information becomes available, this advisory will be
updated. The most recent version of this advisory is available at:
http://www.pre-cert.de/advisories/PRE-SA-2011-01.txt
## ChangeLog ##
\* 24 Feb 2011:
- Added CVE ID to second vulnerability (CVE-2011-1012)
\* 25 Feb 2011:
- Added CVE ID to third vulnerability (CVE-2011-1017)

From: Timo Warns <warns@...-sense.de>
To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com
Subject: CVE request: kernel: fs/partitions: Kernel heap overflow via corrupted
 LDM partition tables

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

The kernel automatically evaluates partition tables of storage devices.
The code for evaluating LDM partitions (in fs/partitions/ldm.c) contains
a bug that allows to overflow the kernel heap. It may be possible to
escalate privileges by exploiting this bug.

(This bug is distinct from the LDM bug reported by Eugene Teo on
2011-02-23.)

This should affect both, 2.4 and 2.6 kernel. As a prerequisite,
CONFIG_LDM_PARTITION needs to be set.

Thanks, Timo

## Details

Kees Cook discovered that some ethtool functions did not correctly clear

heap memory. A local attacker with CAP\_NET\_ADMIN privileges could exploit

this to read portions of kernel heap memory, leading to a loss of privacy.

([CVE-2010-4655](/security/CVE-2010-4655))

Kees Cook discovered that the IOWarrior USB device driver did not correctly

check certain size fields. A local attacker with physical access could plug

in a specially crafted USB device to crash the system or potentially gain

root privileges. ([CVE-2010-4656](/security/CVE-2010-4656))

Goldwyn Rodrigues discovered that the OCFS2 filesystem did not correctly

clear memory when writing certain file holes. A local attacker could

exploit this to read uninitialized data from the disk, leading to a loss of

privacy. ([CVE-2011-0463](/security/CVE-2011-0463))

Jens Kuehnel discovered that the InfiniBand driver contained a race

condition. On systems using InfiniBand, a local attacker could send

specially crafted requests to crash the system, leading to a denial of

service. ([CVE-2011-0695](/security/CVE-2011-0695))

Rafael Dominguez Vega discovered that the caiaq Native Instruments USB

driver did not correctly validate string lengths. A local attacker with

physical access could plug in a specially crafted USB device to crash the

system or potentially gain root privileges. ([CVE-2011-0712](/security/CVE-2011-0712))

Timo Warns discovered that LDM partition parsing routines did not correctly

calculate block counts. A local attacker with physical access could plug in

a specially crafted block device to crash the system, leading to a denial

of service. ([CVE-2011-1012](/security/CVE-2011-1012))

Timo Warns discovered that the LDM disk partition handling code did not

correctly handle certain values. By inserting a specially crafted disk

device, a local attacker could exploit this to gain root privileges.

([CVE-2011-1017](/security/CVE-2011-1017))

Tavis Ormandy discovered that the pidmap function did not correctly handle

large requests. A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system,

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Hash: SHA1
PRE-CERT Security Advisory
==========================
\* Advisory: PRE-SA-2011-01
\* Released on: 23 Feb 2011
\* Last updated on: 11 Jun 2011
\* Affected product: Linux Kernel 2.4 and 2.6
\* Impact: - privilege escalation
- denial-of-service
- disclosure of sensitive information
\* Origin: storage devices
\* Credit: Timo Warns (PRESENSE Technologies GmbH)
\* CVE Identifier: - CVE-2011-1010
- CVE-2011-1012
- CVE-2011-1017
- CVE-2011-2182
Summary
- -------
The Linux kernel contains some vulnerabilities that may lead to
privilege escalation, denial-of-service, or information leakage via
corrupted partition tables. Exploiting these vulnerabilities has been
demonstrated by a "USB Stick of Death" that crashes the Linux kernel
upon connecting the stick.
The kernel automatically evaluates partition tables of storage devices.
Note that this happens independently of whether auto-mounting is enabled
or not. The code for evaluating MAC and LDM partition tables contains the
following vulnerabilities:
\* CVE-2011-1010
A buffer overflow bug in mac\_partition in fs/partitions/mac.c (for MAC
partition tables) allows to cause a denial-of-service (kernel panic)
via a corrupted MAC partition table.
For a patch, see
http://git.kernel.org/linus/fa7ea87a057958a8b7926c1a60a3ca6d696328ed
\* CVE-2011-1012
A division-by-zero bug in ldm\_get\_vblks in fs/partitions/ldm.c (for
LDM partition tables) allows to cause a denial-of-service (kernel
oops) via a corrupted LDM partition table.
For a patch, see
http://git.kernel.org/linus/294f6cf48666825d23c9372ef37631232746e40d
\* CVE-2011-1017
A buffer overflow bug in ldm\_frag\_add in fs/partitions/ldm.c (for LDM
partition tables) may allow to escalate privileges or to disclose
sensitive information via a corrupted LDM partition table.
For a patch, see
http://git.kernel.org/linus/c340b1d640001c8c9ecff74f68fd90422ae2448a
\* CVE-2011-2182
As Ben Hutchings discovered (http://lkml.org/lkml/2011/5/6/407), the
patch for CVE-2011-1017 (buffer overflow in ldm\_frag\_add) is not
sufficient. The original patch in commit c340b1d64000
("fs/partitions/ldm.c: fix oops caused by corrupted partition table")
does not consider that, for subsequent fragments, previously allocated
memory is used.
For a patch, see
http://git.kernel.org/linus/cae13fe4cc3f24820ffb990c09110626837e85d4
Workaround
- ----------
Compile and use a kernel that does not evaluate MAC and LDM partition
tables. The corresponding configuration keys are CONFIG\_MAC\_PARTITION
and CONFIG\_LDM\_PARTITION.
Solution
- --------
\* CVE-2011-1010
The MAC buffer overflow bug has been fixed in Linux kernel 2.6.37.2.
\* CVE-2011-1012
The LDM division-by-zero bug has been fixed in Linux kernel 2.6.37.3.
\* CVE-2011-1017
The LDM buffer overflow bug has been fixed in Linux kernel 2.6.38.6.
\* CVE-2011-2182
The missing LDM buffer overflow case has been fixed in Linux kernel
2.6.38.8.

When further information becomes available, this advisory will be
updated. The most recent version of this advisory is available at:
http://www.pre-cert.de/advisories/PRE-SA-2011-01.txt
ChangeLog
- ---------
\* 24 Feb 2011
- Added CVE ID to second vulnerability (CVE-2011-1012)
\* 25 Feb 2011
- Added CVE ID to third vulnerability (CVE-2011-1017)
\* 9 Mar 2011
- CVE-2011-1010 and CVE-2011-1012 have been fixed in Linux
kernel 2.6.
\* 10 May 2011
- CVE-2011-1017 has been fixed in Linux kernel 2.6.
- Added/updated URLs to patches.
\* 30 May 2011
- Added second patch to CVE-2011-1017.
As Ben Hutchings discovered (http://lkml.org/lkml/2011/5/6/407),
the first patch for CVE-2011-1017 was not sufficient. A second patch
considers that, for subsequent fragments, previously allocated
memory is used.
\* 11 Jun 2011
- CVE-2011-2182 has been assigned to the subsequent LDM patch.

I would still like something along the lines of a proposed patch. I believe
you folks (as you're much brighter than me), but I still don't quite grasp
the difference. I suspect there is enough public information for MITRE to
public a CVE though, so please use CVE-2011-1017.

Thanks.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).
