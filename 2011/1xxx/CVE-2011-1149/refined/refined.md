Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from shortcomings in the Android's `ashmem` implementation, specifically how it handles the "property space." This space, crucial for system security due to properties like `ro.secure`, was not adequately protected by `ashmem` in Android versions prior to Gingerbread (2.3).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate protection of the property space:** The `ashmem` implementation failed to properly protect the system's property space, allowing attackers to manipulate critical system properties like `ro.secure`.
*   **Exploitable `ashmem` implementation:**  The blog post and the linked GitHub repository ("g2root-kmod") highlight the exploitable nature of the `ashmem` implementation, indicating it can be leveraged to gain unauthorized access and privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Root Access:** Exploitation of the vulnerability could lead to gaining root access on affected Android devices. This is confirmed by the blog post author's work on a rooting exploit called "KillingInTheNameOf" which was functional on 2.1 devices, and the reference to another exploit in the github link that apparently works on 2.2.1 devices
*   **System compromise:** By gaining root, an attacker could potentially modify any system files, install malicious software, and completely control the device.
*   **Circumventing security:**  The ability to modify properties like `ro.secure` would disable important security checks and facilitate further malicious activity.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **`ashmem` exploitation:** The vulnerability is exploited through the `ashmem` mechanism, likely by manipulating shared memory regions and then the system properties.
*   **ADB interaction:** The blog post is titled "adb trickery #2", which suggests the Android Debug Bridge (ADB) may be involved in the attack process, potentially as a means of initiating or interacting with the exploit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to interact with ADB or the vulnerable service:**  Attackers likely require some level of access to the device via ADB or through another interface that interacts with the vulnerable `ashmem` component.
*   **Knowledge of `ashmem` internals:** A deep understanding of Android's shared memory and property handling mechanisms is necessary to craft an effective exploit.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The blog post mentions "KillingInTheNameOf" exploit targeting 2.1 devices, and a similar technique for 2.2.1.
*   The linked GitHub repository ("g2root-kmod") contains code related to the `ashmem` exploit, offering more technical insights into the vulnerability.
*   The blog post states that the property implementation was redesigned for Gingerbread (Android 2.3), indicating that the vulnerability was addressed in that version of the operating system.
*   The exploit "Gingerbreak" is also mentioned as being based on the same vulnerability, which the author intends to release in the future.
