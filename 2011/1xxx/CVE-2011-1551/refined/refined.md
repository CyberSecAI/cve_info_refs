The provided content discusses a potential vulnerability related to the `cobbler` daemon and its interaction with log files in `/var/log/cobbler/*`. However, it does not directly mention CVE-2011-1551. It only discusses issues relating to ownership of log files.

Specifically:

*   **Root Cause:** The `cobbler` daemon may run as root, while log files in `/var/log/cobbler/*` may be owned by a web service user. This discrepancy could lead to issues with `logrotate` and potentially `cobbler` itself when it accesses these log files.
*  **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Inconsistent user ownership of log files under /var/log/cobbler/* can lead to permission issues.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** While not explicitly stated, the impact could include the inability of `logrotate` to correctly rotate logs and potentially prevent `cobbler` from accessing log files needed for its operation.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector isn't about direct exploitation but rather about the consequence of misconfigured permissions.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** No direct attacker position is described. The issue arises from system misconfiguration, not from malicious actions.

Based on the above, the content doesn't provide details about CVE-2011-1551. It discusses a different, albeit related, issue with log file handling.
