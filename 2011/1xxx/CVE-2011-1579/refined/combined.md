| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=696360#c0)  Vincent Danen    2011-04-13 21:59:47 UTC  ``` Mediawiki 1.16.3 was released [1] to correct three security flaws:  Masato Kinugawa discovered a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue, which affects Internet Explorer clients only, and only version 6 and earlier. Web server configuration changes are required to fix this issue. Upgrading MediaWiki will only be sufficient for people who use Apache with AllowOverride enabled. ([CVE-2011-1578](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1578))  Wikipedia user Suffusion of Yellow discovered a CSS validation error in the wikitext parser. This is an XSS issue for Internet Explorer clients, and a privacy loss issue for other clients since it allows the embedding of arbitrary remote images. ([CVE-2011-1579](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1579))  MediaWiki developer Happy-Melon discovered that the transwiki import feature neglected to perform access control checks on form submission. The transwiki import feature is disabled by default. If it is enabled, it allows wiki pages to be copied from a remote wiki listed in $wgImportSources. The issue means that any user can trigger such an import to occur. ([CVE-2011-1580](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1580))  [1] <http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/mediawiki-announce/2011-April/000096.html>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=696360#c1)  Vincent Danen    2011-04-13 22:02:01 UTC  ``` Created mediawiki tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 696361](show_bug.cgi?id=696361 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2011-1578 CVE-2011-1579 CVE-2011-1580 mediawiki: multiple vulnerabilities fixed in 1.16.3 [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=696360#c2)  Vincent Danen    2011-04-13 22:02:04 UTC  ``` Created mediawiki116 tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: epel-all [[bug 696362](show_bug.cgi?id=696362 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2011-1578 CVE-2011-1579 CVE-2011-1580 CVE-2011-1765 mediawiki116 various flaws [epel-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=696360#c3)  Vincent Danen    2011-04-14 02:49:31 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 695577](show_bug.cgi?id=695577 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - MediaWiki 1.16.2 Cross-Site Scripting (2) and Access Control Bypass CVE-2011-1578 CVE-2011-1579 CVE-2011-1580") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=696360#c4)  Vincent Danen    2011-04-14 14:39:39 UTC  ``` 1.16.3 is not sufficient, as it does not fully fix the [CVE-2011-1578](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1578) issue.  Mediawiki 1.16.4 has been released to fully address it: <http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/mediawiki-announce/2011-April/000097.html>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=696360#c5)  Vincent Danen    2011-04-18 21:57:46 UTC  ``` The issue noted in [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=696360#c4) (incomplete fix for [CVE-2011-1578](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1578)) has been assigned the name [CVE-2011-1587](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1587).   ``` |  |

Debian Bug     : 650434

Several problems have been discovered in mediawiki, a website engine for
collaborative work.

CVE-2011-1578 CVE-2011-1587

   Masato Kinugawa discovered a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue, which
   affects Internet Explorer clients only, and only version 6 and
   earlier. Web server configuration changes are required to fix this
   issue. Upgrading MediaWiki will only be sufficient for people who use
   Apache with AllowOverride enabled.

   For details of the required configuration changes, see the upstream
   announcements:
  <http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/mediawiki-announce/2011-April/000096.html>
  <http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/mediawiki-announce/2011-April/000097.html>

CVE-2011-1579

   Wikipedia user Suffusion of Yellow discovered a CSS validation error
   in the wikitext parser. This is an XSS issue for Internet Explorer
   clients, and a privacy loss issue for other clients since it allows
   the embedding of arbitrary remote images.

CVE-2011-1580

   MediaWiki developer Happy-Melon discovered that the transwiki import
   feature neglected to perform access control checks on form submission.
   The transwiki import feature is disabled by default. If it is enabled,
   it allows wiki pages to be copied from a remote wiki listed in
   $wgImportSources. The issue means that any user can trigger such an
   import to occur.

CVE-2011-4360

   Alexandre Emsenhuber discovered an issue where page titles on private
   wikis could be exposed bypassing different page ids to index.php. In the
   case of the user not having correct permissions, they will now be redirected
   to Special:BadTitle.

CVE-2011-4361

   Tim Starling discovered that action=ajax requests were dispatched to the
   relevant function without any read permission checks being done. This could
   have led to data leakage on private wikis.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:1.12.0-2lenny9.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:1.15.5-2squeeze2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:1.15.5-5.

We recommend that you upgrade your mediawiki packages.

# Description

Wikipedia user Suffusion of Yellow discovered a CSS injection vulnerability, which occurs when CSS comments /\* ... \*/ are escaped with backslashes: \2f\2a ... \2a\2f. The bug is due to an error in the CSS escape sequence normalisation code which we introduced to fix bug 23687.

As with any CSS injection vulnerability, the impact is complete account compromise (XSS) for Internet Explorer users, and possible privacy loss due to arbitrary remote image embedding for users of other browsers.

---

**Version**: 1.16.x

**Severity**: normal

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=695577#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2011-04-12 04:08:11 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  <http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/mediawiki-announce/2011-April/000096.html>  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- Hash: SHA1  I would like to announce the release of MediaWiki 1.16.3, which is a security release. Three security issues were discovered.  Masato Kinugawa discovered a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue, which affects Internet Explorer clients only, and only version 6 and earlier. Web server configuration changes are required to fix this issue. Upgrading MediaWiki will only be sufficient for people who use Apache with AllowOverride enabled.  Due to the diversity of uploaded files that we allow, MediaWiki does not guarantee that uploaded files will be safe if they are interpreted by the client as some arbitrary file type, such as HTML. We rely on the web server to send the correct Content-Type header, and we rely on the web browser to respect it. This XSS issue arises due to IE 6 looking for a file extension in the query string of the URL (i.e. after the "?"), if no extension is found in path part of the URL. Masato Kinugawa discovered that the file extension in the path part can be hidden from IE 6 by substituting the "." with "%2E".  To fix this issue, configure your web server to deny requests with URLs that have a path part ending in a dot followed by a dangerous file extension. For example, in Apache with mod_rewrite:      RewriteEngine On     RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} \.[a-z]{1,4}$ [nocase]     RewriteRule . - [forbidden]  Upgrading MediaWiki is necessary to fix this issue in dynamically-generated content. This issue is easier to exploit using dynamically generated content, since it requires no special privileges. Accounts on both public and private wikis can be compromised by clicking a malicious link in an email or website. For more details, see [bug 28235](show_bug.cgi?id=28235).  Wikipedia user Suffusion of Yellow discovered a CSS validation error in the wikitext parser. This is an XSS issue for Internet Explorer clients, and a privacy loss issue for other clients since it allows the embedding of arbitrary remote images. For more details, see bug 28450.  MediaWiki developer Happy-Melon discovered that the transwiki import feature neglected to perform access control checks on form submission. The transwiki import feature is disabled by default. If it is enabled, it allows wiki pages to be copied from a remote wiki listed in $wgImportSources. The issue means that any user can trigger such an import to occur. For more details, see bug 28449.  The localisations were updated using content from translatewiki.net.  ********************************************************************** Download: <http://download.wikimedia.org/mediawiki/1.16/mediawiki-1.16.3.tar.gz>  Patch to previous version (1.16.2), without interface text: <http://download.wikimedia.org/mediawiki/1.16/mediawiki-1.16.3.patch.gz> Interface text changes: <http://download.wikimedia.org/mediawiki/1.16/mediawiki-i18n-1.16.3.patch.gz>  GPG signatures: <http://download.wikimedia.org/mediawiki/1.16/mediawiki-1.16.3.tar.gz.sig> <http://download.wikimedia.org/mediawiki/1.16/mediawiki-1.16.3.patch.gz.sig> <http://download.wikimedia.org/mediawiki/1.16/mediawiki-i18n-1.16.3.patch.gz.sig>  Public keys: <https://secure.wikimedia.org/keys.html>  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1.4.10 (GNU/Linux) Comment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - <http://enigmail.mozdev.org/>  iEUEARECAAYFAk2jxbAACgkQgkA+Wfn4zXn38gCWISDEZuC+Ap3Z4aBfibnuNSU1 EgCfeL2lo/4XtCuoKOwah0YbuaHyf5I= =S2JZ -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=695577#c1)  Kurt Seifried    2011-04-13 23:46:26 UTC  ``` > 1) XSS with IE <= 6 due to improper handling of uploaded file names Use [CVE-2011-1578](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1578)  > 2) CSS validation error in wikitext parser Use [CVE-2011-1579](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1579)  > 3) transwiki import neglects to perform access control checks Use [CVE-2011-1580](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1580)   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=695577#c2)  Vincent Danen    2011-04-14 02:49:31 UTC  ```   *** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of [bug 696360](show_bug.cgi?id=696360 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2011-1578 CVE-2011-1579 CVE-2011-1580 CVE-2011-1587 mediawiki: multiple vulnerabilities fixed in 1.16.3, 1.16.4") ***   ``` |  |

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

I would like to announce the release of MediaWiki 1.16.3, which is a
security release. Three security issues were discovered.

Masato Kinugawa discovered a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue, which
affects Internet Explorer clients only, and only version 6 and
earlier. Web server configuration changes are required to fix this
issue. Upgrading MediaWiki will only be sufficient for people who use
Apache with AllowOverride enabled.

Due to the diversity of uploaded files that we allow, MediaWiki does
not guarantee that uploaded files will be safe if they are interpreted
by the client as some arbitrary file type, such as HTML. We rely on
the web server to send the correct Content-Type header, and we rely on
the web browser to respect it. This XSS issue arises due to IE 6
looking for a file extension in the query string of the URL (i.e.
after the "?"), if no extension is found in path part of the URL.
Masato Kinugawa discovered that the file extension in the path part
can be hidden from IE 6 by substituting the "." with "%2E".

To fix this issue, configure your web server to deny requests with
URLs that have a path part ending in a dot followed by a dangerous
file extension. For example, in Apache with mod_rewrite:

    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} \.[a-z]{1,4}$ [nocase]
    RewriteRule . - [forbidden]

Upgrading MediaWiki is necessary to fix this issue in
dynamically-generated content. This issue is easier to exploit using
dynamically generated content, since it requires no special
privileges. Accounts on both public and private wikis can be
compromised by clicking a malicious link in an email or website. For
more details, see bug 28235.

Wikipedia user Suffusion of Yellow discovered a CSS validation error
in the wikitext parser. This is an XSS issue for Internet Explorer
clients, and a privacy loss issue for other clients since it allows
the embedding of arbitrary remote images. For more details, see bug 28450.

MediaWiki developer Happy-Melon discovered that the transwiki import
feature neglected to perform access control checks on form submission.
The transwiki import feature is disabled by default. If it is enabled,
it allows wiki pages to be copied from a remote wiki listed in
$wgImportSources. The issue means that any user can trigger such an
import to occur. For more details, see bug 28449.

The localisations were updated using content from translatewiki.net.
