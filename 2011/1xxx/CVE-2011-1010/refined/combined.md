PRE-CERT Security Advisory
==========================
\* Advisory: PRE-SA-2011-01
\* Released on: 23 Feb 2011
\* Last updated on: 11 Jun 2011
\* Affected product: Linux Kernel 2.4 and 2.6
\* Impact: - privilege escalation
- denial-of-service
- disclosure of sensitive information
\* Origin: storage devices
\* Credit: Timo Warns (PRESENSE Technologies GmbH)
\* CVE Identifier: - CVE-2011-1010
- CVE-2011-1012
- CVE-2011-1017
- CVE-2011-2182
Summary
- -------
The Linux kernel contains some vulnerabilities that may lead to
privilege escalation, denial-of-service, or information leakage via
corrupted partition tables. Exploiting these vulnerabilities has been
demonstrated by a "USB Stick of Death" that crashes the Linux kernel
upon connecting the stick.
The kernel automatically evaluates partition tables of storage devices.
Note that this happens independently of whether auto-mounting is enabled
or not. The code for evaluating MAC and LDM partition tables contains the
following vulnerabilities:
\* CVE-2011-1010
A buffer overflow bug in mac\_partition in fs/partitions/mac.c (for MAC
partition tables) allows to cause a denial-of-service (kernel panic)
via a corrupted MAC partition table.
For a patch, see
http://git.kernel.org/linus/fa7ea87a057958a8b7926c1a60a3ca6d696328ed
\* CVE-2011-1012
A division-by-zero bug in ldm\_get\_vblks in fs/partitions/ldm.c (for
LDM partition tables) allows to cause a denial-of-service (kernel
oops) via a corrupted LDM partition table.
For a patch, see
http://git.kernel.org/linus/294f6cf48666825d23c9372ef37631232746e40d
\* CVE-2011-1017
A buffer overflow bug in ldm\_frag\_add in fs/partitions/ldm.c (for LDM
partition tables) may allow to escalate privileges or to disclose
sensitive information via a corrupted LDM partition table.
For a patch, see
http://git.kernel.org/linus/c340b1d640001c8c9ecff74f68fd90422ae2448a
\* CVE-2011-2182
As Ben Hutchings discovered (http://lkml.org/lkml/2011/5/6/407), the
patch for CVE-2011-1017 (buffer overflow in ldm\_frag\_add) is not
sufficient. The original patch in commit c340b1d64000
("fs/partitions/ldm.c: fix oops caused by corrupted partition table")
does not consider that, for subsequent fragments, previously allocated
memory is used.
For a patch, see
http://git.kernel.org/linus/cae13fe4cc3f24820ffb990c09110626837e85d4
Workaround
- ----------
Compile and use a kernel that does not evaluate MAC and LDM partition
tables. The corresponding configuration keys are CONFIG\_MAC\_PARTITION
and CONFIG\_LDM\_PARTITION.
Solution
- --------
\* CVE-2011-1010
The MAC buffer overflow bug has been fixed in Linux kernel 2.6.37.2.
\* CVE-2011-1012
The LDM division-by-zero bug has been fixed in Linux kernel 2.6.37.3.
\* CVE-2011-1017
The LDM buffer overflow bug has been fixed in Linux kernel 2.6.38.6.
\* CVE-2011-2182
The missing LDM buffer overflow case has been fixed in Linux kernel
2.6.38.8.

When further information becomes available, this advisory will be
updated. The most recent version of this advisory is available at:
http://www.pre-cert.de/advisories/PRE-SA-2011-01.txt
ChangeLog
- ---------
\* 24 Feb 2011
- Added CVE ID to second vulnerability (CVE-2011-1012)
\* 25 Feb 2011
- Added CVE ID to third vulnerability (CVE-2011-1017)
\* 9 Mar 2011
- CVE-2011-1010 and CVE-2011-1012 have been fixed in Linux
kernel 2.6.
\* 10 May 2011
- CVE-2011-1017 has been fixed in Linux kernel 2.6.
- Added/updated URLs to patches.
\* 30 May 2011
- Added second patch to CVE-2011-1017.
As Ben Hutchings discovered (http://lkml.org/lkml/2011/5/6/407),
the first patch for CVE-2011-1017 was not sufficient. A second patch
considers that, for subsequent fragments, previously allocated
memory is used.
\* 11 Jun 2011
- CVE-2011-2182 has been assigned to the subsequent LDM patch.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

# PRE-CERT Security Advisory #
\* Advisory: PRE-SA-2011-01
\* Released on: 23 Feb 2011
\* Last updated on: 24 Feb 2011
\* Affected product: Linux Kernel 2.4 and 2.6
\* Impact: - privilege Escalation
- denial-of-service
- disclosure of sensitive information
\* Origin: storage devices
\* CVE Identifier: - CVE-2011-1010
- CVE-2011-1012
- CVE-2011-1017
## Summary ##
Timo Warns (PRESENSE Technologies GmbH) reported some vulnerabilities in
the Linux kernel that may lead to privilege escalation,
denial-of-service, or information leakage via corrupted partition
tables. Exploiting these vulnerabilities has been demonstrated by a "USB
Stick of Death" that crashes the Linux kernel upon connecting the stick.
The kernel automatically evaluates partition tables of storage devices.
Note that this happens independently of whether auto-mounting is enabled
or not. The code for evaluating MAC and LDM partition tables contains the
following vulnerabilities:
\* CVE-2011-1010
A buffer overflow bug in mac\_partition in fs/partitions/mac.c (for MAC
partition tables) allows to cause a denial-of-service (kernel panic)
via a corrupted MAC partition table.
For a patch, see
http://git.kernel.org/linus/fa7ea87a057958a8b7926c1a60a3ca6d696328ed
\* CVE-2011-1012
A division-by-zero bug in ldm\_get\_vblks in fs/partitions/ldm.c (for
LDM partition tables) allows to cause a denial-of-service (kernel
oops) via a corrupted LDM partition table.
For a patch, see
http://www.spinics.net/lists/mm-commits/msg82429.html
\* CVE-2011-1017
A buffer overflow bug in ldm\_frag\_add in fs/partitions/ldm.c (for LDM
partition tables) may allow to escalate privileges or to disclose
sensitive information via a corrupted LDM partition table.
## Workaround ##
Compile and use a kernel that does not evaluate MAC and LDM partition
tables. The corresponding configuration keys are CONFIG\_MAC\_PARTITION
and CONFIG\_LDM\_PARTITION.
## References ##
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show\_bug.cgi?id=679282
When further information becomes available, this advisory will be
updated. The most recent version of this advisory is available at:
http://www.pre-cert.de/advisories/PRE-SA-2011-01.txt
## ChangeLog ##
\* 24 Feb 2011:
- Added CVE ID to second vulnerability (CVE-2011-1012)
\* 25 Feb 2011:
- Added CVE ID to third vulnerability (CVE-2011-1017)
## Contact ##

key information, refer to http://www.pre-cert.de.

This is good enough for me. Please use CVE-2011-1010.
