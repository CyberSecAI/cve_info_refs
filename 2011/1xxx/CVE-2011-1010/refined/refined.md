{
  "CVE-2011-1010": {
    "Root cause": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `mac_partition` function within the `fs/partitions/mac.c` file when parsing MAC partition tables.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Buffer overflow"
    ],
    "Impact": "A corrupted MAC partition table can cause a denial-of-service (kernel panic).",
     "Attack vectors": "A maliciously crafted storage device (e.g., USB stick) with a corrupted MAC partition table. The kernel automatically evaluates partition tables of storage devices upon connection, even if auto-mounting is disabled.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to create a storage device with a malformed MAC partition table and have it connected to a vulnerable system."
