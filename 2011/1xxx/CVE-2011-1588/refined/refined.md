    "Weaknesses": [
      "Format String Vulnerability"
    ],
    "Impact": "The primary impact is a crash of the Thunar application. However, there is a possibility of arbitrary code execution depending on the system's configuration and compilation options (e.g., without FORTIFY_SOURCE)",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "The vulnerability can be triggered by copying or moving a file with a specially crafted name using Thunar file manager.",

An attacker must either control the file system where the target user may copy or move a file from, or convince the target user to copy or move such a file. No specific privileges are required.",
