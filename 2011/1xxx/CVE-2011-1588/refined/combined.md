1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- postfix
Remote attackers could potentially exploit a memory corruption issue
in postfix' SASL implementation to execute arbitrary code
CVE-2011-0411: CVSS v2 Base Score: 4.0 (AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N)
postfix did not clear the receive buffer after the STARTTLS command. A
man-in-the middle could therefore inject comma nds in the
unencrypted stream that get interpreted in the encrypted phase after
STARTTLS.
CVE-2011-1720: CVSS v2 Base Score: 4.3 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP2, SLE10-SP3, SLE10-SP4, SLE11-SP1,

information leakage vulnerability while using user-crafted ftp://
or file:// URLs with urllib(2).
CVE-2011-1521: CVSS v2 Base Score: 6.4 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:P)
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE10-SP4, SLE11-SP1
- viewvc
cvsdb.py in viewvc did not honor an admin defined row limit which
could cause high load on the database server. Viewvc was updated to
version 1.1.11 which fixes the issue.
CVE-2009-5024: CVSS v2 Base Score: 4.3 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.3, 11.4
- kvm
By causing a hot-unplug of the pci-isa bridge from within guests the
qemu process could access already freed memory. A privileged
user inside the guest could exploit that to crash the guest instance
or potentially execute arbitrary code on the host.
CVE-2011-1751: CVSS v2 Base Score: 7.4 (AV:A/AC:M/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C)
The virtio-blk driver did not properly validate read and write
request. A privileged user inside the guest could exploit that to
cause a heap corruption and crash the guest instance or potentially
execute arbitrary code on the host.
CVE-2011-1750: CVSS v2 Base Score: 7.4 (AV:A/AC:M/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C)
Affected Products: SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.3, 11.4

Affected Products: openSUSE 11.3, 11.4
- logrotate
This update for logrotate provides the following fixes:
+ Race condition in the createOutputFile function in logrotate allows
local users to read log data by opening a file before the intended
permissions are in place.
CVE-2011-1098: CVSS v2 Base Score: 1.9 (AV:L/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)
+ The writeState function in logrotate might allow context-dependent
attackers to cause a denial of service (rotation outage) via a
(1) \n (newline) or (2) \ (backslash) character in a log filename, as
demonstrated by a filename that is automatically constructed on the
basis of a hostname or virtual machine name.
CVE-2011-1155: CVSS v2 Base Score: 1.9 (AV:L/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)
+ In addition, the missingok option has been improved

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=698290#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-04-20 15:20:12 UTC  ``` A format string flaw was found in the way Thunar file manager used to copy / move files with % formatters in their name. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted file and trick the local victim into copying / moving it via Thunar, leading to Thunar executable crash or, possibly, arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running Thunar.  Issue severity note: ==================== The FORTIFY_SOURCE feature would mitigate the impact of this flaw to be crash only on particular Fedora versions.  Upstream patch: [1] <http://git.xfce.org/xfce/thunar/commit/?id=03dd312e157d4fa8a11d5fa402706ae5b05806fa>  References: [2] <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/04/15/4> [3] <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/04/15/5> [4] <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/04/15/6> [5] <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/04/18/6>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=698290#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-04-20 15:24:21 UTC  ``` This issue did NOT affect the versions of the Thunar package, as shipped with Fedora release of 13 and 14 (those versions do not contain the flaw relevant functionality yet).  This issue affects the versions of Thunar package, as scheduled to appear in Fedora release of 15 (Thunar-1.2.1-5.fc15) and as present in Rawhide (Thunar-1.3.0-3.fc16). Please schedule an update of those.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=698290#c2)  Christoph Wickert    2011-04-20 16:44:15 UTC  ``` Working on that.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=698290#c3)  Christoph Wickert    2011-04-20 17:14:35 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=698290#c1)) > This issue affects the versions of Thunar package, as scheduled > to appear in Fedora release of 15 (Thunar-1.2.1-5.fc15)  This is not correct, as written in the first mail the fix is already in 1.2.1. It's also mentioned in /usr/share/doc/Thunar-1.2.1/NEWS  1.2.1 ===== - Paste files in correct order ([bug #6504](show_bug.cgi?id=6504 "CLOSED NOTABUG - System Hang--Found Workaround")). - Fix truncated strings when loading and storing emblems ([bug #7171](show_bug.cgi?id=7171 "CLOSED NOTABUG - Does not report packet loss by kernel")). - Only erase top-level items from trash ([bug #7147](show_bug.cgi?id=7147 "CLOSED RAWHIDE - gdm seems not to execute GiveConsole")). - Don't interpret file display names as format strings ([bug #7128](show_bug.cgi?id=7128 "CLOSED WONTFIX - XFree86 XF86_SVGA hangs with Stealth II S220/ Verite V2100")).   > and as present in Rawhide (Thunar-1.3.0-3.fc16). Please schedule > an update of those.  Fixed in <http://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/taskinfo?taskID=3014396>   ``` |  |

### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.
