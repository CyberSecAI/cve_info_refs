From: Vincent Danen <vdanen@...hat.com>

Subject: CVE request for Asterisk flaws

Two flaws were fixed in Asterisk:

AST-2011-003: <http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/security/AST-2011-003.pdf>
- resource exhaustion DoS in Asterisk Manager Interface

AST-2011-004: <http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/security/AST-2011-003.pdf>
- DoS in TCP/TLS server due to NULL ptr deref

Could CVE names be assigned to these issues?

Thanks!

If a remote, unauthenticated, attacker were to rapidly open and close TCP connections to services using the ast_tcptls_* API, they could cause Asterisk to crash after dereferencing a NULL pointer.  This flaw affects 1.6.2.x and 1.8.x, and is corrected in 1.6.2.17.1 and 1.8.3.1.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).
