Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2011-1175:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from incorrect handling of TCP connections within the `ast_tcptls_*` API of Asterisk, specifically when rapidly opening and closing TCP connections.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **NULL Pointer Dereference:** A race condition during connection handling could cause Asterisk to dereference a NULL pointer, leading to a crash.
- **Incorrect TCP Connection Handling:** The code handling the opening and closing of TCP connections had a flaw in how it managed resources, leading to the NULL pointer dereference.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation results in a crash of the Asterisk server, making it unavailable to provide telephony services. This is a remote denial-of-service vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely, without requiring any prior authentication.
- **Rapid TCP Connection Cycling:** The attack is initiated by rapidly opening and closing TCP connections to services using the `ast_tcptls_*` API (e.g., chan_sip, manager, res_phoneprov).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to establish TCP connections to the vulnerable Asterisk service.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges or authentication.

**Affected Versions:**
- Asterisk Open Source versions 1.6.1.x, 1.6.2.x, and 1.8.x are all vulnerable.

**Patched Versions:**
- The vulnerability is corrected in Asterisk Open Source versions 1.6.1.23, 1.6.2.17.1, and 1.8.3.1.
- Red Hat also issued patched versions, such as asterisk-1.6.2.18-1.fc13 (Fedora 13), asterisk-1.6.2.18-1.fc14 (Fedora 14), and asterisk-1.8.3.3-1.fc15 (Fedora 15).

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is identified as AST-2011-004 in Asterisk's security advisories.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Blake Cornell and Chris Maj.
- The fix involves detecting the failure of the `fdopen` call and avoiding the NULL pointer dereference.
