Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2011-1077:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization, allowing malicious JavaScript to be injected through request parameters or stored form values.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Both stored (persistent) and reflected (non-persistent) XSS vulnerabilities are present. This means that malicious scripts can be injected and executed either directly through a crafted URL or stored within the application and executed when a user views the affected content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser session. This could lead to:
    *   Session hijacking.
    *   Defacement of the web application.
    *   Stealing of sensitive information.
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user without their knowledge.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Request parameters:** Malicious JavaScript can be appended to a request parameter.
*   **Form submissions:** Malicious JavaScript can be stored as a value in a submitted form.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious input containing JavaScript code.
*   No authentication is required, the vulnerability is exploitable by unauthenticated users.
* The attacker needs to entice a user to visit the malicious link or to interact with the malicious content.

**Affected Versions:**

*   Apache Archiva versions 1.3 to 1.3.4.
*   Unsupported versions 1.0 to 1.2.2 are also affected.

**Mitigation:**

*   Upgrade to Apache Archiva version 1.3.5 or higher.
