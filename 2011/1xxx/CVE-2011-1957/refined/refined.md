Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2011-1957:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by a large/infinite loop in the DICOM dissector of Wireshark. This occurs due to the DICOM dissector not checking for invalid payload data unit lengths.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Infinite Loop:** The primary weakness is the potential for an infinite loop within the DICOM dissector when processing malformed data. This arises from a lack of validation of data unit lengths, causing the loop condition to never be met.
*  **Lack of Input Validation:** The DICOM dissector fails to properly validate the payload data unit length.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation leads to a denial-of-service condition, as the application hangs or terminates due to the infinite loop.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malformed Capture File:** An attacker can craft a malicious capture file containing specially crafted DICOM data. When a victim opens this file using Wireshark, the vulnerability is triggered.
* **Network Injection:** It might also be possible to trigger the vulnerability by injecting malformed DICOM packets onto the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to create or modify packet capture files.
* The attacker needs to convince the victim to open the malicious capture file or inject malformed packets into a network the victim is monitoring.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
*   The vulnerability affects Wireshark versions 1.2.0 to 1.2.16 and 1.4.0 to 1.4.6.
*   A public reproducer (capture file) is available.
*   The vulnerability has been fixed in Wireshark versions 1.2.17 and 1.4.7.
*   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5 are not affected, but version 6 and Fedora releases 13, 14 and 15 are affected.
