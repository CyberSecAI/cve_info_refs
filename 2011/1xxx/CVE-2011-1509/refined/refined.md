{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The authentication process of ServiceDesk Plus obfuscates user passwords using a trivial and symmetrical algorithm in Javascript code with no secret. User passwords are stored locally in cookies.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use of a weak, easily reversible encryption algorithm (Caesar Cipher) for password storage.",
      "Lack of salt or secret in the encryption process.",
       "Storage of user credentials in cookies."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can bypass the authentication process and obtain usernames and passwords of registered users by stealing and decrypting the cookies. This can lead to impersonation and identity theft.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker can steal user cookies and decrypt the passwords by analyzing the JavaScript code in 'Login.js'.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to steal the cookies from a user's browser session, likely through network interception or other means."
