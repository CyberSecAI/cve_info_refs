Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2011-1966:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the Windows DNS Server improperly handling a specially crafted Naming Authority Pointer (NAPTR) query string in memory. Specifically, when a non-authoritative DNS server recursively requests an NAPTR record from an authoritative DNS server, the improper handling of the crafted NAPTR record in memory occurs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Handling of NAPTR Queries:** The core issue is the inadequate processing of NAPTR queries in memory within the DNS server software. This allows a crafted NAPTR query to trigger the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the system. This can lead to:
    *   Installation of programs.
    *   Viewing, changing, or deleting data.
    *   Creation of new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely without the need for authentication.
*   **Specially Crafted NAPTR Query:** The attack vector involves sending a specially crafted NAPTR DNS resource record query to a vulnerable DNS server.
*   **Domain Registration:** The attacker needs to register a domain and create a malicious NAPTR record associated with it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send network traffic to the target DNS server.
*   **DNS Knowledge:** An understanding of DNS resource records, specifically NAPTR records, is required to craft the malicious query.
*   **Domain Registration:** Ability to register a domain and configure DNS records.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Component:** The vulnerable component is `dns.exe`, the executable for the Windows DNS Server service.
*   **Systems at Risk:** Servers running the DNS role are primarily at risk. Systems without the DNS server role enabled are not affected.
*   **Mitigation:** Applying the security update released by Microsoft is crucial to fix this vulnerability. A temporary workaround involves disabling the DNS service if not in use, but this impacts functionality.
*   **No Public Disclosure/Exploitation (at the time of initial release):**  At the time of the security bulletin's release, the vulnerability was not publicly disclosed, and there were no reports of it being exploited in the wild.

The provided document also mentions another related vulnerability: CVE-2011-1970, which is a denial-of-service vulnerability caused by improper handling of uninitialized memory in the DNS server, though this is separate from CVE-2011-1966.
