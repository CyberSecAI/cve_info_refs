Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-1130:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Improper input validation for a number in `$_REQUEST['start']` in `QueryString.php` and also the `$start` variable in `Subs.php`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Insufficient input validation. The application doesn't properly sanitize or validate the numerical input received through the `$_REQUEST['start']` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The provided content does not specify the exact impact, but based on the vulnerability description, it could potentially lead to unexpected behavior in the application. 
*   It could cause issues or errors, potentially leading to denial of service (DoS), data corruption, or potentially other issues depending on how the improperly validated input is used in the code.
*   The vulnerability allows an attacker to potentially manipulate program logic by injecting malicious values.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attacker can send a crafted HTTP request containing a malicious value for the `start` parameter through the `$_REQUEST` array.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application. There are no specific privilege requirements.
