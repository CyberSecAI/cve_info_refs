    "root_cause": "Incorrect parameter validation in Windows kernel-mode drivers.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Information disclosure due to improper validation of function parameters by kernel-mode drivers."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can access data from any kernel-mode memory location, including the Security Account Manager (SAM) file which stores user password hashes. This can lead to further attacks, such as offline password cracking.",
