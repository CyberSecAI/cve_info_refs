  "CVE-2011-1477": {
    "description": "Multiple array index errors in sound/oss/opl3.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.39 allow local users to cause a denial of service (heap memory corruption) or possibly gain privileges by leveraging write access to /dev/sequencer.",
    "root_cause": "Multiple array index errors in the sound/oss/opl3.c driver.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Array index errors",
      "Heap memory corruption"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service (heap memory corruption) or possibly privilege escalation.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local users leveraging write access to /dev/sequencer.",
      "Specially crafted ioctl request sent to /dev/sequencer"
    ],
     "required_capabilities": [
      "Local user with write access to /dev/sequencer"
    ],
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability exists in the driver for Yamaha YM3812 and OPL-3 chips. By crafting a specific ioctl request, an attacker could write beyond the bounds of heap buffers."
