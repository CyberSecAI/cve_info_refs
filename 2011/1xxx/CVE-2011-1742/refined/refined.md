Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2011-1742:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Sensitive account credentials might be exposed in clear text within the EMC Data Protection Advisor (DPA) configuration file. This occurs under specific conditions, and the credentials are not stored in clear text during the product's normal operation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information:** The primary vulnerability is the potential exposure of sensitive credentials in a configuration file in clear text. This violates the principle of storing sensitive information securely.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Impact:** Partial. An attacker gaining access to the configuration file could obtain sensitive information (credentials).
*   **Integrity Impact:** None. The vulnerability does not allow modification of data.
*   **Availability Impact:** None. The vulnerability does not disrupt the availability of the system.
*   An attacker gaining access to these credentials could potentially gain unauthorized access to other systems or data that these credentials provide access to.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker needs access to the system where the DPA configuration file is stored.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local System Access:** The attacker must have the ability to access the file system of the server where EMC Data Protection Advisor is installed.
*   **No Authentication Required:** No special authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability, only access to the affected file.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is associated with **CWE-310 (Cryptographic Issues)**.
*   The provided CVSS v2 base score is **2.1/10** (local access, low complexity, no authentication, partial confidentiality impact). However, the EMC advisory gives a score of **7.2**, with a full impact on all three vectors (confidentiality, integrity, and availability). This might indicate a broader understanding of the potential consequences by EMC.

**Mitigation:**

*   EMC provides hotfixes to resolve this issue. Specifically, Data Protection Advisor versions 5.7.1 (Hot Fix DPA-9792), 5.8 (Hot Fix DPA-9792) and 5.8.1 contain fixes.
*   EMC strongly recommends customers to upgrade to these versions or apply the hot fixes at the earliest opportunity.
*  Customers can refer to EMC Knowledgebase solution esg122538 for instructions on how to mitigate the issue on existing installations.
