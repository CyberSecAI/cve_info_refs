* ##### **Security Issue 20101222-0700 Vulnerability Note**

  ##### SQL Authentication Vulnerability

  [IntegraXor 3.6.4000.5](https://www.integraxor.com/download/igsetup.msi) is now added with Read and Write level column to database table which allows user to configure security level for individual database entry. Now only user with security level higher than or equal to the read level can browse for trend and alarm data, and user with security level higher than or equal to the write level can acknowledge alarm. The credit for finding this vulnerability goes to Security Researcher from [Virtual Security Research](http://vsecurity.com) who has reported to [ICS-CERT](https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/) at 22nd December 2010.

  ![Project Editor Database Configuration](https://www.integraxor.com/doc/ug/images/pe-db-config.png)

  Every database could have its own read and write level setting which associated to User level/privilege setting. Note that the default level for both read/write is nil which has no security, this is to ensure compatibility issue for previously developed project. User must manually enter higher level of security as per project requirement.

  Along with this SQL authentication feature, we have also fit in the improvement done for Watch List – Now Watch Window could save user defined list created across session. And also server stability improvement. Lastly, debugging messages in status output will be hidden when debug mode is turned off.

  ##### Summary of Event

  + 22-Dec-2010: ICS CERT Contacted IntegraXor support team. Technical report for the vulnerability is received.
  + 27-Dec-2010: IntegraXor development team acknowledged the vulnerability.
  + 11-Jan-2011: Security fixed is issued as official release for general download.
  + 11-Jan-2011: Public announcement is made by IntegraXor support team.

* ##### **Security Issue SQL Unauthenticated Vulnerability Note**

  Earlier we [announced](https://www.integraxor.com/blog/security-issue-20101222-0700-vulnerability-note) that SQL vulnerability issue has been resolved by adding Read/Write security control onto database configuration, however the security researcher [Dan Rosenberg](http://www.vulnfactory.org/) from [VSR](http://www.vsecurity.com/) claimed that the vulnerability is not fully patched. We were forced to put this issue aside as we have putting on hold too many other features request earlier, and then when we returned to merge the production line with security fix, we were dragged by some crash issues for this fix and worst still bumped into unnecessary problem that due to [breaking change in ADO update KB983246 (included in Windows 7 Service Pack 1)](http://jiangshengvc.wordpress.com/2011/02/24/breaking-change-in-ado-update-kb983246-included-in-windows-7-service-pack-1/).

  And after the vulnerability is fixed we ourselves have been confused by the default configuration that has no Write security control. And finally after more tests and clarification from developer and analysts, last week ICS-CERT has confirmed via email that the reported SQL Unauthenticated Vulnerability has been resolved, that was right before we almost need to setup a conference call with ICS-CERT analysts.

  ![ICS-CERT mail thread](https://www.integraxor.com/blog.img/2011/03/SQL-unauthentication.png)

  So by the time ICS-CERT confirmed that issue has been \*completely\* resolved, the correspondence on one single vulnerability has accumulated up to 53 messages that span across three months. So far this is the vulnerability issue that we find most tedious to solve, and again we thank ICS-CERT for helping up in verifying this fix.

  Due to the confusion arised, we have decided to accept ICS-CERT recommendation to make Write security level default to a value of 100, but Read level remains as 0 which is open for world reading. This means guest user no longer allow to acknowledge alarm nor delete any report by default, starting from this [Release Candidate version 3.60.4042 or for any other version later](https://www.integraxor.com/download/rc.msi).
