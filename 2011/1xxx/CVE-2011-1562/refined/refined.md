    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "Lack of proper authentication checks in the SQL database access within IntegraXor SCADA software.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL Injection vulnerability due to unauthenticated access to the database. Specifically, the initial fix of adding Read/Write security control to the database configuration was insufficient. The default configuration had no Write security control.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could potentially acknowledge alarms or delete reports without proper authorization.",
      "Attack vectors": "Unauthenticated access to the SQL database via the SCADA application.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "No authentication is needed to exploit this vulnerability."
    }
  ],
  "additional_notes": "The vulnerability was initially addressed with the addition of read/write level columns to the database table for user configured security. However, a security researcher found that the vulnerability wasn't completely patched. The write security level was later defaulted to 100 to prevent unauthorized actions by guest users. The read level remains at 0, allowing open reading."
