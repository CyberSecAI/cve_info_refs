Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-1300:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is an "off-by-three" overwrite in the libGLESv2 library, which is part of the WebGL implementation in Firefox.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  **Buffer Overflow:** The core issue is a memory corruption flaw where data overwrites memory outside of an allocated buffer, specifically an "off-by-three" overwrite.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By exploiting the memory corruption, an attacker could potentially execute malicious code on the user's machine.
- **Bypassing ASLR:** On Windows Vista and Windows 7, the WebGLES libraries were compiled without ASLR protection. This means that if an attacker finds an exploitable memory corruption flaw, these libraries can be used to bypass ASLR, making the flaw as exploitable as it would be on Windows XP or other platforms.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is present in the WebGL implementation, suggesting that a malicious website or a web page with a crafted WebGL content could trigger the vulnerability.
- The attack can occur through the browser by exploiting a vulnerability in the WebGLES library used by WebGL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to deliver a web page containing malicious WebGL content to the victim.
- The attacker requires an understanding of the WebGLES library and the ability to craft a payload that exploits the "off-by-three" overwrite.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was found and reported by Yuri Ko.
- It was fixed in ANGLE revision 611.
- The vulnerability is also tracked by Google at [http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=70070](http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=70070) (hidden security bug).
- The fix was included in Firefox 4.0.1
