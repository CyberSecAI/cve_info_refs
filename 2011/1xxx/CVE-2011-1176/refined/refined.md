Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2011-1176

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the configuration merger within the `itk.c` file of the MPM-ITK (Multi-Processing Module) for the Apache HTTP Server. Specifically, it arises when the `NiceValue` directive is set in the configuration without a corresponding `AssignUserID` directive.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Configuration Merging:** The MPM-ITK module's configuration merger improperly handles cases where `NiceValue` is specified but `AssignUserID` is not. This results in the worker process not dropping privileges to the intended user and group.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Because of the incorrect merging, worker processes that should run under a non-root user end up running as root user (uid 0) and group (gid 0).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** Remote attackers can potentially execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the server. This allows them to compromise the entire system, gain access to sensitive data, or perform other malicious activities.
- **Complete System Compromise:** With root access, an attacker has complete control over the affected server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability remotely through HTTP requests.
- **Configuration Dependent:** The vulnerability is triggered by a specific configuration where `NiceValue` is defined without `AssignUserID` in a vhost or directory context.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the affected Apache server.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges or access to the server's file system prior to exploiting this vulnerability.
- The server must have the MPM-ITK module enabled and configured in a way that triggers the vulnerability (`NiceValue` set without `AssignUserID`).

**Additional Notes:**
- The default configuration of Apache with MPM-ITK is not vulnerable.
- The vulnerability only manifests when `NiceValue` is set without `AssignUserID`.
- The issue was introduced in MPM-ITK versions 2.2.11-01 and 2.2.11-02.
- The vulnerability is not present in the standard Apache HTTPD MPMs (prefork, worker, and event).

**Mitigation:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in apache2 versions 2.2.16-6+squeeze1 (Debian stable) and 2.2.17-2 (Debian unstable). Users should upgrade to these or later versions to address the issue.
- As a temporary workaround, the `AssignUserId` directive can be defined globally in the apache2.conf to prevent the default of root.
