```
Root cause of vulnerability:
- eCryptfs incorrectly validated permissions on the requested mountpoint, source directory, and during recovery, as well as mishandling keys and lock counters.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Incorrect permission validation on mount points (CVE-2011-1831)
- Incorrect permission validation on mount points during unmount (CVE-2011-1832)
- Incorrect permission validation on the source directory during mount (CVE-2011-1833)
- Improper handling of the mtab file, leading to potential corruption (CVE-2011-1834)
- Incorrect key handling during encrypted private directory setup (CVE-2011-1835)
- Incorrect permission handling during recovery (CVE-2011-1836)
- Incorrect handling of lock counters (CVE-2011-1837)

Impact of exploitation:
- Privilege escalation by mounting to arbitrary locations (CVE-2011-1831)
- Denial of service by unmounting arbitrary locations (CVE-2011-1832, CVE-2011-1834)
- Information disclosure by mounting an arbitrary directory (CVE-2011-1833)
- mtab file corruption, leading to potential arbitrary unmounts (CVE-2011-1834)
- Manipulation of keys during new user creation (CVE-2011-1835)
- Potential access to another user's data during recovery (CVE-2011-1836)
- Possible overwriting of arbitrary files (CVE-2011-1837)

Attack vectors:
- Local attacker

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Local user on the system
