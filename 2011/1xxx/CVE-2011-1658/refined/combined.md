| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=12393#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2011-01-12 14:47:39 UTC  ``` ld.so currently expands $ORIGIN in privileged programs' RPATH when $ORIGIN is listed alone (see _dl_dst_count and is_dst):  <http://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob;f=elf/dl-load.c;h=41b5ce76;hb=master#l220>  A local user can make ld.so load malicious DSO if she has write access to some directory on the same file system as:  $ ln /path/to/suid $ LD_PRELOAD=payload ./suid   $ORIGIN is not expanded if it's not the only thing in RPATH, e.g. in cases like $ORIGIN/../lib, as DL_DST_COUNT() returns 0 and expand_dynamic_string_token() uses strdup rather than _dl_dst_substitute():  <http://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob;f=elf/dl-load.c;h=41b5ce76;hb=master#l322>  If some privileged program is built with such RPATH, malicious DSO can be loaded regardless of the file system boundaries as:  $ mkdir '$ORIGIN' lib $ ln -s payload lib/lib-required-by-privileged-program.so $ /path/to/suid  ld.so searches relative to the CWD.   Few possible fixes were proposed recently, such as:  <http://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=commitdiff;h=96611391> <http://sourceware.org/ml/libc-hacker/2010-12/msg00001.html>  The problem with that approach is that with l_origin == -1, _dl_dst_substitute() expands "$ORIGIN" to "", which again triggers search staring from the CWD and can be abused as e.g.:  $ LD_PRELOAD=payload /path/to/suid   First two issues affect multiple glibc versions back, the third one was tested with Fedora glibc 2.12.2-1 packages. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=12393#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2011-04-11 14:22:23 UTC  ``` All mentioned cases now seem to be addressed in Andreas' fedora master git branch.  Following seem to be the relevant commits:  <http://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=commitdiff;h=96611391> <http://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=commitdiff;h=101fdc24> <http://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=commitdiff;h=049b59f7>  (In reply to [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=12393#c0)) > ld.so currently expands $ORIGIN in privileged programs' RPATH when $ORIGIN is > listed alone (see _dl_dst_count and is_dst)  is_dst() was changed by the above patches to flag $ORIGIN as recognized DST even when in __libc_enable_secure mode.  $ORIGIN is no longer expanded for executables, but it is for libraries.  > $ORIGIN is not expanded if it's not the only thing in RPATH, e.g. in cases > like $ORIGIN/../lib, as DL_DST_COUNT() returns 0 and > expand_dynamic_string_token() uses strdup rather than _dl_dst_substitute()  As is_dst() no longer ignores $ORIGIN for privileged programs, DL_DST_COUNT() does not return 0 any more and _dl_dst_substitute() is called.   Few comments regarding the applied changes:  - following comment in _dl_dst_substitute() is not completely correct:     /* $ORIGIN is not expanded for SUID/GUID programs        (except if it is $ORIGIN alone) and it must always        appear first in path.  */ Expansion does not happen for SUID/SGID programs, but does for the libs they use.  - following comment is bit misleading:     /* Also skip following colon if this is the first rpath        element, but keep an empty element at the end.  */ Colon is skipped if there was no output written to the result buffer yet, so it may happen multiple times if multiple rpath elements are skipped (e.g. $ORIGIN:$ORIGIN:/lib).  - is_dst() no longer uses start argument passed to it.  _dl_dst_count() only uses start to pass it to is_dst(). ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=12393#c2)  Petr Baudis    2011-04-16 00:41:46 UTC  ``` The initial comment is highly confusing, since when it says "ld.so currently expands $ORIGIN..." it talks NOT about master, but just about the fedora/ branches! In master, $ORIGIN is still expanded even for setuid programs, making just the hardlink attack possible in case someone is foolish enough to compile their setuid program with rpath $ORIGIN.  Therefore, the bug pretty much just describes which changes need to be covered when restricting $ORIGIN usage in setuid programs in master. An additional Ulrich's requirement is to whitelist system directories as $ORIGIN values even in setuid programs. ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=12393#c3)  Tomas Hoger    2011-04-17 20:48:57 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=12393#c2)) > The initial comment is highly confusing, since when it says "ld.so currently > expands $ORIGIN..." it talks NOT about master, but just about the fedora/ > branches!  Petr, I don't understand what confused you so highly.  Initial comment does point out several problematic cases, but it makes it clear that the first two affect currently used glibc versions (and various past versions, it seems the behaviour has not changed for 7+ years), and the third one was an issue that a *proposed* patch to address previous issues introduces, as that problem was not mentioned in the relevant libc-hacker thread.  > In master, $ORIGIN is still expanded even for setuid programs  As mentioned in [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=12393#c0), with an exception mentioned there too.  I fail to see how this contradicts the part of the [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=12393#c0) you quoted. ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=12393#c4)  Petr Baudis    2011-04-18 14:14:35 UTC  ``` You are right. I got a bit lost in the maze of all the RH bugs and advisories and in the end misinterpreted your comment. I was confused, not the bug. :-) ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=12393#c5)  Tomas Hoger    2011-04-18 16:13:38 UTC  ``` No worries, thank for looking! ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=12393#c6)  Petr Baudis    2011-04-22 01:41:55 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 5684](attachment.cgi?id=5684&action=diff "proposed patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=5684&action=edit "proposed patch") proposed patch  Ok, here is a patch I'd propose instead of the Fedora patches (96611391 and the two followups). It is a rather simple approach of reusing the existing logic for checking against insecure paths in rpath. Am I missing something, is there a case this mishandles? ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=12393#c7)  Tomas Hoger    2011-04-26 13:27:51 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=12393#c6)) > Am I missing something, is there a case this mishandles?  Seems to work correctly in all cases I previous pointed out.  Tested with the patch applied on top of vanilla 2.13. ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=12393#c8)  Andreas Schwab    2011-05-03 11:14:05 UTC  ``` This will reject any non-system library directory, which means a suid executable will no longer be able to use private libraries, even if they would be secure. ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=12393#c9)  Petr Baudis    2011-05-05 16:52:15 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 5708](attachment.cgi?id=5708&action=diff "updated patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=5708&action=edit "updated patch") updated patch  Fair point. The updated patch is to replace the original one, instead relaxing the original restriction on $ORIGIN not being alone in the path. Instead, in case of a setuid binary, it verifies fully expanded and /../-normalized path elements where $ORIGIN has occurred against the list of trusted paths. ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=12393#c10)  Ulrich Drepper    2011-05-07 15:46:09 UTC  ``` I mostly agree with the last patch.  It contained some bugs and removed a check which has to stay.  I've checked in an updated patch. ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=12393#c11)  Andreas Schwab    2011-05-09 08:40:44 UTC  ``` This comment:  	      /* In SUID/SGID programs, after $ORIGIN expansion the 		 normalized path must be rooted in one of the trusted 		 directories.  */  is bogus.  In a privileged program $ORIGIN is not expanded except when isolated, and the binary will never be in a directory that is considered trusted (only library directories are).  Also, check_for_trusted is only reset when the test for trusted directories has succeeded, if it didn't the next path element will be checked as well.  It also does not address the problem of $ORIGIN/../lib not being expanded but accepted. ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=12393#c12)  Petr Baudis    2011-05-09 10:24:19 UTC  ``` Good catch with the elem_trusted variable not being reset!  What prevents $ORIGIN that is not alone in the path from being expanded? The point of this change is to allow that to happen securely. ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=12393#c13)  Ulrich Drepper    2011-05-11 04:17:27 UTC  ``` There were a few issues which should be fixed now.  Subdirs of trusted directories are allowed. ```   [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=12393#c14)  Jackie Rosen    2014-02-16 19:41:13 UTC  Comment hidden (spam)  ``` *** Bug 260998 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** Seen from the domain <http://volichat.com> Page where seen: <http://volichat.com/adult-chat-rooms> Marked for reference. Resolved as fixed @bugzilla. ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=667974#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2011-01-07 14:51:17 UTC  ``` Following patch was applied to glibc packages to address dynamic linker privilege escalation issue [CVE-2010-3847](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-3847) (see [bug #643306](show_bug.cgi?id=643306 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2010-3847 glibc: ld.so insecure handling of $ORIGIN in LD_AUDIT for setuid/setgid programs")):  <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2010-3847#c26> <http://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=commitdiff;h=4b646a51f13fd6816c483fb24c308a13264c6d1a>  This change introduced a regression in handling of privileged programs that use $ORIGIN in R*PATH in the binary itself, or any of the depending libraries.  When running such privileged program, this issue causes dynamic linker to not expand $ORIGIN in R*PATH and search for additional dynamic objects starting from the current working directory.  This could allow a local user to escalate their privileges, or cause the program to fail to find required libraries.  Prior to the [CVE-2010-3847](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-3847), it was possible to escalate privileges when privileged program had $ORIGIN in R*PATH.  An attacker needed to have a write access to the file system hosting such binary, to be able to hard-link it to an attacker-controlled directory.  Then the attacker could LD_PRELOAD malicious library from the same directory and execute code with elevated privileges.  This flaw was of limited risk, as setuid/setgid binaries with $ORIGIN in R*PATH seem to be rare (there's no such binary in Red Hat Enterprise Linux).  With the 4b646a51 fix applied, attacker no longer needs write access to the file system with privileged program, and the relative-to-CWD search can be triggered by R*PATHs of depending libraries too.  Even with these loosened requirements, there are currently no privileged programs shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux known to be exploitable using this flaw.  To address this issue, 4b646a51 was reverted and the following patch was applied in fedora glibc git branch: <http://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=commitdiff;h=96611391ad8823ba58405325d78cefeae5cdf699>  Following patch is also required to avoid regressing [CVE-2010-3847](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-3847) fix: <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2010-3847#c22> <http://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=commitdiff;h=22cd1c9bcf57c5829d65b6da825f7a459d40c9eb>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=667974#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2011-01-07 14:55:28 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=667974#c0)) > To address this issue, 4b646a51 was reverted and the following patch was > applied in fedora glibc git branch: > <http://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=commitdiff;h=96611391ad8823ba58405325d78cefeae5cdf699>  This fix has not been applied to glibc master branch yet as discussed in the following libc-hacker mailing list thread: <http://sourceware.org/ml/libc-hacker/2010-12/msg00001.html>  It seems the change was rejected because it removes useful and desired behaviour of having $ORIGIN supported privileged programs' R*PATHs.  The discussion does not seem to mention risks of the feature though.  Andreas, have there been any other off-list discussions of this change?   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=667974#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2011-01-12 08:38:09 UTC  ``` Public now via Debian advisory DSA 2122-2: <http://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/2011/msg00005.html>  and Ubuntu advisory USN-1009-2: <https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-security-announce/2011-January/001226.html>  using patches listed in [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=667974#c0).   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=667974#c5)  Tomas Hoger    2011-01-12 10:32:44 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=667974#c0)) > To address this issue, 4b646a51 was reverted and the following patch was > applied in fedora glibc git branch: > <http://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=commitdiff;h=96611391ad8823ba58405325d78cefeae5cdf699>  F13 glibc-2.12.2-1 ld.so with this patch applied still searches CWD.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=667974#c8)  Andreas Schwab    2011-01-12 14:42:05 UTC  ``` If you can create a suid-root program all bets are off.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=667974#c9)  Tomas Hoger    2011-01-12 15:05:34 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #8](show_bug.cgi?id=667974#c8)) > If you can create a suid-root program all bets are off.  There are two cases here:  - problem with gconv that was introduced as part of [CVE-2010-3847](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-3847) fix.  This may lead to privilege escalation if some suid program uses gconv and it's the issue we need to address (e.g. by reverting "Never expand $ORIGIN in privileged programs" and adding "Don't expand DST twice in dl_open")  - second, there are issues that can lead to privilege escalation when you have suid with odd RPATH.  While such suids are not common, users can unintentionally introduce them in their systems and create and exposure that ld.so can (should?) mitigate.  It's probably worth discussing if linked should provide safety net for such cases, or these can be ignored as way too uncommon to be worth changing current status quo.  Hence I've created upstream bug that can be used to discuss if current behaviour is appropriate or not:   <http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=12393>   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=667974#c12)  Tomas Hoger    2011-04-03 20:24:51 UTC  ``` Raising impact rating to important.
