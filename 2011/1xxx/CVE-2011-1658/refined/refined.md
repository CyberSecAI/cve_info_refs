Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-1658:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the insecure handling of the `$ORIGIN` token within the RPATH (Run-Time Search Path) of privileged programs by the dynamic linker (`ld.so`). Specifically, when `$ORIGIN` is present as the sole element in a privileged program's RPATH, `ld.so` expands it, which can lead to loading shared objects from unexpected locations. Additionally, inconsistencies in how `$ORIGIN` was handled when it was not the only element in the RPATH also contributed to the issue.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure `$ORIGIN` Expansion:** `ld.so` expands the `$ORIGIN` token in the RPATH of privileged (setuid/setgid) programs when it is the only item in the RPATH. This expansion is not done when other elements are present in the RPATH. This behavior allows attackers to manipulate the library search path.
*   **Search from Current Working Directory (CWD):** The expansion of `$ORIGIN` can cause the dynamic linker to search for shared libraries relative to the current working directory, instead of the directory containing the executable, when the RPATH is not properly handled. This is dangerous for setuid/setgid programs.
*   **Inconsistent handling of `$ORIGIN`:** When `$ORIGIN` was not the only element in RPATH, it was not expanded properly, due to a flawed logic in `DL_DST_COUNT` return value.
*  **Bypass of Security checks:** Patches introduced to mitigate other vulnerabilities, specifically a fix for `CVE-2010-3847`, caused the linker to search in CWD when a privileged program has `$ORIGIN` in its RPATH or a depending libraries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability to load malicious shared object libraries (DSOs) when a privileged program is executed. This can lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the vulnerable program.
*   **Denial of Service:** If a malicious library is loaded, the privileged program may not function as expected. This could lead to denial of service or unexpected program termination.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By controlling the loaded shared library, an attacker can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the vulnerable SUID/SGID binary.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Hard Linking:** An attacker can create a hard link to a vulnerable SUID/SGID binary in a directory they control. If the binary's RPATH contains a sole `$ORIGIN`, and the attacker sets `LD_PRELOAD` and executes the binary, the attacker can load a malicious library from that directory.
*   **Directory Creation:** An attacker can create a directory named `$ORIGIN` and place a malicious library within a subdirectory and then execute the vulnerable SUID/SGID binary.
*   **Exploiting RPATH of Libraries:** The vulnerability can also be exploited if a library used by a privileged program has a vulnerable RPATH. This can happen even when the main executable's RPATH doesn't contain just `$ORIGIN`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Access:** The attacker must have local user access to the system.
*   **Write Access:** The attacker must have write access to a directory where they can place malicious shared objects, or they must be able to create a directory named `$ORIGIN`.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Binaries:** The attacker must be aware of privileged programs with vulnerable RPATH settings.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability is present in glibc versions prior to the fix.
* The initial fixes focused on disallowing `$ORIGIN` expansion, which proved to be too restrictive, so the solution was updated to allow `$ORIGIN` in secure directories only.
* The fix involves checking if the path after `$ORIGIN` expansion is within a trusted list of directories.
* The issue also affects libraries used by privileged programs, not just the executables themselves.
* Red Hat, Debian, and Ubuntu were affected by the vulnerability and released patches for it.
* VMware also released patches for ESX and ESXi due to this vulnerability in the glibc library.
