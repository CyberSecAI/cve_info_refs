## wnpa-sec-2011-06 · DECT, NFS, and X.509if vulnerabilities in Wireshark

## Summary

**Name:** DECT, NFS, and X.509if vulnerabilities in Wireshark

**Docid:** wnpa-sec-2011-06

**Date:** April 15, 2011

**Affected versions:** 1.4.0

**Fixed versions:** 1.4.5

## Details

### Description

Wireshark 1.4.5 fixes the following vulnerabilities:

* The NFS dissector could crash on Windows.

  ([Bug
  5209](https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=5209))

  Versions affected: 1.4.0 to 1.4.4.
  * The X.509if dissector could crash.

    ([Bug
    5754](https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=5754),
    [Bug
    5793](https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=5793))

    Versions affected: 1.2.0 to 1.2.15 and 1.4.0 to 1.4.4.
    * Paul Makowski from SEI/CERT discovered that the DECT dissector could
      overflow a buffer. He verified that this could allow remote code
      execution on many platforms.

      Versions affected: 1.4.0 to 1.4.4.

## Impact

It may be possible to make Wireshark crash by injecting a series of malformed
packets onto the wire or by convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace
file.

## Resolution

Upgrade to Wireshark 1.4.5 or later.

If are running Wireshark {{ end\_version }} or earlier (including Ethereal)
and cannot upgrade, you can work around the problem listed above by
doing the following:

* Disable the DECT, NFS (if you're running Windows), and X.509if dissectors:
  + Select *Analyze→Enabled Protocols...* from the menu.+ Make sure "DECT", "NFS", and "X.509if" are un-checked.+ Click "Save", then click "OK".

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
