    "description": "An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the way Windows kernel-mode drivers manage kernel-mode driver objects. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in kernel mode.",
    "root_cause": "Improper management of kernel-mode driver objects by Windows kernel-mode drivers.",
     "vulnerabilities": [
        "Use-after-free vulnerability"
      ],
