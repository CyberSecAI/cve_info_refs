Package        : qemu-kvm
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-0011 CVE-2011-1750
Debian Bug     : 611134 624177

Two vulnerabilities have been discovered in KVM, a solution for full
virtualization on x86 hardware:

CVE-2011-0011

   Setting the VNC password to an empty string silently disabled
   all authentication.

CVE-2011-1750

   The virtio-blk driver performed insufficient validation of
   read/write I/O from the guest instance, which could lead to
   denial of service or privilege escalation.

The oldstable distribution (lenny) is not affected by this problem.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.12.5+dfsg-5+squeeze1.

The unstable distribution (sid) will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your qemu-kvm packages.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## [Qemu-devel] virtio-blk.c handling of i/o which is not a 512 multiple

Hi,

I'm trying to write a virtio-blk driver for Solaris. I've gotten it to the point
where Solaris can see the device and create a ZFS file system on it.

However when I try and create a UFS filesystem on the device, the VM crashed
with the error
*** glibc detected *** /usr/bin/qemu-kvm: double free or corruption (!prev):
0x00007f2d38000a00 ***

I can reproduce the problem with a simple dd, i.e.
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/rdsk/c2d10p0 bs=5000 count=1

My driver will create a virtio-blk request with two elements in the sg list, one
for the first 4096 byes and the other for the remaining 904.

>From stepping through with gdb, virtio_blk_handle_write will sets n_sectors to
>9
(5000 / 512). Later on the code, n_sectors is used the calculate the size of the
buffer required but 9 * 512 is too small and so when the request is process it
ends up writing past the end of the buffer and I guest this triggers the glibc
error.

Is there a requirement for virtio-blk guest drivers that all i/o requests are
sized in multiples of 512 bytes?

Thanks,
Conor

```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other usersâ€™ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a programâ€™s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hatâ€™s CVE database.

When a technologyâ€”enabled and most likely used by defaultâ€”completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-trackingÂ  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.Â  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.Â  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.Â  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.Â  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.Â  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=699773#c0)  Petr Matousek    2011-04-26 15:26:50 UTC  ``` Writing the value 2 to I/O port 0xae08 ("PCI_EJ_BASE") initiates the PIIX3 PCI-ISA bridge removal. Unplugging this causes all of the ISA devices to be unplugged and right now the ISA (in particularly the RTC) devices cannot handle unplug gracefuly.  During MC146818 removal RTCState structure backing the emulated RTC is freed but embedded timers are not unlinked from active_timers list. Next time the timer fires SIGSEGV occurs. RTCState embedds several QEMUTimer structures that define function pointers (callbacks) that get called when timer expires.  Since the memory is freed, however, it is possible, under some circumstances, for the guest to cause a controlled allocation into the freed space, which can ultimately be exploited for code execution in the context of the qemu or qemu-kvm process.  ASLR partially mitigates this issue.  Acknowledgements:                                                                 Red Hat would like to thank Nelson Elhage for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=699773#c8)  Petr Matousek    2011-04-27 19:11:38 UTC  ``` Tested the reproducer on RHEL5 with qemu-kvm under gdb. The code base is completely different, qdev isn't there - ISA devices (RTC) are not connected to piix3 as in RHEL6. The VM stops responding but no sings of use-after free are present.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=699773#c9)  Petr Matousek    2011-05-02 09:43:59 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue only affects Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6. The version of the qemu/kvm as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 is not affected.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=699773#c10)  Petr Matousek    2011-05-19 10:34:28 UTC  ``` Upstream patch:  <http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2011-05/msg01810.html> <http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/96331/>   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=699773#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-05-19 13:02:44 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2011:0534 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0534.html>   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=699773#c13)  Mark J.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2011%3A0534)

## Topic

Updated qemu-kvm packages that fix two security issues, several bugs, and
add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for
Linux on AMD64 and Intel 64 systems. qemu-kvm is the user-space component
for running virtual machines using KVM.

It was found that the virtio-blk driver in qemu-kvm did not properly
validate read and write requests from guests. A privileged guest user could
use this flaw to crash the guest or, possibly, execute arbitrary code on
the host. (CVE-2011-1750)

It was found that the PIIX4 Power Management emulation layer in qemu-kvm
did not properly check for hot plug eligibility during device removals. A
privileged guest user could use this flaw to crash the guest or, possibly,
execute arbitrary code on the host. (CVE-2011-1751)

Red Hat would like to thank Nelson Elhage for reporting CVE-2011-1751.

This update also fixes several bugs and adds various enhancements.
Documentation for these bug fixes and enhancements will be available
shortly from the Technical Notes document, linked to in the References
section.

All users of qemu-kvm should upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to resolve these issues, and fix the bugs and
add the enhancements noted in the Technical Notes. After installing this
update, shut down all running virtual machines. Once all virtual machines
have shut down, start them again for this update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/kb/docs/DOC-11259>

# USN-1145-1: QEMU vulnerabilities

9 June 2011

A privileged attacker within a QEMU guest could cause QEMU to crash.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 11.04](/security/notices?release=natty)
* [Ubuntu 10.10](/security/notices?release=maverick)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [qemu-kvm](/security/cves?package=qemu-kvm) - Machine emulator and virtualizer

## Details

It was discovered that QEMU did not properly perform validation of I/O

operations from the guest which could lead to heap corruption. An attacker

could exploit this to cause a denial of service of the guest or possibly

execute code with the privileges of the user invoking the program.

([CVE-2011-1750](/security/CVE-2011-1750))

Nelson Elhage discoverd that QEMU did not properly handle memory when

removing ISA devices. An attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of

service of the guest or possibly execute code with the privileges of the

user invoking the program. ([CVE-2011-1751](/security/CVE-2011-1751))

When using QEMU with libvirt or virtualization management software based on

libvirt such as Eucalyptus and OpenStack, QEMU guests are individually isolated

by an AppArmor profile by default in Ubuntu.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=698906#c0)  Petr Matousek    2011-04-22 08:50:40 UTC  ``` It was found that virtio-blk driver in qemu-kvm did not properly validate  read and write requests from the guest. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to cause heap corruption, causing the guest to crash (denial of service) or, possibly, resulting in the privileged guest user escalating their privileges on the host.  On RHEL ExecShield (glibc heap/memory checks) mitigates this issue.  References: <http://www.spinics.net/lists/kvm/msg51877.html>  Upstream commit: <http://git.kernel.org/?p=virt/kvm/qemu-kvm.git;a=commit;h=52c050236eaa4f0b5e1d160cd66dc18106445c4d>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=698906#c4)  Petr Matousek    2011-04-22 08:58:07 UTC  ``` Created qemu tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 698911](show_bug.cgi?id=698911 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2011-1750 virtio-blk: heap buffer overflow caused by unaligned requests [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=698906#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-05-19 13:02:41 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2011:0534 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0534.html>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=698906#c8)  Petr Matousek    2012-03-30 17:34:17 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue does not affect versions of kvm package as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=698906#c9)  Fedora Update System    2012-06-07 23:06:38 UTC  ``` qemu-0.14.0-9.fc15 has been pushed to the Fedora 15 stable repository.
