**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization within HP SiteScope, leading to HTML injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **HTML Injection:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary HTML code into the web pages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could inject malicious HTML that could potentially lead to the disclosure of sensitive information.
- **Data Manipulation:** The attacker may also be able to inject HTML to alter the display or content of the affected pages which could lead to users making decisions based on false data.
- **Client-Side attacks:** The injected HTML could be used to redirect the user to malicious websites, steal cookies, or install malware.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, meaning the attacker does not need physical access to the server.
- **Cross-Site:** The attack occurs by injecting malicious HTML into the web application that is then displayed to another user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable HP SiteScope application.
- **Knowledge of the Application:** The attacker needs to understand where user-controlled input is reflected on the page without proper sanitization.
- **Ability to Craft Malicious HTML:** The attacker needs to be able to create malicious HTML payloads for injection.
