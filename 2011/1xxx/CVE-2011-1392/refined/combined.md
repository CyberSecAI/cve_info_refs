# Security Bulletin: Rational Rhapsody for Windows Blueberry FlashBack ActiveX Control vulnerabilities (CVE-2011-1388, CVE-2011-1391, CVE-2011-1392)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

There are multiple high risk security vulnerabilities with the Blueberry FlashBack ActiveX control shipped by IBM Rational Rhapsody for Windows V7.6 and earlier versions. Problem occurs outside Rhapsody when control is invoked as ActiveX by Microsoft Internet Explorer.

## Vulnerability Details

| --- | --- |

**CVE IDs:** [CVE-2011-1388](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-1388), [CVE-2011-1391](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-1391), [CVE-2011-1392](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-1392)

**Important Note:** FlashBack is a third-party control that may have been installed by other applications. If other applications are using FlashBack, you must also implement the workaround. You should contact the appropriate vendor or vendors whose applications also use FlashBack.

**Description:** It is possible for an attacker to compromise the Blueberry FlashBack ActiveX control ("BB FlashBack Recorder.dll") used within Rational Rhapsody for Windows to remotely execute arbitrary code by instantiating this control from Microsoft Internet Explorer Web browsers.

Known methods of exploiting the vulnerabilities in this control include Start(), PauseAndSave(), InsertMarker(), InsertSoundToFBRAtMarker() and TestCompatibilityRecordMode().

For a remote attacker to exploit these vulnerabilities in Rhapsody releases, the following must be accomplished:

1. You must have Rational Rhapsody installed on the machine.

* **Important Note:** Continuous use of Rhapsody is not required; the vulnerabilities may be exploited against the ActiveX control regardless of the use of the product.

3. Attacker needs to create malicious code that would exploit the ActiveX control. This code could be part of an attachment by means of e-mail or a Web page.
4. User must be persuaded to execute the attachment or follow a Web site link that contains the malicious code via the Microsoft Internet Explorer Web browser.
5. On Internet Zone, the user must authorize the ActiveX pop-up dialog before it could be used.
6. As of December 21, 2011, IBM has not received any reports of customer issues related to these security vulnerabilities.

## Affected Products and Versions

Rational Rhapsody for Windows 7.5.x

Rational Rhapsody for Windows 7.6

## Remediation/Fixes

Upgrade to [Rational Rhapsody 7.6.1](http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24031530) or later.

## Workarounds and Mitigations

**Workarounds:**

**Option #1** - Disable the use of the vulnerable ActiveX control within Internet Explorer**.**

 **Option #2** - Disable ActiveXProperly securing your Web browser to limit ActiveX controls can help avoid this issue. Limiting the ActiveX controls would both notify the user, and force the user to take some action to allow the ActiveX functionality.

**Note**: The Firefox browser does not support ActiveX **controls.**

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
