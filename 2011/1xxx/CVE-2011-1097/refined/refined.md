  "CVE-2011-1097": {
    "match": true,
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "A memory safety bug in rsync's generator process (receiving side) when incremental recursion is on, --delete is on, and --owner is off. Some deletion functions temporarily increment a global variable (`file_extra_cnt`) which affects the in-memory format of file_structs. This increment can also affect incremental file-list chunks received during these functions, causing them to be created with the wrong format.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Incorrect handling of a global variable during deletion operations",
        "Potential for memory corruption due to incorrect file_struct format",
          "Improper update of file_extra_cnt"
      ],
      "impact": "The corruption of file_structs, particularly the `F_HL_PREV` field (used with hard links), can lead to incorrect results, valgrind errors, and potential crashes. There is a potential for arbitrary code execution, though not confirmed. This vulnerability can be triggered when the receiving side is pushing data from the sender.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Malicious rsync server sending crafted data to a client",
        "Client pushing data to a server with anonymous rsync upload enabled"
      ],
       "required_attacker_capabilities": [
        "Ability to set up a malicious rsync server or control a client with the ability to push data.",
           "Control of rsync server or client to trigger the vulnerable conditions"
      ]
    },
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability is triggered by specific rsync options used in combination during a transfer where the receiving end allows pushes. The issue is mitigated somewhat because it is on the receiving end of the connection, but it is still considered a security flaw due to the potential for remote code execution. The vulnerability affects rsync versions 3.0.0 and later up to the version fixed. The fix involves correcting how the global counter (`file_extra_cnt`) is handled during file deletion operations to prevent corruption. The client is vulnerable during a push to the server due to the server sending the file list."
