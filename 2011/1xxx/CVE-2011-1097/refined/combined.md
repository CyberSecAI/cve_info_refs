1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- mailman
mailman was updated to version 2.1.14 to fix several cross-site-scripting
(XSS) vulnerabilities:
CVE-2010-3089: CVSS v2 Base Score: 4.0 (low) (AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:N/I:P/A:N)
CVE-2011-0707: CVSS v2 Base Score: 3.5 (moderate) (AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:N/I:P/A:N)
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE10-SP4, SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.2, 11.3
- openssl
Malicious clients could downgrade a connection to a low strength cipher
suite on session resumption if the server offers such ciphers.
CVE-2010-4180: CVSS v2 Base Score: 4.3 (moderate) (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP3, SLE10-SP4
(Packages for SLE11 amd openSUSE were released already.)
- tgt
This update of tgt fixes multiple bugs:
- tgtadm user unbind broken [bnc#633111]
- iscsitarget package not supported [bnc#513934]

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=675036#c0)  Matt McCutchen    2011-02-04 00:21:09 UTC  ``` Wayne Davison and I have identified a memory safety bug in rsync >= 3.0.0, affecting the generator process (receiving side) when incremental recursion is on, --delete is on, and --owner is off.  Under these conditions, some of the generator's deletion functions temporarily increment file_extra_cnt, a global variable that governs the in-memory format of file_structs, and restore the original value on completion.  The increment was intended to only affect the temporary file lists used to implement deletion, but it can also affect incremental file-list chunks that happen to be received during a call to one of these functions, which will be created in the wrong format.  When the original file_extra_cnt is restored, the value originally stored in each applicable OPT_EXTRA field will show up in the next one as listed in rsync.h.  Most of the fields are opaque data or are validated upon use, so their corruption leads to incorrect results but no danger to rsync itself.  However, rsync uses the invariant that the F_HL_PREV field (applicable when --hard-links is on) forms a linked list of file indices consistent with the FLAG_HLINK* flags.  The movement of the F_HL_GNUM values (which can be chosen arbitrarily by the sender subject to some constraints) into the F_HL_PREV field has the potential to break memory safety.  Upstream fix for the 3.0.x branch (sum of three commits): <http://gitweb.samba.org/?p=rsync.git;a=commitdiff;h=83b94efa6b60a3ff5eee4c5f7812c617a90a03f6;hp=c8255147b06b74dad940d32f9cef5fbe17595239>  Upstream bug report (marked fixed, but a full explanation has not been posted due to the security implications): <https://bugzilla.samba.org/show_bug.cgi?id=7936>  I would appreciate Red Hat's help in getting a CVE and determining the severity of the issue.  In my testing, I have been able to make an rsync 3.0.7 generator incur valgrind errors and then segfault (details forthcoming), but we have neither confirmed nor ruled out arbitrary code execution.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=675036#c1)  Vincent Danen    2011-02-04 17:36:33 UTC  ``` These issues affecting the _receiving_ side of rsync, not the server side?  So this would happen regardless of whether this was a connection to rsyncd or rsync over ssh?  If the only impact is client-side, I'm not sure this would be considered a security flaw.  Can this be triggered with some setting server-side, or is it dependent upon client-side options?   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=675036#c2)  Matt McCutchen    2011-02-05 03:41:07 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=675036#c1)) > These issues affecting the _receiving_ side of rsync,  Correct.  > not the server side?  Rsync daemons can have writable modules, though maybe that is not something Red Hat supports for its customers.  > So > this would happen regardless of whether this was a connection to rsyncd or > rsync over ssh?  Yes, as far as I know.  I have only tested with a remote shell.  > If the only impact is client-side, I'm not sure this would be considered a > security flaw.  I think the problem may never occur on a pull because the generator's output goes directly to the console instead of being sent across the socket and triggering the select loop that also receives file-list chunks.  Wayne, can you confirm this?   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=675036#c3)  Wayne Davison    2011-02-19 16:00:38 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=675036#c2)) > I think the problem may never occur on a pull because the generator's output > goes directly to the console instead of being sent across the socket and > triggering the select loop that also receives file-list chunks.  Wayne, can you > confirm this?  Under typical circumstances, yes.  However, if there is a timeout in effect and the deletions are slow, the generator could sent a keep-alive message, which could trigger the checking for incoming file-list data.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=675036#c4)  Vincent Danen    2011-02-25 19:07:46 UTC  ``` Are you saying that if client pushes to server (effectively receiving by the server), that it could cause the server to crash?  Do you have something on hand that we can use to reproduce this?  If the client is able to make a rsync server crash by pushing to it (whether it is using ssh or not), then we certainly need to investigate this further.  Also, are you sure this only affects >= 3.0.0?  Just trying to determine what products would be affected by this.  Sorry for taking so long to get back to you on this.  Vojtech, can you take a look at this and chime in?  I'm not sure I fully understand what is going on here, and whether or not this can be used to cause a problem on the server side of things (I'm not overly interested in client-side crashes when using particular options, but if it can be used to crash an rsync server, then we need to worry about it).  Thanks.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=675036#c5)  Matt McCutchen    2011-02-25 22:31:07 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=675036#c4)) > Are you saying that if client pushes to server (effectively receiving by the > server), that it could cause the server to crash?  Yes, though in the case of an rsync daemon, only the worker process for that connection would crash.  > Do you have something on > hand that we can use to reproduce this?  I just need to pack up a kit.  Hopefully I will get to it tonight.  > If the client is able to make a rsync > server crash by pushing to it (whether it is using ssh or not), then we > certainly need to investigate this further.  I'm not worried about crashes, but about whether arbitrary code execution might be possible.  > Also, are you sure this only affects >= 3.0.0?  Yes.  The bug is in the incremental recursion feature added in 3.0.0.  > I'm not overly interested in > client-side crashes when using particular options  In general I believe client security is widely underappreciated, but I think it's pretty unlikely that a user would pull from an untrusted server with -H.  I never have.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=675036#c6)  Vincent Danen    2011-02-25 23:45:56 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=675036#c5))  > Yes, though in the case of an rsync daemon, only the worker process for that > connection would crash.  Ahh, so it wouldn't cause the daemon itself to crash (the parent), so there is no DoS issue here then.   > I just need to pack up a kit.  Hopefully I will get to it tonight.  That would be fantastic, thank you.  > I'm not worried about crashes, but about whether arbitrary code execution might > be possible.  Yes, of course, but making it crash in the first place would identify whether or not there is something that could lead to arbitrary code execution.  > Yes.  The bug is in the incremental recursion feature added in 3.0.0.  Ok, great.  Thanks for that confirmation.  > > I'm not overly interested in > > client-side crashes when using particular options >  > In general I believe client security is widely underappreciated, but I think > it's pretty unlikely that a user would pull from an untrusted server with -H.  > I never have.  If it's just a client-side _crash_, those happen all the time.  I wouldn't call it security, and don't believe many others would either.  Having said that, if there was something the _server_ could do to make the _client_ execute arbitrary code, then we certainly have a problem.  If the client can only make itself execute arbitrary code, well, it could do that without this flaw.  So on the client side of things, I don't believe security is a concern unless some options on the _server_ will make the client execute arbitrary code (and if the server can tell it what code to execute, of course).   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=675036#c9)  Josh Bressers    2011-03-09 20:18:59 UTC  ``` I'm giving this [CVE-2011-1097](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1097).  This is one of those issues we can't prove non-exploitable. Valgrind clearly shows illegal heap writes, which is good enough for me.  The issue appears to be mitigated by the fact that it's on the receiving end. You'd have to connect to a malicious rsync server, or allow anonymous rsync uploads (which has a whole heap of issues in itself).  I'm going to rate it as having moderate security severity becuase of these factors.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=675036#c10)  Josh Bressers    2011-03-09 20:20:43 UTC  ``` As vendor-sec is no more, we don't have a nice way to coordinate this among vendors in a private manner.  Unless there is an error with my above analysis, I propose we make this public via the oss-security mailing list.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=675036#c11)  Matt McCutchen    2011-03-09 21:00:57 UTC  ``` It might be preferable to wait until rsync 3.0.8 is released with the fix.  Wayne, could you move that process along?  I will help test.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=675036#c14)  Josh Bressers    2011-03-14 19:59:25 UTC  ``` Right, once you guys release rsync-3.0.8, please make sure the changelog mentions the CVE id, and we'll consider it public.  Thanks.   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=675036#c16)  Josh Bressers    2011-03-15 19:36:21 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Wayne Davison and Matt McCutchen for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=675036#c19)  Wayne Davison    2011-03-26 21:48:22 UTC  ``` FYI, I've released rsync 3.0.8.   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=675036#c20)  Tomas Hoger    2011-03-28 07:38:22 UTC  ``` Thank you for the notification, Wayne.  Public now via rsync 3.0.8 upstream release:   <http://samba.anu.edu.au/ftp/rsync/src/rsync-3.0.8-NEWS>      - Fixed a data-corruption issue when preserving hard-links without       preserving file ownership, and doing deletions either before or during       the transfer ([CVE-2011-1097](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1097)).  This fixes some assert errors in the       hard-linking code, and some potential failed checksums (via -c) that       should have matched.   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=675036#c21)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-03-28 16:32:15 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2011:0390 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0390.html>   ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
