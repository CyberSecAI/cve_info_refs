{
  "CVE-2011-1564": [
    {
      "Root cause": "Multiple buffer overflows and an integer overflow in DATAC RealWin server.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Stack buffer overflows due to insufficient bounds checking when copying input strings into fixed-size stack buffers.",
        "Integer overflow leading to a heap overflow due to improper calculation of memory allocation size based on client-provided data."
      ],
      "Impact": "Remote code execution or denial of service by overflowing buffers, potentially allowing an attacker to control the server.",
      "Attack vectors": [
        "Sending specially crafted network packets to the server listening on port 910.",
        "Specifically, crafted `On_FC_CONNECT_FCS_LOGIN`, `On_FC_CTAGLIST_FCS_CADDTAG`, `On_FC_CTAGLIST_FCS_CDELTAG`, `On_FC_CTAGLIST_FCS_ADDTAGMS`, `On_FC_RFUSER_FCS_LOGIN`, various `On_FC_BINFILE_FCS_*FILE`, `On_FC_MISC_FCS_MSGBROADCAST`, `On_FC_MISC_FCS_MSGSEND`, `On_FC_CGETTAG_FCS_GETTELEMETRY`, `On_FC_CGETTAG_FCS_GETCHANNELTELEMETRY`, `On_FC_CGETTAG_FCS_SETTELEMETRY`, `On_FC_CGETTAG_FCS_SETCHANNELTELEMETRY`, and `On_FC_SCRIPT_FCS_STARTPROG` packets are used to exploit the vulnerabilities"
      ],
       "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server listening on port 910 and the ability to send network packets."
