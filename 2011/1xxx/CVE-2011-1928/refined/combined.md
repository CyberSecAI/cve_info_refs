How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with

Package: libapr1
Version: 1.4.2-8
Severity: important
Tags: upstream

Hello,

We have found that the last security update (1.4.2-6+squeeze1, 1.2.12-5+lenny3)
causes apr_fnmatch to enter an infinite loop, on particular patters.

For instance, with the following configuration directive:
    <Location "/*/WEB-INF/">
        deny from all
    </Location>
if someone visits any URL, an apache2 thread will start consuming 100% CPU.

This is introduced by the backport
debian/patches/028_fnmatch_CVE-2011-0419.dpatch, but it can be reproduced with the vanilla apr.

Regards,

Hi,
I can confirm the same problem on our prod server after upgrade to
libapr1-1.2.12-5+lenny3:
the problem is triggered by some configuration directive in apache.conf;

package details:
ii  apache2
2.2.9-10+lenny9            Apache HTTP Server metapackage
ii  apache2-mpm-prefork                             2.2.9-10+lenny9
        Apache HTTP Server - traditional non-threade
ii  apache2-utils
2.2.9-10+lenny9            utility programs for webservers
ii  apache2.2-common                                2.2.9-10+lenny9
        Apache HTTP Server common files
ii  libapache2-mod-auth-pgsql                      2.0.3-5
            Module for Apache2 which provides pgsql auth
ii  libapr1
1.2.12-5+lenny3            The Apache Portable Runtime Library
ii  libaprutil1
1.2.12+dfsg-8+lenny5    The Apache Portable Runtime Utility Library

O.S.: Linux i686 GNU/Linux

I have also some GDB debug if someone is interested: it shows an
application loop in the apr_fnmatch() function
(I can provide the full debug session on someone will ask for it):

    Breakpoint 1, apr_fnmatch (pattern=0x9b0e7c0
"/somestring/*/*/*/*/other_string/", string=0x9b5a5a0 "/somestring",
flags=2)

Thanks
Roby

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Message-ID: <20110519183523.GA2430@redhat.com>

Subject: CVE request: DoS in apr due to CVE-2011-0419 fix

This was posted today:

[http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/httpd-announce/201105.mbox/%3C4DD55092.3030403@apache.org%3E](http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/httpd-announce/201105.mbox/%3C4DD55092.3030403%40apache.org%3E)

Essentially the fix for CVE-2011-0419 in apr caused another security
flaw.

Could a CVE be assigned to this?

Thanks.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=51219#c0)  Chris    2011-05-18 13:07:04 UTC  ``` After last apr update on Debian 5&6 / i386 for CVE-2011-0419 we observed multiple of our apache servers running 100%+ CPU randomely.  We identified function going into an infinite loop to be  apr_fnmatch trying to match pattern '/*/WEB-INF/' against any non matching uri.  This pattern is matched due to following directive in our .conf:  <Location "/*/WEB-INF/">   deny from all </Location>   Problem was reproduced with Apache apr-1.4.4 recompiled from sources adding the extra testcase (testfnmatch.c):      {"/*/WEB-INF/", "/wontmatch",       FAIL},  Problem daesn't exist in apr-1.3.12.  Debian patch is apparently a back port of new code in 1.2/1.4 for Deb 5/6  Debian patch info: <http://packetstormsecurity.org/files/view/101435/dsa-2237-1.txt>  Chris ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=51219#c1)  Chris    2011-05-19 10:22:27 UTC  ``` Bug reported to debian: <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=627182> ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=51219#c2)  Maksymilian    2011-05-21 07:06:15 UTC  ``` Instead of changing the algorithm, it is better to add recursion limit and set 64 (not bigger).

# CVE-2011-1928

| **Name** | CVE-2011-1928 |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | The fnmatch implementation in apr\_fnmatch.c in the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) library 1.4.3 and 1.4.4, and the Apache HTTP Server 2.2.18, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop) via a URI that does not match unspecified types of wildcard patterns, as demonstrated by attacks against mod\_autoindex in httpd when a /\*/WEB-INF/ configuration pattern is used. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incorrect fix for CVE-2011-0419. |
