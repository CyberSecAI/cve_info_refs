{
  "CVE-2011-1928": {
    "Description": "The fnmatch implementation in apr_fnmatch.c in the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) library 1.4.3 and 1.4.4, and the Apache HTTP Server 2.2.18, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop) via a URI that does not match unspecified types of wildcard patterns, as demonstrated by attacks against mod_autoindex in httpd when a /\\*/WEB-INF/ configuration pattern is used. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incorrect fix for CVE-2011-0419.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "An incorrect fix for CVE-2011-0419 introduced a new vulnerability in the `apr_fnmatch` function, specifically when handling certain wildcard patterns.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Infinite loop in `apr_fnmatch` function when processing specific wildcard patterns.",
       "Denial of service vulnerability related to regular expression matching."
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker can cause a denial-of-service by sending requests that trigger the infinite loop in `apr_fnmatch`, leading to high CPU usage and potentially crashing the server.",
    "Attack vectors": "Remote attackers send specially crafted URIs that do not match specified wildcard patterns in the configuration, causing the `apr_fnmatch` function to enter an infinite loop.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker can be remote and needs to be able to send HTTP requests to a server using the vulnerable APR library and Apache server with a vulnerable configuration.",
     "Additional Information": [
        "The vulnerability is triggered by certain `fnmatch` patterns, specifically using a wildcard like '/*' in configurations such as `<Location \"/*/WEB-INF/\">`.",
        "The issue is caused by a regression introduced while fixing CVE-2011-0419."
