### CVE-2011-1752

Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause:** A NULL pointer dereference within the `mod_dav_svn` Apache module when handling requests for baselined WebDAV resources.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**
*   The `mod_dav_svn` module fails to recognize that a request for a baselined resource should return an error.
*   Instead, it attempts to process the request, leading to a dereference of a NULL pointer representing the resource's repository path

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   A remote attacker can crash the `mod_dav_svn` module, causing a denial of service (DoS).
*   While Apache servers may respawn crashed processes, a determined attacker could continuously crash these processes, effectively denying service to legitimate users.

**Attack vectors:**
*   Remote attackers can send specifically crafted HTTP requests against the URL of a baselined resource
*   This attack vector is through the `mod_dav_svn` module for the Apache HTTPD server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Subversion server.
*   No specific authentication or network position is required.
*   The attacker needs to know or discover a URL corresponding to a "baselined resource" that triggers the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
*   The vulnerability is present in Subversion HTTP servers up to and including version 1.6.16.
*   `svnserve` is not vulnerable to this issue.
*   The fix for this vulnerability is included in Subversion version 1.6.17.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Joe Schaefer of the Apache Software Foundation.
