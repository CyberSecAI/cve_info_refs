  "CVE-2011-1256": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Internet Explorer accesses an object that has not been correctly initialized or has been deleted. The vulnerability may corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the logged-on user.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability occurs when Internet Explorer attempts to access a non-initialized or deleted object, leading to memory corruption that can be exploited.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Memory corruption"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution with the same user rights as the logged-on user. An attacker could take complete control of an affected system if the user has administrative rights. This could lead to installation of programs, data manipulation, or creation of new accounts with full user rights.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "Specially crafted website that convince the user to perform copy/paste operations.",
        "Embedding an ActiveX control marked 'safe for initialization' in an application or Microsoft Office document that hosts the IE rendering engine.",
      "Compromised websites or those with user-provided content that could exploit the vulnerability."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to host a specially crafted website and convince a user to perform copy/paste operations while on the attacker's website or via other means such as email attachments.",
       "additional_details": "The vulnerability requires significant user interaction to be triggered, specifically copy/paste operations on a malicious website.  The vulnerability is not present in Internet Explorer 9 and is mitigated by the Enhanced Security Configuration in Windows Server 2003, 2008, and 2008 R2 environments. This vulnerability is also addressed by the security update by modifying how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory."
