- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A buffer overflow existed in the handling of REGION records in PICT files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Viewing a maliciously crafted PICT file may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: Opening a maliciously crafted PICT file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to craft a malicious PICT file and have a user open it with the vulnerable software.
