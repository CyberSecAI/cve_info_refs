Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability details for CVE-2011-1236:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a "Win32k Use After Free Vulnerability" caused by the way Windows Kernel-mode drivers manage kernel-mode driver objects. Specifically, improper management of these objects leads to a use-after-free condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Use-after-free:** The core vulnerability is a use-after-free condition, meaning that the system attempts to use a memory location that has already been freed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Elevation of Privilege:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to run arbitrary code in kernel mode, granting them complete control over the affected system.
*   **Full System Control:** This control enables the attacker to install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new accounts with full administrative rights.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access Required:** An attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to exploit the vulnerability. It cannot be exploited remotely or by anonymous users.
*   **Specially Crafted Application:** The attacker needs to run a specially crafted application to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Valid Local Account:** The attacker needs to have a valid user account on the target system to log in.
*   **Ability to Run Programs:** The attacker must be able to execute a specifically crafted program on the system.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is part of a larger set of vulnerabilities addressed in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS11-034.
*   The affected systems include a range of Windows versions, from Windows XP to Windows Server 2008 R2.
*   The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the way the kernel-mode drivers manage kernel-mode driver objects.
*   The vulnerability was not publicly disclosed before the release of the security bulletin.
*   There were no reports of the vulnerability being actively exploited in the wild at the time of the bulletin's release.
