  "cve_id": "CVE-2011-1153",
  "description": "The provided information indicates that CVE-2011-1153 is a format-string vulnerability found in the PHP Phar extension. Specifically, several class methods within the extension were observed to pass user-supplied arguments to zend_throw_exception_ex(), which would then use these arguments as format strings leading to a format string vulnerability. This issue allows an attacker to potentially leak memory by crafting a malicious format string in the supplied argument.",
  "affected_components": [
    {
      "name": "PHP Phar extension",
      "vulnerability": "format-string vulnerability"
    }
  ],
  "root_cause": "The root cause is the use of user-supplied data as a format string in zend_throw_exception_ex() within several class methods of the PHP Phar extension.",
  "weaknesses": [
    "Format String Vulnerability"
  ],
  "impact": "An attacker can potentially leak memory by crafting a malicious format string in the supplied argument. This is achieved through the use of user-supplied input as a format string without proper validation or sanitization.",
  "attack_vectors": {
    "vector": "The attack vector is through the crafted malicious format string in the argument passed to vulnerable class methods of the PHP Phar extension.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs the capability to supply a malicious format string as an argument to the vulnerable methods of the PHP Phar extension."
  },
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "zend_throw_exception_ex": "The vulnerability stems from several class methods passing the supplied argument to zend_throw_exception_ex(). This function then uses the argument as a format string when generating an error message.",
    "format_string": "The use of an untrusted argument as a format string opens a format string vulnerability, where an attacker can utilize format specifiers to read arbitrary memory locations, leading to sensitive information disclosure.",
     "exploitation_example": "An attacker could pass a string containing format specifiers (e.g., %08x.%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x) as an argument, which would be interpreted by zend_throw_exception_ex() to leak memory locations.",
    "additional_info": "The vulnerability is present in the error handling path of the Phar extension. Although the content from some sources suggests this is more of a local than a remote vulnerability. It is improbable that a script would accept untrusted user input or unvalidated script input data as a PHAR archive file name to load."

  "affected_versions": [
    "PHP versions prior to 5.3.6"
  ],
  "patch": "This issue was fixed in PHP version 5.3.6. The fix involved sanitizing the input to prevent format string interpretation. Reference: <http://svn.php.net/viewvc?view=revision&revision=309221>"
