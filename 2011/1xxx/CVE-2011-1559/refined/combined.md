How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Download IBM WEBi Version 1.0.4 Fix Pack 3

### Download

## Abstract

This document describes how to download and install IBM Web Interface for Content Management (IBM WEBi), Version 1 Release 0 Modification 4 Fix Pack 3.

## Download Description

IBM WEBi is a Web client that enables users to work with content from multiple content servers. IBM WEBi works with IBM Content Manager Enterprise Edition content servers and IBM Content Manager OnDemand content servers. IBM WEBi is also able to search across multiple IBM Content Manager servers, multiple IBM Content Manager OnDemand servers, or a combination of servers by using IBM Content Integrator.

## Important updates to this fix pack

IBM WEBi Version 1.0.4 Fix Pack 3 has been updated to include a fix for the following APAR, which affects IBM Content Manager OnDemand customers: I014227 (The Adobe Reader viewer cannot open some PDF files).

The previous version of the fix pack, IBM WEBi Version 1.0.4.300, has been removed from Fix Central and replaced with the current version of the fix pack, IBM WEBi Version 1.0.4.301. To check which version of IBM WEBi is installed in your environment, go to the **About** menu in the end user client.

If the version of IBM WEBi that is installed is IBM WEBi Version 1.0.4.300, it is recommended that you upgrade to the latest version of the fix pack, Version 1.0.4.301. You can install this fix pack on top of IBM WEBi V1.0.4 and later fix packs, including IBM WEBi Version 1.0.4 Fix Pack 3.

If you have not installed IBM WEBi Version 1.0.4 Fix Pack 3 (Version 1.0.4.300), you can install this updated fix pack on top of IBM WEBi V1.0.4 and later fix packs.

## Prerequisites

The prerequisites for IBM WEBi Version 1.0.4.3 are listed in the "Hardware and software prerequisites for IBM Web Interface for Content Management V1.0.4.2 and V1.0.4.3" document.

IBM WEBi Version 1.0.4 Fix Pack 3 must be installed on top of IBM WEBi Version 1.0.4 or later.

**Important:** If you use IBM WEBi with IBM Content Manager and WebSphere Application Server Version 6.0 or Version 6.1, you might need to upgrade your WebSphere Application Server installation. See the Web application servers section of the "Hardware and software prerequisites for IBM Web Interface for Content Management V1.0.4.2 and V1.0.4.3" document for more information.

## Installation Instructions

## Backing up your current installation

Before you install the fix pack, it is recommended that you back up your current installation of IBM WEBi.

**Important:** You cannot restore the previously installed version of IBM WEBi from IBM WEBi Version 1.0.4 Fix Pack 3. If you want to restore the previous version of IBM WEBi, you must uninstall IBM WEBi Version 1.0.4 Fix Pack 3 and reinstall the previous version. If you backed up your previous installation, you can reapply your configuration files from the backed up copy of IBM WEBi.

Follow the instructions for [Backing up your current installation](http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/cmgmt/v8r4m0/topic/com.ibm.ciwbi.doc/cdnwu002.htm) in *Planning, Installing, and Configuring IBM WEBi*.

## Configuring connections to content servers

**Important:** If you have already configured a connection to a content server, you cannot modify the connection to the content server during this installation. You must use the configuration tool to modify the connection after the installation is complete.

When you install IBM WEBi Version 1.0.4 Fix Pack 3, you can configure connections only to new types of content servers. For example, if you have already configured a connection to an IBM Content Manager OnDemand server during a previous installation, you can configure a connection to an IBM Content Manager server, but you cannot add a connection to a new IBM Content Manager OnDemand server or modify an existing connection to an IBM Content Manager OnDemand server. However, you can configure the connection to the new content server type only if you install of the prerequisite software.

**Tip:** If you want to create a connection to a new type of server, and IBM WEBi Version 1.0.4 Fix Pack 3 is already installed, you can run the installation program for IBM WEBi Version 1.0.4 Fix Pack 3 again to create the connection.

## Installing the fix pack

This fix pack is installed as an update to IBM WEBi. You can install the update by running the installation program or by running a silent installation.

The fix pack must be installed on top of IBM WEBi Version 1.0.4 or later.

**Restrictions:** When you update IBM WEBi, the following restrictions apply:

* The fix pack must be installed on the same path as the previous version of IBM WEBi.
* The fix pack must be deployed to the same instance of WebSphere Application Server.

Follow the instructions for [Upgrading the Web client](http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/cmgmt/v8r4m0/topic/com.ibm.ciwbi.doc/cdnwu005.htm) in *Planning, Installing, and Configuring IBM WEBi*.

[Back to top](#ibm-content)

## Removing the fix pack

If you want to remove the fix pack and restore a previous version of IBM WEBi, you must uninstall the fix pack and reinstall the version that you want to restore.

Follow the instructions for [Restoring a previous version of IBM WEBi](http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/cmgmt/v8r4m0/topic/com.ibm.ciwbi.doc/cdnwu003.htm) in *Planning, Installing, and Configuring IBM WEBi*.
