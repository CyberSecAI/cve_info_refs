Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-1891:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization on specific SharePoint parameters when handling contact details. This allows malicious script to be injected into the application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The core issue is a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability.  The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input, allowing attacker-controlled script to be embedded within the application's responses and executed in a user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Account Control:** An attacker can gain control over valid user accounts.
- **Privilege Escalation:** They can perform operations on the user's behalf, potentially gaining elevated privileges within the SharePoint environment.
- **Redirection:** They can redirect users to malicious websites.
- **Credential Theft:** The attacker could attempt to steal user credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-based Attack:** An attacker could host a malicious web page containing a specially crafted form. They must lure users to visit this page.
- **Email Attack:**  The attacker could send a specially crafted URL via email, tricking users into submitting a malicious form to a vulnerable SharePoint site.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to convince a user to interact with a malicious link or submit a specially crafted form.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the SharePoint site.
- The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious JavaScript into a URL or form submission.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Microsoft SharePoint.
- Internet Explorer 8 and 9's XSS filter provides some mitigation for users browsing from the Internet Zone (but not Intranet Zone).
- This is a reflected XSS attack meaning the malicious script is present in the request and the response.
- The attacker does not directly gain access to the SharePoint server.
- The attacker cannot steal the users authentication cookie because it is HttpOnly.
- The provided Microsoft document includes mitigations, workarounds and installation instructions.
