Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2011-1704:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability exists in the `nipplib.dll` component of the Novell iPrint Client. This component is used by both ActiveX and Netscape-compatible browser plugins.
*   The core issue is a buffer overflow. When processing the `core-package` parameter from a user-specified printer URL, the application blindly copies user-supplied data into a fixed-length buffer on the heap without proper bounds checking.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** A classic programming error where data is written beyond the allocated buffer's boundaries. This can overwrite adjacent memory, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The application fails to validate the size of the user-supplied data before copying it into the buffer. This lack of validation allows an attacker to provide an oversized input that triggers the overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.
*   **Context of the Browser:** The code execution occurs within the context of the browser, meaning it will have the same privileges as the user running the browser. This can allow the attacker to steal user data, install malware, or perform other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Web Page:** The primary attack vector involves tricking a user into visiting a malicious web page that contains a crafted printer URL.
*   **Malicious File:**  The vulnerability can also be triggered by opening a malicious file containing a specially crafted printer URL, indicating the exploit isn't limited to browser-based attacks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can be located remotely, requiring no physical access to the target machine.
*   **Ability to Serve Malicious Content:** The attacker needs the capability to host a malicious webpage or distribute a malicious file containing the exploit.
*   **User Interaction:** Exploitation requires user interaction. The user must either visit the attacker's web page or open a malicious file, highlighting a reliance on social engineering to some degree.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects Novell iPrint Client installations and is triggered by processing the `core-package` parameter.
*   The fix for this vulnerability is included in the "iPrint Client for Windows XP/Vista/Win 7 5.64" patch or later.
*   Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected by a specific Digital Vaccine filter.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Ivan Rodriguez Almuina.
