# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS11-064 - Important

## Vulnerabilities in TCP/IP Stack Could Allow Denial of Service (2563894)

Published: August 09, 2011

**Version:** 1.0

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves two privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows. The vulnerabilities could allow denial of service if an attacker sends a sequence of specially crafted Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) messages to a target system or sends a specially crafted URL request to a server that is serving Web content and has the URL-based Quality of Service (QoS) feature enabled.

This security update is rated Important for all supported editions of Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2008 R2, and is rated Moderate for all supported editions of Windows Vista and Windows 7. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying the way that the Windows TCP/IP stack processes ICMP messages and handles URLs in memory when URL-based QoS is enabled. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

**Recommendation.** The majority of customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871).

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update at the earliest opportunity using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service.

See also the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, later in this bulletin.

**Known Issues.** None

## ICMP Denial of Service Vulnerability - CVE-2011-1871

A denial of service vulnerability exists in the Windows TCP/IP stack that is caused when the TCP/IP stack improperly handles a sequence of specially crafted ICMP messages. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause the target system to stop responding and automatically restart.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2011-1871](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-1871).

#### Mitigating Factors for ICMP Denial of Service Vulnerability - CVE-2011-1871

Microsoft has not identified any mitigating factors for this vulnerability.

#### Workarounds for ICMP Denial of Service Vulnerability - CVE-2011-1871

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Block ICMP at the firewall**

  Blocking all ICMP messages at the network boundary firewall or at the router will help protect systems that are behind that firewall or router from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. We recommend that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet.

  **Impact of workaround.** This workaround can negatively impact performance by preventing TCP from optimizing network communication. ICMP network packets can eliminate fragmentation at routers connecting networks with different MTUs. Fragmentation reduces TCP throughput and increases network congestion.

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* Disable Policy-based QoS. For more information, see the Microsoft TechNet article, [Policy-based Quality of Service (QoS)](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd919203%28ws.10%29.aspx).

#### FAQ for TCP/IP QOS Denial of Service Vulnerability - CVE-2011-1965

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a denial of service vulnerability.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused when the TCP/IP stack improperly handles specially crafted URLs in memory. This vulnerability is only triggered when the target system is hosting Web content with a service like IIS and has URL-based QoS is enabled.

**What is the component affected by the vulnerability?**

Tcpip.sys is the component affected by the vulnerability.

**What is URL-based Quality of Service (QoS)?**

Quality of Service (QoS) for networks is an industry-wide set of standards and mechanisms for ensuring high-quality performance for critical applications. Network administrators can use QoS mechanisms to prioritize, and manage the sending rate for, outgoing network traffic. The use of these mechanisms ensures that resources are used efficiently to provide the required level of service.

Windows Server 2008 R2 allows IT professionals to prioritize Web traffic based on the URL. With URL-based QoS, IT professionals can ensure important Web traffic is processed before less-important traffic, improving performance on busy networks. For example, IT professionals can assign Web traffic for critical internal Web sites a higher priority than external Web sites, maximizing performance when the network is busy. For more information, please see the Microsoft TechNet article, [URL-based QoS](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd637810%28ws.10%29.aspx).

**What is a URI?**

A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a string of characters used to act on or identify resources from the Internet or over a network. A URL is a typical example of a URI that references a resource such as a Web site. For more information about URIs, see [RFC-2396](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause the target system to stop responding and automatically restart.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

In a remote attack scenario, an unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted URL request to a server that is serving Web content and has URL-based QoS enabled.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Servers hosting Web content with URL-based QoS enabled are primarily at risk. Servers that do not have URL-based QoS enabled or are not serving Web content are not affected. Workstations such as Windows 7 systems, which can run Internet Information Services (IIS), are at increased risk if both IIS and URL-based QoS are enabled.

**Are Windows 7 systems at increased risk if configured as a server with IIS?**

Yes. Server software such as IIS can be installed and configured on Windows 7 systems. Although Windows 7 systems are considered to be workstations, in this configuration they act like servers and are therefore at increased risk from this vulnerability.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying the way that the TCP/IP stack handles URLs in memory when URL-based QoS is enabled.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

# Policy-based Quality of Service (QoS)

* Article
* 07/02/2012
## In this article

Applies To: Windows 7, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Vista

As traffic increases on a network, it becomes increasingly important for IT departments to balance network performance with the cost of service. However, network traffic is not easily prioritized and managed. Mission critical and latency-sensitive applications must compete for bandwidth against lower priority traffic. At the same time, some users and computers with specific network performance requirements might require differentiated service levels.

Such challenges of providing cost-effective, predictable network performance levels often first appear over wide area network (WAN) connections or with latency-sensitive applications like voice over IP (VoIP) and video. However, the end-goal of providing predictable network service levels applies to any network environment (for example, an enterprisesâ local area network), and to more than VoIP applications, such as your company's custom line-of-business applications.

For computers running Windows ServerÂ® 2008 R2, WindowsÂ® 7, Windows ServerÂ® 2008, and Windows VistaÂ®, you can use Policy-based Quality of Service (QoS) to manage traffic in order to offer better end-user experiences, control bandwidth costs, or more finely negotiate service levels with bandwidth providers or business departments. Policy-based QoS provides network control based on applications, users, and computers. Applications do not need to be written for specific application programming interfaces (APIs), allowing use with existing applications. Additionally, Policy-based QoS also takes advantage of your existing management infrastructure, because Policy-based QoS is built into Group Policy.

You can specify QoS (QoS) policies that define priority through a Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) value. The DSCP applies a value (0 - 63) within the Type of Service (TOS) field in an IPv4 packet's header and within the Traffic Class field in IPv6. This DSCP value allows classification at the Internet Protocol (IP) level, which routers can use to decide queuing behavior. You can also limit an application's outbound network traffic by specifying a throttle rate.

For example, an you can configure routers to place packets with specific DSCP values into one of three queues: high-priority, best effort, or lower than best effort. Therefore, mission-critical network traffic gets preference before other traffic. The QoS policy defining throttling limits the rate of outbound network traffic. For example, an IT department might implement a service level agreement that specifies a file server can never provide downloads beyond a specific rate, in order to manage WAN costs.

You can also use Policy-based QoS to apply DSCP values and throttle rates for outbound network traffic to the following:

* Sending application and directory path
* Source and destination IP addresses, including support for address prefixes
* Source and destination ports and port ranges
* Protocol (TCP and UDP)
* Specific groups of users or computers (through deployment in Group Policy)
* By using these controls, you can specify a QoS policy with a DSCP value of 46 for a VoIP application, allowing routers to place those packets in a low-latency queue, or you can use a QoS policy to throttle a set of servers' outbound traffic to 512 KBps when sending from TCP port 443. Or, as in the expanded example in the next section, QoS policy can be applied to a particular application that has special bandwidth requirements.

## Advantages of Policy-based QoS

Policy-based QoS enables IT administrators to configure and enforce QoS policies that cannot be configured on routers and switches.

1. **Level of detail:** It is difficult to create user-level QoS policies on routers or switches, especially if the userâs computer is either configured by using dynamic IP address assignment, or the computer is not connected to fixed switch or router ports, as is frequently the case with portable computers. In contrast, Policy-based QoS enables you to easily configure a user-level QoS policy on a domain controller and propagate it to the userâs computer, regardless of where or how the computer connects to the network. For example, you can configure a user-level QoS policy that will apply to a computer no matter where the user logs on, for example, in either a main office or in a branch office. Similarly, the same user level QoS policy will apply no matter how the user connects to the network, for example, by either the wired Ethernet network or by Wi-Fi.
2. **Security:** If your IT department encrypts usersâ traffic from end to end using IPSec, then you cannot classify the traffic on routers based on any information above the IP layer in the packet (for example, a TCP port). However, by using Policy-based QoS, you can classify packets at the end device to indicate the priority of the packets in the IP header before the IP payloads are encrypted and the packets sent out.
3. **Performance:** Some QoS functions, such as throttling, are better performed when they are closer to the source. Policy-based QoS moves such QoS functions to where they can be closest to the source.
4. **Manageability:** Policy-based QoS enhances the network manageability in two ways:

   * First, because it is based on Group Policy, Policy-based QoS allows you to configure and manage a set of user/computer QoS policies whenever necessary, and on one central domain-controller computer.
   * Second, Policy-based QoS facilitates user/computer configuration by allowing you to specify policies by URL, as opposed to specifying policies based on the IP addresses of each of the servers where QoS policies need to be applied.

   For example, assume your network has a cluster of servers that share a common URL. By using Policy-based QoS, you need only to create one policy based on that common URL, as opposed to creating one policy for each server in the cluster, with each policy based on the IP address of each server.

## Scenario 1: Prioritizing a line of business application

In this scenario, an IT department adds QoS to provide better network performance for a key set of users and its mission critical applications but needs to minimize the WAN link costs. The IT department decides to prioritize specific applications by using DSCP values to classify network traffic and to configure its routers to provide preferential treatment for the higher priority traffic. Later, they might consider using this classification to negotiate service levels for the leased WAN links.

In addition to DSCP values, the QoS policies can specify a throttle rate. Throttling limits all outbound traffic that matched the QoS policy to a specific send rate.

The first mission critical application to use Policy-based QoS is a company-wide enterprise resource planning (ERP) application. The ERP application is hosted on several computers running Windows Server 2008 R2 or Windows ServerÂ® 2008 in the datacenter, which are part of a organization unit (OU) for computers. While many groups within the company access the ERP application, the finance group requires differentiated performance, because the finance group depends on this application when dealing with customers. The client-side component for the ERP application is installed on computers running Windows 7 and Windows Vista.

The following example illustrates the clients and servers in a prioritization scenario. The subsequent section titled "Configuring Policy-based QoS" walks through the wizard steps for creating QoS policies. In this example, the IT administrator selects the Group Policy object (GPO) on which the QoS policy will be deployed. Through the QoS policy wizard, the IT administrator creates a QoS Policy for the group of servers called "Server LOB policy" that specifies a high priority DSCP value of 44 for all applications, any IP address, TCP and UDP, and port number. The QoS policy is applied only to the LOB servers by linking the GPO to the OU containing only these servers, via the GPMC tool. This initial Server LOB policy applies the high priority DSCP value whenever the computer sends network traffic. This QoS policy can later be edited (in the Group Policy Object Editor tool) to include the ERP application's port numbers, which limits the policy to apply only when the specified port number is used.

To ensure the finance group can support their customers, a QoS policy needs to classify these users' traffic as higher priority. However, the policy should not apply when members of the finance group use applications other than the ERP application. Thus, the IT department defines a second QoS policy called "Client LOB policy" in the Group Policy Object Editor tool that applies a DSCP value of 60 when the finance user group runs the ERP application.

A separate backup application is running on all computers. To ensure the backup application's traffic does not use all available network resources, a backup data policy is created. This backup policy specifies a DSCP value of 1 based on the executable name for this backup application, backup.exe. A third Group Policy object is created and deployed for all client computers in the domain. Whenever the backup application sends data, the low priority DSCP value is applied, even if it originates from computers in the finance department.

Note that traffic without a QoS policy sends with a DSCP value of 0.

The following table summarizes the QoS policies for this scenario.

| Policy name | DSCP value | Throttle rate | Applied to organization units | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [No policy] | 0 | None | [No deployment] | Best effort (default) treatment for unclassified traffic. |
| Backup data | 1 | None | All clients | Applies a low-priority DSCP value for this bulk data. |
| Server LOB | 44 | None | Computer OU for ERP servers | Applies high-priority DSCP for ERP server traffic |
| Client LOB | 60 | None | Finance User Group | Applies high-priority DSCP for ERP client traffic |

Note

DSCP values are represented in decimal form.

With QoS policies defined and applied by using Group Policy, outbound network traffic receives the policy-specified DSCP value. Routers then provide differential treatment based on these DSCP values, by using queuing. For this IT department, the routers are configured with four queues: high priority, middle priority, best effort, and low priority.

When traffic arrives at the router with DSCP values from "Server LOB policy" and "Client LOB policy," the data is placed into high priority queues. Traffic with a DSCP value of 0 receives a best effort level of service. Whereas packets with a DSCP value of 1 (from the backup application) receive lower priority treatment.

## Prerequisites for prioritizing a line of business application

To complete this task, ensure that you meet the following requirements:

* The computers involved are running Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008.
* The computers involved are members of an Active Directory domain so that they can be controlled by using Group Policy.
* TCP/IP networks are set up with routers configured for DSCP (RFC 2474).
* Administrative credentials requirements are met.

## Administrative credentials

To complete this task, you must be able to create and deploy Group Policy objects.

## Setting up the test environment for prioritizing a line of business application

To set up the test environment, complete the following tasks:

* Create an Active Directory domain controller with clients and users grouped into organization units.
* Configure the routers to differentially queue based on DSCP values. For example, DSCP value 44 gets enters a 'Platinum' queue and all others are weighted-fair-queued.

Note

DSCP values can be viewed by using network captures such as tools like NetMon and by observing the "Type of Service" (TOS) field.

## Steps for prioritizing a line of business application

To prioritize a line of business application, complete the following tasks:

1. Create and link a Group Policy object (GPO) with a QoS policy.
2. Configure the routers to differentially treat a line of business application (by using queuing) based on the selected DSCP values. The procedures of this task will vary depending upon the type of routers you have.

## Scenario 2: Prioritizing an HTTP server application

Many enterprise applications are developed for, and hosted on IIS web servers. Typically, the application is accessed from browsers on client computers. For these deployments, it is beneficial for an IT department to be able to prioritize the network traffic associated with web-based applications. In Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2, Policy-based QoS provides a new feature, know as URL-based Policies, which enables administrators to place HTTP responses -- to applications that are built on top of HTTP -- subject to QoS control.

In this scenario, assume you manage a set of IIS servers that host training videos for all your organizationâs employees. Your objective is to ensure the traffic from these video servers wonât overwhelm your network, and ensure that video traffic is differentiated from voice and data traffic on the network. The task is similar to the task in Scenario 1. You will design and configure the traffic management settings such as the DSCP value for the video traffic and the throttling rate the same as you would for the line of business applications. Only when specifying the traffic, instead of providing the application name you need only to enter the URL to which your HTTP server application will respond; for example https://hrweb/training.

Note

URLâbased QoS policies apply only to computers running Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, and possibly to subsequent releases of the Windows operating system. You cannot use URL-based QoS policies to prioritize network traffic for computers running Windows operating systems that were released prior to Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2.

## Precedence Rules for URL based Policies

All the following URLs are valid and can be specified in Policy-based QoS and applied simultaneously to a computer or a user:

* https://video
* <https://training.hr.mycompany.com>
* <https://10.1.10.249:8080/tech>
* https://\*/ebooks

But which one will receive precedence? The rules are simple. URL based policies are prioritized in a left-to-right reading order. So from the highest priority to the lowest priority, the URL fields are:

1. 1. URL Scheme
2. 2. URL Host
3. 3. URL Port
4. 4. URL Path

Details are as follows:

## 1. URL Scheme

https:// has a higher priority than https://.

## 2. URL Host

From the highest priority to the lowest, they are:

1. Hostname
2. IPv6 address
3. IPv4 address
4. wildcard

In the case of Hostname, a hostname with more dotted elements (more depth) has a higher priority than a hostname with fewer dotted elements. For example, among the following hostnames:

* video.internal.training.hr.mycompany.com (depth = 6)
* selfguide.training.mycompany.com (depth = 4)
* training (depth = 1)
* library (depth = 1)

**video.internal.training.hr.mycompany.com** has the highest priority, and **selfguide.training.mycompany.com** has the next highest priority. **Training** and **library** share the same lowest priority.

## 3. URL Port

A specific or an implicit port number has a higher priority than a wildcard port.

## 4. URL Path

Like a hostname, a URL path may consist of multiple elements. The one with more elements always has a higher priority than the one with less. For example, the following paths are listed by priority:

1. /ebooks/tech/windows/networking/qos
2. /ebooks/tech/windows/
3. /ebooks
4. /

If a user chooses to include all subdirectories and files following a URL path then this URL path will have a lower priority than it would have were the choice not made.

A user may also choose to specify a destination IP address in a URL based policy. The destination IP address has a lower priority than any of the four URL fields described above.

## URL based Policy vs. Quintuple Policy

A Quintuple policy is specified by protocol ID, source IP address, source port, destination IP address, and destination port. A Quintuple policy always has a higher precedence than any URL based policy. If a Quintuple policy is already applied for a user, a new URL based policy will not cause conflicts on any of that userâs client computer.

## Configuring Policy-based QoS

Based on the line of business application example above, you can see that QoS for networks is an industry-wide set of standards and mechanisms for ensuring high-quality performance for mission critical applications. By using QoS mechanisms, network administrators can use existing resources efficiently and ensure the required level of service without reactively expanding or over-provisioning their networks.

In Windows, Policy-based QoS combines the functionality of standards-based QoS with the manageability of Group Policy. Configuration of this combination allows for easy application of QoS policies to Group Policy objects. Windows includes a Policy-based QoS Wizard to help you:

* Create a QoS policy
* View, edit, or delete a QoS policy

## Create a QoS policy

Before you create a QoS policy, it is important that you understand the two key QoS controls used to manage network traffic:

* DSCP value
* Throttle rate

## Prioritizing traffic with DSCP

As noted in the line of business application example above, you can define the priority of outbound network traffic by using **Specify DSCP Value** to configure a QoS policy with a specific Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) value. As described in RFC 2474, DSCP allows values from 0 to 63 to be specified within the Type of Service (TOS) field of an IPv4 packet and within the Traffic Class field in IPv6. Network routers use the DSCP value to classify network packets and to queue them appropriately.

Note

By default, Windows traffic has a DSCP value of 0.

The number of queues and their prioritization behavior needs to be designed as part of your organization's QoS strategy. For example, your organization may choose to have five queues: latency-sensitive traffic, control traffic, business critical traffic, best effort traffic, and bulk data transfer traffic.

## Throttling traffic

Along with DSCP values, throttling is another key control for managing network bandwidth. As mentioned earlier, you can use the **Specify Throttle Rate** setting to configure a QoS policy with a specific throttle rate for outbound traffic. By using throttling, a QoS policy limits the outgoing network traffic to a specified throttle rate. Both DSCP marking and throttling can be used together to manage traffic effectively.

Note

By default, the **Specify Throttle Rate** check box is not selected.

To create a QoS policy, edit the settings of a Group Policy object (GPO) from within the Group Policy Management Console (GPMC) tool. GPMC then opens the Group Policy Object Editor.

QoS policy names must be unique. Behavior depends on where the QoS policy is stored in the Group Policy Object Editor:

* A QoS policy in Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Policy-based QoS applies to computers, regardless of the user that is currently logged on. You typically use computer-based QoS policies for server computers.
* A QoS policy in User Configuration\Windows Settings\Policy-based QoS applies to users after they have logged on, regardless of which computer they have logged on to.

## To create a new QoS policy with the Policy-based QoS wizard

* In Group Policy Object Editor, right-click either of the **Policy-based QoS** nodes, and then click **Create a new policy.**

## Wizard page 1 - Policy Profile

On the first page of the Policy-based QoS wizard, you can specify a policy name and configure how QoS will control outgoing network traffic.

## To configure the Policy Profile page of the QoS-based Policy wizard

1. In **Policy name**, type a name for the QoS policy. The name must uniquely identify the policy.
2. Optionally, use **Specify DSCP Value** to enable DSCP marking, and then configure a DSCP value between 0 and 63.
3. Optionally, use **Specify Throttle Rate** to enable traffic throttling and configure the throttle rate. The throttle rate value must be greater than 1 and you can specify units of kilobytes per second (KBps) or megabytes per second (MBps).
4. Click **Next**.

## Wizard page 2 - Application Name

The second page of the Policy-based QoS wizard allows you to apply the policy to all applications, to a specific application as identified by its executable name, to a path and application name, or to the HTTP server applications that handle requests for a specific URL. **All applications** specifies that the traffic management settings on the first page of the Policy-based QoS wizard apply to all applications. **Only applications with this executable name** specifies that the traffic management settings on the first page of the Policy-based QoS wizard are for a specific application. The executable file name and must end with the .exe file name extension. **Only HTTP server applications responding to requests for this URL** specifies that the traffic management settings on the first page of the Policy-based QoS wizard apply to certain HTTP server applications only.

Optionally, you can enter the application path. To specify an application path, include the path with the application name. The path can include environment variables. For example, %ProgramFiles%\My Application Path\MyApp.exe, or c:\program files\my application path\myapp.exe.

Note

The application path cannot include a path that resolves to a symbolic link.

The URL must conform to RFC 1738, i.e. in the form of âhttp[s]://<hostname>:<port>/<url-path>â. You can use a wildcard, â\*â, for <hostname> and/or <port>, e.g. https://training.\*/, https://\*.\*, but the wildcard cannot denote a substring of <hostname> or <port>. In other words, neither https://my\*site/ nor https://\*training\*/ is valid. Optionally, you can check **Include subdirectories and files** to perform matching on all subdirectories and files following a URL. For example, if this option is checked and the URL is âhttps://trainingâ then Policy-based QoS will consider requests for âhttps://training/videoâ a good match.

## To configure the Application Name page of the Policy-based QoS wizard

1. In **This QoS policy applies to**, select either **All applications** or **Only applications with this executable name**.
2. If you select **Only applications with this executable name**, specify an executable name ending with the .exe file name extension.
3. Click **Next**.

## Wizard page 3 - IP Addresses

The third page of the Policy-based QoS wizard allows you to specify IP address conditions for the QoS policy, including the following:

* All source IPv4 or IPv6 addresses or specific source IPv4 or IPv6 addresses
* All destination IPv4 or IPv6 addresses or specific destination IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.

If you select **Only for the following source IP address** or **Only for the following destination IP address**, you must type one of the following:

* An IPv4 address, such as 192.168.1.1
* An IPv4 address prefix using network prefix length notation, such as 192.168.1.0/24
* An IPv6 address, such as 3ffe:ffff::1
* An IPv6 address prefix, such as 3ffe:ffff::/48

If you select both **Only for the following source IP address** and **Only for the following destination IP address**, both addresses or address prefixes must be either IPv4 or IPv6-based.

If you specified the URL for HTTP server applications in the previous wizard page youâll notice that the source IP address for the QoS policy on this wizard page is grayed out. Thatâs because the source IP address is the HTTP server address and it is not configurable here. On the other hand, you can still customize the policy by specifying the destination IP address. This enables you to create different policies for different clients using the same HTTP server applications.

## To configure the IP Addresses page of the Policy-based QoS wizard

1. In **This QoS policy applies to** (source), select **Any source IP address** or **Only for the following IP source address**.
2. If you selected **Only the following IP source address**, specify an IPv4 or IPv6 address or prefix.
3. In **This QoS policy applies to** (destination), select **Any destination address** or **Only for the following IP destination address.**
4. If you selected **Only for the following IP destination address**, specify an IPv4 or IPv6 address or prefix that corresponds to the type of address or prefix specified for the source address.
5. Click **Next**.

## Wizard page 4 - Protocols and Ports

On the fourth page of the Policy-based QoS wizard you can specify the types of traffic and the ports that are controlled by the settings on the first page of the wizard. You can specify:

* TCP traffic, UDP traffic, or both
* All source ports, a range of source ports, or a specific source port
* All destination ports, a range of destination ports, or a specific destination port

## To configure the Protocols and Ports page of the Policy-based QoS wizard

1. In **Select the protocol this QoS policy applies to**, select **TCP**, **UDP**, or **TCP and UDP**.
2. In **Specify the source port number**, select **From any source port** or **From this source port number**.
3. If you selected **From this source port number**, type a port number between 1 and 65535.

   Optionally, you can specify a port range, in the format of "*Low*:*High*," where *Low* and *High* represent the lower bounds and upper bounds of the port range, inclusively. *Low* and *High* each must be a number between 1 and 65535. No space is allowed between the colon (:) character and the numbers.
4. In **Specify the destination port number**, select **To any destination port** or **To this destination port number**.
5. If you selected **To this destination port number** in the previous step, type a port number between 1 and 65535.

To complete the creation of the new QoS policy, click **Finish** on the Protocols and Ports page of the Policy-based QoS wizard. When completed, the new QoS policy is listed in the details pane of the Group Policy Object Editor.

To apply the QoS policy settings to users or computers, link the GPO in which the QoS policies are located to an Active Directory container, such as a domain, a site, or an organizational unit (OU).

## View, edit, or delete a QoS policy

The pages of the Policy-based QoS wizard described above correspond to the properties pages that are displayed when you view or edit the properties of a policy.

## To view the properties of a QoS policy

* Right-click the policy name in the details pane of the Group Policy Object Editor, and then click **Properties**.

  The Group Policy Object Editor displays the properties page with the following tabs:

  + Policy Profile
  + Application Name
  + IP Addresses
  + Protocols and Ports

## To edit a QoS policy

* Right-click the policy name in the details pane of the Group Policy Object Editor, and then click **Edit existing policy**.

  The Group Policy Object Editor displays the **Edit an existing QoS policy** dialog box.

## To delete a QoS policy

* Right-click the policy name in the details pane of the Group Policy Object Editor, and then click **Delete policy**.

## QoS Policy GPMC Reporting

After you have applied a number of QoS policies across your organization, it may be useful or necessary to periodically review how the policies are applied. A summary of the QoS policies for a specific user or computer can be viewed by using GPMC reporting.

## To run the Group Policy Results Wizard for a report of QoS policies

* In GPMC, right-click the **Group Policy Results** node, and then select the menu option for **Group Policy Results Wizard.**

After Group Policy results are generated, click the **Settings** tab. On the **Settings** tab, the QoS policies can be found under the "Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Policy-based QoS" and "User Configuration\Windows Settings\Policy-based QoS" nodes.

On the **Settings** tab, the QoS policies are listed by their QoS policy names with their DSCP value, throttle rate, policy conditions, and winning GPO listed in the same row. The QoS policy's DSCP value, throttle rate, and policy conditions are also visible in GPOE. The Group Policy results view uniquely identifies the winning GPO. When multiple GPOs have QoS policies with the same QoS policy name, the GPO with the highest GPO precedence gets applied. Conflicting QoS Policies (identified by policy name) that are attached to a lower priority GPO will not get applied. Note the GPO priorities define which QoS policies get deployed in the site, domain, or OU as appropriate. After deployment, at a user or computer level, the QoS Policy Precedence Rules determine which traffic is allowed and blocked.

## Advanced Settings for Roaming and Remote Users

With Policy-based QoS, the goal is to manage traffic on an enterprise's network. In mobile scenarios, users might be sending traffic on or off the enterprise network. Because QoS policies are not relevant while away from the enterprise's network, QoS policies are enabled only on network interfaces connected to the enterprise for Windows Vista.

For example, a user might connect her portable computer to her enterprise's network via VPN from a coffee shop. For VPN, the physical network interface (such as wireless) will not have QoS policies applied. However, the VPN interface will have QoS policies applied because it connects to the enterprise. If the user later enters another enterprise's network that does not have an Active Directory trust relationship, QoS policies will not be enabled.

Note these mobile scenarios do not apply to server workloads. For example, a server with multiple network adapters might sit on the edge of an enterprise's network. The IT department might choose to have QoS policies throttle traffic that egresses the enterprise; however, this network adapter that sends this egress traffic does not necessarily connect back to the enterprise network. For this reason, QoS policies are always enabled on all network interfaces of a computer running Windows Server 2008.

Note

Selective enablement only applies to QoS policies and not to the Advanced QoS settings discussed next in this document.

## Advanced QoS Settings

Advanced QoS settings provide additional controls for IT administrators to manage computer network consumption and DSCP markings. Advanced QoS settings apply only at the computer level, whereas QoS policies can be applied at both the computer and user levels.

## To configure advanced QoS settings

1. Click **Computer Configuration**, and then click **Windows Settings in Group Policy**.
2. Right-click **Policy-based QoS**, and then click **Advanced QoS Settings**.

   The figure below shows the two advanced QoS settings tabs: **Inbound TCP Traffic** and **DSCP Marking Override**.

Note

Advanced QoS Settings are computer level Group Policy settings.

## Advanced QoS Settings: Inbound TCP Traffic

**Inbound TCP Traffic** controls the TCP bandwidth consumption on the receiver's side, whereas QoS policies affect the outbound TCP and UDP traffic. By setting a lower throughput level on the **Inbound TCP Traffic** tab, TCP will limit the size of its advertised TCP receive window. The affect of this setting will be increased throughput rates and link utilization for TCP connections with higher bandwidths or latencies (bandwidth delay product). By default, computers running Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 are set to the maximum throughput level.

The TCP receive window has changed in Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 from previous versions of Windows. Previous versions of Windows limited the TCP receive-side window to a maximum of 64 kilobytes (KB), whereas Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 dynamically size the receive-side window up to 16 megabytes (MB). In the Inbound TCP Traffic control, you can control the inbound throughput level by setting the maximum value to which the TCP receive-window can grow. The levels correspond to the following maximum values.

| Inbound throughput level | Maximum |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | 64 KB |
| 1 | 256 KB |
| 2 | 1 MB |
| 3 | 16 MB |

The actual window size may be a value equal to or smaller than the maximum, depending on network conditions.

## To set the TCP receive-side window

1. In Group Policy Object Editor, click **Local Computer Policy**, click **Windows Settings**, right click **Policy-based QoS**, and then click **Advanced QoS Settings**.
2. In **TCP Receiving Throughput**, select **Configure TCP Receiving Throughput**, and then select the level of throughput that you want.
3. Link the GPO to the OU.

## Advanced QoS Settings: DSCP Marking Override

DSCP Marking Override restricts the ability of applications to specify -- or "mark" -- DSCP values other than those specified in QoS policies. By specifying that applications are allowed to set DSCP values, applications can set non-zero DSCP values. By specifying **Ignore**, applications that use QoS APIs will have their DSCP values set to zero, and only QoS policies can set DSCP values. By default, computers running Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 allow applications to specify DSCP values; applications and devices that do not use the QoS APIs are not overridden.

## Wireless Multimedia and DSCP values

The [Wi-Fi Alliance](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=160769) has established a certification for Wireless Multimedia (WMM) which defines four access categories (WMM\_AC) for prioritizing network traffic transmitted on a Wi-Fi wireless network. The access categories include (in order of highest-to-lowest priority): voice, video, best effort, and background; respectively abbreviated as VO, VI, BE, and BK. The WMM specification defines which DSCP values correspond with each of the four access categories:

| DSCP Value | WMM Access Category |
| --- | --- |
| 48-63 | Voice (VO) |
| 32-47 | Video (VI) |
| 24-31, 0-7 | Best effort (BE) |
| 8-23 | Background (BK) |

In Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, QoS policies can be created that use these DSCP values to ensure that portable computers with Wi-Fi CertifiedÂ® for WMM wireless adapters receive prioritized handling when associated with Wi-Fi CertifiedÂ® for WMM access points.

## QoS Policy Precedence Rules

Similar to GPO's priorities, QoS policies have precedence rules to resolve conflicts when multiple QoS policies apply to a specific set of traffic. For outbound TCP or UDP traffic, only one QoS policy can be applied at a time; meaning, QoS policies do not have a cumulative effect, such as where throttle rates would be summed.

In general, the QoS policy with the most matching conditions wins. When multiple QoS policies apply, the rules fall into three categories: user-level versus computer-level; application versus the network quintuple; and among the network quintuple.

By *network quintuple*, we mean the source IP address, destination IP address, source port, destination port, and protocol (TCP/UDP).

**User-level QoS policy takes precedence over computer-level QoS policy**

This rule greatly facilitates network administrator's management of QoS GPOs, particularly for user groupâbased policies. For example, if the network admin wants to define a QoS policy for a user group, they can just create and distribute a GPO to that group. They donât have to worry about which computers those users are logged on to and whether those computers will have conflicting QoS policies defined, because if a conflict exists, the user-level policy always takes precedence.

Note

A user-level QoS policy is only applicable to traffic generated by that user. Other users of a specific computer, and the computer itself, will not be subject to any QoS policies defined for that user.

**Application specificity and taking precedence over network quintuple**

When multiple QoS policies match the specific traffic, the more specific policy is applied. Among policies that identify applications, a policy that includes the sending application's file path is considered more specific than another policy that only identifies the application name (no path). If multiple policies with applications still apply, the precedence rules use the network quintuple to find the best match.

Alternatively, multiple QoS policies might apply to the same traffic by specifying non-overlapping conditions. Between the conditions of applications and the network quintuple, the policy that specifies the application is considered more specific and is applied. For example, policy\_A only specifies an application name (app.exe), and policy\_B specifies the destination IP address 192.168.1.0/24. When these QoS policies conflict (app.exe sends traffic to an IP address within the range of 192.168.4.0/24), policy\_A gets applied.

**More specificity takes precedence within the Network quintuple**

For policy conflicts within the network quintuple, the policy with the most matching conditions takes precedence. For example, assume policy\_C specifies source IP address "any", destination IP address 10.0.0.1, source port "any", destination port "any", and protocol "TCP". Next, assume policy\_D specifies source IP address "any", destination IP address 10.0.0.1, source port "any", destination port 80, and protocol "TCP". Then policy\_C and policy\_D both match connections to destination 10.0.0.1:80. Because Policy-based QoS applies the policy with the most specific matching conditions, policy\_D takes precedence in this example.

However, QoS policies might have an equal number of conditions. For example, several policies may each specify only one (but not the same) piece of the network quintuple. Among the network quintuple, the following order is from higher to lower precedence:

* Source IP address
* Destination IP address
* Source port
* Destination port
* Protocol (TCP or UDP)

Within a specific condition such as IP address, a more specific IP address is treated with higher precedence; for example, an IP address 192.168.4.1 is more specific than 192.168.4.0/24.

Note

Generally your QoS policies should be designed as specifically as possible to simplify your organization's understanding of which policies are in effect.

## FAQ

## What operating system does my domain controller need to be running?

Your domain controller can be running Windows 2000 Server, Windows Server 2003, or Windows Server 2008.

Note

GPMC must be the version available in Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008.

## Do I need Windows Server 2008 or Windows Server 2008 R2 to deploy QoS policies?

No, Windows Server 2008 is not required. However, QoS policies only apply to users or computers running Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008.

## Do QoS policies apply to the sender or receiver of traffic?

QoS policies must be applied on the sending computer to affect its outbound traffic. In order to affect the bidirectional traffic of two computers, QoS policies need to be deployed to both computers.

## What happens if conflicting policies are deployed to the same computer?

If multiple policies apply, the more specific QoS policy takes precedence. For example, a policy that states a host address (192.168.4.12) gets applied instead of a network address (192.168.0.0/16). If a computer-level and user-level policy have the same specificity, the user-level QoS policy is applied instead of the computer-level QoS policy.

# Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Microsoft Exploitability Index helps customers prioritize security update deployment by providing information on the likelihood that a vulnerability addressed in a Microsoft security update will be exploited.

## The Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Exploitability Index may help customers evaluate risk for a vulnerability. Microsoft evaluates the potential exploitability of each vulnerability associated with a Microsoft security update and then publishes the exploitability information as part of the monthly Microsoft security update details. If after publishing the details Microsoft determines that the Exploitability Index Assessment warrants a change, it will change the assessment and notify customers through technical security notifications. The company will not update the assessment when exploit code is posted that matches the existing exploitability information.

The Exploitability Index uses one of four values to communicate to customers the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited, based on the vulnerabilities addressed by the Microsoft security update.

| Exploitability index assessment | Short definition |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Exploitation detected |
| 1 | Exploitation more likely \* |
| 2 | Exploitation less likely \*\* |
| 3 | Exploitation unlikely \*\*\* |

### 0 – Exploitation Detected

Microsoft is aware of an instance of this vulnerability being exploited. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with the highest priority.

### 1 – Exploitation More Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that exploit code could be created in such a way that an attacker could consistently exploit this vulnerability. Moreover, Microsoft is aware of past instances of this type of vulnerability being exploited. This would make it an attractive target for attackers, and therefore more likely that exploits could be created. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with a higher priority.

### 2 – Exploitation Less Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that while exploit code could be created, an attacker would likely have difficulty creating the code, requiring expertise and/or sophisticated timing, and/or varied results when targeting the affected product. Moreover, Microsoft has not recently observed a trend of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the wild. This makes it a less attractive target for attackers. That said, customers who reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should still treat this as a material update. If they are prioritizing against other highly exploitable vulnerabilities, they could rank this lower in their deployment priority.

### 3 – Exploitation Unlikely

Microsoft analysis shows that successfully functioning exploit code is unlikely to be utilized in real attacks. This means that while it might be possible for exploit code to be released that could trigger the vulnerability and cause abnormal behavior, the full impact of exploitation will be more limited. Moreover, Microsoft has not observed instances of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the past. Thus, the actual risk of being exploited from this vulnerability is significantly lower. Therefore, customers who have reviewed the security update to determine its applicability within their environment could prioritize this update below other vulnerabilities within a release.

In those scenarios where multiple product series are affected, for instance a vulnerability that affects both Windows and Office, the rating reflects the highest risk level across both products. Likewise, the rating reflects the highest risk present across all versions of the product.  In this case, if the Exploitability Assessment on the latest version of Office is "1," and on the latest version of Windows is "2," the rating will reflect "1."  If the XI rating for Windows 10 version 2004 is “2” and the rating for Windows 7 is “1”, the rating will reflect “1”.

## Important Terms and Definitions

**Exploit Code** – A software program or sample code that, when executed against a vulnerable system, uses the vulnerability to spoof attacker identity, tamper with user or system information, repudiate attacker action, disclose user or system information on the server side, deny service to valid users, or elevate privileges for the attacker. For example, if a vulnerability had a security impact of remote code execution, Exploit Code could cause remote code execution to occur when run against a target system.

**Trigger a Vulnerability** – The ability to reach the vulnerable code, but not always achieving the maximum impact. For example, it may be easy to trigger a remote code execution vulnerability, but the resulting effect may only be a denial of service.

* ### What is the Microsoft Exploitability Index?

  The Microsoft Exploitability Index provides additional information to help customers prioritize their deployment of the monthly security updates. Microsoft designed this index to provide customers guidance concerning the likelihood of exploitation, based on each vulnerability addressed by Microsoft security updates.
* ### Why did Microsoft create the Exploitability Index?

  Customers asked for more information to help them prioritize their deployment of Microsoft security updates each month, specifically requesting details about the likelihood of exploitation for the vulnerabilities addressed in security updates. The Exploitability Index provides guidance about the actual risk of exploitation of a vulnerability at the time of the security update’s release.
* ### How are vulnerabilities rated?

  Microsoft Exploitability Index focuses on two aspects of a vulnerability to build its ratings:
  1. Current exploitation trends, based on telemetry data and awareness of exploitation of a particular type of vulnerability in a particular product,
  2. The cost and reliability of building a working exploit for the vulnerability, based on a technical analysis of the vulnerability.
* ### Is this a truly reliable rating system?

  While reliably predicting activity within the security ecosystem is always difficult, there are three reasons why this system should be useful. First, over the last few years we have realized that many security researchers analyze the updates associated with Microsoft's security updates the day they are released to create and evaluate protections. In doing so, many of these researchers also create exploit code to test them. The methodology used to develop this exploit code is like the one Microsoft uses to determine the likelihood of exploit code release. Microsoft analyzes the updates themselves, the nature of the vulnerability, and the conditions that must be met for an exploit to execute successfully. Second, not all vulnerabilities resolved by our security updates are exploited. A vulnerability may well be technically exploitable with a high degree of reliability, but it may never be exploited. We continuously monitor and track exploitation activity to keep up to date with current trends. This in turn informs our opinion of what constitutes a more attractive vulnerability over similar vulnerabilities, and enables us to more accurately communicate an actual risk, rather than a potential one from the vulnerabilities we patch.
  Finally, we are also partnering with protection providers through the Microsoft Active Protections Program (MAPP), working with them to help validate our predictions each month – thereby using a community approach to ensure better accuracy through information sharing.
* ### How is the Exploitability Index different from the Security Update Severity Rating system?

  The Security Update Severity Rating System assumes that exploitation will be successful. For some vulnerabilities where exploitability is high, this assumption is very likely to be true for a broad set of attackers. For other vulnerabilities where exploitability is low, this assumption may only be true when a dedicated attacker puts a lot of resources into ensuring their attack is successful. Regardless of the Severity or Exploitability Index rating, Microsoft always recommends that customers deploy all applicable and available updates; however, this rating information can assist sophisticated customers in prioritizing their approach to each month's release.
* ### How are Denial of Service, Tampering, Information Disclosure, or Spoofing issues rated?

  The Exploitability Index does not differentiate between vulnerability types. It focuses on the likelihood of exploitation of each vulnerability within the range of their full impact potential. Thus, any vulnerability, whether it is Remote Code Execution, Tampering or other, could be rated any of the Exploitability Index ratings.
* ### What happens when newly emerging information requires an update to the Exploitability Index rating?

  The ability to rate the possible exploitation of vulnerabilities is an evolving science, and new techniques for exploitation in general, or unique techniques specific to a vulnerability, or new trends in detected exploits of particular products may be discovered that could change the Exploitability Index rating. However, the goal of the Exploitability Index is to help customers prioritize those updates for the most current monthly release. Therefore, if there is information that would change an assessment released in the first month of a security release, Microsoft will update the Exploitability Index. If information becomes available in subsequent months, after most customers have made their prioritization decisions, the Exploitability Index will not be updated as it is no longer useful to the customer. When an Exploitability Index rating is corrected in a way that reflects increased risk to customers, the security update revision is incremented at a major version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 2.0). When risk is adjusted downwards, the update revision is incremented at a minor version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 1.1).
* ### How does the Exploitability Index relate to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and other rating systems?

  The Exploitability Index is separate and not related to other rating systems. However, the MSRC is a contributing member to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), and Microsoft shares its experience and customer feedback in building and releasing the Exploitability Index with the working group in order to help ensure the CVSS is effective and actionable.
