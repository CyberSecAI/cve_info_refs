Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-1800:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Integer overflows in SVG filters.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The vulnerability stems from integer overflow issues within the SVG filter processing logic. Specifically, during the calculation of filter effects.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The blog post indicates a "High" severity rating for this vulnerability. While the provided text does not give specifics on the impact, integer overflows could lead to crashes, memory corruption, or potentially arbitrary code execution. The fix is focused on preventing these overflows.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves crafting a malicious SVG file that triggers the integer overflows in the filter calculations. This would likely involve complex filter setups that manipulate numbers in a way to force overflows.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to be able to get a user to open a malicious SVG file within the affected browser. This could be done through a website, email, or any other method of delivering the file.

**Additional details:**
- The fix for this issue was part of the Stable channel update to version 11.0.696.68.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Cris Neckar of the Google Chrome Security Team.
- The code review diffs indicate modifications to the following files: `FEComposite.cpp`, `FEConvolveMatrix.h`, `FEDisplacementMap.h`, `FEFlood.h`, `FELighting.h`, `FETile.h`, `FETurbulence.h`, `FilterEffect.h`, `FilterEffect.cpp`, `RenderSVGResourceFilter.cpp` and `RenderSVGResourceFilterPrimitive.cpp`. These files are likely involved in the SVG filter processing.
- The patch adds a new test case `filter-after-transform-crash.svg` to ensure the fix is working correctly.
