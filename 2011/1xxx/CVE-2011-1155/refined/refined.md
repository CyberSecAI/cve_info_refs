Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2011-1155:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The root cause is improper sanitization of file names by the logrotate utility when performing the 'write state' action. Specifically, logrotate doesn't handle special characters in file names correctly during this process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Improper Input Handling:** The vulnerability stems from the logrotate utility's failure to properly escape or sanitize file names containing special characters when writing state information. This lack of input sanitization can lead to unexpected behavior and potentially a denial-of-service condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A local attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause the logrotate utility to abort during subsequent runs. This is achieved by creating a log file with a specially crafted name containing characters that are not properly handled during the 'write state' operation. This would prevent log rotation.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Attack:** The attack vector is local; an attacker needs to have the ability to create a log file with a specially crafted file name in a location processed by logrotate.
- **Crafted Filenames:** The specific attack involves injecting special characters into the log file name, which, when processed during the 'write state' operation, triggers a parsing error causing the program to abort.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local Access:** The attacker requires local access to the system and the ability to create files with specific, crafted names within the directories that are processed by logrotate.
- **Knowledge of Logrotate:** The attacker needs some level of understanding of how logrotate functions, specifically related to writing its state information, in order to craft malicious filenames.

**Additional Notes:**

- This vulnerability is distinct from other logrotate issues mentioned, specifically relating to TOCTOU race conditions or shell injection, and has been assigned its own CVE.
- The vulnerability is present in the way logrotate handles arguments sanitization during the 'write state' action and not during log rotation itself.
