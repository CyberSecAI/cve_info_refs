Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2011-1943

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A debugging message was inadvertently left in the `libnm-util` library of NetworkManager. This message logged the password used to unlock a certificate to the system log (`/var/log/messages`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  **Logging of Sensitive Information:** The primary vulnerability is the logging of the certificate password in plain text.
-  **Information Exposure:** This exposed the password to anyone with access to the system logs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker with access to system logs could obtain the certificate password, potentially leading to unauthorized access or impersonation if the certificate is used for authentication.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Access to System Logs:**  An attacker would need access to the system's log files to view the logged passwords.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** An attacker would need at least local access to the system to view the `/var/log/messages` file.
- **Privilege:** Depending on system configurations, an attacker might require root or administrative privileges to access the system logs.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was introduced in a commit on May 21, 2011, and removed in a subsequent commit on May 27, 2011.
- This issue did not affect versions of NetworkManager shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5, or 6.
- A fix was provided in NetworkManager version 0.8.9997-1.git20110531.fc15 for Fedora 15.
- The vulnerability existed within `libnm-util` not `NetworkManager-openvpn` as initially reported.
