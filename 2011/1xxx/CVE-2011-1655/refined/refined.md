{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Flaw in the implementation of the getDBConfigSettings method in the management.asmx module of the Management Web Service.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Unauthenticated access to sensitive information",
    "Plaintext transmission of database credentials"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote attackers can obtain the server's database credentials, which allows them to authenticate to the server and execute arbitrary code under the context of the database administrator.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending SOAP 1.2 requests to the management.asmx module, specifically targeting the getDBConfigSettings method.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Remote, unauthenticated attacker. Needs network access to the vulnerable service listening on ports 34444 (HTTP) or 34443 (HTTPS)."
