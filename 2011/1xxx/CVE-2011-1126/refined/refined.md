Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2011-1126:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the VMware `vmrun` utility on Linux systems. Specifically, it arises due to the way the utility handles library loading in non-standard filesystem configurations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Library Loading:** The `vmrun` utility, when operating in a non-standard file system configuration, becomes vulnerable to having its execution hijacked. The utility may load libraries from attacker-controlled paths.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local Privilege Escalation:** An attacker with the ability to place files in a predefined library path can gain execution control of the `vmrun` utility. Since `vmrun` is used to interact with virtual machines, taking control of it provides a potential attack vector for further system compromise and privilege escalation.
*   **Complete Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact**: The vulnerability allows a local attacker to completely compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system where the vulnerable `vmrun` utility is installed.
*   **File Placement:** The attacker must be able to place malicious files in a library path that `vmrun` uses for loading libraries in non-standard filesystem configurations.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Account:** The attacker needs to have a user account on the target Linux system.
*   **File Write Permissions:** The attacker requires the ability to write files to a library path which `vmrun` loads libraries from when running in non-standard filesystems.

**Affected Products and Versions:**

*   VMware VIX API for Linux 1.10.2 and earlier.
*   VMware Workstation 7.1.3 on Linux and earlier.
*   VMware Workstation 6.5.5 on Linux and earlier.

**Mitigation:**

*   Upgrade to VIX API 1.10.3 or later.
*   Upgrade to Workstation 7.1.4 build 385536 or later.
*   Apply the updated `vmrun` version for Workstation 6.5.x (Refer to VMware Knowledge Base article 1035509)

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is specific to Linux systems; Windows-based installations are not affected.
* The vulnerability is considered a medium risk with a CVSS base score of 6.9/10.
