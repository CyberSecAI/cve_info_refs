* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

Kees Cook discovered that some ethtool functions did not correctly clear

heap memory. A local attacker with CAP\_NET\_ADMIN privileges could exploit

this to read portions of kernel heap memory, leading to a loss of privacy.

([CVE-2010-4655](/security/CVE-2010-4655))

Kees Cook discovered that the IOWarrior USB device driver did not correctly

check certain size fields. A local attacker with physical access could plug

in a specially crafted USB device to crash the system or potentially gain

root privileges. ([CVE-2010-4656](/security/CVE-2010-4656))

Goldwyn Rodrigues discovered that the OCFS2 filesystem did not correctly

clear memory when writing certain file holes. A local attacker could

exploit this to read uninitialized data from the disk, leading to a loss of

privacy. ([CVE-2011-0463](/security/CVE-2011-0463))

Jens Kuehnel discovered that the InfiniBand driver contained a race

condition. On systems using InfiniBand, a local attacker could send

specially crafted requests to crash the system, leading to a denial of

service. ([CVE-2011-0695](/security/CVE-2011-0695))

Rafael Dominguez Vega discovered that the caiaq Native Instruments USB

driver did not correctly validate string lengths. A local attacker with

physical access could plug in a specially crafted USB device to crash the

system or potentially gain root privileges. ([CVE-2011-0712](/security/CVE-2011-0712))

Timo Warns discovered that LDM partition parsing routines did not correctly

calculate block counts. A local attacker with physical access could plug in

a specially crafted block device to crash the system, leading to a denial

of service. ([CVE-2011-1012](/security/CVE-2011-1012))

Timo Warns discovered that the LDM disk partition handling code did not

correctly handle certain values. By inserting a specially crafted disk

device, a local attacker could exploit this to gain root privileges.

([CVE-2011-1017](/security/CVE-2011-1017))

Tavis Ormandy discovered that the pidmap function did not correctly handle

large requests. A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system,

leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-1593](/security/CVE-2011-1593))

Subject: CVE request: kernel: Corrupted LDM partition table issues

Reported by Timo Warns, "The kernel automatically evaluates partition
tables of storage devices. The code for evaluating LDM partitions (in
fs/partitions/ldm.c) contains a bug that causes a kernel oops on certain

<http://www.spinics.net/lists/mm-commits/msg82429.html>

This should affect kernels version v2.6.27-rc1 and above. Of course,
CONFIG_LDM_PARTITION needs to be set.

Thanks, Eugene

Subject: ldm: corrupted partition table can cause kernel oops
From: Timo Warns <Warns@xxxxxxxxxxxx>

The kernel automatically evaluates partition tables of storage devices.
The code for evaluating LDM partitions (in fs/partitions/ldm.c) contains a
bug that causes a kernel oops on certain corrupted LDM partitions.  A
kernel subsystem seems to crash, because, after the oops, the kernel no
longer recognizes newly connected storage devices.

The patch changes ldm_parse_vmdb() to Validate the value of vblk_size.

PRE-CERT Security Advisory
==========================
\* Advisory: PRE-SA-2011-01
\* Released on: 23 Feb 2011
\* Last updated on: 11 Jun 2011
\* Affected product: Linux Kernel 2.4 and 2.6
\* Impact: - privilege escalation
- denial-of-service
- disclosure of sensitive information
\* Origin: storage devices
\* Credit: Timo Warns (PRESENSE Technologies GmbH)
\* CVE Identifier: - CVE-2011-1010
- CVE-2011-1012
- CVE-2011-1017
- CVE-2011-2182
Summary
- -------
The Linux kernel contains some vulnerabilities that may lead to
privilege escalation, denial-of-service, or information leakage via
corrupted partition tables. Exploiting these vulnerabilities has been
demonstrated by a "USB Stick of Death" that crashes the Linux kernel
upon connecting the stick.
The kernel automatically evaluates partition tables of storage devices.
Note that this happens independently of whether auto-mounting is enabled
or not. The code for evaluating MAC and LDM partition tables contains the
following vulnerabilities:
\* CVE-2011-1010
A buffer overflow bug in mac\_partition in fs/partitions/mac.c (for MAC
partition tables) allows to cause a denial-of-service (kernel panic)
via a corrupted MAC partition table.
For a patch, see
http://git.kernel.org/linus/fa7ea87a057958a8b7926c1a60a3ca6d696328ed
\* CVE-2011-1012
A division-by-zero bug in ldm\_get\_vblks in fs/partitions/ldm.c (for
LDM partition tables) allows to cause a denial-of-service (kernel
oops) via a corrupted LDM partition table.
For a patch, see
http://git.kernel.org/linus/294f6cf48666825d23c9372ef37631232746e40d
\* CVE-2011-1017
A buffer overflow bug in ldm\_frag\_add in fs/partitions/ldm.c (for LDM
partition tables) may allow to escalate privileges or to disclose
sensitive information via a corrupted LDM partition table.
For a patch, see
http://git.kernel.org/linus/c340b1d640001c8c9ecff74f68fd90422ae2448a
\* CVE-2011-2182
As Ben Hutchings discovered (http://lkml.org/lkml/2011/5/6/407), the
patch for CVE-2011-1017 (buffer overflow in ldm\_frag\_add) is not
sufficient. The original patch in commit c340b1d64000
("fs/partitions/ldm.c: fix oops caused by corrupted partition table")
does not consider that, for subsequent fragments, previously allocated
memory is used.
For a patch, see
http://git.kernel.org/linus/cae13fe4cc3f24820ffb990c09110626837e85d4
Workaround
- ----------
Compile and use a kernel that does not evaluate MAC and LDM partition
tables. The corresponding configuration keys are CONFIG\_MAC\_PARTITION
and CONFIG\_LDM\_PARTITION.
Solution
- --------
\* CVE-2011-1010
The MAC buffer overflow bug has been fixed in Linux kernel 2.6.37.2.
\* CVE-2011-1012
The LDM division-by-zero bug has been fixed in Linux kernel 2.6.37.3.
\* CVE-2011-1017
The LDM buffer overflow bug has been fixed in Linux kernel 2.6.38.6.
\* CVE-2011-2182
The missing LDM buffer overflow case has been fixed in Linux kernel
2.6.38.8.

When further information becomes available, this advisory will be
updated. The most recent version of this advisory is available at:
http://www.pre-cert.de/advisories/PRE-SA-2011-01.txt
ChangeLog
- ---------
\* 24 Feb 2011
- Added CVE ID to second vulnerability (CVE-2011-1012)
\* 25 Feb 2011
- Added CVE ID to third vulnerability (CVE-2011-1017)
\* 9 Mar 2011
- CVE-2011-1010 and CVE-2011-1012 have been fixed in Linux
kernel 2.6.
\* 10 May 2011
- CVE-2011-1017 has been fixed in Linux kernel 2.6.
- Added/updated URLs to patches.
\* 30 May 2011
- Added second patch to CVE-2011-1017.
As Ben Hutchings discovered (http://lkml.org/lkml/2011/5/6/407),
the first patch for CVE-2011-1017 was not sufficient. A second patch
considers that, for subsequent fragments, previously allocated
memory is used.
\* 11 Jun 2011
- CVE-2011-2182 has been assigned to the subsequent LDM patch.
