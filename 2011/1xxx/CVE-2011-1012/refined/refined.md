Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-1012:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a division-by-zero error in the `ldm_get_vblks` function within the Linux kernel's Logical Disk Manager (LDM) partition handling code (`fs/partitions/ldm.c`). Specifically, the code does not validate the `vblk_size` value, leading to division by zero when it is zero.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Division-by-zero:** The core issue is the lack of input validation for `vblk_size` before using it in a division operation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The division-by-zero error causes a kernel "oops" (a kernel-level error), which leads to system instability and effectively a denial of service. Additionally, after the oops, the kernel may no longer recognize newly connected storage devices.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Maliciously Crafted Storage Device:** The primary attack vector involves inserting a storage device (e.g., a USB stick) containing a corrupted LDM partition table with a `vblk_size` value of zero.
- **Local Attack:** The attacker needs physical access to the system to plug in the malicious storage device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Physical Access:** The attacker needs physical access to the target system to connect the crafted storage device.
- **Knowledge of LDM Partitions:**  The attacker needs to understand how to craft a corrupted LDM partition table, specifically manipulating the `vblk_size` field.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Linux kernel versions v2.6.27-rc1 and above where `CONFIG_LDM_PARTITION` is enabled.
- The fix involves adding a check in `ldm_parse_vmdb()` to validate if `vm->vblk_size` is 0 and return if it is, preventing the division by zero.
- This is one of a series of vulnerabilities related to parsing of corrupted partition tables, collectively known as the "USB Stick of Death" issue.
