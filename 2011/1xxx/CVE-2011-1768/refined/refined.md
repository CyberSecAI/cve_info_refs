Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2011-1768:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a race condition in the Linux kernel's network subsystem related to the registration of tunnel protocols and network namespaces (netns). Specifically, the receive hook for tunnel protocols (like IPIP, IPv6 tunnels, and SIT) can be called before the network namespace setup is complete.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Race Condition:** A race condition exists during module loading of tunnel protocols (e.g., ipip, ip6_tunnel, sit) where the receive hook for that protocol can be invoked before the necessary network namespace structures are fully initialized.
*   **Incorrect Ordering:** The receive hook can be called before the netns setup, leading to an attempt to access uninitialized structures.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** If a packet arrives at the exact moment when the tunnel module is being loaded but before netns is fully initialized, the kernel will attempt to process the packet using the receive hook. Because the netns is not set up, the hook will try to access a null or uninitialized pointer causing a kernel panic (oops), leading to a denial of service. The system will crash.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Packet:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a network packet to a system when a tunnel module is being loaded into memory.
*  **Module Loading:**  The attacker needs to time the packet sending such that it coincides with the module loading time to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote or Local:** While remote exploitation is possible if the tunnel modules are loaded and a packet is sent at the right moment, the attacker could also trigger this locally by manually loading the module and immediately sending traffic to the affected network interface or having the network traffic start during the module load process..
*  **Timing:** The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted network packet at the moment the affected module is being loaded, which implies a degree of timing precision or luck.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is remotely exploitable if the vulnerable tunnel modules (ipip, ip6_tunnel, sit) are compiled as modules, and network traffic is received at the time of module loading.
* The window of opportunity for the race condition to occur is very small.
* The fix involves properly ordering the netns setup with the protocol registration to avoid the null pointer dereference.
*  The vulnerability affects Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and MRG.
*  A regression was found related to the fix, causing a NULL pointer dereference when `ip6_tunnel` is loaded and required an additional fix.
