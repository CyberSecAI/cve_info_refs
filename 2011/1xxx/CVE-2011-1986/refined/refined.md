Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2011-1986:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by Microsoft Excel incorrectly handling objects in memory, specifically related to a "use after free" condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use-After-Free:** Excel improperly manages memory, leading to a scenario where freed memory is accessed again, causing potential corruption or allowing for arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the logged-on user. This could lead to:
  - Complete control of the affected system.
  - Installation of programs.
  - Viewing, changing, or deleting data.
  - Creation of new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Email:** An attacker sends a specially crafted Excel file as an attachment, convincing the user to open it.
- **Web-based:** An attacker hosts a malicious Excel file on a website (or a compromised site), tricking the user into visiting the site and opening the file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious Excel file that exploits the memory management flaw.
- They need to be able to deliver this file to the victim, either through email or hosting on a web server.
- The attacker needs to convince the victim to open the malicious Excel file for the exploit to trigger.
- No special network access or permissions are required beyond standard user interaction.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided content provides more detailed information than the official CVE description, including specific workarounds and mitigations.
- The vulnerability is rated "Important" due to the mitigating factor of requiring user interaction to open the malicious file.
- The "Office File Validation" feature is mentioned as a partial mitigation, potentially blocking the attack vector or prompting the user before opening the file.
- The Microsoft document also provides detection and deployment guidance, including information on using tools like Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) and Windows Server Update Services (WSUS).
