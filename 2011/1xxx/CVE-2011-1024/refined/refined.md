Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2011-1024:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how OpenLDAP handles forwarded bind (authentication) requests in a specific configuration involving a slave server, a master server, the `chain` overlay and the `ppolicy` overlay with `ppolicy_forward_updates` enabled. When a bind request with invalid credentials is sent to a slave server configured this way, it forwards the request to the master. However, instead of returning a failure message to the client, the slave incorrectly returns a success message, essentially allowing the client to authenticate as an anonymous user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Handling of Forwarded Bind Failures:** The slave server incorrectly interprets a forwarded authentication failure from the master as a successful bind.
- **Chain Overlay Interaction with ppolicy:** The combination of the `chain` overlay (used for forwarding requests to another LDAP server) with `ppolicy` (password policy overlay) and `ppolicy_forward_updates` option exposes the vulnerability.
- **Lack of proper error propagation:** The slave server fails to properly propagate the authentication error response from the master to the client.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Bypassed Authentication:** An attacker can bypass authentication checks on the slave server by providing invalid credentials.
- **Access as Anonymous User:** While the LDAP directory contents are not directly exposed because the user ends up with an anonymous bind, the successful bind response is misleading for client applications, which may grant access based on it.
- **Privilege Escalation (Indirect):** Although this is not a direct privilege escalation within the LDAP directory itself, external programs relying on the bind result from LDAP, such as PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) or SSSD (System Security Services Daemon) which are used for user authentication, can be tricked into allowing a user login with an invalid password.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the OpenLDAP slave server.
- **Direct Bind Request:** The attacker must send a bind request with invalid credentials to the vulnerable slave server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send bind requests to an OpenLDAP server that has the specific vulnerable configuration: a slave server configured with the `chain` overlay and the `ppolicy` overlay with the `ppolicy_forward_updates` enabled.
- No special privileges within the OpenLDAP directory are required for exploitation.

**Technical Details and Description:**

- When a bind request is sent to a slave server, it's forwarded to the master. The master may reject the request due to invalid credentials.
- When the master responds to the slave with failure, the slave should relay this failure, however due to the interaction of `chain` overlay and `ppolicy` overlay with `ppolicy_forward_updates` option enabled, the failure response is ignored.
- The slave then incorrectly returns a successful bind response to the client, but the subsequent `WHOAMI` operation would indicate the client is bound as anonymous user.
- This successful bind result is sent to client applications, like PAM or SSSD, causing them to incorrectly authorize the user.
- The issue is related to the chain overlay forwarding bind operations and the ppolicy overlay incorrectly handling the forwarded failures. The issue is also present when `chain-return-error` is set to `TRUE`.
- The fix involves proper error propagation within the chain overlay.
- The vulnerability affects OpenLDAP versions 2.4.x as found in RHEL5 and RHEL6, but not in RHEL4 because it lacks `ppolicy` overlay support.
