Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2011-1071:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the improper use of `alloca()` within the `fnmatch()` function of the GNU C Library (glibc) and Embedded GLIBC (EGLIBC).
-  `alloca()` is used to allocate space on the stack based on the length of a user-supplied UTF-8 string.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Stack Exhaustion:** A long UTF-8 string passed to `fnmatch()` would lead to excessive stack allocation via `alloca()`, potentially causing stack overflow/exhaustion.
- **Integer Overflow:** The glibc code multiplies the string length by 4 (sizeof(wchar_t)), which can result in an integer overflow if a very long string is provided, potentially causing a large stack allocation.
- **Memory Corruption:** In specific conditions, the stack pointer can wrap, effectively shrinking the stack and overwriting return addresses, local variables, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The most common impact is a denial of service due to stack exhaustion, resulting in an application crash.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** In certain circumstances (e.g., on systems without DEP or when the stack pointer wraps), the vulnerability can be leveraged for arbitrary code execution. The "A" characters of the large input string, when executed as instructions, can lead to arbitrary code execution depending on the architecture and memory layout.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The primary attack vector is through the `fnmatch()` function, where a crafted, long UTF-8 string is passed as the "string" argument.
- The "pattern" argument in `fnmatch()` can also be crafted to exploit other issues.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs the ability to control the input string passed to the `fnmatch()` function.
- No special privileges are needed.

**Additional Information:**

- This issue is related to CVE-2010-2898, CVE-2010-1917, and CVE-2007-4782.
- The issue was initially discovered while investigating a bug in Google Chrome.
- The vulnerability also affects proftpd.
- The integer overflow issue was fixed in a follow-up patch.
- The issue was present in both glibc and eglibc.
- Red Hat releases patched packages to address this flaw.
- VMware also released patches for affected products.
-  The vulnerability bypasses standard system protections such as stack canaries and ASLR.
