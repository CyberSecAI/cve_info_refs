Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-1887:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a **Null Pointer De-reference** issue within the `win32k.sys` driver. This occurs due to how Windows kernel-mode drivers manage pointers to kernel-mode driver objects. Specifically, the vulnerability arises from how the driver keeps track of these pointers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Null Pointer Dereference:** The core issue is that the driver attempts to access memory via a pointer that is null (points to address 0), leading to a crash or exploitable condition.
*   **Improper Kernel-Mode Driver Pointer Management:** The way the driver tracks and manages pointers to kernel objects is flawed, allowing the null pointer dereference to occur.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Elevation of Privilege:** An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code in kernel mode.
*   **Full System Control:** Successful exploitation grants the attacker complete control over the affected system.
*   **Malicious Activities:** This control allows the attacker to:
    *   Install programs.
    *   View, change, or delete data.
    *   Create new accounts with full administrative rights.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on to the system locally. This is not a remote exploitation vulnerability.
*   **Specially Crafted Application:**  The attack is triggered by running a specifically designed application that exploits the null pointer dereference vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Valid Local Logon:** The attacker needs legitimate credentials to log on to the target system.
*   **Ability to Execute Code:** The attacker must be able to execute the crafted application on the target system.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The `win32k.sys` driver is part of the Windows subsystem, handling window management, screen output, input collection, and graphics through the Graphics Device Interface (GDI).
*   This vulnerability is part of a larger set of vulnerabilities (CVE-2011-1874 to CVE-2011-1888) addressed by Microsoft in their MS11-054 security bulletin.
*   The vulnerability was not publicly disclosed or exploited before the release of the security bulletin and patch.
*   The vulnerability affects a wide range of Windows operating systems, including Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2.
*   The vulnerability is classified as "Important" in terms of severity by Microsoft.
*   The provided content indicates that the vulnerability was reported by Tarjei Mandt of Norman.
