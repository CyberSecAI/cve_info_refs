{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `addmntent()` function in glibc, used by setuid mount helpers, does not properly handle the `RLIMIT_FSIZE` resource limit. It returns success even if the write operation is truncated due to a low `RLIMIT_FSIZE` setting, leading to incomplete entries in `/etc/mtab`.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incomplete write handling in `addmntent()`: The function does not check if the entire entry was written, especially when the process has a limited `RLIMIT_FSIZE`.",
      "Lack of error detection: Mount helpers, due to glibc's behavior, do not detect that their write operations to `/etc/mtab` have failed.",
      "Direct `/etc/mtab` manipulation: Some mount helpers directly modify `/etc/mtab` instead of using a temporary file and committing changes only if the write was successful. This can cause data corruption if the write fails mid-operation."
    ],
    "impact": "An unprivileged user can corrupt the `/etc/mtab` file. This corruption can potentially allow manipulation of mount point options and potentially enable unauthorized unmounting of file systems. Multiple invocations of a vulnerable mount helper with a low `RLIMIT_FSIZE` could lead to near-arbitrary appending to `/etc/mtab`.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Setting a low RLIMIT_FSIZE: Attacker sets a small file size limit using `RLIMIT_FSIZE`.",
      "Invoking a vulnerable suid mount helper: The attacker invokes a setuid mount helper, like `mount.cifs`, `ncpmount`, etc, which calls `addmntent()` to write to `/etc/mtab`.",
      "Triggering partial write: The limited `RLIMIT_FSIZE` causes the write to `/etc/mtab` to be truncated, which is not correctly handled by `addmntent()` or the helper."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to have the ability to invoke setuid mount helpers and set resource limits using standard user-level functionality such as the `ulimit` command. No root privileges are initially required to carry out this attack.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability affects several setuid mount helpers including `mount.cifs` (samba), `fusermount` (FUSE), `mount` (util-linux), `ncpmount` (ncpfs), and `vmware-hgfsmounter` (open-vm-tools). The vulnerability stems from how `addmntent()` handles writes to `/etc/mtab` when a low `RLIMIT_FSIZE` is set. The initial proposed solution involved patching glibc to raise the rlimit in `addmntent()` or to have proper error handling, but the glibc maintainer opposed modifying glibc. The final fix in glibc involves checking the return value of fflush to detect errors after the fprintf call, and to return the error properly when the file descriptor is closed via endmntent."
