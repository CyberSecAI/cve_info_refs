Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2011-1991:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how certain Windows components handle the loading of Dynamic Link Library (DLL) files. Specifically, these components do not properly restrict the path used when loading external libraries. This insecure practice can lead to "binary planting" or "DLL preloading attacks".

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Library Loading:** Vulnerable components use insufficiently qualified paths when loading external DLLs. This allows an attacker to introduce a malicious DLL.
- **DLL Preloading/Binary Planting:** The vulnerability occurs because the application searches specific locations, including network shares or the current working directory (CWD), for the necessary library.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the vulnerable application.
- **Complete System Control:** If the user has administrative rights, the attacker can gain full control of the affected system, allowing them to install programs, view, change, or delete data, and create new accounts.
- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker who already has access to a local folder could potentially elevate their access on the system by exploiting a DLL preloading vulnerability in an application running with elevated privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Shares (SMB, WebDAV):** An attacker can place a malicious DLL on a network share (like SMB or WebDAV). If a user opens a document from this location using a vulnerable application, the application might load the attacker's malicious DLL.
- **Email Attachments:** An attacker could send a legitimate document (.rtf, .txt, or .doc) as an email attachment and convince the user to save it into a folder containing a malicious DLL. Then, when the user opens the document, the vulnerable application loads the malicious DLL.
- **Current Working Directory (CWD):** If a vulnerable application searches for a DLL in the current working directory, an attacker can manipulate this directory and place a malicious DLL there.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Write to a Network Share:** The attacker needs to be able to write to a network location (e.g., WebDAV, SMB) that the victim has access to.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to convince the user to open a specially crafted or legitimate document from a location containing the malicious DLL or use an application with a DLL loading vulnerability.
- **Local Access (for privilege escalation):** In the case of privilege escalation, the attacker would need to already have local access to the system to place a malicious DLL in a location where a vulnerable application could load it.

**Additional Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability is related to Microsoft Security Advisory 2269637 which describes the class of insecure library loading vulnerabilities in applications.
- The vulnerability affects multiple Windows components including: Display Panning CPL Extension (deskpan.dll), Microsoft EAPHost Authenticator Service, Microsoft Management Console (MMC), Folder Redirection, the Japanese Input Method Editor (IME), and HyperTerminal
- The vulnerability exists because these components incorrectly restrict the path used to load external libraries.
- Microsoft recommends disabling the WebClient service to block attacks via WebDAV. Blocking TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall can also provide additional protection against SMB based attacks.

**Mitigations and Workarounds:**

*   Applying the security update MS11-071 to patch the vulnerable components
*   Using the tool described in Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2264107 to disable loading libraries from remote network shares and WebDAV
*   Disabling the WebClient service
*   Blocking TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall
