  "response": {
    "root_cause": "The transwiki import feature in MediaWiki neglected to perform access control checks on form submission.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Missing access control checks",
      "Insecure direct object reference"
    ],
    "impact": "Any user could trigger a transwiki import, potentially copying content from a remote wiki without proper authorization. This could lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or disclosure.",
    "attack_vectors": "A specially crafted POST request to the transwiki import feature could bypass the intended access controls.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a user of the MediaWiki instance where the transwiki import feature is enabled and have the ability to send a POST request. No special privileges beyond a standard user account are required.",
    "additional_details": "The transwiki import feature is disabled by default. When enabled, it allows wiki pages to be copied from remote wikis listed in the `$wgImportSources` configuration variable. The vulnerability existed because access control checks were performed only before form display, and not during form submission. This allowed an attacker to directly submit a crafted POST request and initiate the import process without proper authorization."
