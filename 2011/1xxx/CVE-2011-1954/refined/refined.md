Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2011-1954:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The application lacks proper Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection mechanisms, allowing attackers to perform unauthorized actions on behalf of legitimate users.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities are present in multiple parts of the application, including `ajax-weblog-guardar.php`, `verpost.php`, `comments.php`, and `perfil.php`.
- The application only includes a CAPTCHA for anonymous comments and registrations.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can perform administrative actions without the victim's knowledge or consent.
- An attacker could potentially steal cookie-based authentication credentials.
- The attacker could gain unauthorized access to the affected application.

**Attack vectors:**
- Exploitation occurs through crafted requests, likely through social engineering techniques, such as tricking users to click on malicious links or visit malicious web pages.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to craft malicious requests targeting vulnerable endpoints.
- The attacker needs to induce an authenticated user to perform the request.
- The attacker can be remote.

**Additional details:**
- This CVE is one of three vulnerabilities disclosed in Post Revolution 0.8.0c. The other two are: CVE-2011-1952 (Denial of Service) and CVE-2011-1953 (Persistent Cross-Site Scripting).
- The vulnerability is present in all versions of Post Revolution prior to and including 0.8.0c.
- A fix for the CSRF vulnerabilities requires coding.
- The vendor released a patch for the DoS and XSS vulnerabilities, but not the CSRF vulnerability.
