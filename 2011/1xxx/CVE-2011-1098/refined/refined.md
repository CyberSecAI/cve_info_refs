Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-1098:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race condition exists in logrotate during the creation of new log files. Specifically, there is a window of time between when a new log file is opened and when its final permissions are applied.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **TOCTOU Race Condition:** The core vulnerability is the race condition that occurs because the file is initially opened with insecure default permissions, then its permissions are changed via fchmod and fchown, making it vulnerable to exploitation between these calls.
- **Insecure Default Permissions:** The vulnerability stems from the fact that new files are initially created with less-restrictive permissions before final permissions are set.
- **Missing Atomic Operation:** The process of creating the file and setting its permissions are not atomic, allowing an attacker to interfere during the intermediate state.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** A local attacker can exploit this race condition to open a newly created log file before final permissions are applied. This allows the attacker to read sensitive information that might be written to the log file by other processes or users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system to exploit this vulnerability.
- **File System Manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to open the new log file during the race condition.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User:** The attacker must be a local user on the system.
- **Timing:** The attacker must be able to open the log file within the short time window between when it is created and its permissions are set.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability does not involve symlink attacks.
- A proposed fix involves creating a temporary file with `umask 0000`, setting the correct owner and mode, then renaming it to the log file name.
- Upstream fix involves using the 'su' directive.

This vulnerability was assigned a "low" severity rating by Red Hat due to the complexity of exploiting the race condition.
