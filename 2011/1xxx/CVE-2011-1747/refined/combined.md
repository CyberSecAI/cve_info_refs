In <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=698999> it is said
"Reference and patch:", but there is no patch for the issue (as I said
in the patch description).  I have no agp hardware and I cannot test
whether forcing the requested pid to the current pid is a good idea (it
might not).

Thanks,

I am a bit confused.

<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=698999> references
<https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/4/14/294>

 which is assigned to CVE-2011-1746 not CVE-2011-1747.

is there a patch for CVE-2011-1747?

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=698999#c0)  Petr Matousek    2011-04-22 15:21:43 UTC  ``` There is a problem in agp code - kernel memory exhaustion (AGPIOC_RESERVE and AGPIOC_ALLOCATE ioctls).  It is not checked whether requested pid is a pid of the caller (no check in agpioc_reserve_wrap()). Each allocation is limited to 16KB, though, there is no per-process limit. This might lead to OOM situation, which is not even solved in case of the caller death by OOM killer - the memory is allocated for another (faked) process.  Reference: <https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/4/14/294>  Acknowledgements:                                                                   Red Hat would like to thank Vasiliy Kulikov of Openwall for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=698999#c3)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2011-04-25 02:36:38 UTC  ``` This issue was mentioned in <https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/4/14/294> and linux-2.6:b522f02184b413955f3bc952e3776ce41edc6355 for the patch fixing [CVE-2011-1746](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1746) because the patch tries to fix a similar problem - OOM.  [CVE-2011-1747](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1747) is not fixed yet.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=698999#c15)  Petr Matousek    2012-05-23 14:33:00 UTC  ``` Statement:  Red Hat Security Response team does not consider this bug to be security relevant one due to the privileges (CAP_SYS_RAWIO) required to exploit this issue.   ``` |  |

Subject: CVE request: kernel: buffer overflow and DoS issues in agp

Hi,

<https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/4/14/293>

"pg_start is copied from userspace on AGPIOC_BIND and AGPIOC_UNBIND ioctl
cmds of agp_ioctl() and passed to agpioc_bind_wrap().  As said in the
comment, (pg_start + mem->page_count) may wrap in case of AGPIOC_BIND,
and it is not checked at all in case of AGPIOC_UNBIND.  As a result, user
with sufficient privileges (usually "video" group) may generate either
local DoS or privilege escalation."

<https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/4/14/294>
<https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/4/19/400>

"page_count is copied from userspace.  agp_allocate_memory() tries to
check whether this number is too big, but doesn't take into account the
wrap case.  Also agp_create_user_memory() doesn't check whether
alloc_size is calculated from num_agp_pages variable without overflow.
This may lead to allocation of too small buffer with following buffer
overflow.

Another problem in agp code is not addressed in the patch - kernel memory
exhaustion (AGPIOC_RESERVE and AGPIOC_ALLOCATE ioctls).  It is not checked
whether requested pid is a pid of the caller (no check in agpioc_reserve_wrap()).
Each allocation is limited to 16KB, though, there is no per-process limit.
This might lead to OOM situation, which is not even solved in case of the
caller death by OOM killer - the memory is allocated for another (faked)
process."

No.  The problem of CVE-2011-1747 is mentioned in the patch fixing
CVE-2011-1746 because the patch tries to fix a similar problem - OOM.

CVE-2011-1747 is not fixed yet.
