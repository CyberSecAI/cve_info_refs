Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2011-1747:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a lack of proper input validation and resource management in the Linux kernel's AGP (Accelerated Graphics Port) driver, specifically in the handling of `AGPIOC_RESERVE` and `AGPIOC_ALLOCATE` ioctl calls. The driver doesn't verify if the requested process ID (PID) belongs to the calling process, allowing a malicious user to exhaust kernel memory by allocating resources on behalf of other (potentially faked) processes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Missing PID Validation:** The `agpioc_reserve_wrap()` function does not validate whether the requested PID matches the PID of the calling process.
2.  **Lack of Per-Process Limit:** There is no per-process limit on the amount of memory that can be allocated via the AGP ioctls. Each allocation is limited to 16KB, but an attacker can repeatedly allocate 16KB chunks, leading to system-wide resource exhaustion.
3.  **Memory Leak on Caller Death:** If a process allocating memory through these ioctls dies due to the OOM killer, the allocated memory is not freed, and remains associated with the faked PID, compounding the resource exhaustion issue.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Kernel Memory Exhaustion (OOM):** An attacker can exploit the lack of input validation and per-process limits to exhaust kernel memory, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
*   **System Instability:** The memory exhaustion can cause the system to become unstable, potentially crashing or becoming unresponsive.
*   **Resource Depletion:** The allocated memory is not released upon termination of the allocating process, causing a resource leak.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited locally by a user with the ability to make ioctl calls to the AGP device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Sufficient Privileges:** The attacker needs sufficient privileges to make ioctl calls to the AGP device, which usually requires membership in the "video" group or similar access to the graphics hardware. This is described as requiring `CAP_SYS_RAWIO` capability in the Red Hat Bugzilla entry.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The issue was identified alongside other AGP driver vulnerabilities (CVE-2011-1745, CVE-2011-1746).
*   A patch was not initially available when the CVE was requested.
*   Red Hat does not consider this to be a security relevant issue because of the privileges required to exploit it.

In summary, CVE-2011-1747 describes a vulnerability that allows a local user with specific privileges to cause a denial-of-service by exhausting kernel memory through the AGP driver. The lack of PID validation and per-process limits are the core weaknesses.
