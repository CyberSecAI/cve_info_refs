One of the most recognizable IT and information security networking certifications is Network+. As time goes on, new versions of certification exams are released, and Network+ releases the latest exam version, N10-008, in September of 2021. Some of the material covered in this latest exam version has changed and changes to Domain names. This article will detail Network+ Domain 1.0, entitled Networking Fundamentals. It will explore what the Network+ cert is, what has changed since the last Network+ exam version, and the objectives and sub-objectives this Domain covers. If you are looking for a great starter to your Network+ exam outline for Domain 1.0, look no further.

## What is Network+?

Network+ is an IT and information security networking certification offered by CompTIA. This certification validates the skills and knowledge required to securely establish, maintain, and troubleshoot essential organization networks. This is one of the most popular networking certs on the market, with 500,000 cert holders worldwide.

## What has changed since the last Network+ exam version?

There have been some changes since exam version N10-007 that you need to be aware of. Aside from Domain name changes and slight changes to exam material weights, there have been sub-objective changes, especially on the foundational networking tools and technologies used to create secure networks. Below is a comparison of N10-007 and N10-008 (and their respective weights of exam material covered):

|
|  |

 **Network+ N10-007 Domains** | **Network+ N10-008 Domains** |

|
|  |

 1. Networking Concepts (23%) | 1. Networking Fundamentals (24%) |

|
|  |

 2. Infrastructure (18%) | 2. Network Implementations (19%) |

|
|  |

 3. Network Operations (17%) | 3. Network Operations (16%) |

|
|  |

 4. Network Security (20%) | 4. Network Security (19%) |

|
|  |

 5. Network Troubleshooting and Tools (22%) | 5. Network Troubleshooting (22%) |

Domain 1.0 has had a slight name change since the last exam version and is now Networking Fundamentals. It also covers a little more material, adding an extra 1% of exam material to what it covers. Without further ado, let’s dive into the material covered by Domain 1.0.
