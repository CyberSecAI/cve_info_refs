Added by [Jean-Philippe Lang](/users/1) [almost 14 years](/projects/redmine/activity?from=2011-03-07 "2011-03-07 21:07") ago

Redmine [1.1.2](/versions/31) has been released and is available at [Rubyforge](http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=1850).

This maintenance release for 1.1.x users includes 13 bug fixes since 1.1.1 and a security fix (XSS vulnerability affecting all Redmine versions from 1.0.1 to 1.1.1). As previous 1.0.x and 1.1.x releases, it still runs with Rails 2.3.5.
