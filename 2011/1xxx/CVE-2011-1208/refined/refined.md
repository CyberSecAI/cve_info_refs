Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-1208:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to improper handling of the `rpc_test_svc_readwrite` and `rpc_test_svc_done` commands within the IBM solidDB `solid.exe` process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- NULL pointer dereference: Sending the vulnerable commands to the service on TCP port 2315 causes the `solidDB.exe` process to dereference a NULL pointer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): Successful exploitation results in the crashing of the `solidDB.exe` process, leading to a denial of service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network: The vulnerability is triggered by sending specially crafted `rpc_test_svc_readwrite` and `rpc_test_svc_done` commands over a network.
- Remote: The attack can be carried out remotely by an attacker with network access to the vulnerable server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access: The attacker needs to have network access to the system running the vulnerable IBM solidDB instance.
- No authentication: Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker can directly send malicious commands to TCP port 2315.
