The provided document contains detailed information about multiple vulnerabilities addressed in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS11-081, including CVE-2011-1999.

Here's a breakdown of the information relevant to **CVE-2011-1999**:

**Vulnerability Name:** Select Element Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from how Internet Explorer accesses a dereferenced memory address. This improper memory access can corrupt memory, potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper memory access
- Dereferenced memory address is mishandled
- Memory corruption leading to code execution

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution
- An attacker can gain the same user rights as the logged-on user.
- If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker could take complete control of the affected system, install programs, view/modify/delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A specially crafted website designed to trigger the vulnerability.
- Embedding malicious content within an ActiveX control in applications or Microsoft Office documents.
- Compromised websites or websites accepting user-provided content/advertisements could also be used to host malicious content.
- The attacker needs to convince the victim to visit the malicious website, typically via social engineering (e.g., a link in an email or instant message).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to create and host a specially crafted webpage or embed a malicious ActiveX control.
- Ability to convince a user to visit the attacker-controlled website or open the malicious file.

**Mitigating Factors:**
- Internet Explorer's Enhanced Security Configuration on Windows Servers helps to mitigate the vulnerability for sites not in the Trusted Sites zone.
- Opening HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted Sites zone disables scripts and ActiveX controls.
- Users with fewer user rights are less impacted than users with administrative privileges.

**Affected Software (from the document):**
- Internet Explorer 8 on Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, and Windows 7
- Internet Explorer 9 on Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, and Windows 7

The vulnerability does NOT affect Internet Explorer 6, Internet Explorer 7, or Internet Explorer 9 on other operating systems, according to the provided tables.

**Workarounds:**
- Setting the Internet and Local Intranet security zone to "High" to block ActiveX controls and Active Scripting.
- Configuring Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local Intranet security zones.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was not publicly disclosed before this security bulletin.
- There were no reports of active exploitation before this security bulletin.
- The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how Internet Explorer allocates and accesses memory.

This detailed description goes significantly beyond the placeholder CVE description, providing information on the vulnerability's root cause, impact, attack vectors, and mitigations.
