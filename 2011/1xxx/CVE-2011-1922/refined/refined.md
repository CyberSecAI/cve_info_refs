{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to an error in the code that generates DNS error messages, which results in Unbound constructing an empty UDP message under certain conditions.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of error conditions when constructing DNS error messages.",
      "Failure to properly rewind the buffer before setting flags and response code.",
      "Assertion failure when processing empty UDP messages if specific configurations are enabled."
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability leads to a denial of service (DoS) condition, where the Unbound daemon crashes due to an assertion failure.",
    "attack_vectors": "A specially crafted DNS query can trigger the vulnerable code path.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send DNS queries to the Unbound server. No authentication is required, making this vulnerability remotely exploitable. The specific conditions for the assertion to be triggered include using specific configurations (--enable-checking or --enable-debug with interface-automatic). If these conditions are not enabled then an empty packet will be sent instead, which is not harmful."
  },
    "affected_versions": "Unbound versions 1.0 up to and including 1.4.9 are affected.",
    "fixed_versions": "Unbound version 1.4.10 and above."
