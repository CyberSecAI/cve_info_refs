{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Missing error checking in the way page tables were handled in the Xen hypervisor implementation.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The vulnerability lies in the `arch_set_info_guest()` function within the Xen hypervisor implementation. It lacks proper validation when setting up a fresh Virtual CPU (VCPU) context, particularly in handling user-mode execution without verifying if valid user-mode page tables are provided.",
      "Specifically, the function fails to ensure that a 64-bit guest provides a valid non-kernel page table before transitioning one of its VCPUs to non-kernel mode.",
	  "The checks are present in the `iret-into-userspace` path, but not when setting a context on a fresh vcpu."
    ],
    "impact": "A privileged guest user can cause the host, and potentially other guests, to experience a hard lockup. This occurs because a VCPU can enter a non-kernel mode without the required user-mode page table, leading to system instability and denial of service. The observed failure mode is usually a hard lockup of the host.",
    "attack_vector": "The attack vector is a malicious or compromised guest virtual machine that exploits the lack of validation in the hypervisor's VCPU context setup.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a privileged user within a 64-bit guest operating system running on the vulnerable Xen hypervisor. This indicates the need for control over a guest OS instance running under the hypervisor to exploit this flaw.",
	"affected_configurations": "The vulnerability affects the 64-bit version of kernel-xen."
