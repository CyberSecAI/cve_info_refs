  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2011-1781",
    "description": "A flaw was discovered in systemtap's handling of DWARF expressions where it did not guard against divide by zero when unwinding the stack. This can result in a kernel div-by-zero message and possible busywait during stap module shutdown. A div-by-zero could cause the kernel to panic and if the kernel reboot on panic flag was set (panic_on_oops), it would cause the system to reboot.",
    "root_cause": "The systemtap's DWARF expression handling did not include a check against division by zero during stack unwinding.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Divide-by-zero error",
      "Lack of input validation"
     ],
    "impact": "A kernel panic or a system reboot can be triggered due to the division by zero.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A user with staprun or stapdev group membership (or root privileges) can trigger the vulnerability by running a crafted stap script on a hand-corrupted ELF program.",
        "If unprivileged mode is enabled by an admin, a normal user (member of the 'stapusr' group) can exploit this flaw. "
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "Requires the ability to run systemtap scripts and access to a maliciously crafted ELF binary.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability is triggered when inspecting a binary with corrupted DWARF information. The vulnerability exists when using stack unwinding (backtracing) features of the systemtap.",
        "This vulnerability affects systemtap versions 1.4 and above."
