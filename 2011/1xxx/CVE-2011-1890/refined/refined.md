Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-1890:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by Microsoft SharePoint not properly validating user input posted to the `EditForm.aspx` web page. This lack of proper input sanitization allows for malicious JavaScript code to be injected into a post.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-site scripting (XSS):**  The primary vulnerability is XSS, where malicious JavaScript can be injected. This vulnerability can lead to information disclosure and elevation of privilege.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Elevation of Privilege:** An attacker can inject JavaScript that, when executed, will allow them to issue SharePoint commands in the security context of the authenticated user. This can lead to an attacker gaining control over the SharePoint site or data.
- **Information Disclosure:** Through the execution of malicious scripts, an attacker may also be able to access data that they would not otherwise have access to.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-based attack:** An attacker hosts a website containing a specially crafted web page designed to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Email/Phishing:** The attacker sends an email containing a link to the malicious website. The user is then convinced to click the link, thereby triggering the exploit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create and host a malicious webpage or send a specially crafted link via email.
- The attacker relies on social engineering to convince the user to visit the malicious site.
- The attacker does not need to be an authenticated user on the targeted SharePoint site. They are exploiting the vulnerability through a victim's browser session on the targeted SharePoint Site.

**Additional Notes:**
- Internet Explorer 8 and 9 have an XSS filter, which provides a layer of defense for users who access SharePoint sites in the Internet Zone but is disabled by default in the Intranet zone.
- The vulnerability does not allow the attacker to directly steal the user's authentication credentials (cookies) due to SharePoint's use of HttpOnly authentication cookies, though the attacker may try to phish credentials using JavaScript.
- This vulnerability exists in Microsoft SharePoint 2010 and Microsoft Foundation 2010.

This analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the CVE-2011-1890 vulnerability, its implications, and how it can be exploited.
