Package: tesseract
Version: 2.04-2

This bug report was also filed in Ubuntu and can be found at
<http://launchpad.net/bugs/607297>
The description, from segooon, follows:

Hi, I've just discovered that tesseract-ocr is vulnerable to rewriting any user file:

DEBUG_WIN::DEBUG_WIN(                    //constructor
....
  length +=
    sprintf (command + length,
    "\"stty opost; tty >/tmp/debug%d; while [ -s /tmp/debug%d ]\ndo\nsleep 1\ndone\" &\n",
    pid, pid);

Here attacker can create link to any file in the system that user may write to. The only he has to know - the pid of process. As it is (last PID + 1) by default, it is not difficult to guess.

Thanks.

Dear maintainer,

I've prepared an NMU for tesseract (versioned as 2.04-2.1) and uploaded
it to DELAYED/5. Please feel free to tell me if I should delay it
longer.

This xterm-based debug window feature looked very awkward to me, is
undocumented and not used by default; so I went ahead and disabled it
entirely.

Upload it immediately, if you wish. Thanks for preparing it.

I didn't even know it existed.

I didn't either until I dug into the source.

Dear maintainer,

Recently you fixed one or more security problems and as a result you closed
this bug. These problems were not serious enough for a Debian Security
Advisory, so they are now on my radar for fixing in the following suites
through point releases:

lenny (5.0.9)
squeeze (6.0.1)

Please arrange to backport your fix and liase with the release team for
permission to upload. I will happily assist you if the patch is
straightforward and you need help or lack time.

For details of this process and the rationale, please see the original
announcement [1] and my blog post [2].

Thanks,

Attached are debdiffs to fix #612032 for the relevant packages in
lenny and squeeze.

Are you happy for these to be uploaded to stable/oldstable?

Would you like separate bugs to be opened for each distribution? At
the moment, the same sid/wheezy bug is quoted/closed.

Regards

Jeff Ratcliffe

Thanks for working on this.

> Are you happy for these to be uploaded to stable/oldstable?

The oldstable diff looks fine, thanks.

The squeeze update will need a couple of small changes:

- Testing and unstable have tesseract 2.04-2.1, so the package for
stable would need to have a lower version than that.  I'd suggest 2.04-2
+squeeze1, which is conventional.

- It would be nice if the reasoning for the quilt build-dep bump was
mentioned.  My suspicion is that this is due to the use of "dh
--with-quilt" triggering a lintian warning but this isn't really
necessary for stable as the relevant quilt version is already included
there (and the warning has thus been dropped by the version of lintian
in experimental).

That's fine (and the right way to do it).

Adam

Sure. This will be my first contribution directly to stable or
oldstable, as I am sure you can tell. I've updated the oldstable
package to also conform.

There was no mention of the convention in the Developers'
Reference[1]. Is this worth a bug report?

I've dropped it, assuming you are correct, and asked Jakub Wilk, who
prepared the original NMU, to confirm.

Sorry, but your answer is ambigious. Would you like the extra two bugs
opened (and closed)?

I would also suggest that the Developers' Reference could be improved
to confirm this, one way or the other.

I'm planning on working on the wording in the DevRef relating to stable
uploads soon anyway, to ensure it matches current practice; I'll bear it
mind.  The reasoning behind using + is to ensure that the newly uploaded
version is higher than any binNMUs which may exist in stable (i.e.
2.04-2squeeze1 < 2.0.4-2+b1).  It also saves us having to check whether
there was ever a 2.03-3 in the archive previously.

Okay, thanks.

For the record, I'd be happy with the squeeze upload either as is or
with the quilt bump + more expansive changelog entry; the main issue
with the original was the lack of explanation.

Sorry, "that" referred to the current situation.  There's no need to
open more than one bug to track a particular issue in a given package;
the BTS is more than capable of tracking which versions of a package
(and by extension which suites) the bug applies to assuming it has
supplied with the correct version information in terms of fixed / found
versions.  #612032 was already corrected tagged for the stable version
(albeit as a side-effect of it being the unstable version at the time
the bug was reported); I've just sent the relevant control@ command to
mark the oldstable version as affected.

> I would also suggest that the Developers' Reference could be improved

I don't think this is an issue specific to stable; it's a general
feature of BTS version tracking so if further documentation is needed it
should be outside of any stable update discussion.

Regards,

Adam

Adam is correct, I bumped b-d to shut up lintian:

$ lintian --ftp-master-rejects tesseract_2.04-2.dsc
E: tesseract source: missing-build-dependency quilt (>= 0.46-7~)

(missing-build-dependency is no longer on ftp-master's list, but it was
there at least until a few days before I uploaded the NMU.)

Sorry for dissatisfactory changelog entry.

I apologise for not revisiting this in any sane length of time. All of
my (little) time has been taken up with gscan2pdf upstream
development.

I will get to this, but cannot promise when.

Please feel free to NMU this if you wish.

Jeff

# vulnerability: rewrite arbitrary user file

### Bug Description

Hi, I've just discovered that tesseract-ocr is vulnerable to rewriting any user file:

DEBUG\_WIN::DEBUG\_WIN( //constructor

...

  length +=

    sprintf (command + length,

    "\"stty opost; tty >/tmp/debug%d; while [ -s /tmp/debug%d ]\ndo\nsleep 1\ndone\" &\n",

    pid, pid);

Here attacker can create link to any file in the system that user may write to. The only he has to know - the pid of process. As it is (last PID + 1) by default, it is not difficult to guess.

Thanks.

Thanks for taking the time to report this bug and helping to make Ubuntu better.

The latest release of Ubuntu is not vulnerable to symlink race attacks, but earlier releases will need fixing. <https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Features#symlink>

Since the package referred to in this bug is in universe or multiverse, it is community maintained. If you are able, I suggest posting a debdiff for this issue. When a debdiff is available, members of the security team will review it and publish the package. See the following link for more information: <https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/UpdateProcedures>

### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

Subject: vulnerability: rewrite arbitrary user file
Date: Fri, 04 Feb 2011 16:52:17 -0800
```
Package: tesseract
Version: 2.04-2
Severity: grave
Tags: security
Justification: user security hole
User: ubuntu-devel@lists.ubuntu.com
Usertags: origin-ubuntu natty

This bug report was also filed in Ubuntu and can be found at
<http://launchpad.net/bugs/607297>
The description, from segooon, follows:

Hi, I've just discovered that tesseract-ocr is vulnerable to rewriting any user file:

DEBUG_WIN::DEBUG_WIN(                    //constructor
....
  length +=
    sprintf (command + length,
    "\"stty opost; tty >/tmp/debug%d; while [ -s /tmp/debug%d ]\ndo\nsleep 1\ndone\" &\n",
    pid, pid);

Here attacker can create link to any file in the system that user may write to. The only he has to know - the pid of process. As it is (last PID + 1) by default, it is not difficult to guess.

Thanks.

Dear maintainer,

I've prepared an NMU for tesseract (versioned as 2.04-2.1) and uploaded
it to DELAYED/5. Please feel free to tell me if I should delay it
longer.

This xterm-based debug window feature looked very awkward to me, is
undocumented and not used by default; so I went ahead and disabled it
entirely.

I didn't either until I dug into the source.

Dear maintainer,

Recently you fixed one or more security problems and as a result you closed
this bug. These problems were not serious enough for a Debian Security
Advisory, so they are now on my radar for fixing in the following suites
through point releases:

lenny (5.0.9)
squeeze (6.0.1)

Please arrange to backport your fix and liase with the release team for
permission to upload. I will happily assist you if the patch is
straightforward and you need help or lack time.

For details of this process and the rationale, please see the original
announcement [1] and my blog post [2].

Thanks,

Attached are debdiffs to fix #612032 for the relevant packages in
lenny and squeeze.

Are you happy for these to be uploaded to stable/oldstable?

Would you like separate bugs to be opened for each distribution? At
the moment, the same sid/wheezy bug is quoted/closed.

Thanks for working on this.

> Are you happy for these to be uploaded to stable/oldstable?

The oldstable diff looks fine, thanks.

The squeeze update will need a couple of small changes:

- Testing and unstable have tesseract 2.04-2.1, so the package for
stable would need to have a lower version than that.  I'd suggest 2.04-2
+squeeze1, which is conventional.

- It would be nice if the reasoning for the quilt build-dep bump was
mentioned.  My suspicion is that this is due to the use of "dh
--with-quilt" triggering a lintian warning but this isn't really
necessary for stable as the relevant quilt version is already included
there (and the warning has thus been dropped by the version of lintian
in experimental).

That's fine (and the right way to do it).

Adam

Sure. This will be my first contribution directly to stable or
oldstable, as I am sure you can tell. I've updated the oldstable
package to also conform.

There was no mention of the convention in the Developers'
Reference[1]. Is this worth a bug report?

I've dropped it, assuming you are correct, and asked Jakub Wilk, who
prepared the original NMU, to confirm.

Sorry, but your answer is ambigious. Would you like the extra two bugs
opened (and closed)?

I would also suggest that the Developers' Reference could be improved
to confirm this, one way or the other.

Thanks.

I'm planning on working on the wording in the DevRef relating to stable
uploads soon anyway, to ensure it matches current practice; I'll bear it
mind.  The reasoning behind using + is to ensure that the newly uploaded
version is higher than any binNMUs which may exist in stable (i.e.
2.04-2squeeze1 < 2.0.4-2+b1).  It also saves us having to check whether
there was ever a 2.03-3 in the archive previously.

Okay, thanks.

For the record, I'd be happy with the squeeze upload either as is or
with the quilt bump + more expansive changelog entry; the main issue
with the original was the lack of explanation.

Sorry, "that" referred to the current situation.  There's no need to
open more than one bug to track a particular issue in a given package;
the BTS is more than capable of tracking which versions of a package
(and by extension which suites) the bug applies to assuming it has
supplied with the correct version information in terms of fixed / found
versions.  #612032 was already corrected tagged for the stable version
(albeit as a side-effect of it being the unstable version at the time
the bug was reported); I've just sent the relevant control@ command to
mark the oldstable version as affected.

I don't think this is an issue specific to stable; it's a general
feature of BTS version tracking so if further documentation is needed it
should be outside of any stable update discussion.

Regards,

Adam

Adam is correct, I bumped b-d to shut up lintian:

$ lintian --ftp-master-rejects tesseract_2.04-2.dsc
E: tesseract source: missing-build-dependency quilt (>= 0.46-7~)

(missing-build-dependency is no longer on ftp-master's list, but it was
there at least until a few days before I uploaded the NMU.)

Sorry for dissatisfactory changelog entry.

I apologise for not revisiting this in any sane length of time. All of
my (little) time has been taken up with gscan2pdf upstream
development.

I will get to this, but cannot promise when.

Please feel free to NMU this if you wish.

Jeff
