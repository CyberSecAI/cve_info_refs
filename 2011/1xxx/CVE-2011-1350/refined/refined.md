The provided code and description relates to both CVE-2011-1350 and CVE-2011-1352, however, this response will only focus on CVE-2011-1350.

**Root Cause:**
- Improper bounds checking when returning data from the kernel to user mode via an ioctl system call.

**Weakness/Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `ioctl` implementation for the `/dev/pvrsrvkm` device, which allows a user-mode process to specify an output buffer size larger than expected and read kernel memory beyond the intended data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The vulnerability allows an attacker to leak arbitrary kernel memory to user mode, potentially disclosing sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by making an `ioctl` call to the `/dev/pvrsrvkm` device with a crafted output buffer size.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to have access to the `/dev/pvrsrvkm` device, which is typically accessible to any user on the Android system.
- The attacker needs to be able to execute code on the device.

**Additional Details:**
- The exploit code provided uses the memory leak vulnerability (CVE-2011-1350) as a step in exploiting CVE-2011-1352 to gain root privileges on the device. The leak is used to find the address of the `dev_attr_ro` symbol in kernel memory, which is later used to overwrite function pointers and gain root.
- The vulnerability is present in Android devices using the PowerVR SGX chipset prior to Android 2.3.6.
