{
  "CVE-2011-1935": {
    "Description": "pcap-linux.c in libpcap 1.1.1 before commit ea9432fabdf4b33cbc76d9437200e028f1c47c93 when snaplen is set may truncate packets, which might allow remote attackers to send arbitrary data while avoiding detection via crafted packets.",
    "Root cause": "Incorrect calculation of the frame size in memory-mapped captures.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "When a specific snaplen is set, the capture may truncate packets leading to data loss."
    ],
    "Impact": "The vulnerability leads to packet truncation, potentially allowing remote attackers to send arbitrary data while avoiding detection.",
    "Attack vectors": "Remote attackers can exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted packets. The vulnerability is triggered by the use of memory mapped captures when a specific snaplen is set.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to send network traffic to a system capturing packets with libpcap with a specific snaplen set."
  }
