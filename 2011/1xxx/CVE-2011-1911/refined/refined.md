The provided content relates to CVE-2011-1911.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The JasperServer application fails to adequately randomize certain parameters, specifically the `_flowExecutionKey`, making it predictable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) due to predictable parameters.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can trick an authenticated user into loading a malicious URL, which can lead to the attacker gaining user credentials or performing actions as that user. This includes potentially adding new users to the JasperServer.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack is carried out by convincing a user who is already authenticated to JasperServer to load a specially crafted URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to create and distribute a crafted URL, and the targeted victim must have an active authenticated session with JasperServer. The attacker also needs to have some ability to predict the `_flowExecutionKey` parameter via brute-force, though the text mentions less than 100 requests are typically needed.
