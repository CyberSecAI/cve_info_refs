Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2011-1667:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the `index.php` file of "Anzeigenmarkt 2011" application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `q` parameter within `index.php`, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL queries. Specifically, the `q` parameter, used within a `list` request, is vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** Attackers can use the SQL injection vulnerability to gain access to sensitive data stored in the database.  The provided proof of concept shows how to extract user credentials (`id`, `pass`, and `email`) from the `markt_user` table, potentially leading to unauthorized access to user accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by crafting a malicious HTTP GET request to `index.php`, including a specifically crafted SQL injection payload within the `q` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely through the web interface of the vulnerable application.
*   **Basic understanding of SQL injection:** The attacker needs to have some understanding of SQL syntax to craft the malicious queries.

**Technical Details:**

*   The provided proof of concept demonstrates the use of a `UNION SELECT` statement to extract user data.
*   The exploit targets the `d=list` and `q` parameters, showing that the application is vulnerable when listing data.
*   The exploit includes `concat(id,0x3a,pass,0x3a,email)` which concatenates the user ID, password and email into a single field, showing that these values can be exfiltrated.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to "Anzeigenmarkt 2011."
*   The exploit-db content provides a proof of concept, which is more detail than the CVE description itself.

In summary, CVE-2011-1667 relates to a SQL injection vulnerability in the Anzeigenmarkt 2011 web application, allowing remote attackers to gain unauthorized access to database information by injecting malicious SQL code via the `q` parameter.
