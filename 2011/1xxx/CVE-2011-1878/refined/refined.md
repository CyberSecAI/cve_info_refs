Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2011-1878:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause of this vulnerability lies in the way Windows kernel-mode drivers manage kernel-mode driver objects. Specifically, there's an issue related to how these drivers handle the allocation and deallocation of these objects, leading to a "use-after-free" condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Use-After-Free:** The core vulnerability is a use-after-free. This occurs when a program attempts to access memory that has already been freed (deallocated). In this case, the vulnerability exists within the Win32k.sys kernel-mode driver.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Elevation of Privilege:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in kernel mode. This is significant because kernel mode is the most privileged mode of operation in Windows.
*   **Full System Control:** An attacker who achieves kernel-level code execution can gain complete control over the affected system.
*   **Malicious Actions:**  With full control, the attacker can:
    *   Install programs.
    *   View, change, or delete data.
    *   Create new accounts with full administrative rights.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access Required:** The primary attack vector requires the attacker to have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to the system.
*   **Specially Crafted Application:** The attacker would need to run a specially crafted application designed to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Valid Logon Credentials:** The attacker must possess valid logon credentials for a local account on the target system.
*   **Local System Access:** The attacker must be able to log on to the target system locally.
*   **Code Execution:**  The attacker needs to be able to execute a malicious program on the targeted machine.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability resides within the `win32k.sys` driver, which handles window management, screen output, and input devices in the Windows kernel.
*   The vulnerability was not publicly disclosed or exploited at the time of the security bulletin's release.
*   Microsoft credits Tarjei Mandt of Norman for reporting this vulnerability.

This detailed information goes beyond the basic CVE description by providing specific technical details about the root cause, impact, and exploitation process of the vulnerability.
