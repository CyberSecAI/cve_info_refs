Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2011-1730

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Insufficient bounds checking on user-supplied data in a fixed-length buffer on the stack. This means that the software doesn't properly validate the size of the input data before copying it to a fixed-size buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability. The vulnerability exists in the Backup Client Service (OmniInet.exe).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution with SYSTEM user privileges. An attacker can execute malicious code on the affected system, taking complete control.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending specially crafted malformed `EXEC_SCRIPT` message packets to the target system. The vulnerable service listens on TCP port 5555.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Remote and unauthenticated attacker. The attacker does not need to log in to the system in any way before sending the malicious packets.
- Network access to the vulnerable machine on TCP port 5555.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `OmniInet.exe` process, which is the Backup Client Service of HP Data Protector.
- HP has released a patch to address this issue.
- Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected by a specific filter ID '11133'.
