How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=700390#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-04-28 09:49:04 UTC  ``` jabberd2, when expat is used, do not properly detect recursion during entity expansion, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (memory and CPU consumption) via a crafted XML document containing a large number of nested entity references, aka the "billion laughs attack."   References: [1] <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billion_laughs> [2] <http://www.webcitation.org/5wwJidGdh>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=700390#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-04-28 09:51:45 UTC  ``` This issue affects the versions of the jabberd package, as present within EPEL-5 and EPEL-6 repositories.

There is a typo in the jabberd2 patch I discovered while backporting it to 2.0s11. The patch has this:  +#if XML_MAJOR_VERSION > 0 +/* XML_StopParser is present in expat 2.x */ +#define HAVE_XML_STOPPARSER +#endif +  So the check and the comment don't go together, and indeed, according to the changelog, 2.0s11 has expat 1.95.7. This should obviously be changed to '#if XML_MAJOR_VERSION > 1'.  Attached is a lightly tested patch with this change along with massaging for 2.0s11. Using the reproducer, I see the patch is working via the c2s log: Tue May 3 21:53:51 2011 [notice] [13] [127.0.0.1, port=52834] connect Tue May 3 21:53:51 2011 [notice] [13] [127.0.0.1, port=52834] error: Stream error (Expected stream start) Tue May 3 21:53:51 2011 [notice] [13] [127.0.0.1, port=52834] disconnect  Prior to the update, c2s would not disconnect and be DoSd.  --  Jamie Strandboge | <http://www.canonical.com>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=700390#c8)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-05-04 08:53:59 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 496733](attachment.cgi?id=496733&action=diff "Corrrected previously added patch.

It's hard to verify, because Expat documentation is non-existant, but assuming the comment that the XML_StopParser() function is present in 2.x release of Expat, I'm going to release the updated patch with:  #if XML_MAJOR_VERSION > 1  --  Tomasz Sterna Instant Messaging Consultant : Open Source Developer <http://tomasz.sterna.tv/> <http://www.xiaoka.com/>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=700390#c10)  Vincent Danen    2011-06-01 16:24:54 UTC  ``` This is now public with the fixed 2.2.14 version:  <http://codex.xiaoka.com/svn/jabberd2/tags/jabberd-2.2.14/ChangeLog>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=700390#c11)  Vincent Danen    2011-06-01 16:26:53 UTC  ``` Created jabberd tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: epel-5 [[bug 709794](show_bug.cgi?id=709794 "CLOSED NEXTRELEASE - CVE-2011-1755 jabberd: DoS via the XML \"billion laughs attack\" [epel-5]")] Affects: epel-6 [[bug 709795](show_bug.cgi?id=709795 "CLOSED NEXTRELEASE - CVE-2011-1755 jabberd: DoS via the XML \"billion laughs attack\" [epel-6]")] Affects: fedora-all [[bug 709796](show_bug.cgi?id=709796 "CLOSED NEXTRELEASE - CVE-2011-1755 jabberd: DoS via the XML \"billion laughs attack\" [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=700390#c12)  Vincent Danen    2011-06-01 16:39:04 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 502318](attachment.cgi?id=502318&action=diff "upstream patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=502318&action=edit "upstream patch") upstream patch  Taken from the upstream svn repository (r937 is the commit to fix the flaw).   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=700390#c13)  Dominic Hopf    2011-06-02 13:20:33 UTC  ``` Thanks very much for reporting this issue and the great preliminary support!

This bug will be closed by Red Hat Security Response Team member once the issue has been addressed in all affected products (there is yet one Red Hat specific unfixed one). Once that one has addressed the issue too, we will close this entry.  Hope this helps.
