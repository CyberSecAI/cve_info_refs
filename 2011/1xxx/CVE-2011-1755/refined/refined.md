Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2011-1755:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper handling of XML external entities within `jabberd2`, specifically when using the expat XML parser. The software fails to detect recursion during entity expansion.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XML External Entity (XXE) processing:** The core issue is that `jabberd2` expands external entities in incoming XML requests without proper safeguards against recursive definitions.
- **Lack of Recursion Detection:** The parser does not detect or limit the depth of nested entity references, leading to a potential for infinite expansion.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  By sending a crafted XML document with a large number of nested entity references (the "billion laughs attack"), an attacker can cause the server to consume excessive memory and CPU resources, effectively denying service to legitimate users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** Attackers can send malicious XML messages to the `jabberd2` server over the network.
- **XML Payload:** The attack relies on a specially crafted XML document that exploits the server's vulnerable entity expansion mechanism.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to send XML messages to the targeted `jabberd2` server.
- **Knowledge of XMPP:**  Understanding the structure of XMPP messages to craft the malicious XML payload would be beneficial.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring prior authentication to the server.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is described as the "billion laughs attack".
- The fix involves disabling internal entity expansion, preventing the recursive processing.
-  Patches were created by Tomasz Sterna and corrected by Jamie Strandboge.
-  The fix was included in the jabberd2 version 2.2.14.
-  The vulnerability affected multiple products, including:
    - EPEL-5 and EPEL-6
    - Fedora releases 13 and 14.
    - Red Hat Network Satellite Server versions 5.0.2, 5.1.1, 5.2.1, 5.3.0, and 5.4.0
    - Red Hat Network Proxy Server versions 5.0.2, 5.1.1, 5.2.1, 5.3.0, and 5.4.0.
