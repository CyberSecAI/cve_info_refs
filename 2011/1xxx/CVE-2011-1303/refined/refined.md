- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Stale pointer in floating object handling.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use of a stale pointer.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Could lead to a crash or arbitrary code execution
- **Attack vectors:** By manipulating floating objects, an attacker may trigger the use of a stale pointer.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to manipulate floating objects in the context of the vulnerable browser.
