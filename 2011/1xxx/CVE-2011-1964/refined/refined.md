      "content": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Internet Explorer accesses an object that has not been correctly initialized or has been deleted. The vulnerability may corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the logged-on user.\n\n#### Mitigating Factors for Style Object Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2011-1964\n\nMitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:\n\n*   In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted Web site that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the Web site. An attacker could also embed an ActiveX control marked \"safe for initialization\" in an application or Microsoft Office document that hosts the IE rendering engine. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These Web sites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by clicking a link in an e-mail message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site, or by opening an attachment sent through e-mail.\n*   An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.\n*   By default, all supported versions of Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Outlook Express, and Windows Mail open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone, which disables script and ActiveX controls, helps reduce the risk of an attacker being able to use this vulnerability to execute malicious code. If a user clicks a link in an e-mail message, the user could still be vulnerable to exploitation of this vulnerability through the Web-based attack scenario.\n*   By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd883248%28ws.10%29.aspx). This mode mitigates this vulnerability. See the FAQ section for this vulnerability for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.\n\n#### Workarounds for Style Object Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2011-1964\n\nWorkaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:\n\n*   **Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to \"High\" to block ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting in these zones**\n\n    You can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to block ActiveX controls and Active Scripting. You can do this by setting your browser security to High.\n\n    To raise the browsing security level in Internet Explorer, perform the following steps:\n\n    1.  On the Internet Explorer **Tools** menu, click **Internet Options**.\n    2.  In the **Internet Options** dialog box, click the **Security** tab, and then click the **Internet** icon.\n    3.  Under **Security level for this zone**, move the slider to **High**. This sets the security level for all Web sites you visit to High.\n\n    **Note** If no slider is visible, click **Default Level**, and then move the slider to **High**.\n\n    **Note** Setting the level to High may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the security setting set to High.\n\n    **Impact of workaround.** There are side effects to blocking ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX or Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX Controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Blocking ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. If you do not want to block ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting for such sites, use the steps outlined in \"Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone\".\n\n    **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**\n\n    After you set Internet Explorer to block ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect yourself from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.\n\n    To do this, perform the following steps:\n\n    1.  In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.\n    2.  In the **Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.\n    3.  If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.\n    4.  In the **Add this Web site to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.\n    5.  Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.\n    6.  Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.\n\n    **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are **\\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com** and **\\*.update.microsoft.com**. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.\n*   **Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone**\n\n    You can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone. To do this, perform the following steps:\n\n    1.  In Internet Explorer, click **Internet Options** on the **Tools** menu.\n    2.  Click the **Security** tab.\n    3.  Click **Internet**, and then click **Custom Level**.\n    4.  Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.\n    5.  Click **Local intranet**, and then click **Custom Level**.\n    6.  Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.\n    7.  Click **OK** two times to return to Internet Explorer.\n\n    **Note** Disabling Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zones may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly.\n\n    **Impact of workaround.** There are side effects to prompting before running Active Scripting. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use Active Scripting to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click **Yes** to run Active Scripting. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in \"Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone\".\n\n    **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**\n\n    After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.\n\n    To do this, perform the following steps:\n\n    1.  In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.\n    2.  In the **Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.\n    3.  If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.\n    4.  In the **Add this Web site to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.\n    5.  Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.\n    6.  Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.\n\n    **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are **\\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com** and **\\*.update.microsoft.com**. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.\n\n#### FAQ for Style Object Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2011-1964\n\n**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**\n\nThis is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.\n\n**What causes the vulnerability?**\n\nWhen Internet Explorer attempts to access an object that has not been initialized or has been deleted, it may corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the logged-on user.\n\n**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**\n\nAn attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as a logged-on user. If the user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.\n\n**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**\n\nAn attacker could host a specially crafted Web site that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the Web site. An attacker could also embed an ActiveX control marked \"safe for initialization\" in an application or Microsoft Office document that hosts the IE rendering engine. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These Web sites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by clicking a link in an e-mail message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site, or by opening an attachment sent through e-mail.\n\n**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**\n\nSystems where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability.\n\n**I am running Internet Explorer for Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, or Windows Server 2008 R2. Does this mitigate this vulnerability?**\n\nYes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd883248%28ws.10%29.aspx). Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured settings in Internet Explorer that can reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running specially crafted Web content on a server. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone.\n\n**What does the update do?**\n\nThe update addresses the vulnerability by modifying the way that Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.\n\n**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**\n\nNo. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.\n\n**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**\n\nNo. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.",
