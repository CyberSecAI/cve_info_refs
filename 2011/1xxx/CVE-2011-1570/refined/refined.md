Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2011-1570:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue present in the message boards of Liferay Portal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- XSS vulnerability: This indicates a lack of proper input sanitization or output encoding in the message board functionality. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of the XSS vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities, such as:
    - Session hijacking: stealing user's session cookies.
    - Defacement of the website.
    - Phishing: redirecting users to a malicious website.
    - Information theft: accessing sensitive data from the user's session or the website.
    - Malware distribution: redirecting the user to sites that serve malware.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves injecting malicious JavaScript code into message boards. This injected code will be executed when other users view the affected message boards.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to post to message boards. This might require an authenticated user account or if public posting is allowed, no authentication is needed.
- The attacker does not need to be in a privileged position initially. They need the ability to post to the message board and leverage user interaction to deliver the payload.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided context suggests that this vulnerability is one of five security issues corrected in Liferay version 6.0.6.
