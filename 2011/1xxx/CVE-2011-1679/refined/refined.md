Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-1679:

**CVE-2011-1679:**

*   **Root Cause:** The `addmntent()` function in glibc does not report an error when it fails to write completely to `/etc/mtab` due to a low `RLIMIT_FSIZE` setting. This allows a local user to truncate or corrupt `/etc/mtab` by setting a low `RLIMIT_FSIZE` and then invoking a suid mount helper.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Incomplete Error Reporting:** The `addmntent()` function fails to signal a write error when the file size limit (`RLIMIT_FSIZE`) is reached, leading to partial writes without an error.
    *   **Setuid Mount Helpers Vulnerability:** Setuid mount helpers often use `addmntent()` to modify the `/etc/mtab` file. These helpers do not properly check the return codes, or handle errors, resulting in a vulnerability when an attacker sets a small file size limit.
    *   **Direct /etc/mtab manipulation:** Some mount helpers directly edit `/etc/mtab` without using temporary files, compounding the issue.
    *   **Lack of Cleanup:** Some mount helpers do not remove temporary files or lock files after failed operations leading to additional corruption.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Arbitrary /etc/mtab Corruption:** By repeatedly invoking a vulnerable setuid mount helper with a small `RLIMIT_FSIZE`, an attacker can append almost any data to `/etc/mtab` due to the truncation of writes and lack of newline termination.
    *   **Potential for Unauthorized Unmounting:** While not straightforward, the corruption of `/etc/mtab` could potentially lead to the ability to unmount file systems or manipulate mount options.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Local attacker (unprivileged user).
    *   The attacker needs to be able to execute a setuid mount helper that uses `addmntent()` (or calls other programs that do) to modify `/etc/mtab`.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to control `RLIMIT_FSIZE`.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to have local access to a system.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to execute suid mount helpers.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to set a resource limit on file sizes (`RLIMIT_FSIZE`).

**Specific Vulnerable Programs (mentioned):**

*   `ncpmount` (ncpfs)
*   `ncpumount` (ncpfs)
*   `mount.cifs` (samba)
*   `umount.cifs` (samba)
*   `mount` (util-linux)
*   `vmware-hgfsmounter` (open-vm-tools)

**More Details than CVE Description:**

The provided content contains much more detail than a typical CVE description, including:

*   The specific root cause: the failure of `addmntent()` to report write errors.
*   The exact mechanism of exploitation by manipulating `RLIMIT_FSIZE`
*   The details on specific programs vulnerable and how they handle `/etc/mtab` modifications (direct editing, temporary files, error handling).
*   Discussion of glibc patching vs. patching all the mount helpers
*   The proposed fix for glibc is to return an error when there's a partial write due to `RLIMIT_FSIZE`
*   A plan to have all mount helpers edit `/etc/mtab` via a temp file with proper cleanup.
*   Discussion about replacing `/etc/mtab` with symlink to `/proc/mounts`.
*   CVE assignment to other related vulnerabilities from same root cause.
