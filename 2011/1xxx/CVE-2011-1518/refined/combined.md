How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

## Success Stories

[SIEVERS-GROUP](https://otrs.com/success-stories/sievers-group/)

[Success Story](https://otrs.com/success-stories/sievers-group/)

The challenge

Continuous improvement is the credo of the SIEVERS-GROUP: support should be more efficient and of a higher quality for customers. It also strives to optimize the services and products provided. In order to be able to control these factors in a targeted manner, the relevant KPIs (key performance indicators) first had to be made visible and measurable.

1.200 tickets per month

90 agents

The solution

This has now been achieved. “With the help of OTRS, we were able to model and implement standardized processes for ticket processing throughout the company,” reports Henrik Kindt. This results in two key advantages: First, thanks to OTRS, it is possible to communicate with customers much more transparently and efficiently. Secondly, by measuring relevant KPIs, the SIEVERS-GROUP is able to monitor its service quality in a targeted manner and improve it immediately if necessary.

Solution[IT Service Management](https://otrs.com/otrs-software-solutions/it-service-management/)

[DLRG](https://otrs.com/success-stories/dlrg/)

With OTRS as our central helpdesk solution, we can respond quickly to inquiries and offer our volunteers a first-class service.

[Success Story](https://otrs.com/success-stories/dlrg/)

The challenge

The DLRG teams are spread across Germany. They need fast IT service and use a variety of hardware.

2,000 tickets per month

126 agents

The solution

With OTRS as a central software solution, those responsible can improve IT service delivery through excellent organization and quick request processing.

Solution[IT Service Management](https://otrs.com/otrs-software-solutions/it-service-management/)

[H. Gautzsch Group](https://otrs.com/success-stories/h-gautzsch-group/)

The customization options were important in our decision for OTRS. The price-performance ratio then tipped the scales.

[Success Story](https://otrs.com/success-stories/h-gautzsch-group/)

The Challenge

Sales teams did not have a sufficient overview of customer inquiries and processes, sometimes duplicating work.

7000 tickets per month

30 agents

The Solution

OTRS provides an organized overview of all processes and their processing status, and it has noticeably increased efficiency.

Solution[Customer Service & Support](https://otrs.com/otrs-software-solutions/customer-service-support/)[IT Service Management](https://otrs.com/otrs-software-solutions/it-service-management/)

[ALPHA COM](https://otrs.com/success-stories/alpha-com/)

Optimally structured communication and efficient support for greater customer and employee satisfaction at ALPHA COM Deutschland GmbH with OTRS

[Success Story](https://otrs.com/success-stories/alpha-com/)

The Challenge

The ITSM solution used until 2017 was technologically insufficient as a support solution. It lacked transparency, led to communication outside the tool, and employees who were dissatisfied with the interface.

2,000 tickets per month

50 agents

The Solution

High transparency in inquiry handling, efficient escalation processes and structured communication – the use of OTRS leads to increased service quality and satisfied employees and customers.

Solution[IT Service Management](https://otrs.com/otrs-software-solutions/it-service-management/)

[MET Group](https://otrs.com/success-stories/met-group/)

Switching from ((OTRS)) Community Edition to the OTRS enterprise help desk solution improves CSAT and enables proactivity at a great value

[Success Story](https://otrs.com/success-stories/met-group/)

The Challenge

The company was growing. It was time to evolve – from an open source ticketing system to an enterprise help desk solution – in order to better meet the growing needs of customers, management and IT.

1,000+ tickets per month

12 agents

The Solution

The customizable OTRS help desk solution was selected and support was added.
