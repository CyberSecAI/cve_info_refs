Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-1060:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper sanitization of the "wsnuser" cookie parameter within the `index.php` script of WSN Guest. This allows for the injection of arbitrary SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw where user-controlled input (from the "wsnuser" cookie) is directly incorporated into a SQL query without proper escaping or sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database server. This could lead to:
  - Data breaches: Accessing and exfiltrating sensitive information from the database.
  - Data manipulation: Modifying or deleting data within the database.
  - Denial of service: Potentially crashing the database server.
  - Privilege escalation: Potentially gaining unauthorized administrative access to the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through an HTTP request with a specially crafted "wsnuser" cookie.
-  The attacker sends a GET request to `index.php`, including the malicious SQL query inside the `wsnuser` cookie.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable WSN Guest application. No special privileges are required. The attacker just needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target server.
- The attacker needs to understand basic SQL syntax to craft the injection query.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered on 2011-02-01.
- The vulnerability is considered medium risk.
- The vulnerability is present in WSN Guest version 1.24.
- The vendor has been notified but has not replied, and no patch is available.
