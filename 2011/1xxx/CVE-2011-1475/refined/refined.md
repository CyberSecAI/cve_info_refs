{
  "CVE-2011-1475": {
    "Description": "Changes introduced to the HTTP BIO connector to support Servlet 3.0 asynchronous requests did not fully account for HTTP pipelining. As a result, when using HTTP pipelining a range of unexpected behaviours occurred including the mixing up of responses between requests. While the mix-up in responses was only observed between requests from the same user, a mix-up of responses for requests from different users may also be possible.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The HTTP BIO connector in Apache Tomcat did not fully account for HTTP pipelining when handling asynchronous requests introduced in Servlet 3.0. This led to incorrect association of responses with requests due to improper handling of shared resources or buffers.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Improper handling of HTTP pipelining",
      "Incorrect association of responses with requests",
      "Potential for response mixing between users"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could cause the server to serve incorrect responses for requests, potentially leading to information disclosure. This could range from serving a JavaScript file instead of HTML, to serving wrong images, or other resource swaps. In the worst case, responses from other users might be mixed.",
    "Attack vectors": "The primary attack vector is through HTTP pipelining, where multiple requests are sent over the same connection without waiting for a response.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send pipelined HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No special user privileges are required."
