I'm reluctant to assign a CVE name for this one. The default perms for
this is S_IWUSR|S_IRUSR. I will let Steve decide for this one.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=591815#c0)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2010-05-13 08:48:57 UTC  ``` This bug is to collect statements for Linux kernel-related CVE's that do not have their own top-level CVE SRT bug because it did not affect any of our supported kernels. These statements were also referred to as NVD statements and are noted on the NVD web site.  (From [bug 589808](show_bug.cgi?id=589808 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE legacy statements")) Do not change the bug alias, it needs to have "CVE" in the title.  You can add extra statements in new comments or editing existing comments and they will be picked up correctly.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=591815#c1)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2010-05-13 08:57:59 UTC  ``` Statement CVE-2010-0747:  Not vulnerable. This issue did not affect the versions of the Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, 5 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG as they did not backport an out-of-tree drbd module (drbd8).  Statement CVE-2010-1446:  Not vulnerable. This issue did not affect the versions of the Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, 5 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG as they did not include support for KGDB, a debugger for the Linux kernel.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=591815#c2)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2010-05-19 16:23:30 UTC  ``` Statement CVE-2010-1451:  Not vulnerable.
