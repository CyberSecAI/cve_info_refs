{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "When a J2EE 1.4 application EAR file contains both `ibm-application-bnd.xml` and `ibm-application-bnd.xmi` files, the security role mapping defined in the `.xmi` file is ignored, and the security role mapping defined in the `.xml` file is used instead. This leads to incorrect security role assignments.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Incorrect security role mapping, leading to potential unauthorized access.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Users may be prompted for secured pages even if they should have the appropriate role, or conversely, users might gain access to secured pages without the required roles.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by the presence of both `ibm-application-bnd.xml` and `ibm-application-bnd.xmi` files within a J2EE 1.4 application EAR file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would need to deploy or modify a J2EE 1.4 application that contains both `ibm-application-bnd.xml` and `ibm-application-bnd.xmi` files. No specific network position is mentioned, but the attacker needs to have the ability to deploy the application on the server."
