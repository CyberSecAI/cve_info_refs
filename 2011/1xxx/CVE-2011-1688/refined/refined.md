Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-1688:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a directory traversal flaw present in Request Tracker (RT) versions 3.2.0 and above.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Directory traversal vulnerability. This vulnerability allows an attacker to access files outside of the intended directory scope.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated attacker can read any file that is accessible to the webserver. This could include sensitive system files, configuration files, or other data not intended to be exposed.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack is carried out through a web interface, using directory traversal techniques to access files.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the webserver running the vulnerable RT instance. No authentication is required.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is particularly exploitable on servers that do not have safeguards against directory traversal, such as the standalone server provided with RT, plackup, starman, twiggy, and lighttpd.
- Web servers like Apache and nginx have built-in protections that mitigate the directory traversal attack by restricting file access outside of the document root.
