  "vulnerability": {
    "cveID": "CVE-2011-1093",
    "description": "A flaw in the dccp_rcv_state_process() function could allow a remote attacker to cause a denial of service, even when the socket was already closed.",
    "affected_packages": [
      "kernel"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The dccp_rcv_state_process() function did not prevent operations on an already torn-down socket, leading to a NULL pointer dereference when a Reset packet is received after the socket is closed.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of socket state after closure",
      "NULL pointer dereference vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service.",
    "attack_vector": "A remote attacker sends a DCCP Reset packet to a closed socket.",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send DCCP packets to the target system."
