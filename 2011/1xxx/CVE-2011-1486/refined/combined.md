# USN-1152-1: libvirt vulnerabilities

16 June 2011

Libvirt could be made to crash or read arbitrary files on the host.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 11.04](/security/notices?release=natty)
* [Ubuntu 10.10](/security/notices?release=maverick)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [libvirt](/security/cves?package=libvirt) - Libvirt virtualization toolkit

## Details

It was discovered that libvirt did not use thread-safe error reporting. A

remote attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service via

application crash. ([CVE-2011-1486](/security/CVE-2011-1486))

Eric Blake discovered that libvirt had an off-by-one error which could

be used to reopen disk probing and bypass the fix for [CVE-2010-2238](/security/CVE-2010-2238). A

privileged attacker in the guest could exploit this to read arbitrary files

on the host. This issue only affected Ubuntu 11.04. By default, guests are

confined by an AppArmor profile which provided partial protection against

this flaw. ([CVE-2011-2178](/security/CVE-2011-2178))

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Synopsis

Moderate: libvirt security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2011%3A0478)

## Topic

Updated libvirt packages that fix one security issue are now available for
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

## Description

The libvirt library is a C API for managing and interacting with the
virtualization capabilities of Linux and other operating systems. In
addition, libvirt provides tools for remotely managing virtualized systems.

A flaw was found in the way libvirtd handled error reporting for concurrent
connections. A remote attacker able to establish read-only connections to
libvirtd on a server could use this flaw to crash libvirtd. (CVE-2011-1486)

All libvirt users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to resolve this issue. After installing the
updated packages, libvirtd must be restarted ("service libvirtd restart")
for this update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/kb/docs/DOC-11259>

libvirt security update (RHSA-2011-0478)

Original Release Date: May 3, 2011

Last Revised: July 21, 2015

Number: ASA-2011-139

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 2.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

The libvirt library is a C API for managing and interacting with the
virtualization capabilities of Linux and other operating systems. In
addition, libvirt provides tools for remotely managing virtualized
systems.

A flaw was found in the way libvirtd handled error reporting for
concurrent
connections. A remote attacker able to establish read-only connections
to
libvirtd on a server could use this flaw to crash libvirtd. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the
name [CVE-2011-1486](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-1486.html) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the
security advisory issued by Red Hat:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0478.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products using a modified version of RHEL5 with affected components/packages installed: | Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | Avaya Aura® System Platform | 1.1.x, 6.0.x thru 6.3.3 | Low | Upgrade to 6.3.4 or later |

**Recommended Actions for System Products:**
Avaya strongly
recommends that customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place, risk to Avaya
products and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as an Avaya provided
product update or the recommended Avaya action is applied.
Further restrictions as deemed necessary based on the
customer's security policies may be required during this
interim period, but customers should not modify the System Product
operating system or application unless the change is approved by Avaya.
Making changes that are not approved may void the Avaya product service
contract.

### Mitigating Factors:

When determining risk, Avaya takes into account many factors as
outlined by Avaya's
[Security Vulnerability Classification Policy](https://support.avaya.com/css/P8/documents/100066674).
The following table describes factors that mitigate the risk of specific
vulnerabilities for affected Avaya products:

| Vulnerability | Mitigating Factors |
| --- | --- |
| CVE-2011-1486 | This is rated Low risk because libvirtd on System Platform does not open any externally accessible ports, and so is not vulnerable to a remote attacker. |

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating
systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying
operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities
often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity
of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not
affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be.
Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and
then follow
that vendor's guidance.

| Product: | Actions: |
| --- | --- |
| Avaya Aura® Application Enablement Services 4.x/5.x | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the AES application. |
| CVLAN | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite (IMS) | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. |
| Avaya Aura® Presence Services | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the PS application. |
| Avaya Aura® System Manager 1.0 | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the SMGR application. |
| Voice Portal | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the Voice Portal application. |

**Recommended Actions for Software-Only Products:**
In the
event that the affected package is installed, Avaya recommends that
customers follow recommended actions supplied by Red Hat regarding their
Enterprise Linux.
