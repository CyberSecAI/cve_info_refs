    "root_cause": "A memory corruption vulnerability exists due to improper handling of objects within Internet Explorer. Specifically, the vulnerability occurs when Internet Explorer attempts to access a 'selection object' that has not been correctly initialized or has been deleted.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Memory corruption due to improper object handling",
      "Use-after-free vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the logged-on user. This could lead to complete system compromise if the user has administrative privileges, allowing the attacker to install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Web-based attack: An attacker could host a specially crafted web page designed to trigger the vulnerability.",
      "Compromised websites: Attackers can inject malicious content into compromised or user-provided content websites.",
        "ActiveX controls: An attacker can embed an ActiveX control marked 'safe for initialization' into applications or Office documents that host the IE rendering engine"
