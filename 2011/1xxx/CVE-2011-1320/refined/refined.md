  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The code removes entries in AuthCache by user ID and realm name if getRemoteUser method returns a valid user ID. However, if a cache entry of which cache key is user ID had been evicted, but other cache entries which are using different cache key (like LTPA token cookie) still exist, the code doesn't delete these cache entries.",

      "Incomplete cache invalidation",
       "User credentials remain in the cache after logout"
    ],
    "impact": "User credentials remain in the cache after logout, which could potentially be exploited by an attacker to gain unauthorized access.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker could potentially exploit the presence of user credentials in the cache after logout to gain unauthorized access. The specific attack vector is not described in the provided text.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker would likely need to have knowledge or access to the system where the cache is stored after the user logs out."
