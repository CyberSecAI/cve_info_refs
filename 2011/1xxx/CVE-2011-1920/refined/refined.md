Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2011-1920

**Root Cause:**
- The `bsd.lib.mk` and `bsd.prog.mk` make include files in NetBSD (and used in pmake) create temporary files with predictable names in `/tmp` (specifically `/tmp/_depend<PID>`). This was done when generating dependencies for build targets. The temporary files were created without using `mktemp` or respecting the `$TMPDIR` environment variable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Insecure Temporary File Creation:** The use of a predictable file name in `/tmp` makes the system vulnerable to symlink attacks.
- **Lack of `mktemp` Usage:** The scripts do not utilize `mktemp` for secure temporary file creation, which would prevent the predictability of the file path.
- **Ignoring `$TMPDIR`:** The scripts do not check or use the `$TMPDIR` environment variable, forcing temporary file creation into `/tmp`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** A local attacker can create a symbolic link to an arbitrary file at the predictable temporary file path before the `make` process does. The `make` process then writes to this path, resulting in overwriting the linked file with the content of the generated dependency file.
- **Modification of .depend File:** An attacker can symlink the temporary file to the `.depend` file in the victim's home directory, allowing modification of dependency information, potentially impacting builds.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited by a local user.
- **Symlink Attack:** The attacker must create a symlink at the predictable path of the temporary file before the vulnerable `make` process creates the temporary file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a local user with the ability to create symlinks in `/tmp` before the vulnerable `make` process creates the temporary file.
- The attacker needs to have the ability to execute `make` on a project that includes the vulnerable `bsd.lib.mk` or `bsd.prog.mk` files.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was present in NetBSD before version 1.6.2, and in pmake 1.111.
- The issue was fixed upstream by removing the insecure temporary file handling code and, in the fix applied to Debian and Red Hat, by using `mktemp` to generate secure temporary file names.
- The affected files in the `mk-files` package are `/usr/share/mk/bsd.lib.mk` and `/usr/share/mk/bsd.prog.mk`.
- Red Hat classified this as a low-severity issue and did not fix it in RHEL 4.
- The fix involves using `mktemp -t _dependXXXXXXXXXX` to create temporary files with unique names.
