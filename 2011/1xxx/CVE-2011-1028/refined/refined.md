{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The $smarty.template variable in Smarty3 is not properly sanitized before being used in the compiled PHP file, allowing for the inclusion of arbitrary PHP code.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper input sanitization, arbitrary code execution",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary PHP code execution, potentially leading to complete compromise of the server.",
  "Attack vectors": "By crafting a template file name with embedded PHP code and then using the $smarty.template variable, a remote attacker can include and execute that arbitrary code.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Ability to influence the template file names, and potentially modify template content, that is used by Smarty."
