### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

| [Description](#c0)  Tim Sammut (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2011-02-26 20:03:11 UTC  ``` From $URL:  Anyway, i found a problem with $smarty.template variable, and how it's inserted into compiled php file. If i have a template source file named '.(include 'hack.php').'.tpl containing just {$smarty.template} string, it gets compiled into following: Code: <?php echo ''.(include 'hack.php').'.tpl';?>  Which would effectively include hack.php file.  Vulnerable code is found in sysplugins/smarty_internal_compile_private_special_variable.php file (line 60), and looks like there's several potential issues as well. I guess solution would be to simply call addslashes for inserted variable.   @tomk and @php, 3.0.7 is reportedly fixed and is already in the tree. Is it an appropriate target for stabilization? Thanks! ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Tim Sammut (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2011-03-02 06:46:49 UTC  ``` Adding CVE assignment per <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/02/28/8>. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Tom Knight (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2011-03-02 09:38:31 UTC  ``` I'd like to do a bit more testing with this, especially to see if the 2.6 branch is vulnerable or not. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Ole Markus With (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2011-03-02 10:39:49 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=356615#c2)) > I'd like to do a bit more testing with this, especially to see if the 2.6 > branch is vulnerable or not. >   This is my concern too. Especially since e.g phpdocumentor has a dependency on <smarty-3. ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Tom Knight (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2011-03-02 11:53:24 UTC  ``` 2.6.24 and 2.6.26 are vulnerable, I'll get a patch together to fix them (at least 2.2.26) and submit upstream. If they're not interested in supporting 2.6 any more we can use the patch locally while there are still packages that depend on 2.6. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Tim Sammut (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2011-06-12 20:46:57 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=356615#c4)) > 2.6.24 and 2.6.26 are vulnerable, I'll get a patch together to fix them (at > least 2.2.26) and submit upstream.

Thanks! ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Chris Reffett (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev Security  2013-09-03 19:51:56 UTC  ``` Fix has been in upstream SVN since Feb 2011. Is 2.6.27 affected? If no, are we good to stable? ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Thomas Deutschmann (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2013-09-03 21:07:26 UTC  ``` (In reply to Chris Reffett from [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=356615#c6)) > Fix has been in upstream SVN since Feb 2011.

I took some time and verified: 2.6.27 (latest 2.6.x version) *is* affected! ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Thomas Deutschmann (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2013-09-30 19:52:00 UTC  ``` Hi,  I contacted Uwe Tews (Smarty author). He confirmed the vulnerability in Smarty v2.x, but the impact should be limited to developers only.  The fix is already in SVN (see r4779; thank you Uwe for the fast response!): <https://code.google.com/p/smarty-php/source/detail?r=4779>  Upstream says a new 2.x release containing this fix will be released within the next few days. ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Thomas Deutschmann (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2013-10-02 19:42:57 UTC  ``` Smarty v2.6.28 is now available: <http://www.smarty.net/files/Smarty-2.6.28.tar.gz> ```  [Comment 10](#c10)  Yury German   Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev  2013-10-08 04:41:28 UTC  ``` (In reply to Thomas D. from [comment #9](show_bug.cgi?id=356615#c9)) > Smarty v2.6.28 is now available: > <http://www.smarty.net/files/Smarty-2.6.28.tar.gz>  Can an ebuild be created for 2.6.28 for stabilization? ```  [Comment 11](#c11)  Thomas Deutschmann (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2013-10-21 12:14:12 UTC  ``` Is there anything we can help with? This bug takes very long now...  You just have to create a copy of the previous ebuild for the new version. ```  [Comment 12](#c12)  Ole Markus With (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2013-10-21 19:24:44 UTC  ``` (In reply to Thomas D. from [comment #11](show_bug.cgi?id=356615#c11)) > Is there anything we can help with?
