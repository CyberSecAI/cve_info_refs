```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The authentication protocol allows a remote attacker to specify the length of a password hash. By specifying a minimum length, the attacker can force the process to validate only the first several bytes of the password hash.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper validation of password hash length, leading to authentication bypass.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of IBM solidDB, bypassing authentication.",
  "Attack vectors": "Network-based attacks targeting the solid.exe process, which listens on TCP ports 1315, 1964, and 2315 by default.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable ports of the solidDB server, no authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability"
