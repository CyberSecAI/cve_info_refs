Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-1251:

**CVE Description:**

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Internet Explorer accesses an object that has not been correctly initialized or has been deleted. The vulnerability may corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the logged-on user.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from improper handling of objects in memory within Internet Explorer. Specifically, it occurs when the browser attempts to access an object that has not been correctly initialized or has already been deleted. This leads to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- Memory corruption vulnerability due to improper object handling.
- Use-after-free or double-free vulnerability.
- Potential for arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine with the privileges of the logged-on user.
-   **Full System Control:** If the user has administrative rights, the attacker can gain complete control over the affected system. This includes installing programs, viewing, modifying, or deleting data, and creating new user accounts.
-  **Compromised System:** An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Web-Based Attack:** Attackers can host a malicious webpage designed to trigger the vulnerability and lure users into visiting it using social engineering or compromised websites.
-   **ActiveX Control:** The exploit could potentially be triggered by embedding a malicious ActiveX control marked as "safe for initialization" within applications or documents that use the Internet Explorer rendering engine.
-   **Compromised Web Sites:** Attackers can inject the exploit into compromised websites and advertisements which are served through ad networks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   Ability to host or inject malicious content into a website or other medium capable of rendering the malformed content.
-   Social engineering to convince users to visit a malicious website or open a malicious document
-   No special privileges are required on the target system.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Internet Explorer 8. Internet Explorer 6, 7, and 9 are listed as not affected by this specific vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is classified as "Critical" for client systems and "Moderate" for server systems, based on a typical setup.
- This bulletin also includes a fix for CVE-2011-1346 which addresses a memory address leak.
- The provided document states that "Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure" and that "Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued."

This detailed breakdown provides a clear picture of the nature and potential consequences of the CVE-2011-1251 vulnerability.
