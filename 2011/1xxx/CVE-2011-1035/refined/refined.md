Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-1035:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the way PivotX (versions 2.2.3 and earlier) handles password resets. It allows an attacker to change the password of any account simply by knowing or guessing the username.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Password Reset:** The primary vulnerability is an insecure password reset mechanism. The system does not adequately verify the identity of the user requesting the password change, leading to unauthorized password resets.
*  **Lack of username validation/enumeration protection**: The system allows an attacker to submit password reset requests for any username.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Account Takeover:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to take control of any user account, including administrator accounts.
*   **Full System Control:** Gaining administrative access to the CMS allows the attacker to perform actions, such as uploading malicious files to the server, leading to a full system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based Attack:** The attack is carried out through a specially crafted URL that exploits the insecure password reset process, making it a network-based attack.
*  **Targeted at application**: The attacker needs to target the specific application and version (PivotX 2.2.3 and earlier)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable PivotX instance.
*   **Usernames:** The attacker needs to know or guess the usernames for the accounts they wish to compromise.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was being exploited in the wild.
*   PivotX version 2.2.4 was reported to not be affected. Version 2.2.5 was released to patch this vulnerability.
*   Mitigation steps for users that have been compromised were posted in the PivotX Support Community.
