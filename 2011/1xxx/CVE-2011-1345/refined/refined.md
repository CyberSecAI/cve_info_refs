Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2011-1345:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory, specifically when accessing objects that have not been correctly initialized or have already been deleted. This improper object management leads to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Corruption:** The core vulnerability is memory corruption due to incorrect object handling during certain processes in Internet Explorer. This allows an attacker to overwrite memory and potentially gain control of execution flow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution. An attacker can execute arbitrary code within the context of the logged-on user.
- **Full System Control:** If the user has administrative privileges, a successful exploit could give the attacker complete control over the affected system.
- **Malicious Actions:** An attacker could install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-based attacks:**
   - An attacker could host a specially crafted web page that triggers the vulnerability when viewed in Internet Explorer.
   - Compromised websites or websites hosting user-provided content (e.g. ads) can also be used to serve malicious content.
- **Email/Office Documents:**
   - Malicious content could be embedded within an ActiveX control in an application or an office document (e.g. Microsoft Office Document) that hosts the IE rendering engine.
   - A user could be convinced to open an attachment sent through email.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote:** The attacker can be remote from the target system.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to convince a user to visit a malicious website or open a malicious file.
- **Crafted Web Content:** The attacker needs to create a specially crafted web page that exploits the memory corruption vulnerability.

**Mitigating Factors (as mentioned in the content):**
-  Users with fewer user rights will be less impacted than administrative users.
-  By default, email messages are opened in a restricted zone reducing the risk of execution by malicious scripts and ActiveX controls from email.
- Enhanced Security Configuration in Windows Server environments mitigates the web-based attack vector for sites not in the Trusted Sites zone.
- Internet Explorer 9 is not affected.

**Workarounds (as mentioned in the content):**
- Reading emails in plain text.
- Setting Internet and Local intranet security zones to "High" to block ActiveX controls and Active Scripting.
- Configuring Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or disabling it entirely.

**Additional Notes:**

-   The vulnerability is addressed in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS11-018.
-   Microsoft is aware of limited targeted attacks attempting to exploit the vulnerability.
-   The update fixes the vulnerability by changing how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.
