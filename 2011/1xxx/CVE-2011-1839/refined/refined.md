Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-1839:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The session ID was being transmitted via the HTTP GET method.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  Exposure of sensitive information: Session IDs, which are used to maintain user sessions, were being included in the URL.
-  Use of HTTP GET method for sensitive information: The HTTP GET method includes parameters in the URL which can be logged by servers, stored in browser history, and more easily exposed than parameters sent with the POST method.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Session hijacking/theft: An attacker could potentially steal the session ID.
- Unauthorized access: With a valid session ID, an attacker can impersonate the legitimate user and gain unauthorized access to their account.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network sniffing: An attacker could intercept network traffic to capture the session ID.
- Browser history: Session IDs in the URL might be accessible through browser history.
- Server logs: Session IDs in URLs can be logged by web servers.
- URL Sharing: If users share URLs containing the session ID, that ID could be exposed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be in a position to capture network traffic, access server logs, or obtain the URL containing the session ID. This could range from being on the same network as the user to gaining access to logs or other information storage locations.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was found in IBM Rational Build Forge SE.
- The fix involved changing the redirect from the authentication servlet to the PHP application to use POST instead of GET, preventing the session ID from appearing in the URL.
- The affected version of Rational Build Forge SE was 710.
- The specific APAR (Authorized Program Analysis Report) number for this issue is PM29655.
