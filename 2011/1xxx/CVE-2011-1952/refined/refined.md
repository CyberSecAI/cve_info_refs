Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-1952:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies within the `check_html` function in `common.php` of Post Revolution. This function attempts to remove non-permitted HTML tags from user comments.
- The code uses a `while` loop that relies on `stripos` to find the opening `<` character and then the closing `>` character.
- If a comment contains a string like "a<", `stripos` will find the opening `<`, but the corresponding closing `>` will not exist, causing an infinite loop.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The infinite loop in the `check_html` function leads to excessive resource consumption, eventually causing the PHP script to terminate due to exceeding the maximum execution time.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- An attacker can cause a denial of service by submitting a crafted comment containing a malformed HTML string (e.g., "a<"). This prevents legitimate users from accessing or using the affected application.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Comment submission:** The vulnerability is triggered by submitting a comment containing the specific string.
- **Remote attack:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely by submitting the crafted comment through the application's comment functionality.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs the ability to post comments to the affected application, this is a feature generally available to users, thus low privilege levels are sufficient.
- No special privileges or authentication are required to trigger the vulnerability.
- The attacker does not need to be in a specific network position; they can launch the attack from anywhere.
