NetBSD 5.0.\*: affected
NetBSD 5.0: affected

Severity: remote DOS, possible memory corruption
Fixed: NetBSD-current: April 1st, 2011

Please note that NetBSD releases prior to 4.0 are no longer supported.
It is recommended that all users upgrade to a supported release.
Abstract
========
A malicious packet containing nested RFC 3173 - IP Payload Compression
Protocol (IPComp) headers can cause a panic due to kernel stack exhaustion
in a kernel with option IPSEC enabled. Under certain conditions, kernel
memory may get overwritten. In kernels with option FAST\_IPSEC a sufficient
quantity of such packets may cause a denial of service.
This vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2011-1547.
Technical Details
=================
The option IPSEC stack recurses through packet headers, expecting them to be
ESP/AH-IPCOMP-payload. Due to compression, an IPCOMP-IPCOMP-... packet may
contain a lot of headers, so attempting to recurse over all of them may
exhaust kernel stack, triggering a panic.
The kernel stack may overflow into other memory, causing memory corruption;
on amd64 and i386 (and some other architectures) option DIAGNOSTIC in the
kernel will prevent this corruption, causing a faster panic instead.
The IPv4 FAST\_IPSEC stack merely iterates through the packet headers so
there is no ressource exhaustion by one packet, but a quine packet may
essentially iterate eternally, and thus bind ressources. With FAST\_IPSEC,
there needs to be a SA configured for ipcomp to be admitted at all.
Neither IPSEC nor FAST\_IPSEC are enabled in NetBSD kernels by default.
Solutions and Workarounds
=========================
Workaround: If you do not expect plain ipcomp packets, filter out
incoming proto ipcomp packets (using either ipfilter, pf or npf).
This is not sufficient if you need to allow IPSEC and cannot trust
your IPSEC peers.
Fix: Patch, recompile, and reinstall the kernel, then reboot.

The following instructions briefly summarize how to update and
recompile the kernel. In these instructions, replace:
VERSION with the fixed version from the appropriate CVS branch
(from the above table)
FILE with the name of the file from the above table
ARCH with your architecture (from uname -m), and
KERNCONF with the name of your kernel configuration file.
To update from CVS, re-build, and re-install the kernel:
# cd src
# cvs update -r VERSION FILE
# ./build.sh kernel=KERNCONF
# cp sys/arch/ARCH/compile/obj/KERNCONF/netbsd /netbsd.new
# mv /netbsd /netbsd.old && mv /netbsd.new /netbsd
then reboot:
# shutdown -r now

## IPComp encapsulation nested payload vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#668220

Original Release Date: 2011-04-01 | Last Revised: 2011-08-16

---

### Overview

Some IPComp implementations may contain a kernel memory corruption vulnerability in their handling of nested encapsulation of IPComp payloads.

### Description

| [RFC 3173](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3173) defines the IP Payload Compression Protocol (IPComp) as:  *IP payload compression is a protocol to reduce the size of IP datagrams. This protocol will increase the overall communication performance between a pair of communicating hosts/gateways ("nodes") by compressing the datagrams, provided the nodes have sufficient computation power, through either CPU capacity or a compression coprocessor, and the communication is over slow or congested links*.IPComp is commonly used in conjunction with IPsec implementations.Some network stack implementations, particularly those incorporating the [KAME](http://www.kame.net/) project or [NetBSD](http://www.netbsd.org/) project IPComp and IPsec implementations, may fail to check for stack overflow in their recursive handling of nested IPComp-encapsulated payloads. Exploitation of this vulnerability could allow a remote attacker to cause kernel memory corruption. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker can cause a kernel stack overflow leading to a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply a Patch from Your Vendor**Please see the Vendor Information below for specific vendor information and patches. |
| --- |

| **Workarounds**     + Filter IPComp (protocol number 108) at network borders if it is not required + Utilize packet filtering on workstations or servers to prevent the vulnerable code from being executed + Recompile affected software to disallow nested encapulation of IPComp payloads if possible |
| --- |

### Vendor Information

| Note that any systems derived from the KAME or NetBSD IPComp implementations may be vulnerable. |
