**2. Extracted Information:**

*   **Root Cause:** The root cause of the vulnerability lies in a weakness in the W3C XML Encryption Standard when block ciphers are used in Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode. This cryptographic weakness allows an attacker to perform chosen-ciphertext attacks by analyzing SOAP response differences.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   The use of CBC mode with block ciphers in XML Encryption standard.
    *   Vulnerability to chosen-ciphertext attacks due to the nature of CBC mode.
    *   The ability to extract information about the encryption via differences in server responses

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   A remote attacker can recover the plaintext of encrypted XML messages.
    *   Chosen-ciphertext attacks can compromise the confidentiality of the encrypted data.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The vulnerability is exploited remotely over the network.
    *   The attack involves sending specially crafted (chosen) ciphertexts to a web service.
    *   Analysis of differences between SOAP responses.
    *   Attacker gains information from server responses for varying ciphertext inputs.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must be able to send requests to a vulnerable web service.
    *   The attacker must be aware of the cryptographic weakness in CBC mode with XML encryption.
    *   No authentication is required

**Additional Technical Details and Descriptions:**

*   The vulnerability is not specific to any product implementation of XML Encryption, it is an inherent issue in the standard itself when CBC mode is used.
*   The attack is a form of padding oracle attack, exploiting the way the server handles decryption errors.
*   A countermeasure is to switch to a secure mode like AES-GCM instead of CBC.
*   Apache CXF introduced new algorithm suite policies to use GCM to counter the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability is related to Bleichenbacher attacks.
*   The vulnerability affects, jbossws, apache-cxf implementations.
*   Red Hat advises that, to resolve the vulnerability, customers should configure their applications to use GCM based encryption algorithms or update the encryption config to specify a GCM algorithm,

**Mitigation:**
The primary mitigation for this vulnerability is to switch from CBC mode encryption to Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) for XML encryption. This requires specific configuration changes in affected applications. Specifically:
 *  Use AES-128 or AES-256 with GCM.
 * For jboss 4.x product update the encryption configurations specifying the encryption algorithm to use GCM with, e.g. `<encrypt type="x509v3" algorithm="aes-128-gcm" alias="wsse" />`
 *   For CXF users, use the custom Basic128GCM, Basic192GCM or Basic256GCM policies provided by the framework.
* Upgrade to Apache Santuario 1.5.0 and Apache WSS4J 1.6.5 to get GCM algorithm support
