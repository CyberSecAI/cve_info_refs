Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-1665:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of access control on backup files generated by PHPBoost 3.0. These files are stored in the `/cache/backup/` directory and are accessible without authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Storage of Backup Files:** The backup files, containing sensitive database information, are stored in a publicly accessible directory.
*   **Lack of Access Control:**  No access control mechanisms prevent unauthorized access to these backup files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** An attacker can download the database backup file (.sql), potentially exposing all information stored within the database. This may include user credentials, configuration settings, and other sensitive data.
*   **Complete Compromise of Application:**  The database contents are often critical to the operation of an application, and access to this data can allow an attacker to completely compromise the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct URL Access:** The attacker can directly access the backup files by crafting a URL that points to the vulnerable backup files directory. Example: `http://[localhost]/[path]/cache/backup/backup_[sitname]_*Y*M*D*H*Mn*S*.sql`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web server hosting the vulnerable PHPBoost application.
*   **Knowledge of Backup Path:** The attacker needs to know or guess the path to the backup files, which are located in the `/cache/backup/` directory. The naming convention is also predictable `backup_[sitname]_*Y*M*D*H*Mn*S*.sql`.

**Additional Details:**

*   The exploit details provided in the `exploit-db` content include a suggested workaround of creating a `.htaccess` file in the backup directory containing "deny from all" to block access.
*   The `exploit-db` entry provides a Google dork for finding vulnerable websites "Powered by PHPBoost 3.0" or "Boost√© par PHPBoost 3.0"
*  This vulnerability allows remote exploitation without prior authentication.
