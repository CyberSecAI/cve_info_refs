Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-1074:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the use of `realpath()` with elevated privileges (euid 0) in the `crontab` utility of FreeBSD. Specifically, when `crontab` is invoked with a file argument, it uses `realpath()` to canonicalize the provided path. `realpath()` resolves path components individually, and this occurs with root privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is an information disclosure issue. Because `realpath()` is called with elevated privileges, it allows an unprivileged user to determine the existence of directories, regardless of their search permissions on those directories.
*   **Privilege Escalation (Indirect):** While not direct, this vulnerability allows information disclosure that could be used to further exploit system weaknesses.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Bypass of Discretionary Access Controls (DAC):** The vulnerability allows a user to bypass standard file system access controls by determining the existence of directories they would not otherwise have permission to access.
*   **Information Leakage:** An attacker can discover the existence of hidden or protected directories.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **File Argument to `crontab`:** The attacker provides a crafted path to `crontab` as an argument. This path contains directory components for which the attacker does not have search permissions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Access:** The attacker must have local user access to the system where they can execute the `crontab` command.
*   **Ability to Invoke `crontab`:** The attacker needs to be able to execute the `crontab` command with the crafted file path argument.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerable code snippet is:
```c
} else if (realpath(Filename, resolved_path) != NULL &&
           !strcmp(resolved_path, SYSCRONTAB)) {
        err(ERROR_EXIT, SYSCRONTAB " must be edited manually");
}
```
`SYSCRONTAB` is defined as `/etc/crontab`.  The `realpath()` function will attempt to resolve all path components, and if any do not exist, it will return an error. This behaviour allows for the information disclosure.

**Example Attack:**

The attacker provides the following as an argument to crontab:
`crontab /my/secret/directory/../../../../etc/crontab`

If `/my/secret/directory` exists, then `realpath()` will return a non-NULL value, and the comparison to `SYSCRONTAB` will pass. If `/my/secret/directory` does not exist, then `realpath()` will return NULL, and the error message "SYSCRONTAB must be edited manually" will *not* be generated, informing the user the directory does not exist.

**Affected Systems:**

*   FreeBSD
*   Mac OS X (except for the `realpath()` case, which is `#ifdef`'d out)

**Unaffected Systems:**

*   OpenBSD
*   NetBSD
*   Debian/Ubuntu cron (based on vixie-cron 3.0)
*   Red Hat/Fedora cronie (fork of ISC Cron)

**Additional Notes:**
The advisory mentions this is a minor DAC bypass and that the disclosure is intended for system administrators and developers of FreeBSD-based systems. It notes that the vulnerable code appears to be custom code inserted into FreeBSD's codebase, not present in upstream versions of cron.
