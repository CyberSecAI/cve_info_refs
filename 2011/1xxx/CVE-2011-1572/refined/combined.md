Dylan Simon found a security hole in the ADC system. If
you're using ADCs (admin-defined commands), you need to use
one of the 2 patch files attached and update asap.

If you're not using ADCs this does not affect you. [Note:
the setperms/getperms commands are not ADCs; if that is all
you're using you should be fine. ADC's are enabled by
setting GL\_ADC\_PATH in the rc file.]

Please ugrade to v1.5.9.1 if you're on "master" or the
latest "pu" if you're on "pu".

My sincere apologies for missing this, and thanks once again
to Dylan for catching it and reporting it.

regards,

sitaram

There is no patch file; sorry. Just get the latest commits
for master or pu from github as needed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=695568#c0)  Vincent Danen    2011-04-12 02:54:52 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the gitolite ADC (Admin Defined Commands) system [1].  If the ADC feature were enabled, a remote user could connect to gitolite and execute arbitrary commands by specifying a command such as "../../../../usr/bin/foo" because gitolite did not filter command names.  This has been corrected upstream [2] in version 1.5.9.1 and gitolite will now refuse to execute any commands with ".." in the supplied command name.  Note that ADC is only enabled when GL_ADC_PATH is set in the rc file (it is not enabled or set by default) and both the documentation and example rc file note that there are security risks involved with using ADC.  [1] <http://groups.google.com/group/gitolite/browse_thread/thread/797a93ec26e1dcbc?pli=1> [2] <https://github.com/sitaramc/gitolite/commit/4ce00aef84d1ff7c35f7adbbb99a6241cfda00cc>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=695568#c1)  Vincent Danen    2011-04-12 02:55:44 UTC  ``` Created gitolite tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 695569](show_bug.cgi?id=695569 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2011-1572 gitolite: arbitrary command execution flaw with optional admin-defined command feature [fedora-all]")] Affects: epel-6 [[bug 695570](show_bug.cgi?id=695570 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2011-1572 gitolite: arbitrary command execution flaw with optional admin-defined command feature [epel-6]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=695568#c2)  Lubomir Rintel    2011-04-12 07:24:34 UTC  ``` This was fixed long ago in:  gitolite-1.5.3-2.fc14 gitolite-1.5.7-2.1.el6   ``` |  |

Package        : gitolite
Vulnerability  : directory traversal
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : none yet

Dylan Simon discovered that gitolite, a SSH-based gatekeeper for git
repositories, is prone to directory traversal attacks when restricting
admin defined commands (ADC).  This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary
commands with privileges of the gitolite server via crafted command names.

Please note that this only affects installations that have ADC enabled
(not the Debian default).

The oldstable distribution (lenny) is not affected by this problem,
it does not include gitolite.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.5.4-2+squeeze1.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.5.7-2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.5.7-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your gitolite packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

This appears to be an arbitrary command execution flaw (the patch appears
to limit the commands that can be run).

Use CVE-2011-1572

Thanks.
