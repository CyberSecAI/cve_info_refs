Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-1585:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from improper session management in the CIFS (Common Internet File System) implementation of the Linux kernel. Specifically, the `cifs_find_smb_ses` function in `fs/cifs/connect.c` doesn't correctly determine the association between users and sessions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Inadequate session matching:** The kernel fails to properly verify if a user is authorized to reuse an existing CIFS session created by another user. It primarily matched sessions based on username, which is insufficient for security.
*   **Missing password verification:** When matching sessions by username, the code initially neglected to verify passwords. This omission allows unauthorized users to "borrow" another user's session without the necessary credentials.
*  **Insufficient `MAX_PASSWORD_SIZE`**: The initial definition of the `MAX_PASSWORD_SIZE` was too small, which might have led to truncation and thus flawed session matching.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Bypass authentication:**  A local user could bypass CIFS share authentication and potentially gain access to files they shouldn't. This is achieved by reusing the session of another authenticated user.
*  **Access to sensitive information:** By bypassing authentication, an attacker could gain unauthorized access to sensitive data.
*   **Data modification:** The attacker may also be able to modify data on the mounted share if they gain write access via the "borrowed" session.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Local access:** The attacker needs local access to the system to exploit this flaw.
*   **Mounting CIFS share:** The attacker must attempt to mount a CIFS share after another user has already successfully mounted the same share, and the attacker must have a way of influencing the authentication parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Local user account:** The attacker needs a valid user account on the vulnerable system.
*   **Knowledge of another user's mounted share:** The attacker needs to know the path and settings for a CIFS share already mounted by another user.
*   **(Optional) sudo privileges:** If `/sbin/mount.cifs` does not have the setuid bit, the attacker needs sudo rights to execute it.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in Linux kernel versions before 2.6.36.
*   The issue can be exploited by another user mounting the same share using `mount.cifs`, especially if it is setuid root. However, the Red Hat Bugzilla entry clarifies that `mount.cifs` is not setuid root by default on Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

The provided content contains more detail than the original CVE description which simply states:
>The cifs_find_smb_ses function in fs/cifs/connect.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.36 does not properly determine the associations between users and sessions, which allows local users to bypass CIFS share authentication by leveraging a mount of a share by a different user.

The detailed description from Suse clarifies the specific function and mechanism within the kernel that causes the issue. Additionally, the Red Hat Bugzilla entries highlights that the primary exploit vector is using mount.cifs as a setuid binary, or exploiting it via sudo. The commit notes also show that the patch increases `MAX_PASSWORD_SIZE` from 16 to 512.
