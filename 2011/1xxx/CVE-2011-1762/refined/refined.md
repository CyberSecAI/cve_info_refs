**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The core issue was a flaw in how WordPress handled user roles and permissions, specifically regarding contributor-level users and their ability to publish posts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **WordPress Account:** The attacker needs a user account with the "Contributor" role.
*   **Access to WordPress Admin Area:**  The attacker must be able to log in to the WordPress administration area.
