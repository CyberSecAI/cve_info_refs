Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2011-1880:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a null pointer dereference in the Windows kernel-mode driver (win32k.sys). This occurs due to the way kernel-mode drivers keep track of pointers to certain kernel-mode driver objects.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Null pointer dereference: The driver attempts to access a memory location using a pointer that is null (pointing to nothing), leading to a crash or other unexpected behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Elevation of Privilege:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to run arbitrary code in kernel mode. This gives the attacker complete control over the affected system.
- **Full System Compromise:** An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full administrative rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to the system. The vulnerability cannot be exploited remotely or by anonymous users.
- **Specially Crafted Application:** The attacker would need to run a specially crafted application designed to trigger the null pointer dereference.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have valid credentials to log on to the targeted system locally.
- The attacker must be able to execute a crafted application on the target.

**Additional Details:**

- The affected component is `win32k.sys`, which is the kernel part of the Windows subsystem responsible for window management, screen output, and input collection.
- The vulnerability is addressed by correcting the way that kernel-mode drivers manage pointers to kernel-mode driver objects.
- This vulnerability was not publicly disclosed prior to the release of the security bulletin.
- There were no reports of this vulnerability being exploited in the wild when the security bulletin was released.
