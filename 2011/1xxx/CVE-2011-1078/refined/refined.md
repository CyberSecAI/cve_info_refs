{
  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2011-1078",
    "description": "struct sco_conninfo has one padding byte in the end. Local variable cinfo of type sco_conninfo is copied to userspace with this uninitialized one byte, leading to old stack contents leak.",
    "affected_component": "Linux kernel's Bluetooth implementation",
    "root_cause": "The `sco_conninfo` structure has a padding byte at the end, which is not initialized. When a local variable of this type is copied to userspace, this uninitialized padding byte leaks old stack data.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Information Leak"
    ],
    "impact": "A local unprivileged user could potentially leak contents of kernel stack memory to userspace.",
    "attack_vector": "Local access is required to exploit this vulnerability.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be a local user with the ability to call the `sco_sock_getsockopt_old()` function, which is a standard operation for interacting with Bluetooth SCO sockets.",
        "additional_information": "This issue only affects 32-bit systems."
