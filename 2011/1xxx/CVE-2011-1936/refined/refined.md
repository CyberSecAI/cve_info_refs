  "CVE-2011-1936": {
    "description": "A bug was found in the way Xen handles cpuid instruction emulation during VM exits. An unprivileged guest user can potentially use this flaw to crash the guest.",
    "root_cause": "Insecure handling of CPUID instruction emulation during VM exits within the Xen hypervisor.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Improper emulation of the CPUID instruction during VM exits"
    ],
    "impact": "An unprivileged guest user can potentially crash the guest operating system.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A malicious or compromised user-space process within a Xen virtualized guest can trigger the vulnerable code path by making specific use of the CPUID instruction."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have the ability to execute code within a Xen guest OS, but does not need to have root privileges inside the guest OS.",
    "affected_architectures": [
      "x86 architecture with Intel processor and VMX virtualization extension enabled."
    ],
    "additional_notes": [
       "This vulnerability does not affect upstream Linux kernels.",
       "The vulnerability is addressed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 via RHSA-2011:0927"
