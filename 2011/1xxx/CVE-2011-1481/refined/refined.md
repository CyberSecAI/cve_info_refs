Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of the `sender_name` and `sender_email` parameters when submitted to `/modules.php?name=Feedback`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is reflected XSS. The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can craft a malicious URL containing JavaScript that, when accessed by a victim, will execute in their browser. This can lead to a variety of malicious actions.
*   **Potential Consequences:** This could allow the attacker to steal cookies, redirect users to malicious websites, deface the website, or perform other client-side attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is conducted through a POST request to `/modules.php?name=Feedback`, specifically targeting the `sender_name` and `sender_email` parameters.
*   **Maliciously Crafted URL:** The attacker crafts a URL with the payload in the parameters that will execute JavaScript in the victim's browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **URL Crafting:** The attacker needs the ability to create a URL with the malicious script embedded within the vulnerable parameters.
*   **Victim Interaction:** The attacker needs to induce the victim to access the crafted URL (e.g., via social engineering, phishing).

**Additional details:**
* The vulnerability was tested in version 8.0 of PHP-Nuke, and versions 8.1 and 9.0 might be vulnerable as well.
* The vulnerability was disclosed after failed attempts to contact the vendor.
