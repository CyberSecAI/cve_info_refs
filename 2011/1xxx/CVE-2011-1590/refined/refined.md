```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The X.509if dissector in Wireshark was vulnerable to a crash due to use of uninitialized variables.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Use of uninitialized variables in the X.509if dissector.
- Impact of exploitation: It may be possible to make Wireshark crash by injecting a series of malformed packets onto the wire or by convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace file.
- Attack vectors: By injecting a series of malformed packets or by convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace file.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs to be able to send malformed packets to a network being monitored by Wireshark, or be able to provide a malformed packet trace file to a Wireshark user.
