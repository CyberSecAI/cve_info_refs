    {
      "source": "www.kb.cert.org_8eaac106_20250125_011412.html",
      "root_cause": "The NetGear WNAP210 access point has two vulnerabilities: (1) a configuration backup file containing the administrator password in plaintext is accessible without authentication and (2) a web page allows bypassing the login page, resulting in unauthenticated access to the device configuration.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Cleartext storage of sensitive data",
         "Authentication bypass"
      ],
      "impact": "A remote unauthenticated attacker can retrieve the administrator password in plaintext and bypass the login web page to access the device's configuration web page directly.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Network access to the device is required. Accessing specific URLs on the device's web interface is needed: /BackupConfig.php to obtain the password and /recreate.php followed by /index.php to bypass the login page."
      ],
       "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs network connectivity to the vulnerable device. No prior authentication is needed."
