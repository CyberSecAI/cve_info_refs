Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-1582:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an error in the fix for CVE-2011-1088 and CVE-2011-1183. The fix caused security constraints configured via annotations to be ignored on the first request to a Servlet.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Security Constraint Bypass:**  Servlet security annotations, which define access control rules, were not being applied correctly on the initial request to a servlet.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker could potentially bypass security constraints and access resources they should not be authorized to access on the first request.
-  After the first request, security constraints would be applied correctly.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves sending a request to a servlet protected by security constraints, which could be done via HTTP.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-  The attacker needs to be able to send a request to the vulnerable servlet.
- No specific position is mentioned, indicating that the attacker can be remote.

**Additional Notes:**
- The issue was present in Tomcat versions 7.0.12 and 7.0.13, and resolved in version 7.0.14.
- The issue was a regression introduced by previous fixes.
- The fix involved using the correct class loader.
- The vulnerability was present on the first request to a Servlet. Subsequent requests were secured correctly.
