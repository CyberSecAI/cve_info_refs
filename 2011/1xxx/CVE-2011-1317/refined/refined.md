{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The JSP container's internal buffer expands when a JSP outputs a large response but does not reset afterwards. Repeated requests that generate large responses can lead to memory exhaustion.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Memory leak due to improper buffer management in the JSP container."
    ],
    "impact": "Out of Memory (OOM) errors leading to application instability or denial of service.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "Sending repeated JSP requests that generate large responses."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Ability to send JSP requests to the vulnerable application."
  },
  "additional_details": {
        "affected_components": "IBM WebSphere Application Server versions 6.1 and 7.0 users of JavaServer Pages (JSP)",
        "fix_information": "The JSP Container code was modified to use its memory more efficiently. The fix for this APAR is included in fix pack 6.1.0.37 and 7.0.0.15, and later fix packs.",
       "details": "The memory leak occurs in `com.ibm.ws.jsp.runtime.WASJSPStrBufferImpl`, which uses a `StringBuilder` to store the JSP output. The buffer size increases with the response size and is not reset, leading to a continuous increase in memory consumption."
