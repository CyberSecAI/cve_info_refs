Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-1736:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied data when the HP Data Protector Backup Client Service (OmniInet.exe) handles certain messages. This lack of sanitization allows for directory traversal attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Directory Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is a directory traversal flaw. This means an attacker can manipulate file path references to access files and directories outside of the intended scope.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The Backup Client Service does not properly validate or sanitize user-supplied input, specifically filename strings, before processing them.
- **Lack of Authentication:** The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring any authentication, meaning a remote attacker can directly attempt exploitation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Access:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to view or download arbitrary files on the target system. This could include sensitive data, configuration files, or other critical information.
- **Confidentiality Breach:** The ability to read arbitrary files leads to a significant breach of data confidentiality.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** The vulnerability is exploited over the network by sending crafted messages to the vulnerable service.
- **Remote:** The attack can be carried out remotely, with no requirement for the attacker to be present on the local network or system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send network traffic to the target system on TCP port 5555, where the Backup Client Service listens.
- **Crafted Messages:** The attacker needs the ability to construct and send specially crafted filename strings to exploit the directory traversal flaw.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects the HP OpenView Data Protector software.
- The specific service involved is the Backup Client Service (OmniInet.exe).
- The vulnerability was reported to HP by Aniway (Aniway.Anyway@gmail.com).
- Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS provides a protection filter (ID '11136') against this vulnerability.
- HP has issued an update to fix the vulnerability.
