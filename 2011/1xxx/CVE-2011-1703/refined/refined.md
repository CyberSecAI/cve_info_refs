          "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies within the nipplib component of Novell iPrint Client. Specifically, when handling the 'driver-version' parameter from a user-specified printer URL, the component blindly copies user-supplied data into a fixed-length buffer on the heap.",

          "attack_vectors": "The attack vector involves a malicious page or file that exploits the vulnerable iPrint client.",
          "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to lure the target to visit a malicious page or open a malicious file."
