```
- **Root cause of vulnerability**:
The `ServletSecurity` annotations were ignored during web application startup. This meant that security constraints defined via annotations were not being applied correctly, potentially leaving parts of the application unprotected.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
  - Security constraints defined using `@ServletSecurity` annotations were not being applied when a web application was started, leading to a bypass of intended access restrictions.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
  - Unprotected areas of the application could be accessed by unauthorized users.
- **Attack vectors**:
  - The vulnerability is triggered during the web application start process. An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access by making requests to parts of the application that should have been protected by security constraints.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
  - The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the web application and access resources that are supposed to be protected by security annotations.
