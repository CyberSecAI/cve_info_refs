Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2011-1048:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a **SQL injection flaw** in the `product.php` script of the MihanTools Script. This script fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `id` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the presence of a SQL injection flaw. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the database query by manipulating the `id` parameter within the `product.php` script.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database Information Disclosure:** An attacker can leverage the SQL injection vulnerability to retrieve sensitive information from the database, such as usernames, passwords, and other confidential data.
*   **Data Modification:**  The attacker could potentially modify or delete data within the database.
*   **Potential for Full System Compromise:** In a worst-case scenario, successful exploitation could lead to complete compromise of the application and potentially the server, depending on database permissions and configuration.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited through a specially crafted HTTP GET request to `product.php`. The `id` parameter is manipulated to inject malicious SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web application to send the malicious HTTP request.
*   **Basic Knowledge of SQL Injection:** The attacker needs to be familiar with SQL syntax and injection techniques to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **No Authentication Required:** Based on the exploit details, the attacker does not need any prior authentication.

**Technical Details (from the exploit):**

*   **Vulnerable URL:** `http://localhost/product.php?id=`
*   **Exploit String:** `-1+union+select+version(),2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14--`
*   This payload uses `UNION SELECT` to append results from the database to the original query. In this case, it's retrieving the database version.

The provided exploit demonstrates how the attacker can retrieve the database version, but it is trivial to adapt this payload to extract other database information or potentially modify data.
