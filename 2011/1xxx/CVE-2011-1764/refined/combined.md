=head1 Exim Development Repository

This is the Exim (Mail Transport Agent) Development Repository. Please
read the following information if you wish to use or contribute to the
Exim development process - this is to prevent your or our time being
unnecessarily wasted.

If you just want to use, build or get information on Exim then have a
look at the pointers further down this file at L<General Exim Information>.

=head2 General Development Information

The general Exim development process and resources are documented in
the wiki page at L<http://wiki.exim.org/EximDevelopment> - although
the wiki is likely to be moved and rehashed in the near future.

The sections below this duplicate much of the information form the
wiki document.

=head2 Development Repositories

Exim development is kept within a  git (L<https://git-scm.com/>)
repository. The master repository is at L<git://git.exim.org/exim.git>
with a web interface giving change and source visibility at
L<https://git.exim.org/exim.git>

There is a secondary repository on github at
L<https://github.com/Exim/exim> managed by the Exim Organisation
- however this may currently fall out of synchronisation with the
main one.

=head2 Bug Tracking

Currently this is all done using Bugzilla at L<https://bugs.exim.org/>
- please do not use github issue tracking.

=head2 Mailing List

Development issues are normally discussed on the exim-dev mailing list
- see L<https://www.exim.org/maillist.html>

=head2 Exim Release Process

Some documentation on the release process can be found at
L<http://wiki.exim.org/EximRelease>.

=head2 General Exim Information

The best place to get general information is on the website at
L<https://www.exim.org/>.

You can find Download locations L<https://www.exim.org/mirrors.html>,
Mailing list info L<https://www.exim.org/maillist.html> and Full
Documentation L<https://www.exim.org/docs.html> on that website.

If you are using a Linux or other freely available Unix like operating
system it is very likely that your system will have Exim packaged for
it already. In this case it is probably prudent to use these packages
unless you have specialised requirements.

In any case you can always ask on the
Exim Users mailing list L<https://lists.exim.org/mailman3/postorius/lists/exim-users.lists.exim.org/>
for further information.

Package        : exim4
Vulnerability  : format string vulnerability
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-1764
Debian Bug     : 624670

It was discovered that Exim, the default mail transport agent in
Debian, uses DKIM data obtain from DNS directly in a format string,
potentially allowing malicious mail senders to execute arbitrary code.
(CVE-2011-1764)

The oldstable distribution (lenny) is not affected by this problem
because it does not contain DKIM support.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Date: 29 Apr 2011 10:50:50 -0400 From: John R. Levine <johnl@iecc.com> To: Suresh Ramasubramanian <suresh@hserus.net>  It's a buglet in exim, which seems to be misinterpreting percent signs as printf codes or something.  In DKIM signatures, percent signs aren't special.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=702474#c0)  Vincent Danen    2011-05-05 18:40:26 UTC  ``` It was reported [1],[2] that Exim would improperly interpret '%' in a DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) signature, which would get logged to the paniclog.  It is possible that using '%n' in the DKIM signature could be used to verwrite stack data, which could cause Exim to crash.  DKIM support has been in Exim since version 4.70.  A fix has been pushed upstream [3].  [1] <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=624670> [2] <http://bugs.exim.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1106> [3] <http://git.exim.org/exim.git/commitdiff/337e3505b0e6cd4309db6bf6062b33fa56e06cf8>   Statement:  Not vulnerable. This issue did not affect the versions of exim as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 or 5 as they did not include support for DKIM.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=702474#c1)  Vincent Danen    2011-05-05 18:41:13 UTC  ``` Created exim tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 702475](show_bug.cgi?id=702475 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2011-1407 exim various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=702474#c2)  Josh Bressers    2011-05-05 18:49:35 UTC  ``` A workaround is to add "control = dkim_disable_verify" to an ACL to prevent processing DKIM signatures.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=702474#c3)  Vincent Danen    2011-05-17 17:54:24 UTC  ``` Created exim tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: epel-6 [[bug 705448](show_bug.cgi?id=705448 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2011-1407 CVE-2011-1764 exim various flaws [epel-6]")]   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=702474#c4)  Vincent Danen    2012-08-10 18:23:54 UTC  ``` According to:  <http://wiki.exim.org/EximSecurity>  This was resolved in upstream 4.76.  Current supported versions of Fedora provide 4.76, however EPEL6 still provides 4.72 and is still vulnerable.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=702474#c5)  Vincent Danen    2012-08-10 18:36:33 UTC  ``` It seems that EPEL6 did fix this, but incorrectly noted the wrong CVE:  exim-4.72-0003-CVE-2011-1407.patch is from the git commit above, so it actually fixes [CVE-2011-1764](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1764) and _not_ [CVE-2011-1407](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1407) as the patch name and changelog implied.   ``` |  |

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.
