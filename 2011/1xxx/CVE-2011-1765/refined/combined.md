This has been fixed in 1.16.4, I think. Tim, could you close it, if so?

No, it's not fixed.

One possibility is

/\.[^\\/:\\*\?\"<>|]+(#|\?|$)/i

This was suggested by Reedy based on the characters that are not allowed in Windows paths. I'm wondering if it's a good idea to allow the percent symbol:

/\.[^\\/:\\*\?\"<>|%]+(#|\?|$)/i

This would make it less likely that innocuous plain text at the end of a query string would be disallowed, in URLs such as:

<http://www.mediawiki.org/w/api.php?action=parse&text=Sentence%20one.%20Sentence%20two>

In theory, file extensions can contain percent symbols, but in practice this doesn't seem to be done.

Allowing it sounds safe enough. The percent sign being a very obscure character in extensions makes it very unlikely it would be associated with a dangerous MIME type.

Fixes are in r85844 and following; there are still serious outstanding bugs in 1.16.x & 1.17 beta releases caused by the fix series.

Latest updates on r89397 and r89558 may help reduce the false positives, but probably needs a quick test survey to confirm that things are ok.

It looks like Tim has been doing most of the work on this to fix the problem, updating the assignee to reflect that. Looks like the this is actually fixed, too, since the fixes mentioned Comment #7 have been merged.

I'm sure you know how to reopen this if I'm wrong ;)

# [MediaWiki-announce] MediaWiki security release 1.16.5

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

I would like to announce the release of MediaWiki 1.16.5. Two security
issues were discovered.

The first issue is yet another recurrence of the Internet Explorer 6
XSS vulnerability that caused the release of 1.16.4. It was pointed
out that there are dangerous extensions with more than four
characters, so the regular expressions we introduced had to be updated
to match longer extensions.

For more details, see <https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=28534>

The second issue allows unauthenticated users to gain additional
rights, on wikis where $wgBlockDisablesLogin is enabled. By default,
it is disabled. The issue occurs when a malicious user sends cookies
which contain the user name and user ID of a "victim" account. In
certain circumstances, the rights of the victim are loaded and persist
throughout the malicious request, allowing the malicious user to
perform actions with the victim's rights.

$wgBlockDisablesLogin is a feature which is sometimes used on private
wikis to prevent users who have an account from logging in and viewing
content on the wiki.

For more details, see <https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=28639>

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=702512#c0)  Vincent Danen    2011-05-05 23:04:28 UTC  ``` Mediawiki 1.16.5 was released [1] to correct two security flaws:  The first issue is yet another recurrence of the Internet Explorer 6 XSS vulnerability that caused the release of 1.16.4. It was pointed out that there are dangerous extensions with more than four characters, so the regular expressions we introduced had to be updated to match longer extensions. ([CVE-2011-1765](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1765))  For more details, see <https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=28534>  The second issue allows unauthenticated users to gain additional rights, on wikis where $wgBlockDisablesLogin is enabled. By default, it is disabled. The issue occurs when a malicious user sends cookies which contain the user name and user ID of a "victim" account. In certain circumstances, the rights of the victim are loaded and persist throughout the malicious request, allowing the malicious user to perform actions with the victim's rights. ([CVE-2011-1766](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1766))  $wgBlockDisablesLogin is a feature which is sometimes used on private wikis to prevent users who have an account from logging in and viewing content on the wiki.  For more details, see <https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=28639>  [1] <http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/mediawiki-announce/2011-May/000098.html>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=702512#c1)  Vincent Danen    2011-05-05 23:08:29 UTC  ``` Created mediawiki tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 702513](show_bug.cgi?id=702513 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2011-1765 mediawiki: two vulnerabilities fixed in 1.16.5 [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=702512#c2)  Vincent Danen    2011-05-05 23:08:31 UTC  ``` Created mediawiki116 tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: epel-all [[bug 696362](show_bug.cgi?id=696362 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2011-1578 CVE-2011-1579 CVE-2011-1580 CVE-2011-1765 mediawiki116 various flaws [epel-all]")]   ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
