How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

##### VMware Security Advisory

CVE-2010-1323 CVE-2010-4020 CVE-2010-4021
CVE-2010-2240
##### 1. Summary

VMware ESXi and ESX could encounter a socket exhaustion situation which may lead to a denial of service. Updates to Likewise components and to the ESX Service Console address security vulnerabilities.﻿

#####

##### 2. Relevant releases

VMware ESXi 4.1 without patch ESXi410-201104401-SG.
VMware ESXi 4.0 without patch ESXi400-201104401-SG.

VMware ESX 4.1 without patch ESX410-201104401-SG.
VMware ESX 4.0 without patch ESX400-201104401-SG.

##### 3. Problem Description

a. ESX/ESXi Socket Exhaustion
By sending malicious network traffic to an ESXi or ESX host an attacker could exhaust the available sockets which would prevent further connections to the host. In the event a host becomes inaccessible its virtual machines will continue to run and have network connectivity but a reboot of the ESXi or ESX host may be required in order to be able to connect to the host again.
ESXi and ESX hosts may intermittently lose connectivity caused by applications that do not correctly close sockets. If this occurs an error message similar to the following may be written to the vpxa log:
socket() returns -1 (Cannot allocate memory)
An error message similar to the following may be written to the vmkernel logs:
socreate(type=2, proto=17) failed with error 55
VMware would like to thank Jimmy Scott at inet-solutions.be for reporting this issue to us.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2011-1785 to this issue.
Column 4 of the following table lists the action required to remediate the vulnerability in each release, if a solution is available.

#####

b. Likewise package update
Updates to the vmware-esx-likewise-openldap and vmware-esx-likewise-krb5 packages address several security issues.
One of the vulnerabilities is specific to Likewise while the other vulnerabilities are present in the MIT version of krb5. An incorrect assert() call in Likewise may lead to a termination of the Likewise-open lsassd service if a username with an illegal byte sequence is entered for user authentication when logging in to the Active Directory domain of the ESXi/ESX host. This would lead to a denial of service. The MIT-krb5 vulnerabilities are detailed in MITKRB5-SA-2010-007.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names CVE-2011-1786 (Likewise-only issue), CVE-2010-1324, CVE-2010-1323, CVE-2010-4020, CVE-2010-4021 to these issues.
