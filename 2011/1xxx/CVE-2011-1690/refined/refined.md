Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2011-1690:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from a flaw in how Request Tracker (RT) handles authentication credentials, which allows an attacker to redirect those credentials to a third-party server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-   **Credential redirection:** The core issue is the possibility of an attacker redirecting user authentication credentials. This suggests a lack of proper validation or sanitization of URLs or other parameters that control the authentication flow. This is a type of man-in-the-middle attack vector.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Credential theft:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to steal user credentials.
-   **Unauthorized access:** Stolen credentials can be used to gain unauthorized access to the RT system.
-   **Compromise of data:**  With access, attackers may be able to view, modify, or delete sensitive data, depending on the user's permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **Malicious link:**  Attackers can trick a user into clicking a malicious link that redirects their credentials to a third-party server.
-   **Cross-site request forgery (CSRF):**  While not explicitly mentioned as a vector for this specific vulnerability, it is mentioned alongside other vulnerabilities and could be a possible attack vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious link and get a legitimate user to click it, or create a CSRF attack.
-   No specialized access to the RT system itself is required, making this vulnerability potentially easier to exploit.

**Affected Versions:**

*   RT versions 3.6.0 through 3.8.7 are vulnerable.
*   RT version 3.8.8 is vulnerable to a more limited degree.

**Additional Notes:**
-   This vulnerability is part of a set of several security issues discovered during a security audit of RT's source code.
-   Patches have been released to address this and other vulnerabilities for RT versions 3.6.10, all versions of 3.8, and as part of new releases 3.6.11, 3.8.10 and 4.0.0rc8.
-   The advisory from Debian also mentions that this vulnerability affects request-tracker3.6 and request-tracker3.8 and has been fixed in versions 3.6.7-5+lenny6, 3.8.8-7+squeeze1 and 3.8.10-1 of their respective packages.
