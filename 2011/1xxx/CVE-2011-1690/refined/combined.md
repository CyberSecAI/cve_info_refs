How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# [Rt-announce] Security vulnerabilities in RT

```
In the process of preparing the release of RT 4.0.0, we performed an
extensive security audit of RT's source code.  During this audit,
several vulnerabilities were found which affect earlier releases of RT.
We are releasing versions 3.6.11, 3.8.10, and 4.0.0rc8 to resolve these
vulnerabilities, as well as patches which apply atop 3.6.10 and all
versions of RT 3.8.

RT versions 3.8.0 and above with the "external custom field" feature
enabled and configured are vulnerable to a remote code execution
vulnerability.  An authenticated user (either privileged or
unprivileged) can use this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code with
the permissions of the webserver; they may also be tricked into doing so
via cross-site request forgery (CSRF).  The external custom field option
is disabled by default; if you have not explicitly enabled
"CustomFieldValuesSources" in your RT configuration, your RT instance is
not vulnerable.  We have been assigned CVE-2011-1685 for this
vulnerability.

RT versions 2.0.0 and above are vulnerable to multiple SQL injection
attacks.  We do not believe these attacks to be capable of directly
inserting, altering or removing data from the database, but an
authenticated user (either privileged or unprivileged) could use them to
retrieve unauthorized ticket data.  Deployments since 3.6.0 are
additionally vulnerable to a more complex attack, which can be used by a
privileged user to retrieve arbitrary data from the database.  We have
been assigned CVE-2011-1686 for this vulnerability.

RT versions 3.0.0 and higher are vulnerable to an information leak
wherein an authenticated privileged user could gain sensitive
information, such as encrypted passwords, via the search interface.  We
have been assigned CVE-2011-1687 for this vulnerability.  This
vulnerability is particularly notable given RT's previous vulnerability
with insecure hashing (CVE-2011-0009).

RT versions 3.6.0 through 3.8.7, as well as 3.8.8 to a more limited
degree, are vulnerable to a malicious attacker tricking the user into
sending their authentication credentials to a third-party server.  We
have been assigned CVE-2011-1690 for this vulnerability.

RT versions 3.2.0 and above are vulnerable to a directory traversal
attack where an unauthenticated attacker can read any file which is
readable by the webserver.  While some servers (Apache, nginx) have
safeguards which mitigate this attack, preventing such traversals from
accessing files outside of RT's document root, many others (including
the standalone server provided with RT, plackup, starman, twiggy, and
lighttpd) are vulnerable to this exploit.  We have been assigned
CVE-2011-1688 for this vulnerability.

RT versions 2.0.0 and above are vulnerable to javascript
cross-site-scripting vulnerabilities, which allow an attacker to run
javascript with the user's credentials.  We have been assigned
CVE-2011-1689 for this vulnerability.

In addition to releasing RT versions 3.6.11, 3.8.10, and 4.0.0rc8, we
have collected patches for 3.6.10 and all releases of 3.8 into a
distribution available for download at this link:

<http://download.bestpractical.com/pub/rt/release/security-2011-04-14.tar.gz>
<http://download.bestpractical.com/pub/rt/release/security-2011-04-14.tar.gz.sig>

7d09b1315785a90d915bdbc86da1a0c9bd017a03  security-2011-04-14.tar.gz
7898a45b15474641a0f9c381d0f6f58fb34afcc3  security-2011-04-14.tar.gz.sig

The README in the tarball contains instructions for applying the
patches.

If you need help resolving this issue locally, we will provide
discounted pricing for single-incident support.  Please contact us at

Package        : request-tracker3.6, request-tracker3.8
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-1685 CVE-2011-1686 CVE-2011-1687 CVE-2011-1688
                 CVE-2011-1689 CVE-2011-1690

Several vulnerabilities were in Request Tracker, an issue tracking
system.

CVE-2011-1685
    If the external custom field feature is enabled, Request Tracker
    allows authenticated users to execute arbitrary code with the
    permissions of the web server, possible triggered by a cross-site
    request forgery attack.  (External custom fields are disabled by
    default.)

CVE-2011-1686
    Multiple SQL injection attacks allow authenticated users to obtain
    data from the database in an unauthorized way.

CVE-2011-1687
    An information leak allows an authenticated privileged user to
    obtain sensitive information, such as encrypted passwords, via the
    search interface.

CVE-2011-1688
    When running under certain web servers (such as Lighttpd), Request
    Tracker is vulnerable to a directory traversal attack, allowing
    attackers to read any files accessible to the web server.  Request
    Tracker instances running under Apache or Nginx are not affected.

CVE-2011-1689
    Request Tracker contains multiple cross-site scripting
    vulnerabilities.

CVE-2011-1690
    Request Tracker enables attackers to redirect authentication
    credentials supplied by legitimate users to third-party servers.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.6.7-5+lenny6 of the request-tracker3.6 package.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.8.8-7+squeeze1 of the request-tracker3.8 package.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 3.8.10-1 of the
request-tracker3.8 package.

We recommend that you upgrade your Request Tracker packages.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=696795#c0)  Vincent Danen    2011-04-14 20:33:11 UTC  ``` Several flaws have been reported [1] and corrected in RT versions 3.6.11 and 3.8.10, including:  RT versions 3.8.0 and above with the "external custom field" feature enabled and configured are vulnerable to a remote code execution vulnerability.  An authenticated user (either privileged orunprivileged) can use this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the webserver; they may also be tricked into doing so via cross-site request forgery (CSRF). ([CVE-2011-1685](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1685))  RT versions 2.0.0 and above are vulnerable to multiple SQL injection attacks.  We do not believe these attacks to be capable of directly inserting, altering or removing data from the database, but an authenticated user (either privileged or unprivileged) could use them to retrieve unauthorized ticket data. ([CVE-2011-1686](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1686))  RT versions 3.0.0 and higher are vulnerable to an information leak wherein an authenticated privileged user could gain sensitive information, such as encrypted passwords, via the search interface. ([CVE-2011-1687](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1687))  RT versions 3.6.0 through 3.8.7, as well as 3.8.8 to a more limited degree, are vulnerable to a malicious attacker tricking the user into sending their authentication credentials to a third-party server. ([CVE-2011-1690](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1690))  RT versions 3.2.0 and above are vulnerable to a directory traversal attack where an unauthenticated attacker can read any file which is readable by the webserver.  While some servers (Apache, nginx) have safeguards which mitigate this attack, preventing such traversals from accessing files outside of RT's document root, many others (including the standalone server provided with RT, plackup, starman, twiggy, and lighttpd) are vulnerable to this exploit. ([CVE-2011-1688](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1688))  RT versions 2.0.0 and above are vulnerable to javascript cross-site-scripting vulnerabilities, which allow an attacker to run javascript with the user's credentials. ([CVE-2011-1689](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1689))  Upstream have released a patchset [2] as well for 3.6.10 and 3.8 releases, in addition to the new releases.  [1] <http://blog.bestpractical.com/2011/04/security-vulnerabilities-in-rt.html> [2] <http://download.bestpractical.com/pub/rt/release/security-2011-04-14.tar.gz>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=696795#c1)  Fedora Update System    2011-10-27 19:05:48 UTC  ``` rt3-3.8.10-2.el6.1 has been pushed to the Fedora EPEL 6 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ``` |  |
