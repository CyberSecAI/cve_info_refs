| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=676389#c0)  Vincent Danen    2011-02-09 17:29:49 UTC  ``` A Debian bug report [1],[2] indicated that feh is vulnerable to an arbitrary file overwrite flaw.  If a user could guess the PID of the feh process and create a symlink in /tmp, they could cause the overwrite of any file that the user running feh has write access to via wget overwriting the file.  In src/imlib.c we have:  235 char *feh_http_load_image(char *url) 236 { 237     char *tmpname; 238     char *basename; 239     char *path = NULL; 240  241     if (opt.keep_http) { 242         if (opt.output_dir) 243             path = opt.output_dir; 244         else  245             path = ""; 246     } else 247         path = "/tmp/"; 248 249     basename = strrchr(url, '/') + 1; 250     tmpname = feh_unique_filename(path, basename); ... 455             execlp("wget", "wget", "--cache=off", "-O", tmpname, url, quiet, NULL);  and in src/utils.c we have:  162 char *feh_unique_filename(char *path, char *basename) 163 { ... 170  171     /* Massive paranoia ;) */ 172     if (i > 999998) 173         i = 1; 174  175     ppid = getpid(); 176     snprintf(cppid, sizeof(cppid), "%06ld", (long) ppid); 177  178     /* make sure file doesn't exist */ 179     do { 180         snprintf(num, sizeof(num), "%06ld", i++); 181         tmpname = estrjoin("", path, "feh_", cppid, "_", num, "_", basename, NULL); 182     } 18     while (stat(tmpname, &st) == 0); 184     return(tmpname); 185 }  feh_unique_filename() has some attempt at randomness, but I don't think it's enough.  i always starts at 1, so unless the same process is creating multiple temporary files, you're almost guaranteed to have that extra randomness being '1'; it's also just as easy to create a bunch of symlinks to account for the "randomness" provided you know the PID.  Using mkstemp would be a much better solution.
