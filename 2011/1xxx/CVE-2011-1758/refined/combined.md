# fedorahosted.org retirement

## Summary

fedorahosted.org was retired on March 1st, 2017. If you are viewing this page, odds are it's after that date and you have been redirected here by attempting to go to some project on fedorahosted.org. If you are a user of a project formerly hosted at fedorahosted.org, please search for the new home the project you are interested in likely has. If you are a maintainer of a project formerly hosted at fedorahosted.org and need your data to migrate, see below.

## Background

fedorahosted.org was set up in late 2007 as a location to host svn, git, hg, and bzr projects. The trac wiki and issue tracker was used for issues and project planning. Groups for each project were managed in the Fedora Account System, and via a wrapper, scp/sftp uploads of releases was supported. Many of the projects there were closely related to Fedora, but not all of them. For many years fedorahosted thrived.

With the rise of GitHub and the pull request (PR) workflow most new projects moved to other locations. In early 2015, pagure.io came into being. It was a from the ground up implementation of the new git/PR workflow and also hosted by and maintained by Fedora Infrastructure. In early 2016 it became clear that Fedora Infrastructure didn't have resources to keep maintaining both fedorahosted.org and pagure.io and so the announcement was made to retire fedorahosted. Maintainers have had over the last year to migrate their projects to pagure.io or whatever other place they wish.

## Reasons for retirement

* Over the last few years there have been almost 0 new projects added to fedorahosted.org. This shows not much interest by the developer community.
* fedorahosted.org uses trac 0.12 (a Long term release), but upstream is very behind on newer releases. (The next 0.12 bugfix is 18 months behind schedule and the next 1.0 stable is 4 months late as of this writing). Newer trac and all its plugins would need to be packaged for a new release.
* A fair bit of technical debt has piled up over the years:
  + fedorahosted.org is running RHEL6
  + is not in Ansible (our configuration management (CM))
  + isn't distributed in any way
* The 'fedorahosted.org' domain and using fas groups to manage committers has tied fedorahosted.org to Fedora, causing some projects issues.

## General answers

* If you are a maintainer who needs data off the old fedorahosted.org instance, please file an issue in <https://pagure.io/fedora-infrastructure/> with your request. Please be clear what data you want (trac db, git repo, other) and how you want us to get the data to you.
* We are also happy to setup redirects for your project to a new location. Just file an issue in <https://pagure.io/fedora-infrastructure> and we will try and help you out.
* If you are a user of a project formerly at fedorahosted.org, please check <https://pagure.io/> for the project, it may have moved there.
* lists.fedorahosted.org will continue to work and exist for the future.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=700867#c0)  Vincent Danen    2011-04-29 16:23:53 UTC  ``` A flaw was introduced in SSSD 1.5.0 that, under certain conditions, would have sssd overwrite a cached password with the filename of the kerberos credential store (defined by krb5_ccache_template  in sssd.conf).  This could allow an attacker to gain access to an account without knowing the password if they knew the cached-credential string.  This flaw does not affect earlier versions of SSSD that did not have support for automatic ticket renewal services.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=700867#c1)  Vincent Danen    2011-04-29 18:27:44 UTC  ``` Created sssd tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 700891](show_bug.cgi?id=700891 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2011-1758 sssd: automatic TGT renewal overwrites cached password with predicatable filename [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=700867#c2)  Vincent Danen    2011-04-29 18:30:55 UTC  ``` From Stephen Gallagher:  Ok, so here's an explanation of the security implications of this bug.  The automatic ticket renewal service in SSSD operates by providing the active credential cache to the kerberos libraries in order to renew the user's TGT on their behalf by using their existing credentials. Internally, SSSD treats this as a standard authentication, which upon success will update the cached credentials of the user.  The side-effect here is that the user's credentials in the context of this renewal are actually the path to the credential cache file, instead of their real password. So as a result, the user's cached credentials have now become a different string.  The security issue is that this new cached-credential string is now predictable. Another user on the local system would now be capable of logging in as the first user by performing an 'ls /tmp' and seeing what the first user's cache file is called.  The problem gets further complicated if the administrators has modified the SSSD config option 'krb5_ccache_template' to remove the mkstemp() suffix. This would then make the credential cache's name predictable to a network attacker as well.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=700867#c3)  Vincent Danen    2011-04-29 18:31:14 UTC  ``` Note that this issue did not affect sssd packages released with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.0.  This issue was introduced as part of the rebase to newer upstream sssd version which adds support for automatic kerberos TGT renewals.  This issue never affected released non-beta sssd packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, and hence is not handled as security fix for RHEL-6.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=700867#c4)  Vincent Danen    2011-04-29 18:32:03 UTC  ``` Additional references:  <https://fedorahosted.org/sssd/ticket/838> <http://git.fedorahosted.org/git/?p=sssd.git;a=commitdiff;h=fffdae81651b460f3d2c119c56d5caa09b4de42a>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=700867#c5)  Tomas Hoger    2011-04-29 19:26:51 UTC  ``` Announcement of the sssd 1.5.7 release: <https://fedorahosted.org/pipermail/sssd-devel/2011-April/006138.html>   ``` |  |

Subject: vulnerability in sssd 1.5.0+ (CVE-2011-1758)

Hello all.

Anyone shipping sssd 1.5.0 or higher will want to be aware of a flaw
that was found in how it handled cached passwords when renewal kerberos
tickets is enabled (this is a new feature in 1.5.0).  Due to a bug, the
cached password was overwritten with a (moderately) predictable
filename, which could allow a user to authenticate as someone else if
they knew the name of the cache file (under some pretty specific
conditions).

We've assigned the name CVE-2011-1758 to this issue and it is now fixed
upstream.

#### #856 Automatic TGT renewal overwrites cached password Closed: Fixed None Opened 13 years ago by sgallagh.

Closed: Fixed
Reopen Issue

When the internal ticket renewal process runs, it has the Kerberos credential cache saved into the 'authtok' member attribute of the PAM data. So after it successfully renews the ticket, we're saving this value to the cache.

We need to skip updating the cached password if it's happening during automatic ticket renewal.

# fedorahosted.org retirement

## Summary

fedorahosted.org was retired on March 1st, 2017. If you are viewing this page, odds are it's after that date and you have been redirected here by attempting to go to some project on fedorahosted.org. If you are a user of a project formerly hosted at fedorahosted.org, please search for the new home the project you are interested in likely has. If you are a maintainer of a project formerly hosted at fedorahosted.org and need your data to migrate, see below.

## Background

fedorahosted.org was set up in late 2007 as a location to host svn, git, hg, and bzr projects. The trac wiki and issue tracker was used for issues and project planning. Groups for each project were managed in the Fedora Account System, and via a wrapper, scp/sftp uploads of releases was supported. Many of the projects there were closely related to Fedora, but not all of them. For many years fedorahosted thrived.

With the rise of GitHub and the pull request (PR) workflow most new projects moved to other locations. In early 2015, pagure.io came into being. It was a from the ground up implementation of the new git/PR workflow and also hosted by and maintained by Fedora Infrastructure. In early 2016 it became clear that Fedora Infrastructure didn't have resources to keep maintaining both fedorahosted.org and pagure.io and so the announcement was made to retire fedorahosted. Maintainers have had over the last year to migrate their projects to pagure.io or whatever other place they wish.

## Reasons for retirement

* Over the last few years there have been almost 0 new projects added to fedorahosted.org. This shows not much interest by the developer community.
* fedorahosted.org uses trac 0.12 (a Long term release), but upstream is very behind on newer releases. (The next 0.12 bugfix is 18 months behind schedule and the next 1.0 stable is 4 months late as of this writing). Newer trac and all its plugins would need to be packaged for a new release.
* A fair bit of technical debt has piled up over the years:
  + fedorahosted.org is running RHEL6
  + is not in Ansible (our configuration management (CM))
  + isn't distributed in any way
* The 'fedorahosted.org' domain and using fas groups to manage committers has tied fedorahosted.org to Fedora, causing some projects issues.

## General answers

* If you are a maintainer who needs data off the old fedorahosted.org instance, please file an issue in <https://pagure.io/fedora-infrastructure/> with your request. Please be clear what data you want (trac db, git repo, other) and how you want us to get the data to you.
* We are also happy to setup redirects for your project to a new location. Just file an issue in <https://pagure.io/fedora-infrastructure> and we will try and help you out.
* If you are a user of a project formerly at fedorahosted.org, please check <https://pagure.io/> for the project, it may have moved there.
* lists.fedorahosted.org will continue to work and exist for the future.
