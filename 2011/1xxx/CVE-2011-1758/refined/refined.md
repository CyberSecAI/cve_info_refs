Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-1758:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how SSSD (System Security Services Daemon) handled cached passwords during automatic Kerberos ticket renewal. Specifically, during the ticket renewal process, the Kerberos credential cache file's path was inadvertently saved into the `authtok` member attribute of the PAM data. This value was then saved to the user's cached credentials, effectively overwriting the actual password with the file path.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Password Overwrite:** The primary vulnerability is that the user's cached password gets overwritten with the path to the Kerberos credential cache file.
- **Predictable Credential:** The path to the credential cache file was predictable, making the new "password" predictable. The default cache file name includes a `mkstemp()` suffix which provides a degree of randomness but if this suffix was removed from the SSSD configuration, the name would become completely predictable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker, knowing the predictable credential cache path, could potentially gain access to a user's account without knowing the actual password. This could be done by another user on the same system (local attack) if the `mkstemp()` suffix was used or via network attack if not.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** An attacker with local access to the system could exploit this vulnerability if they knew the credential cache path.
- **Network Access:** If the `mkstemp()` suffix was removed from the SSSD configuration option 'krb5_ccache_template', a network attacker could also predict the credential cache's name.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local User:** An attacker needs to be a local user on the system (or to have network access in the specific circumstance above) where the vulnerable SSSD service was running.
- **Knowledge of Credential Cache Path:** The attacker needs to be able to determine the path to the affected user's Kerberos credential cache file.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was introduced in SSSD version 1.5.0, which included automatic ticket renewal.
- The issue was fixed in SSSD version 1.5.7.
- This issue did not affect sssd packages released with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.0.
- The fix involves skipping the update of the cached password during automatic ticket renewal.
