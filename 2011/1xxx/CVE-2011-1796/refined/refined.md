Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-1796:

*   **Vulnerability:** Use-after-free
*   **Location:** Frame handling in WebKit. Specifically, the issue arises when the document element is removed.
*   **Impact:** Likely a crash, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack Vector:** The vulnerability is triggered by a specific sequence of operations involving frame handling, particularly when the document element is removed.
*   **Credit:** Inferno is credited with discovering and reporting this vulnerability.
*   **Root Cause:** The code in `FrameView::calculateScrollbarModesForLayout` could take a code path that doesn't call `applyOverflowToViewport()`. This could result in `m_viewportRenderer` not being reset correctly, leading to a use-after-free condition when the frame is later accessed after being freed.
*   **Fix:** The fix involves resetting `m_viewportRenderer` in `FrameView::calculateScrollbarModesForLayout` to prevent the use-after-free.

The provided information also indicates that this vulnerability was fixed in Chromium browser version 11.0.696.65 and affected Ubuntu versions Lucid, Maverick, Natty, and Oneiric.

The commit message associated with the fix describes a crash scenario triggered when the document element is removed. The fix ensures that the `m_viewportRenderer` is reset to null in `FrameView::calculateScrollbarModesForLayout` to prevent the use-after-free.
