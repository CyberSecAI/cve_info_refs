Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-1146:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of this vulnerability is that several API calls in libvirt did not properly check if a connection was read-only before executing the requested action. This allowed users with read-only connections to potentially modify the state of the system or execute code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper access control: Certain libvirt API calls failed to enforce the read-only status of a connection, allowing unintended write operations on the system.
- Missing checks: The code lacked the necessary checks to verify if the connection was read-only, leading to the execution of privileged operations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): Attackers could exploit the vulnerability to crash the host server by sending crafted input via the vulnerable APIs.
- Potential code execution: The vulnerability could potentially allow the execution of arbitrary code, although this is not explicitly detailed in all the content.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote exploitation: An attacker who is authorized to connect to the libvirt daemon could exploit the vulnerability remotely.
- API calls: The following APIs were identified as vulnerable:
  - `virNodeDeviceDettach`
  - `virNodeDeviceReset`
  - `virDomainRevertToSnapshot`
  - `virDomainSnapshotDelete`
  -  `virNodeDeviceReAttach`
  -  `virConnectDomainXMLToNative`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authorized user: The attacker must be an authorized user with the ability to connect to the libvirt daemon.
- Network access: Network access to the libvirt daemon is required to send malicious requests over the API.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was identified by Petr Matousek from Red Hat Security Response Team.
- Patches were made available for various distributions including openSUSE, Ubuntu, and Debian.
- The vulnerability was addressed in libvirt versions 0.8.8-3 (unstable), 0.8.3-5+squeeze1 (stable), and 0.7.5-5ubuntu27.9 (Ubuntu).
