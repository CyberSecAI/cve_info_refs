Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause of the vulnerability is that WebSphere Application Server was not properly checking the administrator role before allowing access to modify the primary admin ID.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Access Control:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper access controls within the administrative console. Members with an administrator role were incorrectly granted the ability to modify the primary administrator ID.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** By allowing modification of the primary administrator ID by users with a standard administrative role, there's a potential for privilege escalation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Modification:** An attacker with an administrative role could modify the primary administrator ID.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** If the primary admin ID is modified or hijacked, this could lead to a complete compromise of the WebSphere Application Server instance and the applications it hosts.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Administrative Console Access:** The attack vector involves gaining access to the administrative console of WebSphere Application Server with an administrator role.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Compromised Admin Account:** An attacker would need to have an existing administrator role within the WebSphere Application Server.

**Summary of the fix**
*   WebSphere Application Server has been modified to properly check the admin role before allowing access to the primary admin id.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The identified vulnerability is described by APAR PK88606.
*   Fixes are available in WebSphere Application Server versions 6.1.0.31 and 7.0.0.11 and later fixpacks
