Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2011-1760:

**Root Cause:**

The `oprofile` profiling system's control utility, `opcontrol`, fails to properly sanitize user-provided input, specifically within the event argument passed using the `-e` option. This lack of sanitization allows for the injection of shell metacharacters. Additionally, the tool unsafely sources a configuration file where it saves data based on user provided input from the `--vmlinux`, `--session-dir`, and `--xen` options. The `--save` option, combined with `--session-dir`, allows a user to write files to arbitrary locations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Command Injection via `-e` argument:** The `set_event` function in `opcontrol` uses `eval` on the second argument (`$2`) without any sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary commands by including shell metacharacters within the value provided to the `-e` option.
2.  **Unsafe sourcing of configuration file:** The `do_save_setup` function saves multiple values into a shell script (`/root/.oprofile/daemonrc`). This script is later sourced by `do_load_setup`. Because the values are not sanitized, an attacker can inject malicious commands into the script via the `--vmlinux`, `--session-dir` and `--xen` options.
3.  **Directory Traversal via `--save` and `--session-dir`:** The `--save` option moves files within the session directory, but a combination of `--session-dir` and `--save` options allows an attacker to copy a file to an arbitrary location by using relative paths with the `--save` option.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

A local unprivileged user, who is authorized (e.g. via `sudo`) to run the `opcontrol` utility, can leverage these vulnerabilities to:

*   **Escalate Privileges:** Execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the privileged system user (root).
*   **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** Copy and overwrite files to arbitrary locations by combining the `--session-dir` and `--save` options.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Command Injection:** The attacker crafts a malicious input string using shell metacharacters and provides this as the argument to the `-e` option in `opcontrol`. For example: `sudo opcontrol -e "abcd;/usr/bin/id"`
*   **Configuration File Injection:** An attacker can create a malicious file name or path and uses it with the `--vmlinux`, `--session-dir`, or `--xen` options to create a malicious configuration file (`/root/.oprofile/daemonrc`). Any subsequent calls to opcontrol will source this file, executing the injected code. For example: `sudo opcontrol --vmlinux="$HOME/malicious;id"`
*   **Directory Traversal:** An attacker can create a fake 'samples' directory, create a malicious file named `current`, then use a crafted combination of `--session-dir` and `--save` to copy this file to an arbitrary location. For example: `sudo opcontrol --session-dir=/tmp/xxx; sudo opcontrol --save=../../../etc/XXX`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system.
*   **`sudo` or similar authorization for `opcontrol`:** The attacker must have the ability to run `opcontrol` with elevated privileges (e.g., via `sudo`).

**Additional Details:**
The provided content contains a discussion about a patch that was created to address CVE-2011-1760 which sanitized user supplied input with a regex, and then subsequently expands on the other attack vectors and the need to sanitize input to the `--vmlinux`, `--session-dir`, and `--xen` options to prevent further exploitation.
It is also noted that OProfile is not intended to be used with `sudo` and that the best practice is to not grant `sudo` access for the `opcontrol` script to untrusted users.

This vulnerability was present in the `oprofile` packages of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6, Fedora 13 and 14, and Debian (Lenny, Squeeze, Wheezy, and Sid) distributions, and Ubuntu 10.04.
