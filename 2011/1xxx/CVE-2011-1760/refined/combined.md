| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=700883#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-04-29 17:56:09 UTC  ``` It was found that oprofile profiling system did not properly sanitize the content of event argument, provided to oprofile profiling control utility (opcontrol). If a local unprivileged user was authorized by sudoers file to run the opcontrol utility, they could use the flaw to escalate their privileges (execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the privileged system user, root). Different vulnerability than [CVE-2006-0576](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-0576).  References: [1] <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=624212>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=700883#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-04-29 17:58:24 UTC  ``` This issue did not affect the version of the oprofile package, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.  This issue affects the versions of the oprofile package, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.  This issue affects the versions of the oprofile package, as shipped with Fedora release of 13 and 14.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=700883#c3)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-04-29 18:16:18 UTC  ``` CVE Request: [2] <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/04/29/3>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=700883#c4)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2011-05-03 03:30:28 UTC  ``` This has been assigned [CVE-2011-1760](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1760)   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=700883#c6)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2011-05-03 03:35:16 UTC  ``` Created oprofile tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 701508](show_bug.cgi?id=701508 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2011-1760 oprofile: Local privilege escalation via crafted opcontrol event parameter [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=700883#c7)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-05-03 08:33:04 UTC  ``` Original public PoC / scenario from Stephane Chauveau (issue reporter): (from [3] <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=624212#5>)  $ sudo opcontrol -e "abcd;/usr/bin/id" uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root) No such event "abcd"   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=700883#c8)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-05-03 08:34:40 UTC  ``` Stephane also reported [4] two more ways how to exploit this: =============================================================  I just found 2 more ways to execute arbitrary commands via sudo opcontrol  ################# Method 1 ##################  The problem is in the functions do_save_setup() where multiple values  are saved in the shell script /root/.oprofile/daemonrc.  That file is sourced in do_load_setup() by later invocations of opcontrol.  The function do_save_setup() does not sanitize the values and thus  allows do_load_setup() to execute arbitrary commands.  There is even a comment in do_load_setup that indicates that the method  is known to be insecure  Here is a possible method using the --vmlinux option:  (1) create a fake vmlinux file with a 'malformed' name  #  touch "$HOME/abcd;id"  (2) start the oprofile daemon using that vmlinux file. This creates the  daemonrc file  # sudo opcontrol   --vmlinux="$HOME/aaaa;id"  (3) Any invocation of opcontrol will now source the malformed daemonrc  file as root.  # sudo opcontrol   --stop uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root) Daemon not running  (4) The daemonrc file can be cleared with  # sudo opcontrol   --no-vmlinux  The same trick can probably be used with the --session-dir and --xen  options.  ################# Method 2 ##################  The --save=name option is moving samples/current to samples/name in the  current session directory.  A proper combination of  --session-dir and --save can be used to copy a  file to any location.  The following example shows how to create a file /etc/XXX  (1) Create a 'samples' directory  # mkdir -p /tmp/xxx/samples  (2) Create a file named 'current' in that directory  # echo "my_commands" > /tmp/xxx/samples/current  (3) Set the oprofile session directory to the root of the 'samples'  directory  # sudo opcontrol --session-dir=/tmp/xxx  (4)  Execute --save with a path relative to the 'current' file  #  sudo opcontrol --save=../../../etc/XXX  =============================================================  [4] <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=624212#14>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=700883#c9)  William Cohen    2011-05-16 21:29:10 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 499232](attachment.cgi?id=499232&action=diff "0001-Sanitize-Event-Names.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=499232&action=edit "0001-Sanitize-Event-Names.patch") 0001-Sanitize-Event-Names.patch   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=700883#c10)  William Cohen    2011-05-16 21:30:06 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 499233](attachment.cgi?id=499233&action=diff "0002-Ensure-that-save-only-saves-things-in-SESSION_DIR.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=499233&action=edit "0002-Ensure-that-save-only-saves-things-in-SESSION_DIR.patch") 0002-Ensure-that-save-only-saves-things-in-SESSION_DIR.patch   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=700883#c11)  William Cohen    2011-05-16 21:30:46 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 499234](attachment.cgi?id=499234&action=diff "0003-Avoid-blindly-source-SETUP_FILE-with.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=499234&action=edit "0003-Avoid-blindly-source-SETUP_FILE-with.patch") 0003-Avoid-blindly-source-SETUP_FILE-with.patch   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=700883#c12)  William Cohen    2011-05-16 21:31:19 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 499235](attachment.cgi?id=499235&action=diff "0004-Do-additional-checks-on-user-supplied-arguments.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=499235&action=edit "0004-Do-additional-checks-on-user-supplied-arguments.patch") 0004-Do-additional-checks-on-user-supplied-arguments.patch   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=700883#c16)  Vincent Danen    2011-07-07 22:07:24 UTC  ``` Jamie Strandboge noted that one of the patches reverts a change made in the previous patch.  Was it intentional?  Quoting from <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/07/07/6> :  Thanks for these patches. I was reviewing them and noticed that 0003-Avoid-blindly-source-SETUP_FILE-with.patch undoes the 'error_if_not_basename $arg $val' for --save added in 0002-Ensure-that-save-only-saves-things-in-SESSION_DIR.patch such that if you apply all 4 patches, method #2 from the Debian bug[1] is no longer fixed. Attached is a patch to correct this (to be applied after the other 4).  [1] <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=624212#14>   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=700883#c17)  Vincent Danen    2011-07-07 22:10:09 UTC  ``` Sorry, the above comment is probably more pertinent to [CVE-2011-2472](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-2472) than this (although the patch is attached to this bug).   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=700883#c18)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2011-07-29 10:01:08 UTC  ``` OProfile was not designed to work safely with sudo as suggested by upstream at: <http://oprofile.sourceforge.net/faq/>  Fixing this issue is likely to break a lot of use case where opcontrol is started by non-root user via sudo, and make OProfile less usefull. We recommend not to grant sudo access for the opcontrol script to untrusted users.   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=700883#c19)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2011-07-29 10:01:48 UTC  ``` Statement:  Red Hat currently does not plan to address this issue.

Hi Huzaifa,

I have generated some patches to address the CVE. However, I have not yet address the <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=624212#19> related to the "echo do_jitconv > $SESSION_DIR/opd_pipe"

I will send the the patches from my local git branch in a moment.

Any feedback would be appreciated.

-Will

Package        : oprofile
Vulnerability  : command injection
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
Debian bug     : 624212
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-1760

OProfile is a performance profiling tool which is configurable by opcontrol, its
control utility. Stephane Chauveau reported several ways to inject arbitrary
commands in the arguments of this utility. If a local unprivileged user is
authorized by sudoers file to run opcontrol as root, this user could use the
flaw to escalate his privileges.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.3-2+lenny1.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.6-1.1+squeeze1.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.6-1.2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.6-1.2.

We recommend that you upgrade your oprofile packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

Hello,

unless I am missing something, the problem is only with the eval of $2
in set_event.

$1 is fine because it always contains a number that cannot be modified
by the user. If so, a simple patch could be to escape $2:

set_event()
{
    eval "CHOSEN_EVENTS_$1=\$2"
}

Stephane (the original bug reporter)

```

I don't know if this is the best way to fix this issue, but attached is a patch that filters out all but alpha numeric characters and '_'. Feedback on the patch would be appreciated.

Subject: CVE Request -- oprofile -- Local privilege escalation via crafted
 opcontrol event parameter when authorized by sudo

Hello Josh, Steve, vendors,

   It was found that oprofile profiling system did not properly sanitize
the content of event argument, provided to oprofile profiling control
utility (opcontrol). If a local unprivileged user was authorized by
sudoers file to run the opcontrol utility, they could use the flaw
to escalate their privileges (execute arbitrary code with the privileges
of the privileged system user, root). Different vulnerability than
CVE-2006-0576.

Could you allocate a CVE id for this?

Thank you & Regards, Jan.

I'm giving this an ID. oprofile is one of those tools that is likely to be
run as a privileged user.

Please use CVE-2011-1760

Thanks.

Hi,

I did a bisection on oprofile git and found the set_event function in opcontrol in:

<http://oprofile.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=oprofile/oprofile;a=commit;h=6b60be5e370aa8d58bd4fbbc39abd51c90509a31>

The email thread associated with that patch:

<http://marc.info/?l=oprofile-list&m=112293360728638&w=2>

Appears that the eval is being used to simulate arrays:

Subject: arbitrary command execution via sudo opcontrol
Date: Tue, 26 Apr 2011 16:06:43 +0200
```
Package: oprofile
Version: 0.9.6-1.1

I found a way to execute arbitrary commands when using opcontrol via
sudo. I realize that sudoing shell scripts is a bad idea (the oprofile
FAQ discourages the use of sudo) but sudo is nevertheless a common
advice on internet to provide oprofile to a user without giving him full
root-access.

The problem is in the set_event function where the content of $2 is not
checked.

set_event()
{
  eval "CHOSEN_EVENTS_$1=$2"
}

This error can be exploited by injecting commands via the -e option as
in the following example:

$ sudo opcontrol -e "abcd;/usr/bin/id"
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
No such event "abcd"

This is a different vulnerability than
   <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-0576>

Subject: More ways to execute root commands
Date: Tue, 03 May 2011 03:11:28 +0200
```
I just found 2 more ways to execute arbitrary commands via sudo opcontrol

################# Method 1 ##################

The problem is in the functions do_save_setup() where multiple values
are saved in the shell script /root/.oprofile/daemonrc.

That file is sourced in do_load_setup() by later invocations of opcontrol.

The function do_save_setup() does not sanitize the values and thus
allows do_load_setup() to execute arbitrary commands.

There is even a comment in do_load_setup that indicates that the method
is known to be insecure

Here is a possible method using the --vmlinux option:

(1) create a fake vmlinux file with a 'malformed' name

#  touch "$HOME/abcd;id"

(2) start the oprofile daemon using that vmlinux file. This creates the
daemonrc file

# sudo opcontrol   --vmlinux="$HOME/aaaa;id"

(3) Any invocation of opcontrol will now source the malformed daemonrc
file as root.

# sudo opcontrol   --stop
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
Daemon not running

(4) The daemonrc file can be cleared with

# sudo opcontrol   --no-vmlinux

The same trick can probably be used with the --session-dir and --xen
options.

################# Method 2 ##################

The --save=name option is moving samples/current to samples/name in the
current session directory.

A proper combination of  --session-dir and --save can be used to copy a
file to any location.

The following example shows how to create a file /etc/XXX

(1) Create a 'samples' directory

# mkdir -p /tmp/xxx/samples

(2) Create a file named 'current' in that directory

# echo "my_commands" > /tmp/xxx/samples/current

(3) Set the oprofile session directory to the root of the 'samples'
directory

# sudo opcontrol --session-dir=/tmp/xxx

(4)  Execute --save with a path relative to the 'current' file

#  sudo opcontrol --save=../../../etc/XXX

```

Subject: One more method
Date: Tue, 03 May 2011 11:02:54 +0200
```
I do not have a working example yet but I believe that privileges can
also be escalated with the following method.

The problem is the following command in do_dump_data

  echo do_jitconv > $SESSION_DIR/opd_pipe

SESSION_DIR can be controlled by the --session-dir option so a malicious
user could  very well replace the fifo $SESSION_DIR/opd_pipe by a
symbolic link.

In theory it becomes possible to create an arbitrary file containing the
text "do_jitconv"

I am not a security expert but I am pretty sure that this is enough to
obtain root privileges for example by creating a custom entry in
/etc/ld.so.conf.d/

Generally speaking, allowing sudoers to change the oprofile session
directory without any controls is probably a very bad idea. The feature
is probably needed to avoid disk quota issues so an etc configuration
file listing all possible session directories could be the solution.

```

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

# USN-1166-1: OProfile vulnerabilities

11 July 2011

OProfile could be made to run programs as an administrator.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [oprofile](/security/cves?package=oprofile) - System-wide profiler for Linux systems

## Details

Stephane Chauveau discovered that OProfile did not properly perform input

validation when processing arguments to opcontrol. A local user who is

allowed to run opcontrol with privileges could exploit this to run

arbitrary commands as the privileged user. ([CVE-2011-1760](/security/CVE-2011-1760), [CVE-2011-2471](/security/CVE-2011-2471))

Stephane Chauveau discovered a directory traversal vulnerability in

OProfile when processing the --save argument to opcontrol. A local user

could exploit this to overwrite arbitrary files with the privileges of

the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2011-2472](/security/CVE-2011-2472))

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 10.04

* [oprofile](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/oprofile)
  -
  [0.9.6-1ubuntu4.4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/oprofile/0.9.6-1ubuntu4.4)

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=700883#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-04-29 17:56:09 UTC  ``` It was found that oprofile profiling system did not properly sanitize the content of event argument, provided to oprofile profiling control utility (opcontrol). If a local unprivileged user was authorized by sudoers file to run the opcontrol utility, they could use the flaw to escalate their privileges (execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the privileged system user, root). Different vulnerability than [CVE-2006-0576](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-0576).  References: [1] <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=624212>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=700883#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-04-29 17:58:24 UTC  ``` This issue did not affect the version of the oprofile package, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.  This issue affects the versions of the oprofile package, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.  This issue affects the versions of the oprofile package, as shipped with Fedora release of 13 and 14.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=700883#c3)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-04-29 18:16:18 UTC  ``` CVE Request: [2] <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/04/29/3>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=700883#c4)  Huzaifa S.

That file is sourced in do_load_setup() by later invocations of opcontrol.  The function do_save_setup() does not sanitize the values and thus  allows do_load_setup() to execute arbitrary commands.  There is even a comment in do_load_setup that indicates that the method  is known to be insecure  Here is a possible method using the --vmlinux option:  (1) create a fake vmlinux file with a 'malformed' name  #  touch "$HOME/abcd;id"  (2) start the oprofile daemon using that vmlinux file. This creates the  daemonrc file  # sudo opcontrol   --vmlinux="$HOME/aaaa;id"  (3) Any invocation of opcontrol will now source the malformed daemonrc  file as root.  # sudo opcontrol   --stop uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root) Daemon not running  (4) The daemonrc file can be cleared with  # sudo opcontrol   --no-vmlinux  The same trick can probably be used with the --session-dir and --xen  options.  ################# Method 2 ##################  The --save=name option is moving samples/current to samples/name in the  current session directory.  A proper combination of  --session-dir and --save can be used to copy a  file to any location.  The following example shows how to create a file /etc/XXX  (1) Create a 'samples' directory  # mkdir -p /tmp/xxx/samples  (2) Create a file named 'current' in that directory  # echo "my_commands" > /tmp/xxx/samples/current  (3) Set the oprofile session directory to the root of the 'samples'  directory  # sudo opcontrol --session-dir=/tmp/xxx  (4)  Execute --save with a path relative to the 'current' file  #  sudo opcontrol --save=../../../etc/XXX  =============================================================  [4] <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=624212#14>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=700883#c9)  William Cohen    2011-05-16 21:29:10 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 499232](attachment.cgi?id=499232&action=diff "0001-Sanitize-Event-Names.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=499232&action=edit "0001-Sanitize-Event-Names.patch") 0001-Sanitize-Event-Names.patch   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=700883#c10)  William Cohen    2011-05-16 21:30:06 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 499233](attachment.cgi?id=499233&action=diff "0002-Ensure-that-save-only-saves-things-in-SESSION_DIR.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=499233&action=edit "0002-Ensure-that-save-only-saves-things-in-SESSION_DIR.patch") 0002-Ensure-that-save-only-saves-things-in-SESSION_DIR.patch   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=700883#c11)  William Cohen    2011-05-16 21:30:46 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 499234](attachment.cgi?id=499234&action=diff "0003-Avoid-blindly-source-SETUP_FILE-with.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=499234&action=edit "0003-Avoid-blindly-source-SETUP_FILE-with.patch") 0003-Avoid-blindly-source-SETUP_FILE-with.patch   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=700883#c12)  William Cohen    2011-05-16 21:31:19 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 499235](attachment.cgi?id=499235&action=diff "0004-Do-additional-checks-on-user-supplied-arguments.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=499235&action=edit "0004-Do-additional-checks-on-user-supplied-arguments.patch") 0004-Do-additional-checks-on-user-supplied-arguments.patch   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=700883#c16)  Vincent Danen    2011-07-07 22:07:24 UTC  ``` Jamie Strandboge noted that one of the patches reverts a change made in the previous patch.  Was it intentional?  Quoting from <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/07/07/6> :  Thanks for these patches. I was reviewing them and noticed that 0003-Avoid-blindly-source-SETUP_FILE-with.patch undoes the 'error_if_not_basename $arg $val' for --save added in 0002-Ensure-that-save-only-saves-things-in-SESSION_DIR.patch such that if you apply all 4 patches, method #2 from the Debian bug[1] is no longer fixed. Attached is a patch to correct this (to be applied after the other 4).  [1] <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=624212#14>   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=700883#c17)  Vincent Danen    2011-07-07 22:10:09 UTC  ``` Sorry, the above comment is probably more pertinent to [CVE-2011-2472](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-2472) than this (although the patch is attached to this bug).   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=700883#c18)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2011-07-29 10:01:08 UTC  ``` OProfile was not designed to work safely with sudo as suggested by upstream at: <http://oprofile.sourceforge.net/faq/>  Fixing this issue is likely to break a lot of use case where opcontrol is started by non-root user via sudo, and make OProfile less usefull. We recommend not to grant sudo access for the opcontrol script to untrusted users.   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=700883#c19)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2011-07-29 10:01:48 UTC  ``` Statement:  Red Hat currently does not plan to address this issue.
