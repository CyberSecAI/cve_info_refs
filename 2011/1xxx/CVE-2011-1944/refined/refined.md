  "CVE-2011-1944": {
    "Metadata": {
      "CWE": "CWE-190",
      "Description": "An integer overflow flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was found in the way libxml2 parsed certain XPath expressions. If an attacker were able to supply a specially-crafted XML file to an application using libxml2, as well as an XPath expression for that application to run against the crafted file, it could cause the application to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code.",
        "date": "2011-05-27"
    },
    "Analysis": {
      "Root Cause": "Integer overflow leading to heap-based buffer overflow when parsing specific XPath expressions within XML files.",
      "Vulnerabilities": [
        "Heap-based buffer overflow due to an integer overflow"
       ],
      "Impact": "Denial of service (application crash) or arbitrary code execution.",
      "Attack Vectors": [
         "Crafted XML file",
        "Malicious XPath expression"
      ],
      "Required Capabilities": "Ability to provide crafted XML and XPath expression to the vulnerable application.",
     "Additional Information": "The vulnerability is triggered when the application uses libxml2 to parse a crafted XML file with a specific XPath expression. The issue stems from incorrect handling of memory allocation during XPath processing, where a nodeset is grown using a potentially overflowing integer, resulting in an undersized buffer allocation. This can be achieved through network based attacks if the program processes external XML data, or through local files if it processes local XML data."
