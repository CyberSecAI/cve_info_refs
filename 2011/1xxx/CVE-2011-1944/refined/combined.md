# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2015

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2015

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

[Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore *strongly* recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes *without* delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 169 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that a blog entry summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at <https://blogs.oracle.com/security>.

Please note that on October 16, 2014, Oracle released information for  [CVE-2014-3566 "POODLE"](/security-alerts/poodlecve-2014-3566.html) .Customers of affected Oracle products are strongly advised to apply the fixes and/or configuration steps that were announced for CVE-2014-3566 in addition to the fixes announced in this CPU.

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available at:  [https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF).

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in  [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is available  [here](/security-alerts/cpujan2015verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](//cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same**CVE#** in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 2.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS 2.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see  [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the only variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review  [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and how to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update January 2015 Availability Document,  [My Oracle Support Note 1942215.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1942215.1).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/) . We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in  [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1) .Please review the  [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available to customers who have Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/) . Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download patches released through the Critical Patch Update program for products in the Extended Support Phase.

### Appendix - Oracle Java SE

#### Oracle Java SE Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 19 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE. 14 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found  [here](https:///security-alerts/cpujan2015verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Partial" instead of "Complete", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 10.0 becomes 7.5.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 7 and 8 releases.

[My Oracle Support Note 360870.1](https:///https%3A//support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=360870.1) explains the impact of Java security vulnerabilities on Oracle products that include an Oracle Java SE JDK or JRE.

# RHSA-2013:0217 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Important: mingw32-libxml2 security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A0217)

## Topic

Updated mingw32-libxml2 packages that fix several security issues are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6. This advisory also contains
information about future updates for the mingw32 packages, as well as the
deprecation of the packages with the release of Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 6.4.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

These packages provide the libxml2 library, a development toolbox providing
the implementation of various XML standards, for users of MinGW (Minimalist
GNU for Windows).

IMPORTANT NOTE: The mingw32 packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 will no
longer be updated proactively and will be deprecated with the release of
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4. These packages were provided to support other
capabilities in Red Hat Enterprise Linux and were not intended for direct
customer use. Customers are advised to not use these packages with
immediate effect. Future updates to these packages will be at Red Hat's
discretion and these packages may be removed in a future minor release.

A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way libxml2 decoded
entity references with long names. A remote attacker could provide a
specially-crafted XML file that, when opened in an application linked
against libxml2, would cause the application to crash or, potentially,
execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the
application. (CVE-2011-3919)

A heap-based buffer underflow flaw was found in the way libxml2 decoded
certain entities. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted XML
file that, when opened in an application linked against libxml2, would
cause the application to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with
the privileges of the user running the application. (CVE-2012-5134)

It was found that the hashing routine used by libxml2 arrays was
susceptible to predictable hash collisions. Sending a specially-crafted
message to an XML service could result in longer processing time, which
could lead to a denial of service. To mitigate this issue, randomization
has been added to the hashing function to reduce the chance of an attacker
successfully causing intentional collisions. (CVE-2012-0841)

Multiple flaws were found in the way libxml2 parsed certain XPath (XML Path
Language) expressions. If an attacker were able to supply a
specially-crafted XML file to an application using libxml2, as well as an
XPath expression for that application to run against the crafted file, it
could cause the application to crash. (CVE-2010-4008, CVE-2010-4494,
CVE-2011-2821, CVE-2011-2834)

Two heap-based buffer overflow flaws were found in the way libxml2 decoded
certain XML files. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted XML
file that, when opened in an application linked against libxml2, would
cause the application to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with
the privileges of the user running the application. (CVE-2011-0216,
CVE-2011-3102)

An integer overflow flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was
found in the way libxml2 parsed certain XPath expressions. If an attacker
were able to supply a specially-crafted XML file to an application using
libxml2, as well as an XPath expression for that application to run against
the crafted file, it could cause the application to crash or, possibly,
execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2011-1944)

An out-of-bounds memory read flaw was found in libxml2. A remote attacker
could provide a specially-crafted XML file that, when opened in an
application linked against libxml2, would cause the application to crash.
(CVE-2011-3905)

Red Hat would like to thank the Google Security Team for reporting the
CVE-2010-4008 issue. Upstream acknowledges Bui Quang Minh from Bkis as the
original reporter of CVE-2010-4008.

All users of mingw32-libxml2 are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which contain backported patches to correct these issues.

## Solution

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=709747#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-06-01 14:46:56 UTC  ``` An integer overflow, leading to heap-based buffer overflow was found in the way libxml, XML files manipulation library, processed certain XPath expressions. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted XML file, which once opened in an application linked against libxml would cause that application to crash, or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.

# USN-1153-1: libxml2 vulnerability

16 June 2011

libxml2 could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it opened a
specially crafted file.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 11.04](/security/notices?release=natty)
* [Ubuntu 10.10](/security/notices?release=maverick)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)

## Packages

* [libxml2](/security/cves?package=libxml2) - GNOME XML library

## Details

Chris Evans discovered that libxml2 incorrectly handled memory allocation.

If an application using libxml2 opened a specially crafted XML file, an

attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly execute code as the

user invoking the program.

### libxml vulnerability and interesting integer issues

A while ago, I was playing with grammar-based XPath fuzzing and I found and fixed an interesting libxml bug. The commit, for the curious, is here:

<http://git.gnome.org/browse/libxml2/commit/?id=d7958b21e7f8c447a26bb2436f08402b2c308be4>

The trigger for this bug was the XPath expression: `//@*/preceding::node()/ancestor::node()/ancestor::foo['foo']` which for some reason I haven't yet analyzed leads to a pathologically large collection of nodes within libxml.

As the nodeset is grown and grown, things get interesting when the system runs out of memory whilst trying to double the size of the nodeset:
```

        cur->nodeMax *= 2;
        temp = (xmlNodePtr *) xmlRealloc(cur->nodeTab, cur->nodeMax *
                                         sizeof(xmlNodePtr));
        if (temp == NULL) {
            xmlXPathErrMemory(NULL, "growing nodeset\n");
            return;
        }
        cur->nodeTab = temp;

```

Notice how the max number of allocated nodes in the "cur" structure is doubled *before* doing, checking and assigning the reallocation. This means that in the event of a realloc() failure, one of two things will happen:

* If you malloc() implementation exits the process upon alloc failure (such as Chromium), lucky you! You dodged a bullet.

* More typically, you'll exit this function with "cur" in an inconsistent state, i.e. it indicates it can hold more data than it really can.

Despite the call to xmlXPathErrMemory(), XPath processing continues with "cur" in an inconsistent state, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.

The fix is to only update the structure's "max size" member after a successful expansion of the underlying array. libxml already did this in most places, using a paradigm such as:
```

        temp = (xmlNodePtr *) xmlRealloc(cur->nodeTab, cur->nodeMax * 2 *
                                         sizeof(xmlNodePtr));
        if (temp == NULL) {
            xmlXPathErrMemory(NULL, "growing nodeset\n");
            return;
        }
        cur->nodeMax *= 2;
        cur->nodeTab = temp;

```

... which leads us nicely into part 2:

**Interesting integer issues**

Even with the fix applied, there are some really interesting integer issues going on here. The astute will have noticed a possible integer overflow in the argument to xmlRealloc(), which is a general hazard with the common pattern of "double the size of the array if we ran out of room". Digging in to more detail, we see a fascinating difference in behaviour between 32-bit and 64-bit builds and maybe even learn a thing or two about integer promotion rules.

On 32-bit builds

First, let's quickly note that `cur->nodeMax` is of type `int`. That's likely the wrong type for a couple of reasons, but we will run with it for our analysis.
On 32-bit, sizeof(int) == sizeof(size\_t) so we're looking at a fairly basic possible integer overflow. But can it ever be triggered? Does the 32-bit address space offer enough room?
The case with the least space requirements for the 32-bit address space is the case where we already have a 2GB (2^31) allocation and are attempting to double it -- leading to an integer overflow at 2^32 and an attempt to realloc() to 0 bytes.
But to arrive at the 2^31 allocation, we need to have a 1GB -> 2GB realloc() succeed first.
This is actually unlikely on 32-bit Linux -- which typically has just the lower 3GB of address space usable. 1GB + 2GB + program text etc. won't simultaneously fit, so the only way 1GB -> 2GB realloc() will succeed is if the allocation can be expanded in-place. glibc malloc() will typically use mmap() for large allocations, and put them towards the top of address space in order to reserve room for standard heap expansion. So realloc() on such an mmap()ed chunk typically won't have room to mremap() to a larger size.
All in all, this seems to be a hard-to-exploit bug, unless the attacker has a lot of control over other allocations (to influence the placement of the 1GB mmap() lower down in the address space and then free() whatever chunks were needed to do that, before the realloc()). Further research might be merited for other allocators (e.g. tcmalloc) and 32-bit-process-on-64-bit-host (>3GB address space available).

On 64-bit builds

With 64-bit, we have a much larger address space. This means that we should be able to successfully allocate the growing array -- and the objects contained within it -- right up until the fault condition.

The fault condition is that `cur->nodeMax * 2` will eventually become negative. This negative `int` is then multiplied by `sizeof(xmlNodePtr)`. **Remember that sizeof() returns a size\_t, so we have an int -> size\_t promotion at this point**. This will result in sign-extension to a 64-bit size, which will end up massive and the system allocator will not be able to satisfy an allocation of that size. Therefore, a lucky lack of impact on 64-bit.

Finally, note that there's a real subtlety in the ordering of the expression given to xmlMalloc():
```

cur->nodeMax * 2 * sizeof(xmlNodePtr)

```

Things would be very different if we had:
```

cur->nodeMax * sizeof(xmlNodePtr) * 2

```

Promotions for left-to-right operator sequences are done in strict left-to-right ordering, as opposed to some kind of overall max(precedence) promotion. Therefore, in this latter case, the initial negative-related failure will be avoided; we're looking at:
```

(int) 2^30 -> (int) -(2^31) -> (size_t) 0xffffffff80000000 * 8 == (size_t) 0xfffffffc00000000
vs.
(int) 2^30 -> (size_t) 2^30 * 8 -> (size_t) 2^30 * 8 * 2 == (size_t) 2^34

```

Seeing that `nodeNr` is just an `int`, we would likely see subsequent memory corruption if `nodeNr` goes subsequently negative after its increment in a statement such as `cur->nodeTab[cur->nodeNr++] = xmlXPathNodeSetDupNs(node, ns);`

Package        : libxml2
Vulnerability  : buffer overflow
Problem type   : local (remote)
Debian-specific: no
Debian Bug     : 628537

Chris Evans discovered that libxml was vulnerable to buffer overflows,
which allowed a crafted XML input file to potentially execute arbitrary
code.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.6.32.dfsg-5+lenny4.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.7.8.dfsg-2+squeeze1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.7.8.dfsg-3.

We recommend that you upgrade your libxml2 packages.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=709747#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-06-01 14:46:56 UTC  ``` An integer overflow, leading to heap-based buffer overflow was found in the way libxml, XML files manipulation library, processed certain XPath expressions. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted XML file, which once opened in an application linked against libxml would cause that application to crash, or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=724906#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-07-22 09:34:21 UTC  ``` Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures assigned an identifier [CVE-2011-0216](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-0216) to the following vulnerability:  Off-by-one error in libxml in Apple Safari before 5.0.6 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer overflow and application crash) via a crafted web site.  References: [1] <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-0216> [2] <http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4808> [3] <http://lists.apple.com/archives/security-announce/2011//Jul/msg00002.html>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=724906#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-07-22 09:37:22 UTC  ``` Unfortunately right now we don't have further information about this flaw, than it is listed above. Thus not sure, if this flaw might be applicable to libxml / libxml2 / mingw32-libxml2 package versions, as shipped across different Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Fedora products.  We have contacted Apple Security Team to provide further details about this issue and once they are provided, this Red Hat Bugzilla issue tracking system entry will be updated accordingly.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=724906#c5)  Paul Howarth    2011-08-04 06:30:03 UTC  ``` What about libxml? Are there more details of this vulnerability posted somewhere?   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=724906#c18)  Kai Tietz    2011-08-23 10:28:32 UTC  ``` As far as I understood is this CVE not affecting our libxml2 version.  Are any more details for this?  Or is this CVE something to close?

Are any > more details for this?  Or is this CVE something to close?  According to [Comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=724906#c4) it doesn't affect libxml2. However, we still don't know yet if it affects libxml.   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=724906#c21)  Tomas Hoger    2011-11-16 09:50:12 UTC  ``` Upstream commit: <http://git.gnome.org/browse/libxml2/commit/?id=69f04562f75212bfcabecd190ea8b06ace28ece2>   ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=724906#c23)  Paul Howarth    2011-11-16 18:51:33 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #21](show_bug.cgi?id=724906#c21)) > Upstream commit: > <http://git.gnome.org/browse/libxml2/commit/?id=69f04562f75212bfcabecd190ea8b06ace28ece2>  I don't see any code like that in libxml's encoding.c so I guess that's not vulnerable?   ```  [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=724906#c24)  Daniel Veillard    2011-11-18 08:34:37 UTC  ``` In what version of encoding.c did you look ? Because that bug has been around forever ... if you mean libxml as libxml version1, then yes it's likely to not have that code, it's more than 10 years old, and I don't think the support for iconv was plugged yet at the time of renaming to libxml2. But any recent version of libxml (i.e. libxml2) is affected.

Yes, I did mean libxml as libxml version1; it's still in Fedora at the moment.   ```  [Comment 26](show_bug.cgi?id=724906#c26)  Daniel Veillard    2011-11-18 14:05:22 UTC  ``` urgh that should have been deprecated for ages ...

They suggest that Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5 and 6. As well as Fedora release 14, 15 and 16 are affected by this flaw.   ```  [Comment 32](show_bug.cgi?id=724906#c32)  Huzaifa S.
