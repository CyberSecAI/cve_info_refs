## HP Data Protector Backup Client Service EXEC\_INTEGUTIL Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-11-147ZDI-CAN-1174

| CVE ID | [CVE-2011-1731](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-1731) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 10.0, [AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=2.0&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [Hewlett-Packard](http://www.hp.com/) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | [Data Protector](http://h71028.www7.hp.com/enterprise/w1/en/software/information-management-data-protector.html) |
| TREND MICRO CUSTOMER PROTECTION | Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID ['11132']. For further product information on the TippingPoint IPS: <http://www.tippingpoint.com> |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of HP OpenView Data Protector. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.  This specific flaw exists in the Backup Client Service (OmniInet.exe). The Backup Client Service listens on TCP port 5555 for communications between systems in the cell. The process has insufficient bounds checking on user-supplied data in a fixed-length buffer on the stack. Remote, unauthenticated attackers can exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed EXEC\_INTEGUTIL message packets to the target, which could ultimately lead to arbitrary code execution under the context of the SYSTEM user. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | Hewlett-Packard has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at:  <http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bizsupport/TechSupport/Document.jsp?objectID=c02810240> |
| DISCLOSURE TIMELINE | * 2011-04-04 - Vulnerability reported to vendor * 2011-04-29 - Coordinated public release of advisory |
