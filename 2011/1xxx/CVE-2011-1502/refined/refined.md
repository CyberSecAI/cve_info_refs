Based on the provided content, here's the analysis for CVE-2011-1502:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper processing of XML external entities (XXE) in Liferay Portal version 6.0.6.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The core weakness is an XXE vulnerability which allows an attacker to inject malicious XML that can be parsed to disclose arbitrary files from the server.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to achieve arbitrary file disclosure on the affected Liferay server.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves injecting malicious XML containing external entity declarations that the Liferay server processes, thus disclosing local files.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be able to provide malicious XML content that will be processed by the Liferay server. The content suggests that this involves exploiting the processing of XSLT, which implies the attacker would likely interact with an endpoint that processes XSL/XML content.
