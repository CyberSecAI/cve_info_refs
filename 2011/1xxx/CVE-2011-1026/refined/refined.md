Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-1026:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The application does not properly check the origin of requests, allowing an attacker to perform actions on behalf of a logged-in user through specially crafted web pages.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The vulnerability is a classic CSRF issue, stemming from the lack of proper origin verification for requests performing actions in the application.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   An attacker can perform actions on the vulnerable Archiva application with the same privileges as the targeted user who is logged in. This could include actions like modifying configurations or manipulating data within the application, depending on the user's role.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The attack vector involves enticing a logged-in user (typically an administrator) to visit a malicious webpage. This page contains a hidden `<img>` tag (or other methods) pointing to a vulnerable URL within the Archiva application, which triggers the action without the user's knowledge.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious HTML page.
*   The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user to access this malicious page.
*   No direct access to the Archiva server is required for exploitation.

**Additional Details:**

*   The security advisory notes that an attacker can embed a malicious image tag (e.g., `<img src=vulnurl width=0 height=0 />`) within an HTML page to exploit this vulnerability.

* The vulnerability affects Apache Archiva versions 1.3 to 1.3.4, as well as older unsupported versions (1.0 to 1.2.2).
