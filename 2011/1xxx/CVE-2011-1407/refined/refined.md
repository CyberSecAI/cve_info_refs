Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-1407:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) processing code of Exim. Specifically, it involves how Exim handles DKIM identities. The issue arises due to improper handling of input strings within the `match_isinlist()` function when processing the DKIM signature.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** By crafting a malicious email with a specially formatted DKIM identity, an attacker can inject commands that are then executed by the Exim process. The vulnerability stems from using a function intended for list matching (`match_isinlist()`) for simple string matching, which allows for the injection of lookup items and potential command execution.
- **Command Injection:** The vulnerability allows attackers to inject commands through manipulated DKIM data, leading to remote code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server. The code runs with the privileges of the Exim user. This can result in a full compromise of the mail server, data breaches, and other malicious activities.
- **System Compromise:**  An attacker could potentially gain control of the affected system due to the ability to execute arbitrary code.
- **Tripping IDS Systems:** While the injected commands might not be directly included in emails or logs, the crafted input will cause the system to perform unintended actions, tripping Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS).

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:**  The attack is performed remotely by sending a specially crafted email message to an Exim server.
- **Email with Malicious DKIM Identity:** The attacker crafts an email that includes a malicious DKIM signature/identity which exploits the vulnerable code during DKIM verification.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send emails to the vulnerable Exim server.
- **Email Sending Capability:**  The attacker must be able to send emails with DKIM signatures.
- **Understanding of DKIM Structure:** The attacker needs knowledge of the DKIM protocol to craft the malicious DKIM identity that triggers the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in Exim versions 4.70 up to and including 4.75.
- Debian's default Exim configuration does not expose the vulnerability directly, but specific configurations could.
- A temporary workaround was suggested (disabling DKIM verification) before the full patch was released in version 4.76
- This CVE is related to the Exim security release that also addressed CVE-2011-1764, a format string vulnerability in the same DKIM code.
