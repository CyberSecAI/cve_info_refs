  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE": "CVE-2011-1171",
    "description": "Structures ipt_replace, compat_ipt_replace, and xt_get_revision are copied from userspace. Fields of these structs that are zero-terminated strings are not checked. When they are used as argument to a format string containing \"%s\" in request_module(), some sensitive information is leaked to userspace via argument of spawned modprobe process.",
    "affected_component": "ipv4: netfilter: ip_tables",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the fact that the Linux kernel's netfilter module copies structures, including ipt_replace, compat_ipt_replace, and xt_get_revision, from user space without properly validating zero-terminated strings within them. When these strings are used in format strings within the request_module() function, sensitive kernel memory can be leaked.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Input Validation",
      "Information Leakage",
      "Use of unchecked user-supplied data in format strings"
    ],
    "impact": "The impact of this vulnerability is an information leak to user space. Specifically, an attacker with CAP_NET_ADMIN capabilities can potentially gain access to sensitive kernel memory by crafting malicious strings in the structure that is copied from userspace.",
     "attack_vector": "Local",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to have the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability to exploit this vulnerability. This capability allows the attacker to perform network administration tasks, including manipulating firewall rules, which are related to the vulnerable functions."
