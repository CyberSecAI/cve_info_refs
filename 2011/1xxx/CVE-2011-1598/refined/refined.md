{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Missing validation check in the `bcm_release()` function within the Linux kernel's Controller Area Network (CAN) implementation.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Missing input validation",
      "NULL pointer dereference"
    ],
    "impact": "A local, unprivileged user could cause a denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Local access",
      "Unprivileged user"
    ],
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability occurs when a NULL socket argument is passed from userspace to the `bcm_release()` function. This results in a NULL pointer dereference and a subsequent denial of service. The fix involves adding a check to handle the NULL socket argument."
