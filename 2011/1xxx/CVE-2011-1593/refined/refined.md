## Analysis of CVE-2011-1593

Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-1593:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `next_pidmap()` function in the Linux kernel had a signedness issue when handling the `last` parameter. This function is used to find the next available PID. When a negative value was passed as `last`, the function did not properly handle the sign extension.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Signedness Error:** The `next_pidmap()` function did not properly check or sanitize the `last` parameter, leading to a sign extension when calculating the `map` pointer.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The `f_pos` value within the `/proc` filesystem was not validated, allowing a negative value to be passed to `next_pidmap()`.
- **Incorrect Pointer Calculation:** When a negative `last` parameter was processed, it lead to invalid pointer calculation `map = &pid_ns->pidmap[(last + 1)/BITS_PER_PAGE]` due to sign extension.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Kernel Panic:** The incorrect pointer calculation could cause a general protection fault (GP) because the resulting memory access was out-of-bounds, leading to a kernel crash and denial of service (DoS).
- **Privilege Escalation** While not directly mentioned in the official description, the incorrect pointer calculation may have the potential to read or write kernel memory resulting in privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local:** A local attacker could exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the file offset (`f_pos`) within the `/proc` filesystem. Specifically, setting it to a negative value by using syscalls such as `lseek64`, `readdir()`, or `getdents()` while accessing `/proc`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system.
- **Ability to Use System Calls:** The attacker needs to be able to use system calls to open and manipulate file descriptors, such as open, lseek, and getdents, to cause the vulnerable code to be executed.
- **No Special Privileges:** Initially the attacker did not need elevated privileges, but the vulnerability was exploited due to an invalid offset and memory access.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability primarily affects the x86_64 architecture and appears to not affect other architectures like ppc64, s390x, and ia64.
- The vulnerability can be triggered using the `getdents` or `readdir` system calls.
- The vulnerability was reported by Robert Święcki and analyzed with help from Tavis Ormandy, which is acknowledged in the Red Hat Bugzilla entry.
- The fix involves validation of the `last` parameter, which ensures a valid memory access.
