I'm surprised by the discrepancy between this oops, and kdb memory dump:

From oops/kdb (from address 0xffffffff810ac3a1 which is start of next\_pidmap)
Code: 0f 1f 44 00 00 ff c6 49 89 fc 89 f2 4c 8d af 08 08 00 00 48....

From objdump vmlinux (the same address)
Code: e8 1a 88 e7 00 ff c6 49 89 fc 89 f2 4c 8d af 08 08 00 00 48...

Which decodes to

kdb:

0: 0f 1f 44 00 00 nopl 0x0(%rax,%rax,1)
5: ff c6 inc %esi
7: 49 89 fc mov %rdi,%r12
a: 89 f2 mov %esi,%edx
c: 4c 8d af 08 08 00 00 lea 0x808(%rdi),%r13

vmlinux:

ffffffff810ac3a1: e8 1a 88 e7 00 callq ffffffff81f24bc0 <mcount>

ffffffff810ac3a6: ff c6 inc %esi

ffffffff810ac3a8: 49 89 fc mov %rdi,%r12

ffffffff810ac3ab: 89 f2 mov %esi,%edx

ffffffff810ac3ad: 4c 8d af 08 08 00 00 lea 0x808(%rdi),%r13

Might this difference (nopl 0x0(%rax,%rax,1) vs callq
ffffffff81f24bc0 <mcount> at 0xffffffff810ac3a1) be some kind of
kernel instrumentation (ftrace, perf or so), or a symptom of a bug
(overwritten memory)?

Might it be unsigned (2405651902) vs signed (-1889315394) problem? The
map is counted as

map = &pid\_ns->pidmap[(last + 1)/BITS\_PER\_PAGE];

so

Yup:

int proc\_pid\_readdir(struct file \* filp, void \* dirent, filldir\_t filldir)
{
 unsigned int nr = filp->f\_pos - FIRST\_PROCESS\_ENTRY;
..
 for (; nr < ARRAY\_SIZE(proc\_base\_stuff); filp->f\_pos++, nr++) {
..
 }

ns = filp->f\_dentry->d\_sb->s\_fs\_info;
 iter.task = NULL;
 iter.tgid = filp->f\_pos - TGID\_OFFSET;
..

There's no test to validate f\_pos. If it's out of bounds, the "for"
just doesn't run.

Subject: CVE request -- kernel: proc: signedness issue in next_pidmap()

"A signedness issue has been found in next_pidmap() function when the "last"
parameter is negative as next_pidmap() just quietly accepted whatever
"last" pid that was passed in, which is not all that safe when one of the
users is /proc.

Setting f_pos to negative value when accessing /proc via readdir()/getdents()
resulted in sign extension of this value when map pointer was being
constructed.

This later lead to #GP because the final pointer was not canonical (x86_64)."

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

## Details

Kees Cook discovered that some ethtool functions did not correctly clear

heap memory. A local attacker with CAP\_NET\_ADMIN privileges could exploit

this to read portions of kernel heap memory, leading to a loss of privacy.

([CVE-2010-4655](/security/CVE-2010-4655))

Kees Cook discovered that the IOWarrior USB device driver did not correctly

check certain size fields. A local attacker with physical access could plug

in a specially crafted USB device to crash the system or potentially gain

root privileges. ([CVE-2010-4656](/security/CVE-2010-4656))

Goldwyn Rodrigues discovered that the OCFS2 filesystem did not correctly

clear memory when writing certain file holes. A local attacker could

exploit this to read uninitialized data from the disk, leading to a loss of

privacy. ([CVE-2011-0463](/security/CVE-2011-0463))

Jens Kuehnel discovered that the InfiniBand driver contained a race

condition. On systems using InfiniBand, a local attacker could send

specially crafted requests to crash the system, leading to a denial of

service. ([CVE-2011-0695](/security/CVE-2011-0695))

Rafael Dominguez Vega discovered that the caiaq Native Instruments USB

driver did not correctly validate string lengths. A local attacker with

physical access could plug in a specially crafted USB device to crash the

system or potentially gain root privileges. ([CVE-2011-0712](/security/CVE-2011-0712))

Timo Warns discovered that LDM partition parsing routines did not correctly

calculate block counts. A local attacker with physical access could plug in

a specially crafted block device to crash the system, leading to a denial

of service. ([CVE-2011-1012](/security/CVE-2011-1012))

Timo Warns discovered that the LDM disk partition handling code did not

correctly handle certain values. By inserting a specially crafted disk

device, a local attacker could exploit this to gain root privileges.

([CVE-2011-1017](/security/CVE-2011-1017))

Tavis Ormandy discovered that the pidmap function did not correctly handle

large requests. A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system,

leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-1593](/security/CVE-2011-1593))

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=697822#c0)  Petr Matousek    2011-04-19 11:42:20 UTC  ``` A signedness issue has been found in next_pidmap() function when the "last" parameter is negative as next_pidmap() just quietly accepted whatever "last" pid that was passed in, which is not all that safe when one of the users is /proc.

Setting f_pos to negative value when accessing /proc via readdir()/getdents() resulted in sign extension of this value when map pointer was being constructed.  This later lead to #GP becasue the final pointer was not cannonical (x86_64).  map = &pid_ns->pidmap[(last + 1)/BITS_PER_PAGE];  ffffffff810ac3b4:       48 63 f6                movslq %esi,%rsi      <- sign extension (f_pos+-)  ffffffff810ac3b7:       81 e2 ff 7f 00 00       and    $0x7fff,%edx   ffffffff810ac3bd:       48 c1 ee 0f             shr    $0xf,%rsi  ffffffff810ac3c1:       48 c1 e6 04             shl    $0x4,%rsi  ffffffff810ac3c5:       48 8d 5c 37 08          lea    0x8(%rdi,%rsi,1),%rbx    ... if (unlikely(!map->page))   ffffffff810ac3cc:       48 8b 7b 08             mov    0x8(%rbx),%rdi <- #GP  Only x86_64 architecture seems to be vulnerable to this particular issue (tested ppc64, s390x, ia64).

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=698996#c0)  Petr Matousek    2011-04-22 15:16:48 UTC  ``` pg_start is copied from userspace on AGPIOC_BIND and AGPIOC_UNBIND ioctl cmds of agp_ioctl() and passed to agpioc_bind_wrap().  As said in the comment, (pg_start + mem->page_count) may wrap in case of AGPIOC_BIND, and it is not checked at all in case of AGPIOC_UNBIND.  As a result, user with sufficient privileges (usually "video" group) may generate either local DoS or privilege escalation.  Reference and patch: <https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/4/14/293>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=698996#c4)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2011-04-25 02:46:50 UTC  ``` Upstream commit: <http://git.kernel.org/linus/194b3da873fd334ef183806db751473512af29ce>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=698996#c5)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2011-04-25 02:48:41 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue affects the versions of Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise 4, 5, 6, and Red Hat Enterprise MRG. This has been addressed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and Red Hat Enterprise MRG via <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0927.html>, <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-1350.html>, and <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-1253.html>. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 is now in Production 3 of the maintenance life-cycle, <https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/>, therefore the fix for this issue is not currently planned to be included in the future updates.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=698996#c6)  Vincent Danen    2011-05-09 19:59:52 UTC  ``` MITRE has assigned an additional CVE name to this issue ([CVE-2011-2022](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-2022)), the following is the description of both flaws.  Note that because the same git commit corrects both flaws, I'm not filing a second bug (as it is unlikely we would fix one and not the other).  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures assigned an identifier [CVE-2011-1745](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1745) to the following vulnerability:  Name: [CVE-2011-1745](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1745) URL: <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-1745> Assigned: 20110419 Reference: <https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/4/14/293> Reference: <http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/04/21/4> Reference: <http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/04/22/7> Reference: <http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=194b3da873fd334ef183806db751473512af29ce> Reference: <http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/ChangeLog-2.6.38.5> Reference: [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=698996](show_bug.cgi?id=698996 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2011-1745 CVE-2011-2022 kernel: agp: insufficient pg_start parameter checking in AGPIOC_BIND and AGPIOC_UNBIND ioctls")  Integer overflow in the agp_generic_insert_memory function in drivers/char/agp/generic.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.38.5 allows local users to gain privileges or cause a denial of service (system crash) via a crafted AGPIOC_BIND agp_ioctl ioctl call.

## Synopsis

Important: kernel security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2011%3A0927)

## Topic

Updated kernel packages that fix multiple security issues and several bugs
are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

This update fixes the following security issues:

* An integer overflow flaw in ib\_uverbs\_poll\_cq() could allow a local,

unprivileged user to cause a denial of service or escalate their
privileges. (CVE-2010-4649, Important)

* A race condition in the way new InfiniBand connections were set up could

allow a remote user to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2011-0695,
Important)

* A flaw in the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) implementation

could allow a remote attacker to cause a denial of service if the sysctl
"net.sctp.addip\_enable" variable was turned on (it is off by default).
(CVE-2011-1573, Important)

* Flaws in the AGPGART driver implementation when handling certain IOCTL

commands could allow a local, unprivileged user to cause a denial of
service or escalate their privileges. (CVE-2011-1745, CVE-2011-2022,
Important)

* An integer overflow flaw in agp\_allocate\_memory() could allow a local,

unprivileged user to cause a denial of service or escalate their
privileges. (CVE-2011-1746, Important)

* A flaw allowed napi\_reuse\_skb() to be called on VLAN (virtual LAN)

packets. An attacker on the local network could trigger this flaw by
sending specially-crafted packets to a target system, possibly causing a
denial of service. (CVE-2011-1576, Moderate)

* An integer signedness error in next\_pidmap() could allow a local,

unprivileged user to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2011-1593, Moderate)

* A flaw in the way the Xen hypervisor implementation handled CPUID

instruction emulation during virtual machine exits could allow an
unprivileged guest user to crash a guest. This only affects systems that
have an Intel x86 processor with the Intel VT-x extension enabled.
(CVE-2011-1936, Moderate)

* A flaw in inet\_diag\_bc\_audit() could allow a local, unprivileged user to

cause a denial of service (infinite loop). (CVE-2011-2213, Moderate)

* A missing initialization flaw in the XFS file system implementation

could lead to an information leak. (CVE-2011-0711, Low)

* A flaw in ib\_uverbs\_poll\_cq() could allow a local, unprivileged user to

cause an information leak. (CVE-2011-1044, Low)

* A missing validation check was found in the signals implementation. A

local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to send signals via the
sigqueueinfo system call, with the si\_code set to SI\_TKILL and with spoofed
process and user IDs, to other processes. Note: This flaw does not allow
existing permission checks to be bypassed; signals can only be sent if your
privileges allow you to already do so. (CVE-2011-1182, Low)

* A heap overflow flaw in the EFI GUID Partition Table (GPT) implementation

could allow a local attacker to cause a denial of service by mounting a
disk containing specially-crafted partition tables. (CVE-2011-1776, Low)

* Structure padding in two structures in the Bluetooth implementation

was not initialized properly before being copied to user-space, possibly
allowing local, unprivileged users to leak kernel stack memory to
user-space. (CVE-2011-2492, Low)

Red Hat would like to thank Jens Kuehnel for reporting CVE-2011-0695;
Vasiliy Kulikov for reporting CVE-2011-1745, CVE-2011-2022, and
CVE-2011-1746; Ryan Sweat for reporting CVE-2011-1576; Robert Swiecki for
reporting CVE-2011-1593; Dan Rosenberg for reporting CVE-2011-2213 and
CVE-2011-0711; Julien Tinnes of the Google Security Team for reporting
CVE-2011-1182; Timo Warns for reporting CVE-2011-1776; and Marek Kroemeke
and Filip Palian for reporting CVE-2011-2492.

Bug fix documentation will be available shortly from the Technical Notes
document linked to in the References.

Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported
patches to correct these issues, and fix the bugs noted in the Technical
Notes. The system must be rebooted for this update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/kb/docs/DOC-11259>

To install kernel packages manually, use "rpm -ivh [package]". Do not
use "rpm -Uvh" as that will remove the running kernel binaries from
your system. You may use "rpm -e" to remove old kernels after
determining that the new kernel functions properly on your system.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.
