  "cve": "CVE-2011-1979",
  "description": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Microsoft Visio validates objects in memory when parsing specially crafted Visio files. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less affected than users who operate with administrative user rights.",
  "information": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by improper validation of objects in memory when parsing specially crafted Visio files.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Remote Code Execution"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can gain complete control of the affected system, install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Opening a specially crafted Visio file",
      "E-mail attack scenario",
        "Web-based attack scenario"
     ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a specially crafted Visio file and convince a user to open the file. In a web-based attack, the attacker needs to host a website with this file or inject it into a compromised website."
