Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2011-1526:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a combination of two flaws in the `krb5-appl` package's GSS-API FTP daemon:
    1.  **Missing autoconf tests:** The configure script for `krb5-appl` omitted necessary checks for `setegid()` and related functions, resulting in the `krb5_setegid()` macro always failing.
    2.  **Lack of error checking:** The FTP daemon failed to check the return value of `krb5_setegid()`. This caused it to silently continue execution even when it failed to set the effective group ID (EGID).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Privilege Dropping:** The FTP daemon failed to properly drop its initial effective group ID (often root/GID 0).
*   **Silent Failure:** The failure of `krb5_setegid()` was not detected or handled, leaving the FTP process with its original, elevated privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized File Access:** Authenticated remote users could gain read or write access to files with a group ownership matching the initial EGID of the FTP daemon (typically root), bypassing intended file access restrictions.
*   **Potential Privilege Escalation:** While not a traditional privilege escalation, the ability to access and modify files owned by the root group represents a significant security risk, as it could lead to system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Exploitation:** The vulnerability is exploitable by a remote attacker over the network using the GSS-API FTP service.
*   **Authenticated Access Required:** The attacker needs valid authentication credentials to log in to the FTP server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Network Access:** Attacker must be able to connect to the vulnerable FTP server.
*   **Valid FTP Credentials:** Attacker must have a valid username/password or other authentication mechanism accepted by the server.
