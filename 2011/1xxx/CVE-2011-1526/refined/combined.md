An update that fixes three vulnerabilities is now available.
Description:
The following issues have been fixed:
- CVE-2011-1528: In releases krb5-1.8 and later, the KDC
can crash due to an assertion failure.

MITKRB5-SA-2011-005
MIT krb5 Security Advisory 2011-005
Original release: 2011-07-05
Topic: FTP daemon fails to set effective group ID
CVE-2011-1526
CVSSv2 Vector: AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P/E:H/RL:O/RC:C
CVSSv2 Base Score: 6.5
Access Vector: Network
Access Complexity: Low
Authentication: Single
Confidentiality Impact: Partial
Integrity Impact: Partial
Availability Impact: Partial
CVSSv2 Temporal Score: 5.7
Exploitability: High
Remediation Level: Official Fix
Report Confidence: Confirmed
SUMMARY
=======
A remote client of the GSS-API FTP daemon in the krb5-appl
distribution can access files using the effective group ID that the
FTP daemon process had when it started.
IMPACT
======
An authenticated remote user can gain unauthorized read or write
access to files whose group owner is the initial effective group ID of
the FTP daemon process. This is often GID 0 ("root" or "wheel").
The severity of the consequences depends heavily on the details of an
individual system's configuration. Prudent system administration
practices concerning file permissions will largely prevent any
malicious damage from this vulnerability.
No exploit code is necessary; any user able to log into the FTP server
will gain unauthorized access.
AFFECTED SOFTWARE
=================
\* The GSS-API FTP daemon in all krb5-appl releases, up to and
including krb5-appl-1.0.1, is vulnerable.
FIXES
=====
\* An upcoming release of krb5-appl will contain a fix.
\* Apply the following patch. You will need to run ./autogen.sh to
rebuild the configure script, and you should rebuild from a clean
source tree to ensure that the correct macro definitions are
compiled.

We thank Tim Zingelman for discovering this vulnerability and
providing a preliminary patch.
CONTACT
=======
The MIT Kerberos Team security contact address is

please PGP-encrypt it using the following key:
pub 2048R/56CD8F76 2010-12-29 [expires: 2012-02-01]
uid MIT Kerberos Team Security Contact <krbcore-security (at) mit (dot) edu [email concealed]>
DETAILS
=======
The vulnerability results from two interacting flaws: omission of
required autoconf tests, causing krb5\_setegid() to always fail, and
the FTP daemon's failure to check for the successful execution of
krb5\_setegid().
The FTP daemon calls the portability macro krb5\_setegid() from
k5-util.h, which is intended to wrap or emulate the POSIX interface
setegid(). The definition of the macro depends on macros that the
autoconf configure script defines (based on tests of the target
platform environment) when it runs. When the krb5 application
programs moved out of the main krb5 source tree, the new configure
script inadvertently omitted the necessary autoconf tests for
setegid() and related legacy interfaces. If no setegid() equivalent
appears to exist on the system, k5-util.h defines krb5\_setegid() to
always fail with errno EPERM. Since the relevant autoconf tests never
execute, k5-util.h will always define krb5\_setegid() to fail.
The FTP daemon does not check the return value of krb5\_setegid(), so
it silently fails to set its effective GID, allowing users to gain
unauthorized access using the effective GID that the daemon process
started with.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=711419#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-06-07 13:06:19 UTC  ``` It was found that the kerberized FTP server did not properly check for the failure to set its effective group identifier (GID). A remote, authenticated FTP user could use this flaw to gain unauthorized read or write access to files whose group owner was the initial effective GID of the FTP daemon process.  References: [1] <http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/advisories/MITKRB5-SA-2011-005.txt>     (not public yet) [2] <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-1526>  Upstream patch: [3] <http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/advisories/2011-005-patch.txt>  Acknowledgements:   Red Hat would like to thank the MIT Kerberos project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Tim Zingelman as the original reporter.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=711419#c3)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-06-07 13:12:40 UTC  ``` This issue affects the versions of the krb5 package, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.  This issue affects the version of the krb5-appl package, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.  --  This issue affects the versions of the krb5-appl package, as shipped with Fedora release of 14 and 15.   ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=711419#c23)  Tomas Hoger    2011-06-24 11:53:51 UTC  ``` As noted in the upstream advisory, there are 2 issues really:  First, there was problem introduced when splitting various kerberized applications out of krb5 sources to a separate krb5-appl packages.  A missing check in configure script caused krb5_setegid() to be incorrectly defined as always returning error without trying to change egid at all.  Second, the return value of krb5_setegid() was not checked, causing ftpd to not detect the problem and continue without changed effective group privileges.  Both problems combined resulted in users' ftpd sessions running with egid == 0, i.e. with root group privileges.  This problem affected Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and Fedora.  The krb5 versions in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5 were only affected by the second problem.  This is still a potential problem, but without the first issue, there's no easy way to an attacker to trigger setegid failure.  We plan to address the return value checking problem in the future krb5 packages update in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.   ```  [Comment 28](show_bug.cgi?id=711419#c28)  Vincent Danen    2011-07-05 17:38:38 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue was addressed in krb5-appl packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via RHSA-2011:0920 and krb5 packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 via RHSA-2012:0306.  This issue is not planned to be addressed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, where this issue was rated as having low security impact.   ```  [Comment 29](show_bug.cgi?id=711419#c29)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-07-05 18:18:24 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2011:0920 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0920.html>   ```  [Comment 30](show_bug.cgi?id=711419#c30)  Vincent Danen    2011-07-05 18:34:55 UTC  ``` Created krb5-appl tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 719095](show_bug.cgi?id=719095 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2011-1526 krb5, krb5-appl: ftpd incorrect group privilege dropping (MITKRB5-SA-2011-005) [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 32](show_bug.cgi?id=711419#c32)  Vincent Danen    2012-02-07 23:02:52 UTC  ``` IssueDescription:  It was found that ftpd, a Kerberos-aware FTP server, did not properly drop privileges.

Package        : krb5-appl
Vulnerability  : programming error
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-1526

Tim Zingelmann discovered that due an incorrect configure script the
kerborised FTP server failed to set the effective GID correctly,
resulting in privilege escalation.

The oldstable distribution (lenny) is not affected.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.1-1.1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your krb5-appl packages.

Hash: SHA1
MITKRB5-SA-2011-005
MIT krb5 Security Advisory 2011-005
Original release: 2011-07-05
Topic: FTP daemon fails to set effective group ID
CVE-2011-1526
CVSSv2 Vector: AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P/E:H/RL:O/RC:C
CVSSv2 Base Score: 6.5
Access Vector: Network
Access Complexity: Low
Authentication: Single
Confidentiality Impact: Partial
Integrity Impact: Partial
Availability Impact: Partial
CVSSv2 Temporal Score: 5.7
Exploitability: High
Remediation Level: Official Fix
Report Confidence: Confirmed
SUMMARY
=======
A remote client of the GSS-API FTP daemon in the krb5-appl
distribution can access files using the effective group ID that the
FTP daemon process had when it started.
IMPACT
======
An authenticated remote user can gain unauthorized read or write
access to files whose group owner is the initial effective group ID of
the FTP daemon process. This is often GID 0 ("root" or "wheel").
The severity of the consequences depends heavily on the details of an
individual system's configuration. Prudent system administration
practices concerning file permissions will largely prevent any
malicious damage from this vulnerability.
No exploit code is necessary; any user able to log into the FTP server
will gain unauthorized access.
AFFECTED SOFTWARE
=================
\* The GSS-API FTP daemon in all krb5-appl releases, up to and
including krb5-appl-1.0.1, is vulnerable.
FIXES
=====
\* An upcoming release of krb5-appl will contain a fix.
\* Apply the following patch. You will need to run ./autogen.sh to
rebuild the configure script, and you should rebuild from a clean
source tree to ensure that the correct macro definitions are
compiled.

DETAILS
=======
The vulnerability results from two interacting flaws: omission of
required autoconf tests, causing krb5\_setegid() to always fail, and
the FTP daemon's failure to check for the successful execution of
krb5\_setegid().
The FTP daemon calls the portability macro krb5\_setegid() from
k5-util.h, which is intended to wrap or emulate the POSIX interface
setegid(). The definition of the macro depends on macros that the
autoconf configure script defines (based on tests of the target
platform environment) when it runs. When the krb5 application
programs moved out of the main krb5 source tree, the new configure
script inadvertently omitted the necessary autoconf tests for
setegid() and related legacy interfaces. If no setegid() equivalent
appears to exist on the system, k5-util.h defines krb5\_setegid() to
always fail with errno EPERM. Since the relevant autoconf tests never
execute, k5-util.h will always define krb5\_setegid() to fail.
The FTP daemon does not check the return value of krb5\_setegid(), so
it silently fails to set its effective GID, allowing users to gain
unauthorized access using the effective GID that the daemon process
started with.
