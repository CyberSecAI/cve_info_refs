  "CVE-2011-1574": {
    "description": "A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability was found in libmodplug when handling S3M media files. An attacker could create a specially crafted music file that, when played by a victim, would cause applications using GStreamer to crash or potentially execute arbitrary code. The vulnerability lies within the ReadS3M method in load_s3m.cpp. If an attacker were able to coerce a user into opening a malicious S3M media file with an application linked to libmodplug, it could be possible to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.",

      "libmodplug",
      "gstreamer-plugins (embedded modplug)",
