  "CVE-2011-1930": {
    "description": "In klibc 1.5.20 and 1.5.21, the DHCP options written by ipconfig to /tmp/net-$DEVICE.conf are not properly escaped. This may allow a remote attacker to send a specially crafted DHCP reply which could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of any process which sources DHCP options.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The ipconfig utility in klibc writes DHCP options to a temporary file without properly escaping them. This file is later sourced by other scripts.",

        "Command Injection",
        "Insecure handling of DHCP options",
        "Improper escaping of data written to a temporary file"

        "Sending a specially crafted DHCP reply to a vulnerable system",
