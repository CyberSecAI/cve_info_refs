- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `tftpserver.exe` component of HP 3COM/H3C Intelligent Management Center uses an opcode from a received packet as an index into a function pointer table.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A missing bounds check or insufficient validation of the opcode value allows an attacker to specify an invalid or large opcode, causing the process to call an arbitrary address based on the attacker-controlled index. This results in arbitrary code execution.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending crafted UDP packets to port 69, where the `tftpserver.exe` process listens.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker can be remote and does not need authentication to exploit the vulnerability. They need the ability to send UDP packets to the affected server on port 69.
