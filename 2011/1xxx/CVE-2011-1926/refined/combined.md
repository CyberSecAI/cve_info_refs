How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## STARTTLS plaintext command injection vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#555316

Original Release Date: 2011-03-07 | Last Revised: 2011-09-08

---

### Overview

Some STARTTLS implementations could allow a remote attacker to inject commands during the plaintext phase of the protocol.

### Description

| STARTTLS is an extension to plaintext communication protocols that offers a way to upgrade a plaintext connection to an encrypted (TLS or SSL) connection instead of using a separate port for encrypted communication. Some implementations of STARTTLS contain a vulnerability that could allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to inject commands during the plaintext protocol phase, that will be executed during the ciphertext protocol phase. This vulnerability is caused by the switch from plaintext to TLS being implemented below the application's I/O buffering layer.  This issue is only of practical concern for affected implementations that also perform correct certificate validation. Implementations which do not perform certificate validation are already inherently vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.Note: Not all implementations of STARTTLS are affected by this vulnerability. Some implementations of Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) could also be affected by this vulnerability. Please see the Vendor Information below for specific vendor information. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker with the ability to pose as a man-in-the-middle may be able to inject commands for the corresponding protocol (e.g., SMTP, POP3, etc.) during the plaintext protocol phase, that will then be executed during the ciphertext protocol phase. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Update**Please see the Vendor Information below for specific vendor information and patches. |
| --- |

| **Purge the application I/O buffer**Developers of STARTTLS-enabled applications should take care to purge the application's I/O buffer immediately after switching to TLS in order to mitigate this vulnerability. |

Because STARTTLS is not supported by default in either the original qmail distribution or the netqmail distribution, those distributions are not vulnerable to this issue.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=705288#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-05-17 09:39:52 UTC  ``` It was found, that Cyrus IMAP recognized IMAP, LMTP, NNTP and POP3 protocol commands during plaintex to TLS session switch (by TLS protocol initialization). A remote attacker could use this flaw to insert plaintext, protocol relevant, commands into TLS protocol initialization messages, leading to execution of these commands during the ciphertext protocol phase, potentially allowing the attacker to steal the victim's mail or authentication credentials.

Package        : cyrus-imapd-2.2
Vulnerability  : implementation error
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-1926
Debian Bug     : 627081

It was discovered that the STARTTLS implementation of the Cyrus IMAP
server does not properly restrict I/O buffering, which allows
man-in-the-middle attackers to insert commands into encrypted IMAP,
LMTP, NNTP and POP3 sessions by sending a cleartext command that is
processed after TLS is in place.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.13-14+lenny4.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.13-19+squeeze1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.13p1-11 for cyrus-imapd-2.2 and in version 2.4.7-1
for cyrus-imapd-2.4.

We recommend that you upgrade your cyrus-imapd-2.2 packages.

Subject: CVE Request -- Cyrus-IMAP STARTTLS issue -- [was: Re:
 pure-ftpd STARTTLS command injection / new CVE?]

Hello, Josh, Steve, vendors,

   it was reported that Cyrus-IMAP is also prone to the CVE-2011-0411
issue (in IMAP, LMTP, NNTP, POP3, .. protocols):
[1] <http://bugzilla.cyrusimap.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3424>

Relevant upstream patch:
[2]
<http://git.cyrusimap.org/cyrus-imapd/patch/?id=523a91a5e86c8b9a27a138f04a3e3f2d8786f162>

References:
[3] <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=705288>

To my knowledge the list of CVE-2011-0411 related CVEs:

CVE-2011-0411 Postfix
CVE-2011-1430 Ipswich IMAIL
CVE-2011-1431 1431 netqmail
CVE-2011-1432 SCO Soffice Server
CVE-2011-1575 pure-ftpd

does not include Cyrus case yet (but not sure this list being
complete, so worthy of double-checking).

Could you allocate a CVE id for this?

Thank you & Regards, Jan.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

<http://www.debian.org/security/>                                Nico Golde

Package        : kolab-cyrus-imapd
Vulnerability  : implementation error
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-1926
Debian Bug     : 629350

It was discovered that the STARTTLS implementation of the
Kolab Cyrus IMAP server does not properly restrict I/O buffering,
which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to insert commands into encrypted
IMAP, LMTP, NNTP and POP3 sessions by sending a cleartext command that is
processed after TLS is in place.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.13-5+lenny3.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.13-9.1.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.13p1-0.1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.13p1-0.1.

We recommend that you upgrade your kolab-cyrus-imapd packages.
