Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the CVE-2011-1794 vulnerability:

*   **CVE Description:** Integer overflow in SVG filters.
*   **Root Cause:** Integer overflow within the SVG filters functionality of WebKit.
*   **Vulnerability:** An integer overflow can occur when processing SVG filters, potentially leading to a buffer overflow or other memory corruption issues.
*   **Impact:** Exploitation could lead to a crash or arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack Vector:** By crafting a malicious SVG file with specific filter parameters, an attacker could trigger the integer overflow.
*   **Affected Software:** Chromium, and potentially other software using the vulnerable WebKit version.
*   **Credit:** Inferno is credited with discovering and reporting this vulnerability.
*   **Fix:** The vulnerability was fixed in chromium-browser version 11.0.696.65. The fix involved changes to `Source/WebCore/platform/graphics/filters/FilterEffect.cpp`. Specifically, the fix implemented an early return if the paint rect and the source rect do not overlap, as no bytes need to be copied.
