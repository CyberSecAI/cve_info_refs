      "content": "LibAVCodec AMV Out of Array Write\n27/04/2011\nDominic Chell of NGS Secure has discovered a high risk vulnerability in LibAVCodec. Opening a malformed AMV file can result in an out of array write and potentially arbitrary code execution when using this library. Whilst the vulnerability may affect multiple applications that use this library, it was only tested on VLC media player.\nVersions affected include:\nVLC media player 1.1.9 and earlier releases.\nThis issue is addressed in the latest release of FFMpeg, which can be found at:\nhttp://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html\nFurther information on the changes is available in the FFMpeg git repository:\nhttp://git.videolan.org/?p=ffmpeg.git;a=commit;h=89f903b3d5ec38c9c5d90fba7e626fa0eda61a32\nNGS Secure is going to withhold details of this flaw for three months.\nThis three month window will allow users the time needed to apply the\npatch before the details are released to the general public. This\nreflects the NGS Secure approach to responsible disclosure.",
