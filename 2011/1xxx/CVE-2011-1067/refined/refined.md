```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The server uses the c_timelimit field in the connection table element to check for stale Simple Paged Results requests. This field was not always properly cleaned up when a stale connection was disconnected. Subsequent requests that acquire the same connection table element could then timeout.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Incomplete cleanup of the c_timelimit field in the connection table element.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The server stops responding to new requests, requiring a restart. New connections are immediately disconnected. The issue primarily affects Simple Paged Results connections. The server becomes unresponsive, leading to a denial-of-service condition.",
  "Attack vectors": "Replaying production LDAP traffic with multiple processes, specifically targeting Simple Paged Results connections.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send a high volume of LDAP requests, simulating production load, that use Simple Paged Results. The attacker needs to be able to establish multiple concurrent connections."
