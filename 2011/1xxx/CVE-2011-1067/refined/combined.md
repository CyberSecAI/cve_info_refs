How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=668619#c0)  Jeremy Mates    2011-01-10 22:20:37 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 472701](attachment.cgi?id=472701 "replay script, configs, access log, strace results") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=472701&action=edit "replay script, configs, access log, strace results") replay script, configs, access log, strace results  Description of problem:  slapd stops responding to queries; the TCP port remains open, though new connections are unable to bind() or issue LDAP queries. This condition persists until slapd is shutdown and restarted.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):  Stock and up-to-date RHEL system; RPM on clean install from EPEL.  # cat /etc/redhat-release  Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 5.5 (Tikanga) # rpm -qa | grep 389 389-console-1.1.4-1.el5 389-dsgw-1.1.5-1.el5 389-ds-base-1.2.7.5-1.el5 389-admin-1.1.13-1.el5 389-admin-console-1.1.5-1.el5 389-admin-console-doc-1.1.5-1.el5 389-ds-1.2.1-1.el5 389-adminutil-1.1.8-4.el5 389-ds-console-1.2.3-1.el5 389-ds-console-doc-1.2.3-1.el5  How reproducible:  Difficult: requires multiple processes replaying production TCP sessions saved from tcpdump to cause the wedge. A single replay process causes no issue, nor does multiple processes replicating the slapd log via ldapsearch against the server.  Steps to Reproduce:  1. Clean install of a standalone LDAP server, minor configuration tweaks    to enable Kerberos support, increase file descriptors, allow    anonymous binds. (See dirsrv.sysconfig, dse.ldif, attached.) 2. Collect production LDAP traffic (actual client requests against    the current LDAP servers, which run an older fedora-ds release    that do not exhibit this bug): `tcpdump -vv -c 100000 -s 0 -w ldap-    traffic port 389` 3. Run strace against slapd-* process on server. 4. Replay production LDAP traffic against test standalone server (via    ldap-tcpdump-replay script, attached). Requires multiple runs of the    script, single run does not suffice? 5. Wait for server to stop responding...  Started strace at 20:45 UTC and the test traffic at around then; server stopped responding and was automatically restarted by an every-15- seconds health check connecting via 127.0.0.1 that saw no problems at ~20:47:30 but found an unresponsive server at ~20:47:45.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=668619#c1)  Rich Megginson    2011-01-10 22:38:58 UTC  ``` This looks like a duplicate of [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=668548](show_bug.cgi?id=668548 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - Possible bug in file descriptor handler in 389 1.2.7")   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=668619#c2)  Todd Hendricks    2011-01-10 22:41:14 UTC  ``` I have experienced this issue as well under production load.

The field is supposed to be cleaned up when the staled Simple Paged Results connection is disconnected.  But the cleanup was sometimes incomplete.  It causes the following requests which happens to acquire the same connection table element timed out. This patch forces to clean up the c_timelimit every time the connection table is acquired and renewed.  Also, the timeout check is done only for the Simple Paged Results connection.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=668619#c6)  Noriko Hosoi    2011-01-31 19:06:19 UTC  ``` Reviewed by Rich (Thank you!!!)

Thanks.  The stack looks corrupted.  Are you using SASL/GSSAPI Kerberos authentication?  Can you attach the last few lines from your errors and access logs before the crash?   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=668619#c13)  Jeremy Mates    2011-02-10 21:51:54 UTC  ``` Yes, the servers are configured for Kerberos auth (via [http://directory.fedoraproject.org/wiki/Howto:Kerberos](http://directory.fedoraproject.org/wiki/Howto%3AKerberos)). Our existing fedora-ds-1.0.4-1.RHEL4 production LDAP servers also use Kerberos auth, and do not exhibit any problems (they were setup well before my time here, though).  Errors shows just various peer rests, nothing unique at time of the crash.  [10/Feb/2011:18:18:01 +0000] - PR_Write(118) Netscape Portable Runtime error -59 61 (TCP connection reset by peer.) [10/Feb/2011:18:18:02 +0000] - PR_Write(79) Netscape Portable Runtime error -596 1 (TCP connection reset by peer.)  Access shows nothing exciting, though that is buffered. Trying again with unbuffered logs and a higher error log level.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=668619#c14)  Jeremy Mates    2011-02-11 18:26:22 UTC  ``` Unbuffered logging appears to avoid the segmentation faults (for an overnight run of test traffic; buffered logging leads to crashes within minutes), though hobbles performance to the log write speed. If production load is near or beyond that limit, client requests block or timeout, which is not ideal. Shutting down the unbuffered logging ns-slapd took 10 (!) minutes after all test traffic was cut off.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=668619#c15)  Rich Megginson    2011-02-11 18:36:17 UTC  ``` Yeah, that's why we buffer access logging by default.  You can use a named pipe script for the access log instead - <http://directory.fedoraproject.org/wiki/Named_Pipe_Log_Script>   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=668619#c16)  Jeremy Mates    2011-02-26 01:10:58 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 481105](attachment.cgi?id=481105 "gdb trace from 1.2.8 a3 segfault") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=481105&action=edit "gdb trace from 1.2.8 a3 segfault") gdb trace from 1.2.8 a3 segfault  gdb trace from 1.2.8 a3 segfault added (alpha 3 is harder to segfault than alpha 2).   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=668619#c17)  Rich Megginson    2011-02-26 02:20:40 UTC  ``` Centos5?  32-bit or 64-bit?

It crashes..  here are the few lines from access log : [20/May/2011:15:20:02 +051800] conn=13 op=1 SRCH base="dc=example,dc=com" scope=2 filter="(cn=*)" attrs="distinguishedName" [20/May/2011:15:20:07 +051800] conn=13 op=1 RESULT err=3 tag=101 nentries=0 etime=8 notes=U,P [20/May/2011:15:20:00 +051800] conn=94 fd=156 slot=156 connection from 127.0.0.1 to 127.0.0.1 [20/May/2011:15:20:07 +051800] conn=63 op=-1 fd=125 closed - T2 [20/May/2011:15:20:07 +051800] conn=59 op=-1 fd=121 closed - T2 [20/May/2011:15:20:07 +051800] conn=55 op=-1 fd=117 closed - T2 [20/May/2011:15:20:07 +051800] conn=51 op=-1 fd=113 closed - T2 [20/May/2011:15:20:07 +051800] conn=49 op=-1 fd=111 closed - T2 [20/May/2011:15:20:07 +051800] conn=47 op=-1 fd=109 closed - T2 [20/May/2011:15:20:07 +051800] conn=38 op=-1 fd=100 closed - T2 [20/May/2011:15:20:07 +051800] conn=95 fd=68 slot=68 connection from 127.0.0.1 to 127.0.0.1 [20/May/2011:15:20:07 +051800] conn=96 fd=73 slot=73 connection from 127.0.0.1 to 127.0.0.1 [20/May/2011:15:20:00 +051800] conn=47 op=1 RESULT err=0 tag=101 nentries=5 etime=1 notes=U,P [20/May/2011:15:20:07 +051800] conn=74 op=1 SRCH base="dc=example,dc=com" scope=2 filter="(cn=*)" attrs="distinguishedName" [20/May/2011:15:20:07 +051800] conn=74 op=1 RESULT err=0 tag=101 nentries=5 etime=0 notes=U,P [20/May/2011:15:20:07 +051800] conn=73 op=1 SRCH base="dc=example,dc=com" scope=2 filter="(cn=*)" attrs="distinguishedName" [20/May/2011:15:20:07 +051800] conn=73 op=1 RESULT err=0 tag=101 nentries=5 etime=0 notes=U,P   [20/May/2011:15:20:08 +051800] conn=65 op=2 UNBIND [20/May/2011:15:20:08 +051800] conn=65 op=2 fd=127 closed - U1 [20/May/2011:15:20:08 +051800] conn=64 op=2 UNBIND [20/May/2011:15:20:08 +051800] conn=64 op=2 fd=126 closed - U1 [20/May/2011:15:20:08 +051800] conn=62 op=2 UNBIND [20/May/2011:15:20:08 +051800] conn=62 op=2 fd=124 closed - U1 [20/May/2011:15:20:08 +051800] conn=61 op=3 UNBIND [20/May/2011:15:20:08 +051800] conn=61 op=3 fd=123 closed - U1 [20/May/2011:15:20:08 +051800] conn=58 op=2 UNBIND [20/May/2011:15:20:08 +051800] conn=58 op=2 fd=120 closed - U1 [20/May/2011:15:20:07 +051800] conn=97 fd=77 slot=77 connection from 127.0.0.1 to 1   [20/May/2011:15:20:08 +051800] conn=109 fd=125 slot=125 connection from 127.0.0.1 to 127.0.0.1 [20/May/2011:15:20:09 +051800] conn=91 op=-1 fd=153 closed - T2 [20/May/2011:15:20:09 +051800] conn=86 op=-1 fd=148 closed - T2 [20/May/2011:15:20:09 +051800] conn=74 op=-1 fd=136 closed - T2 [20/May/2011:15:20:09 +051800] conn=73 op=-1 fd=135 closed - T2 [20/May/2011:15:20:09 +051800] conn=71 op=-1 fd=133 closed - T2 [20/May/2011:15:20:09 +051800] conn=70 op=-1 fd=132 closed - T2 [20/May/2011:15:20:09 +051800] conn=69 op=-1 fd=131 closed - T2 [20/May/2011:15:20:09 +051800] conn=68 op=-1 fd=130 closed - T2   20/May/2011:15:20:11 +051800] conn=28 op=1 RESULT err=3 tag=101 nentries=0 etime=12 notes=U,P [20/May/2011:15:20:11 +051800] conn=14 op=2 UNBIND [20/May/2011:15:20:11 +051800] conn=14 op=2 fd=76 closed - U1 [20/May/2011:15:20:11 +051800] conn=13 op=2 UNBIND [20/May/2011:15:20:11 +051800] conn=13 op=2 fd=75 closed - U1 [20/May/2011:15:20:11 +051800] conn=12 op=2 UNBIND [20/May/2011:15:20:11 +051800] conn=12 op=2 fd=74 closed - U1 [20/May/2011:15:20:11 +051800] conn=10 op=2 UNBIND [20/May/2011:15:20:11 +051800] conn=10 op=2 fd=72 closed - U1   From errors log ; [20/May/2011:14:36:24 +051800] - PR_Write(64) Netscape Portable Runtime error -5961 (TCP connection reset by peer.)

What makes you think it crashes?  Are you talking about the test program or the directory server?  From the errors log below, the server shuts down cleanly and starts up cleanly - no crash there.  The original bug was that the server would stop responding to new requests after some period of activity.  That is, ldapsearch would fail, but the server would be running.  Are you able to reproduce that problem?  Note that it is ok to get T2 errors - if the client is hung or there is a lot of network congestion, the server can timeout attempting to read/write to the client.  If this is a common occurrence for the customer, we usually recommend increasing the idle timeout.  >  > here are the few lines from access log : > [20/May/2011:15:20:02 +051800] conn=13 op=1 SRCH base="dc=example,dc=com" > scope=2 filter="(cn=*)" attrs="distinguishedName" > [20/May/2011:15:20:07 +051800] conn=13 op=1 RESULT err=3 tag=101 nentries=0 > etime=8 notes=U,P > [20/May/2011:15:20:00 +051800] conn=94 fd=156 slot=156 connection from > 127.0.0.1 to 127.0.0.1 > [20/May/2011:15:20:07 +051800] conn=63 op=-1 fd=125 closed - T2 > [20/May/2011:15:20:07 +051800] conn=59 op=-1 fd=121 closed - T2 > [20/May/2011:15:20:07 +051800] conn=55 op=-1 fd=117 closed - T2 > [20/May/2011:15:20:07 +051800] conn=51 op=-1 fd=113 closed - T2 > [20/May/2011:15:20:07 +051800] conn=49 op=-1 fd=111 closed - T2 > [20/May/2011:15:20:07 +051800] conn=47 op=-1 fd=109 closed - T2 > [20/May/2011:15:20:07 +051800] conn=38 op=-1 fd=100 closed - T2 > [20/May/2011:15:20:07 +051800] conn=95 fd=68 slot=68 connection from 127.0.0.1 > to 127.0.0.1 > [20/May/2011:15:20:07 +051800] conn=96 fd=73 slot=73 connection from 127.0.0.1 > to 127.0.0.1 > [20/May/2011:15:20:00 +051800] conn=47 op=1 RESULT err=0 tag=101 nentries=5 > etime=1 notes=U,P > [20/May/2011:15:20:07 +051800] conn=74 op=1 SRCH base="dc=example,dc=com" > scope=2 filter="(cn=*)" attrs="distinguishedName" > [20/May/2011:15:20:07 +051800] conn=74 op=1 RESULT err=0 tag=101 nentries=5 > etime=0 notes=U,P > [20/May/2011:15:20:07 +051800] conn=73 op=1 SRCH base="dc=example,dc=com" > scope=2 filter="(cn=*)" attrs="distinguishedName" > [20/May/2011:15:20:07 +051800] conn=73 op=1 RESULT err=0 tag=101 nentries=5 > etime=0 notes=U,P >  >  > [20/May/2011:15:20:08 +051800] conn=65 op=2 UNBIND > [20/May/2011:15:20:08 +051800] conn=65 op=2 fd=127 closed - U1 > [20/May/2011:15:20:08 +051800] conn=64 op=2 UNBIND > [20/May/2011:15:20:08 +051800] conn=64 op=2 fd=126 closed - U1 > [20/May/2011:15:20:08 +051800] conn=62 op=2 UNBIND > [20/May/2011:15:20:08 +051800] conn=62 op=2 fd=124 closed - U1 > [20/May/2011:15:20:08 +051800] conn=61 op=3 UNBIND > [20/May/2011:15:20:08 +051800] conn=61 op=3 fd=123 closed - U1 > [20/May/2011:15:20:08 +051800] conn=58 op=2 UNBIND > [20/May/2011:15:20:08 +051800] conn=58 op=2 fd=120 closed - U1 > [20/May/2011:15:20:07 +051800] conn=97 fd=77 slot=77 connection from 127.0.0.1 > to 1 >  >  > [20/May/2011:15:20:08 +051800] conn=109 fd=125 slot=125 connection from > 127.0.0.1 to 127.0.0.1 > [20/May/2011:15:20:09 +051800] conn=91 op=-1 fd=153 closed - T2 > [20/May/2011:15:20:09 +051800] conn=86 op=-1 fd=148 closed - T2 > [20/May/2011:15:20:09 +051800] conn=74 op=-1 fd=136 closed - T2 > [20/May/2011:15:20:09 +051800] conn=73 op=-1 fd=135 closed - T2 > [20/May/2011:15:20:09 +051800] conn=71 op=-1 fd=133 closed - T2 > [20/May/2011:15:20:09 +051800] conn=70 op=-1 fd=132 closed - T2 > [20/May/2011:15:20:09 +051800] conn=69 op=-1 fd=131 closed - T2 > [20/May/2011:15:20:09 +051800] conn=68 op=-1 fd=130 closed - T2 >  >  > 20/May/2011:15:20:11 +051800] conn=28 op=1 RESULT err=3 tag=101 nentries=0 > etime=12 notes=U,P > [20/May/2011:15:20:11 +051800] conn=14 op=2 UNBIND > [20/May/2011:15:20:11 +051800] conn=14 op=2 fd=76 closed - U1 > [20/May/2011:15:20:11 +051800] conn=13 op=2 UNBIND > [20/May/2011:15:20:11 +051800] conn=13 op=2 fd=75 closed - U1 > [20/May/2011:15:20:11 +051800] conn=12 op=2 UNBIND > [20/May/2011:15:20:11 +051800] conn=12 op=2 fd=74 closed - U1 > [20/May/2011:15:20:11 +051800] conn=10 op=2 UNBIND > [20/May/2011:15:20:11 +051800] conn=10 op=2 fd=72 closed - U1 >  >  > From errors log ; > [20/May/2011:14:36:24 +051800] - PR_Write(64) Netscape Portable Runtime error > -5961 (TCP connection reset by peer.) > [20/May/2011:15:13:50 +051800] - slapd shutting down - signaling operation > threads > [20/May/2011:15:13:50 +051800] - slapd shutting down - closing down internal > subsystems and plugins > [20/May/2011:15:13:52 +051800] - Waiting for 4 database threads to stop > [20/May/2011:15:13:52 +051800] - All database threads now stopped > [20/May/2011:15:13:53 +051800] - slapd stopped. > [20/May/2011:15:13:56 +051800] - 389-Directory/1.2.8.3 B2011.123.1759 starting > up > [20/May/2011:15:13:56 +051800] - slapd started.

If so, then the server is not hung, and you have not reproduced the problem.  I tried running the script.  For one, on my system, I got a lot of errors like this: /share/scripts/[bug668619](show_bug.cgi?id=668619 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - slapd stops responding").sh: fork: retry: Resource temporarily unavailable  For another - the script runs with -E pr=5 - by default, ldapsearch will prompt for the next page, so I have several hundred ldapsearch processes waiting for input on stdin - is this right?  I guess the purpose of the test is to leave several hundred paged searches unfinished?  Otherwise, they might finish before the timeout is hit.   ```  [Comment 30](show_bug.cgi?id=668619#c30)  Amita Sharma    2011-07-07 08:58:06 UTC  ``` Hi Rich and Noriko,  I am using attached script - "script to reproduce the problem" to verify.  1).
