  "summary": "The provided content contains information about a vulnerability in PHP that is identified by CVE-2011-1468. The vulnerability is a memory leak in the openssl\_encrypt and openssl\_decrypt functions that is due to the lack of proper freeing of the cipher context.",
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The root cause of the vulnerability is the failure to free the cipher context after using the openssl\_encrypt and openssl\_decrypt functions in PHP.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Memory leak due to improper resource management."
    ],
    "impact": "The memory leak can lead to increased memory consumption and potentially denial-of-service if an attacker repeatedly triggers the vulnerable functions.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "Calling openssl_encrypt and openssl_decrypt functions multiple times."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need the ability to execute PHP code that calls these functions."
  },
  "additional_details": "The vulnerability is described in more detail on the PHP bug tracker, where it is associated with bug IDs 54060 and 54061. The fix consists of adding the EVP_CIPHER_CTX_cleanup function call to the end of the openssl\_encrypt and openssl\_decrypt functions to release allocated memory for the cipher context. The identified memory leak occurs within the ext/openssl/openssl.c file of the PHP source code. The content also shows that the issue exists in both openssl\_encrypt and openssl\_decrypt.  The initial bug report ([#54060](bug.php?id=54060)) mentions memory leaks when calling openssl\_encrypt, and a following bug report ([#54061](bug.php?id=54061)) reports that similar leaks happen in openssl\_decrypt."
