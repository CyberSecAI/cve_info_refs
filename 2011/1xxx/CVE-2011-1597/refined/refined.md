- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A specially crafted report format plugin could be uploaded to the OpenVAS Manager.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The OpenVAS Manager did not properly validate report format plugins, allowing for arbitrary code execution.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A rogue user could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the OpenVAS Manager. This means a complete compromise of the system where OpenVAS Manager runs.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious user crafts and uploads a specially crafted report format plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have the ability to upload the malicious plugin and knowledge of the operating system where OpenVAS Manager is installed.
