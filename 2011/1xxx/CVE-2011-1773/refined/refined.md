Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2011-1773:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `virt-v2v` tool, when converting virtual machines, was not preserving the VNC password protection of the source VM in the target VM. Specifically, during conversion to a RHEL/libvirt target hypervisor, virt-v2v would replace the guest's existing display configuration with `<graphics type='vnc' port='-1' listen='127.0.0.1'/>`, effectively disabling any password configured on the source machine.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing VNC Password Protection:** The primary vulnerability is the loss of VNC password protection during VM conversion. The converted virtual machine's VNC console becomes accessible without authentication, even if a password was configured on the original VM.
- **Insecure Default Configuration:** `virt-v2v` replaced the original VNC configuration, disregarding the existing password protection, with an insecure default configuration that allows access without authentication.
- **Improper Handling of Display Settings:** The tool did not properly migrate the VNC display configuration, especially the password setting, from the source to the destination.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker who can connect to the target VM's VNC console could gain access to the virtual machine.
- **VM Control:** Once connected, the attacker could operate the VM with the privileges of the logged-in user, potentially executing commands, accessing data, or otherwise compromising the system.
- **Data Breach/System Compromise:** The lack of password protection on the console could lead to a data breach or complete compromise of the virtual machine's operating system and its resources.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access to VNC Console:** The attack vector is primarily through network access to the VNC console of the converted virtual machine. This assumes that the VNC service is accessible over the network and an attacker has network access to it.
- **Local access to the hypervisor console** If the hypervisor allows direct access to the console (e.g. a management console) then the attacker may be able to bypass network access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs network access to the target virtual machine's VNC service, or local access to the console of the hypervisor running the VM.
- **No Authentication Required:** Because the VNC password protection is missing, no prior knowledge of any credentials is required.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is specific to conversions to a libvirt/RHEL hypervisor and not to RHEV (Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization) as RHEV does not allow a VNC password to be specified.
- The scope was limited to cases where the target hypervisor allows unprivileged users who are not administrators to login.
- The bug was fixed by updating the `virt-v2v` package to properly handle VNC password settings during conversion.
- The issue was also addressed by an update to the `perl-Sys-Virt` package.
