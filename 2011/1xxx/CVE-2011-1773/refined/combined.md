How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=702754#c0)  Petr Matousek    2011-05-06 20:23:48 UTC  ``` It was found that after virtual machine conversion using virt-v2v the target VM does not have VNC password enabled even though the source VM does. An attacker able to connect to the target VM can possibly use this flaw to operate the VM with privileges of the logged in user.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=702754#c1)  Petr Matousek    2011-05-06 20:24:36 UTC  ``` +++ This bug was initially created as a clone of [Bug #665347](show_bug.cgi?id=665347) +++  It also occurs with virt-v2v-0.6.3-4.el5.  +++ This bug was initially created as a clone of [Bug #665345](show_bug.cgi?id=665345) +++  Created [attachment 470410](attachment.cgi?id=470410) [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=470410&action=edit) log from LIBGUESTFS_TRACE=1  Description of problem: Libvirt supports guests to have VNC encrypt when accessing guest via VNC. But after conversion, users won't be asked to enter VNC password.   BTW: It works on migrating guest (#virsh migrate...)   Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): virt-v2v-0.6.2-4.el6.x86_64  How reproducible: always  Steps to Reproduce: 1.

I've filed appropriate bugs ([bug 705791](show_bug.cgi?id=705791) and [bug 705792](show_bug.cgi?id=705792)) against perl-Sys-Virt in RHEL 5 and RHEL 6. Time constraints make it highly unlikely this bug will be fixed for RHEL 5.7.  Some more information: This bug only affects conversions when a guest is being converted to run on a RHEL/libvirt target hypervisor. RHEV does not allow a VNC password to be specified, so this bug is not applicable there.  During conversion to RHEL/libvirt, virt-v2v currently entirely ignores the guest's existing display configuration, and replaces it with:  <graphics type='vnc' port='-1' listen='127.0.0.1'/>  That is, the converted guest will always use VNC on the localhost interface with an automatically allocated port number. The scope of the loss of the VNC password is therefore limited to:  1. Conversions where the target is libvirt/RHEL (not RHEV) and 2. The target hypervisor allows unprivileged logins for users who are not also administrators.  I think in practise this scope is extremely small and could be handled with a release note until the perl bindings can be updated.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=702754#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-12-06 14:49:26 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2011:1615 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-1615.html>   ``` |  |

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=732421#c0)  yuping zhang    2011-08-22 12:21:04 UTC  ``` Description of problem: Install Windows Recovery Console to windows OS and convert it,then boot from WRC,it will BSOD.   Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): virt-v2v-0.8.3-1.el6.x86_64 libvirt-0.9.4-4.el6.x86_64 libguestfs-1.7.17-36.el6.x86_64 virtio-win-1.3.3-0.el6.norach   How reproducible: always  Steps to Reproduce: 1.Install Windows Recovery Console to Windows OS,refer to link: <http://support.microsoft.com/kb/307654#howtoinstallrc> 2.Convert it # virt-v2v -ic qemu+ssh://10.66.72.122/system -os default -b rhevm winxp-32b-kvm-RecoveryConsole winxp-32b-raw-kvm-Recovery.img: 100% [=====================================================]D 0h02m16s virt-v2v: WARNING: There is no virtio net driver available in the directory specified for this version of Windows. The guest will be configured with a rtl8139 network adapter, but no driver will be installed for it. If the rtl8139 driver is not already installed in the guest, you must install it manually after conversion. virt-v2v: winxp-32b-kvm-RecoveryConsole configured with virtio storage only. 3.Boot the guest from Windows Recovery Console 4.Delete WRC and  re-install it  Actual results: For step 3: It will BSOD after select boot from WRC For step 4: I have tried winxp-32b and win2k3-64b,     for winxp-32b:BSOD after re-installed it     for win2k3-64b:It works well after re-installed WRC  Expected results: It will not BSOD,or document this issue. After delete the WRC and re-install it,WRC should be works well.  Additional info:   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=732421#c1)  yuping zhang    2011-08-22 12:21:40 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 519277](attachment.cgi?id=519277 "BSOD for WRC") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=519277&action=edit "BSOD for WRC") BSOD for WRC   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=732421#c3)  Matthew Booth    2011-08-23 09:02:35 UTC  ``` This can be resolved in Win2k3 R2 by re-installed WRC. I'm going to test all other versions and make a recommendation for a doc update.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=732421#c4)  Matthew Booth    2011-08-24 10:33:16 UTC  ``` To follow up on this:  Windows XP 32bit doesn't seem to support the recovery console on a VirtIO system. It can't even be enabled on a fresh system. There's nothing virt-v2v can do about this.  Windows XP 64bit and Windows 2003 (32 and 64bit): the recovery console works fine after it is re-installed.  Re-installing the recovery console is the same procedure as installing it in the first place:  1. Present Windows installation CD to the guest 2. Start->Run "d:\(i386|amd64)\winnt32.exe /cmdcons"  I don't plan to fix it in virt-v2v, although we ought to document it.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=732421#c5)  Matthew Booth    2011-08-25 10:55:58 UTC  ``` I've pushed an update to the man page upstream. I've opened [bug 733005](show_bug.cgi?id=733005) to track an update to the V2V guide.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=732421#c8)  yuping zhang    2011-08-29 07:21:20 UTC  ``` Verify this issue with virt-v2v-0.8.3-4.el6  #man virt-v2v ... Windows Recovery Console        virt-v2v does not support conversion of the Windows Recovery Console. If a guest has a recovery console installed and VirtIO was enabled during conversion,        attempting to boot the recovery console will result in a BSOD.         Windows XP x86 does not support the Windows Recovery Console on VirtIO systems, so there is no resolution to this. However, on Windows XP AMD64 and Windows 2003        (x86 and AMD64), the recovery console can be re-installed after conversion. The re-installation procedure is the same as the initial installation procedure. It is        not necessary to remove the recovery console first.  Following re-installation, the recovery console will work as intended. ...  So change the bug status to VERIFIED.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=732421#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-12-06 14:49:51 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=702754#c0)  Petr Matousek    2011-05-06 20:23:48 UTC  ``` It was found that after virtual machine conversion using virt-v2v the target VM does not have VNC password enabled even though the source VM does. An attacker able to connect to the target VM can possibly use this flaw to operate the VM with privileges of the logged in user.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=702754#c1)  Petr Matousek    2011-05-06 20:24:36 UTC  ``` +++ This bug was initially created as a clone of [Bug #665347](show_bug.cgi?id=665347) +++  It also occurs with virt-v2v-0.6.3-4.el5.  +++ This bug was initially created as a clone of [Bug #665345](show_bug.cgi?id=665345) +++  Created [attachment 470410](attachment.cgi?id=470410) [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=470410&action=edit) log from LIBGUESTFS_TRACE=1  Description of problem: Libvirt supports guests to have VNC encrypt when accessing guest via VNC. But after conversion, users won't be asked to enter VNC password.   BTW: It works on migrating guest (#virsh migrate...)   Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): virt-v2v-0.6.2-4.el6.x86_64  How reproducible: always  Steps to Reproduce: 1.

I've filed appropriate bugs ([bug 705791](show_bug.cgi?id=705791) and [bug 705792](show_bug.cgi?id=705792)) against perl-Sys-Virt in RHEL 5 and RHEL 6. Time constraints make it highly unlikely this bug will be fixed for RHEL 5.7.  Some more information: This bug only affects conversions when a guest is being converted to run on a RHEL/libvirt target hypervisor. RHEV does not allow a VNC password to be specified, so this bug is not applicable there.  During conversion to RHEL/libvirt, virt-v2v currently entirely ignores the guest's existing display configuration, and replaces it with:  <graphics type='vnc' port='-1' listen='127.0.0.1'/>  That is, the converted guest will always use VNC on the localhost interface with an automatically allocated port number. The scope of the loss of the VNC password is therefore limited to:  1. Conversions where the target is libvirt/RHEL (not RHEV) and 2. The target hypervisor allows unprivileged logins for users who are not also administrators.  I think in practise this scope is extremely small and could be handled with a release note until the perl bindings can be updated.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=702754#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-12-06 14:49:26 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2011:1615 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-1615.html>   ``` |  |

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

It made a backup of /etc/modprobe.conf at the time it was installed, and copies this backup over /etc/modprobe.conf when it is uninstalled. No attempt is made to preserve changes to /etc/modprobe.conf in the intervening period. This is a bug in vmware tools.  Secondly, virt-v2v scans modprobe.conf during initial inspection. At this point, modprobe.conf doesn't contain an eth0 entry. virt-v2v later runs vmware-uninstall-tools.pl, which copies the backup modprobe.conf into place. modprobe.conf now does contain an eth0 entry, but virt-v2v only iterates over the list of entries it found originally, so ignores the new eth0 entry. This is also why eth0 is correctly updated if it isn't manually removed from modprobe.conf  A couple of things to note on this:  It's a real weird edge case. If you don't make this unusual manual alteration to modprobe.conf, you'll never hit it.  For some reason I don't understand, the guest continues to use virtio networking correctly anyway. This means that, apart from having an untidy entry in modprobe.conf, the bug has no impact.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=707261#c11)  Huang Wenlong    2011-08-29 03:05:44 UTC  ``` Verify this bug in virt-v2v-0.8.3-4.el6   #  virt-v2v -ic esx://10.66.72.79/?no_verify=1 -os r6 -b breth0  esx4.1-rhel5.7-x86_64-wl-vmtools   esx4.1-rhel5.7-x86_64-wl-test_esx4.1-rhel5.7-x86_64-wl-test: 100% [================================================================]D 0h10m13s virt-v2v: esx4.1-rhel5.7-x86_64-wl-vmtools configured with virtio drivers.

# fedorahosted.org retirement

## Summary

fedorahosted.org was retired on March 1st, 2017. If you are viewing this page, odds are it's after that date and you have been redirected here by attempting to go to some project on fedorahosted.org. If you are a user of a project formerly hosted at fedorahosted.org, please search for the new home the project you are interested in likely has. If you are a maintainer of a project formerly hosted at fedorahosted.org and need your data to migrate, see below.

## Background

fedorahosted.org was set up in late 2007 as a location to host svn, git, hg, and bzr projects. The trac wiki and issue tracker was used for issues and project planning. Groups for each project were managed in the Fedora Account System, and via a wrapper, scp/sftp uploads of releases was supported. Many of the projects there were closely related to Fedora, but not all of them. For many years fedorahosted thrived.

With the rise of GitHub and the pull request (PR) workflow most new projects moved to other locations. In early 2015, pagure.io came into being. It was a from the ground up implementation of the new git/PR workflow and also hosted by and maintained by Fedora Infrastructure. In early 2016 it became clear that Fedora Infrastructure didn't have resources to keep maintaining both fedorahosted.org and pagure.io and so the announcement was made to retire fedorahosted. Maintainers have had over the last year to migrate their projects to pagure.io or whatever other place they wish.

## Reasons for retirement

* Over the last few years there have been almost 0 new projects added to fedorahosted.org. This shows not much interest by the developer community.
* fedorahosted.org uses trac 0.12 (a Long term release), but upstream is very behind on newer releases. (The next 0.12 bugfix is 18 months behind schedule and the next 1.0 stable is 4 months late as of this writing). Newer trac and all its plugins would need to be packaged for a new release.
* A fair bit of technical debt has piled up over the years:
  + fedorahosted.org is running RHEL6
  + is not in Ansible (our configuration management (CM))
  + isn't distributed in any way
* The 'fedorahosted.org' domain and using fas groups to manage committers has tied fedorahosted.org to Fedora, causing some projects issues.

## General answers

* If you are a maintainer who needs data off the old fedorahosted.org instance, please file an issue in <https://pagure.io/fedora-infrastructure/> with your request. Please be clear what data you want (trac db, git repo, other) and how you want us to get the data to you.
* We are also happy to setup redirects for your project to a new location. Just file an issue in <https://pagure.io/fedora-infrastructure> and we will try and help you out.
* If you are a user of a project formerly at fedorahosted.org, please check <https://pagure.io/> for the project, it may have moved there.
* lists.fedorahosted.org will continue to work and exist for the future.

## Topic

An updated virt-v2v package that fixes one security issue and several bugs
is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

## Description

virt-v2v is a tool for converting and importing virtual machines to
libvirt-managed KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine), or Red Hat Enterprise
Virtualization.

Using virt-v2v to convert a guest that has a password-protected VNC console
to a KVM guest removed that password protection from the converted guest:
after conversion, a password was not required to access the converted
guest's VNC console. Now, converted guests will require the same VNC
console password as the original guest. Note that when converting a guest
to run on Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization, virt-v2v will display a
warning that VNC passwords are not supported. (CVE-2011-1773)

Note: The Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.2 perl-Sys-Virt update must also be
installed to correct CVE-2011-1773.

Bug fixes:

* When converting a guest virtual machine (VM), whose name contained

certain characters, virt-v2v would create a converted guest with a
corrupted name. Now, virt-v2v will not corrupt guest names. (BZ#665883)

* There were numerous usability issues when running virt-v2v as a non-root

user. This update makes it simpler to run virt-v2v as a non-root user.
(BZ#671094)

* virt-v2v failed to convert a Microsoft Windows guest with Windows

Recovery Console installed in a separate partition. Now, virt-v2v will
successfully convert a guest with Windows Recovery Console installed in a
separate partition by ignoring that partition. (BZ#673066)

* virt-v2v failed to convert a Red Hat Enterprise Linux guest which did not

have the symlink "/boot/grub/menu.lst". With this update, virt-v2v can
select a grub configuration file from several places. (BZ#694364)

* This update removes information about the usage of deprecated command

line options in the virt-v2v man page. (BZ#694370)

* virt-v2v would fail to correctly change the allocation policy, (sparse or

preallocated) when converting a guest with QCOW2 image format. The error
message "Cannot import VM, The selected disk configuration is not
supported" was displayed. With this update, allocation policy changes to a
guest with QCOW2 storage will work correctly. (BZ#696089)

* The options "--network" and "--bridge" can not be used in conjunction

when converting a guest, but no error message was displayed. With this
update, virt-v2v will now display an error message if the mutually
exclusive "--network" and "--bridge" command line options are both
specified. (BZ#700759)

* virt-v2v failed to convert a multi-boot guest, and did not clean up

temporary storage and mount points after failure. With this update,
virt-v2v will prompt for which operating system to convert from a
multi-boot guest, and will correctly clean up if the process fails.
(BZ#702007)

* virt-v2v failed to correctly configure modprobe aliases when converting a

VMware ESX guest with VMware Tools installed. With this update, modprobe
aliases will be correctly configured. (BZ#707261)

* When converting a guest with preallocated raw storage using the

libvirtxml input method, virt-v2v failed with the erroneous error message
"size(X) < usage(Y)". This update removes this erroneous error. (BZ#727489)

* When converting a Red Hat Enterprise Linux guest, virt-v2v did not check

that the Cirrus X driver was available before configuring it. With this
update, virt-v2v will attempt to install the Cirrus X driver if it is
required. (BZ#708961)

* VirtIO systems do not support the Windows Recovery Console on 32-bit

Windows XP. The virt-v2v man page has been updated to note this. On Windows
XP Professional x64 Edition, however, if Windows Recovery Console is
re-installed after conversion, it will work as expected. (BZ#732421)

* Placing comments in the guest fstab file by means of the leading "#"

symbol caused an "unknown filesystem" error after conversion of a guest.
With this update comments can now be used and error messages will not be
displayed. (BZ#677870)

Users of virt-v2v should upgrade to this updated package, which fixes these
issues and upgrades virt-v2v to version 0.8.3.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
