{
  "CVE-2011-1888": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by a null pointer de-reference due to the way kernel-mode drivers keep track of pointers to certain kernel-mode driver objects.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Null pointer de-reference"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in kernel mode and take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full administrative rights.",
    "Attack vectors": "To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would first have to log on to the system. An attacker could then run a specially crafted application that could exploit the vulnerability and take complete control over the affected system.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to exploit this vulnerability."
