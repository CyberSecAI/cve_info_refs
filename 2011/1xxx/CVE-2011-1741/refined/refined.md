Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the CVE-2011-1741 vulnerability:

*   **Vulnerability:** EMC Documentum eRoom Indexing Server OpenText HummingBird Connector Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
*   **Root Cause:** A buffer overflow exists in the HummingBird Client Connector (ftserver.exe) due to improper handling of packet data received over a TCP connection. The application attempts to copy part of the packet's contents into a stack-based buffer without properly validating the data size.
*   **Weakness:** Insufficient bounds checking when copying data into a buffer, leading to a stack buffer overflow.
*   **Impact:** Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of EMC Documentum eRoom Indexing Server. This can lead to complete compromise of the server, including confidentiality, integrity, and availability.  Denial of service is also possible.
*   **Attack Vector:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can send a specially crafted message over TCP to the affected server.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs the ability to send network packets to the server. No authentication is required.
*   **Affected Product:** EMC Documentum eRoom versions 7.x
*   **Solution:** Upgrade to EMC Documentum eRoom 7.4.3.f or later.  The HummingBird Client Connector has been replaced by a new interface that is not susceptible to this vulnerability.
