## EMC Documentum eRoom Indexing Server OpenText HummingBird Connector Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-11-236ZDI-CAN-1079

| CVE ID | [CVE-2011-1741](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-1741) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 10.0, [AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=2.0&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [EMC](http://www.emc.com/) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | [Documentum eRoom](http://www.emc.com/products/detail/software/eroom.htm) |
| TREND MICRO CUSTOMER PROTECTION | Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID ['11443']. For further product information on the TippingPoint IPS: <http://www.tippingpoint.com> |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of EMC Documentum eRoom Indexing Server. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within the bundled implementation of OpenText's HummingBird Connector. When parsing a particular packet received from a TCP connection, the application will attempt to copy part of the packet's contents into a buffer located on the stack. Due to not completely accommodating for the size of the data in the packet, the application will overwrite variables positioned after the buffer. This can lead to code execution under the context of the server. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | EMC has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at:  <http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/518897/30/0/threaded> |
| DISCLOSURE TIMELINE | * 2011-01-21 - Vulnerability reported to vendor * 2011-07-18 - Coordinated public release of advisory |

Hash: SHA1
ESA-2011-022: EMC Documentum eRoom Indexing Server HummingBird Client Connector Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
EMC Identifier: ESA-2011-022
CVE Identifier: CVE-2011-1741
Severity Rating: CVSS v2 Base Score: 9.3 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)
Affected products:
EMC Documentum eRoom versions 7.x
Vulnerability Summary:
EMC Documentum eRoom?s Indexing Server contains a buffer overflow vulnerability which can be exploited to cause a denial of service, or possibly, arbitrary code execution.
Vulnerability Details:
The HummingBird Client Connector (ftserver.exe) used by affected versions of EMC Documentum eRoom?s Indexing Server contains a buffer overflow vulnerability. The vulnerability may allow a remote unauthenticated user to send a specially-crafted message over TCP to cause a denial of service, or possibly, execute arbitrary code.
Problem Resolution:
The following EMC Documentum eRoom products contain resolutions to this issue. The HummingBird Client Connector has been replaced by a new interface which is not susceptible to this vulnerability.
? EMC Documentum eRoom 7.4.3.f.
EMC strongly recommends all customers upgrade at the earliest opportunity.
Link to remedies:
Registered EMC Powerlink customers can download software from Powerlink.
For EMC Documentum eRoom Software, navigate in Powerlink to Home > Support > Software Downloads and Licensing > Downloads D > Documentum eRoom
EMC has created an eRoom Sizing Tool with related documentation that helps customers with the eRoom deployment sizing process. EMC strongly recommends that eRoom Administrators read and understand the provided documentation, run the eRoom Sizing Tool and review its results, perform the eRoom 7.4.3 upgrade to a test or staging environment, and complete thorough performance testing in the test or staging environment prior to a production upgrade. Failure to complete these steps may lead to an unplanned eRoom 7.4.3 outage. Refer to EMC ETA esg112401 for the details.
Because the view is restricted based on customer agreements, you may not have permission to view certain downloads. Should you not see a software download you believe you should have access to, follow the instructions in EMC Knowledgebase solution emc116045.
