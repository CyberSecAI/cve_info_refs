{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `fnmatch()` function in glibc used `alloca()` to allocate memory on the stack based on the length of a user-supplied UTF-8 string multiplied by four. An integer overflow could occur in this calculation, and the large allocation could cause a stack overflow or other unexpected behavior due to stack pointer wrapping. Additionally, there could be an out-of-bounds read due to incorrect end-of-string checks.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use of alloca() for potentially large, user-controlled allocations.",
      "Integer overflow during size calculation.",
      "Insufficient checks when comparing string pointers",
       "Lack of stack protection mechanisms (e.g., DEP, stack canaries) in some environments."
    ],
    "impact": "Application crash due to stack overflow or memory corruption. In some cases, specifically on 32-bit systems without DEP, it could lead to arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": "By providing a specially crafted long UTF-8 string to the `fnmatch()` function as the `string` argument along with a specially crafted `pattern` argument..",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to control the input string passed to the `fnmatch()` function."
