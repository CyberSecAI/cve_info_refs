Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2011-1772

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper output escaping of user-provided data within automatically generated error pages in Apache Struts, specifically when handling action names and method names. This occurs when Dynamic Method Invocation (DMI) is enabled and no custom error handling is defined, leading to the inclusion of unsanitized user input directly into the HTML output.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** User-supplied data, specifically within the action and method attributes of the `<s:submit>` tag (when using bash syntax), is not properly encoded before being included in error messages. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript into the HTML response, which is then executed by the victim's browser.
- **Exposure of internal paths:** The error messages also reveal internal paths for Java classes that implement the actions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary script execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser. This could lead to various malicious activities, such as:
    - Stealing session cookies, leading to account hijacking.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Defacing web pages.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Manipulated Action Names:** An attacker can inject malicious code into the action name part of a URL. This is triggered when the requested action does not exist.
- **Manipulated Method Names:** An attacker can inject malicious code into the method name part of a URL when DMI is enabled. This is triggered when the requested method does not exist in the action class.
- **Specific Struts tag usage:** The vulnerability is triggered when using the `<s:submit>` tag with bash syntax in JSP pages to call actions and methods.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Struts application.
- **No Authentication Required**: The attacker does not need any credentials to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Knowledge of Struts/XWork:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of how Struts and XWork handle actions and errors, especially how DMI and error pages are generated.
- **Ability to Craft Malicious URLs/Requests:** The attacker needs to craft URLs or POST requests with malicious JavaScript embedded in the action or method parameters.
- **No User Interaction** is required beyond normal browsing.
- **Vulnerable Configuration:** DMI must be enabled, and no declarative error handling rules must be defined in the struts.xml configuration file.

**Additional Notes:**
- The issue affects Apache Struts versions prior to 2.2.3.1, including 2.0.x.
- The vulnerability is present in the XWork framework, which is used by Struts. Other applications using XWork could be vulnerable.
- The provided blog post gives a detailed view of the vulnerability and steps to reproduce.
- The vulnerability is fixed in Struts 2.2.3 by output encoding action names in generated error pages.
- The vulnerability was reported by Marian Ventuneac.
