Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2011-1771

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a null pointer dereference in the `cifsFileInfo_put` function within the CIFS (Common Internet File System) kernel module.
- This occurs when attempting to create a file with the `O_DIRECT` flag on a CIFS filesystem. CIFS does not support `O_DIRECT`, leading to a failure and improper handling of file structures.
- Specifically, in some cases, the `filp->private_data` is not set before being dereferenced in `cifsFileInfo_put`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Null Pointer Dereference:** The core issue is dereferencing a null pointer (`cifs_file->dentry`) within the `cifsFileInfo_put` function. The function expects a valid `cifsFileInfo` struct, which contains a dentry pointer (`dentry`). When `O_DIRECT` is used and an error occurs, this dentry pointer can be null, causing the crash. This null pointer is the `filp->private_data` which is expected to be set but isn't.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Kernel Crash (Denial of Service):** The primary impact of this vulnerability is a kernel crash, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS). The system becomes unstable and potentially unusable due to the kernel panic.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** A local user with the ability to mount a CIFS share can trigger the vulnerability by creating a file with the `O_DIRECT` flag. This could be a user with shell access or an application attempting to perform file operations on the CIFS share.
- **File System Operations:** The vulnerability is triggered when a file is opened with the `O_DIRECT` flag, which is passed down to the CIFS module.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have the ability to mount and perform file operations on a CIFS share.
- They also need the ability to specify the `O_DIRECT` flag when opening a file.

**Technical Details:**
- The crash occurs in the `cifsFileInfo_put` function at the line where it tries to access `cifs_file->dentry->d_inode`. The dereference of `cifs_file->dentry`, when it's NULL, results in a kernel oops.
- The vulnerability was introduced by commit `cdff08e7` in the Linux kernel, which was part of a patchset to clean up filehandle management in CIFS.
- The fix involves checking if `filp->private_data` is NULL before attempting to dereference it in the `cifsFileInfo_put` function, thus preventing the null pointer dereference.

**Affected Versions:**
- The vulnerability affects Linux kernels which include the vulnerable commit, including at least 2.6.38.2.
- Specifically mentioned: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6
- Not affected: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux MRG

**Mitigation:**
- The vulnerability is fixed by an upstream commit: `7797069305d13252fd66cf722aa8f2cbeb3c95cd`. The fix is a simple null check before dereferencing the pointer.

**Additional Notes:**
- CIFS does not support `O_DIRECT`, and attempts to use it should result in an error, which is why the dentry pointer is null.
-  The `forcedirectio` mount option might provide similar functionality but proper `O_DIRECT` support is still missing.
- The issue is a regression caused by changes in how filehandles are handled.
