Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-1523:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a failure to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `layer` parameter of the Nagios network status map CGI script (`statusmap.cgi`). This allows injection of arbitrary web script or HTML.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is an XSS flaw. This allows a remote attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web page viewed by a user, leading to potential execution of arbitrary code in the victim's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript or HTML in the user's browser.
- **Data Modification:**  The injected script can modify the content displayed on the page.
- **Data Theft:** The attacker could potentially steal sensitive information (e.g. cookies, session tokens) from the user.
- **Confidential Data Exposure:**  The attacker could steal or modify confidential data within the same domain of the Nagios instance.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through a specially crafted HTTP GET request to `statusmap.cgi`.
- **Malicious Parameter:** The malicious code is embedded in the `layer` parameter of the request.
  Example:  `http://site/nagios/cgi-bin/statusmap.cgi?layer=' onmouseover="alert('XSS')" '`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can be remote and does not need direct access to the Nagios server.
- **Ability to Craft Malicious URLs:** The attacker needs to craft malicious URLs that contain the XSS payload in the `layer` parameter.
- **Social Engineering:**  Attackers would typically trick users into clicking the malicious links or navigating to pages containing the malicious links.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability is in a publicly accessible CGI script and doesn't require prior authentication.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was reported by Jan Lieskovsky.
- A patch for this issue was committed upstream on 2011-09-07, which escapes the layer string.
- Affected versions of Nagios are shipped with Red Hat HPC Solution, Fedora 13 and 14, and EPEL-4, EPEL-5, and EPEL-6 repositories.
- Ubuntu releases 11.04, 10.10 and 10.04 were also vulnerable and have received updates.
- Red Hat has marked the Red Hat HPC Solution as End of Life (EOL) and therefore will not be patching it.
