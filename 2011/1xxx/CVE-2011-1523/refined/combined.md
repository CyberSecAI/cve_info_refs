# USN-1151-1: Nagios vulnerabilities

15 June 2011

An attacker could modify or steal data if you were tricked into clicking on
a special link to Nagios.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 11.04](/security/notices?release=natty)
* [Ubuntu 10.10](/security/notices?release=maverick)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [nagios3](/security/cves?package=nagios3) - A host/service/network monitoring and management system

## Details

Stefan Schurtz discovered than Nagios did not properly sanitize its input

when processing certain requests, resulting in cross-site scripting (XSS)

vulnerabilities. With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were

tricked into viewing server output during a crafted server request, a

remote attacker could exploit this to modify the contents, or steal

confidential data, within the same domain.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 11.04

* [nagios3-cgi](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/nagios3)
  -
  [3.2.3-1ubuntu1.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/nagios3/3.2.3-1ubuntu1.2)

##### Ubuntu 10.10

* [nagios3-cgi](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/nagios3)
  -
  [3.2.1-2ubuntu1.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/nagios3/3.2.1-2ubuntu1.2)

##### Ubuntu 10.04

* [nagios3-cgi](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/nagios3)
  -
  [3.2.0-4ubuntu2.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/nagios3/3.2.0-4ubuntu2.2)

After a standard system update you need to restart Nagios to make

all the necessary changes.

Subject: CVE Request -- Nagios -- XSS in the network status map CGI script

Hello Steve, vendors,

   Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Nagios allows remote
attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via specially-crafted
'layer' parameter passed to the Nagios network status map CGI script
(statusmap.cgi).

References:
[1] <http://tracker.nagios.org/view.php?id=207>
[2] <http://www.rul3z.de/advisories/SSCHADV2011-002.txt>
[3] <http://secunia.com/advisories/43287/>
[4] <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=690877>

Public PoC (from [2):
=====================
<http://site/nagios/cgi-bin/statusmap.cgi?layer='> onmouseover="alert('XSS')" '

This doesn't seem to have a CVE id yet, so could you allocate one?

Thanks && Regards, Jan.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).
