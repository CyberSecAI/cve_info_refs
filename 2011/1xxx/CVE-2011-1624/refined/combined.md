Bias-Free Language

### Bias-Free Language

The documentation set for this product strives to use bias-free language. For the purposes of this documentation set, bias-free is defined as language that does not imply discrimination based on age, disability, gender, racial identity, ethnic identity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and intersectionality. Exceptions may be present in the documentation due to language that is hardcoded in the user interfaces of the product software, language used based on RFP documentation, or language that is used by a referenced third-party product.

>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Windows 2000, XP, Vista, and Windows Server 2003.
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Internet Explorer 6.0, 7.0, Firefox 1.5, 2.0 or later with JavaScript enabled.
>
> The device manager verifies the browser version when starting a session and does not require a plug-in.
>
>
>
>
> ### Cluster Compatibility
>
> You cannot create and manage switch clusters through the device manager. To create and manage switch clusters, use the command-line interface (CLI) or the Network Assistant application.
>
> When creating a switch cluster or adding a switch to a cluster, follow these guidelines:
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)When you create a switch cluster, we recommend configuring the highest-end switch in your cluster as the command switch.
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)If you are managing the cluster through Network Assistant, the switch with the latest software should be the command switch.
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)The standby command switch must be the same type as the command switch. For example, if the command switch is a Cisco IE 3000 switch, all standby command switches must be Cisco IE 3000 switches.
>
> For additional information about clustering, see *Getting Started with Cisco Network Assistant* and *Release Notes for Cisco Network Assistant* (not orderable but available on Cisco.com), the software configuration guide, and the command reference.
>
>
>
> ### CNA Compatibility
>
> Cisco IOS 12.2(46)SE1 and later is only compatible with Cisco Network Assistant (CNA) 5.4 and later.
>
> ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)
>
> ---
>
>
> **Note** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CNA 5.4 does not support the cisco-ie-macros that were introduced in Cisco 12.2(55)SE and later. Using the new Smartport role names will cause CNA errors.

>
>
>
> ### Finding the Software Version and Feature Set
>
> The Cisco IOS image is stored as a bin file in a directory that is named with the Cisco IOS release. A subdirectory contains the files needed for web management. The image is stored on the compact flash memory card.
>
> You can use the **show version** privileged EXEC command to see the software version that is running on your switch. The second line of the display shows the version.
>
> You can also use the **dir** filesystem: privileged EXEC command to see the directory names of other software images that you might have stored in flash memory.
>
>
>
> ### Deciding Which Files to Use
>
> The upgrade procedures in these release notes describe how to perform the upgrade by using a combined tar file. This file contains the Cisco IOS image file and the files needed for the embedded device manager. You must use the combined tar file to upgrade the switch through the device manager. To upgrade the switch through the command-line interface (CLI), use the tar file and the **archive download-sw** privileged EXEC command.
>
> [Table 4](#wp39614) lists the filenames for this software release.
>
> If you download the IP services image and plan to use Layer 3 functionality, you must use the Switch Database Management (SDM) routing template. To see which template is currently active template, enter the **show sdm prefer** privileged EXEC command. If necessary, change the SDM template to the routing template by entering the **sdm prefer routing** global configuration command. You will be prompted to reload the switch to activate the new template.
>
> ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)
>
> ---
>
>
> **Note** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)The switch must be running Cisco IOS Release 12.2(52)SE or later to configure the routing template.

>
>
> Table 4 Cisco IOS Software Image Files
>
>
> | Filename | Description |
> | --- | --- |
> | ies-lanbasek9-tar.122-58.SE1.tar | Cisco IE 3000 cryptographic image file and device manager files with Layer 2+, Kerberos, and SSH features. |
> | ies-ipservicesk9-tar.122-58.SE1.tar | Cisco IE 3000 IP services cryptographic image and device manager files with Kerberos, SSH, Layer 2+, and full Layer 3 features. |
>
>
>
>
>
> ### Archiving Software Images
>
> Before upgrading your switch software, make sure that you have archived copies of the current Cisco IOS release and the Cisco IOS release to which you are upgrading. You should keep these archived images until you have upgraded all devices in the network to the new Cisco IOS image and until you have verified that the new Cisco IOS image works properly in your network.
>
> Cisco routinely removes old Cisco IOS versions from Cisco.com. See *Product Bulletin 2863* for more information:
> <http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/iosswrel/ps8802/ps6969/ps1835/prod_bulletin0900aecd80281c0e.html>
>
> You can copy the bin software image file on the flash memory to the appropriate TFTP directory on a host by using the **copy flash: tftp:** privileged EXEC command.
>
> ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)
>
> ---
>
>
> **Note** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Although you can copy any file on the flash memory to the TFTP server, it is time consuming to copy all of the HTML files in the tar file. We recommend that you download the tar file from Cisco.com and archive it on an internal host in your network.
>
> ---
>
>
> You can also configure the switch as a TFTP server to copy files from one switch to another without using an external TFTP server by using the **tftp-server** global configuration command. For more information about the **tftp-server** command, see the "Basic File Transfer Services Commands" section of the *Cisco IOS Configuration Fundamentals Command Reference, Release 12.2*:
> <http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/fundamentals/command/reference/cf_t1.html>
>
>
>
> ### Upgrading a Switch by Using the Device Manager or Network Assistant
>
> You can upgrade switch software by using the device manager or Network Assistant. For detailed instructions, click **Help**.
>
> ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)
>
> ---
>
>
> **Note** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)When using the device manager to upgrade your switch, do not use or close your browser session after the upgrade process begins. Wait until after the upgrade process completes.
>
> ---
>
>
>
>
> ### Upgrading a Switch by Using the CLI
>
> This procedure is for copying the combined tar file to the switch. You copy the file to the switch from a TFTP server and extract the files. You can download an image file and replace or keep the current image.
>
> ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)
>
> ---
>
>
> **Note** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Make sure that the compact flash card is inserted into the switch before downloading the software.
>
> ---
>
>
> To download software, follow these steps:
>
> ---
>
>
>
> **Step 1** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Use [Table 4](#wp39614) to identify the file that you want to download.
>
> **Step 2** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Download the software image file:
>
>  **a.** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)If you are a registered customer, go to this URL and log in.
>
> <http://www.cisco.com/cisco/software/navigator.html?a=ahttp://www.cisco.com/cisco/web/download/index.htmli=rpm>
>
>  **b.** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Navigate to **Switches** > **Industrial Ethernet Switches**.
>
>  **c.** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Navigate to your switch model.
>
>  **d.** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Click **IOS Software**, then select the latest IOS release.
>
>  **e.** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Download the image you identified in [Step 1](#wp65278).
>
> **Step 3** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Copy the image to the appropriate TFTP directory on the workstation, and make sure that the TFTP server is properly configured.
> For more information, see the *Cisco IE 3000 Switch Software Configuration Guide*.
>
> **Step 4** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Log into the switch through the console port or a Telnet session.
>
> **Step 5** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)(Optional) Ensure that you have IP connectivity to the TFTP server by entering thisprivileged EXEC command:
>
>
> ```
> Switch# ping tftp-server-address
>
> ```
>
>
> ```
>
>
> ```
>
> For more information about assigning an IP address and default gateway to the switch, see the software configuration guide for this release.
>
> **Step 6** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Download the image file from the TFTP server to the switch. If you are installing the same version of software that is currently on the switch, overwrite the current image by entering this privileged EXEC command:
>
>
> ```
> Switch# archive download-sw /overwrite /reload
> tftp:[[//location]/directory]/image-name.tar
>
> ```
>
>
> ```
>
>
> ```
>
> The **/overwrite** option overwrites the software image in flash memory with the downloaded one.
>
> The **/reload** option reloads the system after downloading the image unless the configuration has been changed and not saved.
>
> For **//**location, specify the IP address of the TFTP server.
>
> For /*directory*/image-name.tar, specify the directory (optional) and the image to download. Directory and image names are case sensitive.
>
> This example shows how to download an image from a TFTP server at 198.30.20.19 and to overwrite the image on the switch:
>
>
> ```
> Switch# archive download-sw /overwrite tftp://198.30.20.19/image-name.tar
>
> ```
>
>
> ```
>
>
> ```
>
> You can also download the image file from the TFTP server to the switch and keep the current image by replacing the **/overwrite** option with the **/leave-old-sw** option.
>

>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)A static IP address might be removed when the previously acquired DHCP IP address lease expires.
>
> This problem occurs under these conditions:
>
> –![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)When the switch is booted up without a configuration (no config.text file in flash memory).
>
> –![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)When the switch is connected to a DHCP server that is configured to give an address to it (the dynamic IP address is assigned to VLAN 1).

> ### Ethernet
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Traffic on EtherChannel ports is not perfectly load-balanced. Egress traffic on EtherChannel ports are distributed to member ports on load balance configuration and traffic characteristics like MAC or IP address. More than one traffic stream may map to same member ports based on hashing results calculated by the ASIC.
>
> If this happens, uneven traffic distribution will happen on EtherChannel ports.

>
>
>
>
> ### IP
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)When the rate of received DHCP requests exceeds 2,000 packets per minute for a long time, the response time might be slow when you are using the console.
>
> The workaround is to use rate limiting on DHCP traffic to prevent a denial of service attack from occurring. (CSCeb59166)
>
>
>
> ### Multicasting
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)If the number of multicast routes and Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) groups are more than the maximum number specified by the **show sdm prefer** global configuration command, the traffic received on unknown groups is flooded in the received VLAN even though the **show ip igmp snooping multicast-table** privileged EXEC command output shows otherwise.
>
> The workaround is to reduce the number of multicast routes and IGMP snooping groups to less than the maximum supported value. (CSCdy09008)
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)IGMP filtering is applied to packets that are forwarded through hardware. It is not applied to packets that are forwarded through software. Hence, with multicast routing enabled, the first few packets are sent from a port even when IGMP filtering is set to deny those groups on that port.
>
> There is no workaround. (CSCdy82818)
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)If an IGMP report packet has two multicast group records, the switch removes or adds interfaces depending on the order of the records in the packet:
>
> –![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)If the ALLOW\_NEW\_SOURCE record is before the BLOCK\_OLD\_SOURCE record, the switch removes the port from the group.
>
> –![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)If the BLOCK\_OLD\_SOURCE record is before the ALLOW\_NEW\_SOURCE record, the switch adds the port to the group.
>
> There is no workaround. (CSCec20128)
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)When IGMP snooping is disabled and you enter the **switchport block multicast** interface configuration command, IP multicast traffic is not blocked.
>
> The **switchport block multicast** interface configuration command is only applicable to non-IP multicast traffic.
>
> There is no workaround. (CSCee16865)
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Incomplete multicast traffic can be seen under either of these conditions:
>
> –![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)You disable IP multicast routing or re-enable it globally on an interface.
>
> –![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)A switch mroute table temporarily runs out of resources and recovers later.
>
> The workaround is to enter the **clear ip mroute** privileged EXEC command on the interface. (CSCef42436)
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)After you configure a switch to join a multicast group by entering the **ip igmp join-group** group-address interface configuration command, the switch does not receive join packets from the client, and the switch port connected to the client is removed from the IGMP snooping forwarding table.
>
> Use one of these workarounds:
>
> –![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Cancel membership in the multicast group by using the **no ip igmp join-group** group-address interface configuration command on an SVI.
>
> –![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Disable IGMP snooping on the VLAN interface by using the **no ip igmp snooping vlan** vlan-id global configuration command. (CSCeh90425)
>
>
>
> ### QoS
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Some switch queues are disabled if the buffer size or threshold level is set too low with the **mls qos queue-set output** global configuration command. The ratio of buffer size to threshold level should be greater than 10 to avoid disabling the queue.
>
> The workaround is to choose compatible buffer sizes and threshold levels. (CSCea76893)
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)When auto-QoS is enabled on the switch, priority queuing is not enabled. Instead, the switch uses shaped round robin (SRR) as the queuing mechanism. The auto-QoS feature is designed on each platform based on the feature set and hardware limitations, and the queuing mechanism supported on each platform might be different.
>
> There is no workaround. (CSCee22591)
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)If you configure a large number of input interface VLANs in a class map, a traceback message similar to this might appear:
>
>
> ```
> 01:01:32: %BIT-4-OUTOFRANGE: bit 1321 is not in the expected range of 0 to 1024
>
> ```
>
>
> ```
>
>
> ```
>
> There is no impact to switch functionality.
>
> There is no workaround. (CSCtg32101)
>
>
>
>
> ### SPAN and RSPAN
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP), VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP), and Port Aggregation Protocol (PAgP) packets received from a SPAN source are not sent to the destination interfaces of a local SPAN session.
>
> The workaround is to use the **monitor session** *session\_number* destination {**interface** interface-id **encapsulation replicate**}global configuration command for local SPAN. (CSCed24036)
>
>
>
> ### Trunking
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)The switch treats frames received with mixed encapsulation (IEEE 802.1Q and Inter-Switch Link [ISL]) as frames with FCS errors, increments the error counters, and the port LED blinks amber. This happens when an ISL-unaware device receives an ISL-encapsulated packet and forwards the frame to an IEEE 802.1Q trunk interface.
>
> There is no workaround. (CSCdz33708)
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)IP traffic with IP options set is sometimes leaked on a trunk port. For example, a trunk port is a member of an IP multicast group in VLAN X but is not a member in VLAN Y. If VLAN Y is the output interface for the multicast route entry assigned to the multicast group and an interface in VLAN Y belongs to the same multicast group, the IP-option traffic received on an input VLAN interface other than one in VLAN Y is sent on the trunk port in VLAN Y because the trunk port is forwarding in VLAN Y, even though the port has no group membership in VLAN Y.
>
> There is no workaround. (CSCdz42909).
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)For trunk ports or access ports configured with IEEE 802.1Q tagging, inconsistent statistics might appear in the **show interfaces counters** privileged EXEC command output. Valid IEEE 802.1Q frames of 64 to 66 bytes are correctly forwarded even though the port LED blinks amber, and the frames are not counted on the interface statistics.
>
> There is no workaround. (CSCec35100).
>
>
>
> ### VLAN
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)If the number of VLANs times the number of trunk ports exceeds the recommended limit of 13,000, the switch can fail.
>
> The workaround is to reduce the number of VLANs or trunks. (CSCeb31087)
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)When line rate traffic is passing through a dynamic port, and you enter the switchport access vlan dynamic interface configuration command for a range of ports, the VLANs might not be assigned correctly. One or more VLANs with a null ID appears in the MAC address table instead.
>
> The workaround is to enter the switchport access vlan dynamic interface configuration command separately on each port. (CSCsi26392)
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)When many VLANs are configured on the switch, high CPU utilization occurs when many links are flapping at the same time.
>
> The workaround is to remove unnecessary VLANs to reduce CPU utilization when many links are flapping. (CSCtl04815)
>
>
>
> ### Device Manager Limitations
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)When you are prompted to accept the security certificate and you click *No*, you only see a blank screen, and the device manager does not launch.
>
> The workaround is to click *Yes* when you are prompted to accept the certificate. (CSCef45718)
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)When you successfully upgrade an image by using device manager and click *No* when prompted to reload the image, device manager becomes unusable.
>
> The workaround is to manually reload the switch. (CSCsj88169)

>
> ### Device Manager Notes
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)You cannot create and manage switch clusters through the device manager. To create and manage switch clusters, use the CLI or Cisco Network Assistant.
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)We recommend this browser setting to speed up the time needed to display the device manager from Microsoft Internet Explorer.

>
>  **2.** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Click **Settings** in the "Temporary Internet files" area.
>
>  **3.** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)From the Settings window, choose **Automatically**.

>  **5.** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Click **OK** to exit the Internet Options window.
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)The HTTP server interface must be enabled to display the device manager. By default, the HTTP server is enabled on the switch. Use the **show running-config** privileged EXEC command to see if the HTTP server is enabled or disabled.
>
> Beginning in privileged EXEC mode, follow these steps to configure the HTTP server interface:
>
>
> |  | Command | Purpose |
> | --- | --- | --- |
> | Step 1 | **configure terminal** | Enter global configuration mode. |
> | Step 2 | ip http authentication {**aaa |** enable | local} | Configure the HTTP server interface for the type of authentication that you want to use.  •**aaa**—Enable the authentication, authorization, and accounting feature. You must enter the aaa new-model interface configuration command for the **aaa** keyword to appear.  •enable—Enable password, which is the default method of HTTP server user authentication, is used.  •local—Local user database, as defined on the Cisco router or access server, is used. |
> | Step 3 | **end** | Return to privileged EXEC mode. |
> | Step 4 | **show running-config** | Verify your entries. |
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)The device manager uses the HTTP protocol (the default is port 80) and the default method of authentication (the enable password) to communicate with the switch through any of its Ethernet ports and to allow switch management from a standard web browser.
>
> If you change the HTTP port, you must include the new port number when you enter the IP address in the browser **Location** or **Address** field (for example, http://10.1.126.45:184 where 184 is the new HTTP port number). You should write down the port number through which you are connected. Use care when changing the switch IP information.
>
> If you are *not* using the default method of authentication (the enable password), you need to configure the HTTP server interface with the method of authentication used on the switch.
>
> Beginning in privileged EXEC mode, follow these steps to configure the HTTP server interface:
>
>
> |  | Command | Purpose |

> When a switch running Multiple Spanning Tree (MST) is connected to a switch running Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP), the MST switch acts as the root bridge and runs per-VLAN spanning tree (PVST) simulation mode on boundary ports connected to the RST switch. If the allowed VLAN on all trunk ports connecting these switches is changed to a VLAN other than VLAN 1 and the root port of the RSTP switch is shut down and then enabled, the boundary ports connected to the root port move immediately to the forward state without going through the PVST+ slow transition.

> ### Updates to the Getting Started Guide
>
>
> ### Express Setup
>
> When you launch Express Setup, you are prompted for the switch password. Enter the default password, *cisco*. The switch ignores text in the username field. Before you complete and exit Express Setup, you must change the password from the default password, *cisco*.
>
> In the "Running Express Setup" section of the *Cisco IE 3000 Switch Getting Started Guide*,
> Steps 8 to 10 have changed.
>
>
> ### Running Express Setup:
>
> To run Express Setup:
>
>
> | Step 1 | Make sure that nothing is connected to the switch.  During Express Setup, the switch acts as a DHCP server. If your PC has a static IP address, change your PC settings before you begin to temporarily use DHCP. |  |
> | --- | --- | --- |
> | Step 2 | Connect power to the switch.  See the wiring instructions in the "Grounding the Switch" section and the "Wiring the DC Power Source" section. | |
> | Step 3 | When the switch powers on, it begins the power-on self-test (POST). During POST, the System LED blinks while a series of tests verify that the switch functions properly. Wait for the switch to complete POST, which takes approximately 1 minute. | |
> | Step 4 | Make sure that POST has completed by verifying that the System LED is solid green. If the switch has not been configured, the Setup LED blinks green. If the Setup LED stops blinking, you can still continue with the next step.  If the switch fails POST, the System LED turns red. See the "In Case of Difficulty" section if your switch fails POST. | |
> | Step 5 | Press the Express Setup button. This button is recessed behind the front panel, so you can use a simple tool, such as a paper clip.  When you press the Express Setup button, a switch port LED begins blinking green. |  |
> | Step 6 | Connect a Category 5 Ethernet cable (not provided) from the blinking switch port to the Ethernet port on your PC.  The port LEDs on your PC and the switch blink green while the switch configures the connection. |  |
> | Step 7 | When the Setup LED turns solid green, start a browser session on the PC. | |
> | Step 8 | The Express Setup window automatically appears. If the window does not appear, verify that any proxy settings or pop-up blockers are disabled on your browser and that any wireless client is disabled on your PC. You might also need to enter a URL in your browser, such as *Cisco.com* or another well-known website. If you need help, see the "In Case of Difficulty" section.    ---    **Note** If the switch has been previously configured, the device manager page appears. You can use it to change the switch IP address.   --- | |
> | Step 9 | Enter the network settings. All entries must be in English letters and Arabic numbers.  •**Management Interface (VLAN)**: We recommend using the default, **VLAN 1**. The management VLAN establishes an IP connection to the switch.  •**IP Assignment Mode**: We recommend using the default, **Static**, which means that the switch always has the IP address that you assign. Use the **DHCP** setting when you want the switch to automatically obtain an IP address from a DHCP server.  •**IP Address**: Enter the IP address for the switch. Later, you can use the IP address to access the switch through the device manager.  •**Subnet Mask**: Select a mask from the drop-down list.  •**Default Gateway**: Enter the IP address of the router.  •**Password**: Enter a password. The password can be from 1 to 25 alphanumeric characters, can start with a number, is case sensitive, allows embedded spaces, but does not allow spaces at the beginning or end. In the **Confirm Password** field, enter the password again.  For more information about the network settings, click **Help** on the toolbar. | |
> | Step 10 | Enter the Control Industrial Protocol (CIP) VLAN settings:  •**CIP VLAN**: Enter the VLAN on which CIP will be enabled. The CIP VLAN can be the same as the management VLAN, or you can isolate CIP traffic on another VLAN that is already configured on the switch. The default CIP VLAN ID is **VLAN 1**.  •**IP Address**: Enter the IP address for the CIP VLAN. If the CIP VLAN is different from the management VLAN, you must specify an IP address for the CIP VLAN. Make sure that the IP address that you assign to the switch is not being used by another device in your network.  •**Subnet Mask**: Select a mask from the drop-down list.  For more information about the CIP VLAN settings, click **Help** on the toolbar. | |
> | Step 11 | Enter the Optional Settings now, or enter them later by using the device manager interface:  •Enter a **Host Name** for the switch.  •Select Enable or Disable for Telnet access. If enabled, enter and confirm the Telnet password in the **Password** fields.  •The date and time fields are populated from your PC.  •Click **Enable** to use Daylight Saving Time.  For more information about the optional settings, click **Help** on the toolbar. | |
> | Step 12 | Click **Submit** to save the information that you entered and to finish the basic configuration. You have completed the initial switch setup. If you click **Cancel**, the fields are cleared, and you can start over. | |
> | Step 13 | Turn off DC power at the source, disconnect all cables to the switch, and install the switch in your network. See the "Managing the Switch" section for information about configuring and managing the switch. | |
>
>
> ### Warning Statement 1067
>
> This warning statement has been removed from the *Cisco IE 3000 Switch Getting Started Guide* on Cisco.com.
>
>
> ### Grounding the Switch
>
> Step 6: Use a ratcheting torque screwdriver to tighten the ground screw and ring terminal lug to the switch front panel to 8.5 in-lb, the maximum recommended torque.
>
>
> ### Wiring the DC Power Source
>
> Step 6: Use a ratcheting torque flathead screwdriver to torque the power and relay connector captive screws (above the installed wire leads) to 2 in-lb, the maximum recommended torque.
>
>
> ### Resetting the Switch
>
> Follow these steps to return your switch to the factory default settings. These are reasons why you might want to reset the switch:
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)You installed the switch in your network and cannot connect to it because you assigned the wrong IP address.
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)You want to clear all configurations from the switch and assign a new IP address.
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)You want to reset the password on the switch.
>
> ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/caut.gif)
>
> ---
>
>
>
> **Caution**
> ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Resetting the switch deletes the configuration and reboots the switch.
>
> ---
>
>
> To reset the password on the switch:
>
>  **1.** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Power off the switch.
>
>  **2.** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Power on the switch, and at the same time, press and hold down the Express Setup button until all the system LEDs turn red.
>
>  **3.** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Release the Express Setup button, and the switch continues to boot.
>
> After the switch restarts, continue to run Express Setup.
>
>
>
> ### Updates to the Regulatory Compliance and Safety Information for the Cisco IE 3000 Switch

Hi,

Have you run the **Show Processes CPU** command to see what that says? It may point towards the specific process that is causing the high CPU utilisation.

Hope this helps,

Jonathan

Hi,

I have found the following post which relates to the LED Process:

[https://supportforums.cisco.com/message/608643](/message/608643#608643)

Seems that the percentage you are seeing is considered normal behaviour with regards to the Hulc LED Process on a 2960, are you noticing any performance problems that you think may be related to the CPU utilisation?

Many thanks

Jonathan

Hi.

We have same problem.

We installed six 2960S.

All switch is high CPU.

CPU utilization for five seconds: 63%/40%; one minute: 44%; five minutes: 59%
 PID Runtime(ms)   Invoked      uSecs   5Sec   1Min   5Min TTY Process
   1           0         7          0  0.00%  0.00%  0.00%   0 Chunk Manager
   2        7233    395600         18  0.00%  0.00%  0.00%   0 Load Meter
   3        2460      1250       1968  0.00%  0.00%  0.00%   0 SpanTree Helper

I think maybe IOS bug.

We plan to upgrade IOS to 12.2(55)SE.

If we sloved this problem and I will tell you.

thanks.

Hi, Maker.

We plan to upgrade Nov.18.

Using six 2960-S is high CPU.

We buy two new 2960-S.

But this swich idle status is nomal CPU.

So, we testing more now before upgrade to 12.2(55)

Hi JunKun,

You might be running into one of these 2 bugs:

CSCtg86211    Hulc LED Process uses 6-15% CPU on Catalyst 2960/2960S 24/48-port switch

<http://tools.cisco.com/Support/BugToolKit/search/getBugDetails.do?method=fetchBugDetails&bugId=CSCtg86211>

-> expected behaviour

CSCth24278 Bug Details High CPU when no Console/VTY activity

<http://tools.cisco.com/Support/BugToolKit/search/getBugDetails.do?method=fetchBugDetails&bugId=CSCth24278>

-> will be in next 12.2SE release, 12.2(58)SE

Rgds,

Tom

Hi, maker.

I was received result of this case from TAC.

See the below.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It means our Development Engineer keep on touch this issue and investigate further.

Regarding to the bug, I was just informed that the fix for this issue

**will be integrated in 12.2(58)SE, and the approximate time is March,2011.**

**What’s more, the issue is cosmetic and has no impact to the system's**

functionality and performance, according to the confirmation from our Develop team.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thanks.

Correct JunKun,

this is purely cosmetic issue.

Have verified this as well in lab,

and this is also explained on the bug details on CCO:

I have tried 12.2 58 version on 2960S. High CPU Utilisation issue is fixed but there is another problem. Master reloads when we have SSH and Login Banners turned on. I disabled the banner which stopped rebooting the master but it started again.

Looks like 12.2 55 and 58 both are not stable versions.

Not sure which IOS to use now. Any suggestion?
