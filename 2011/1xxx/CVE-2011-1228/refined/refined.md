  "CVE-2011-1228": {
    "related": true,
    "description": "An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists due to the way that Windows Kernel-mode drivers manage pointers to kernel-mode driver objects. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in kernel mode. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a Null pointer de-reference due to the way kernel-mode drivers keep track of pointers to certain kernel-mode driver objects.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Null pointer dereference"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution in kernel mode, allowing an attacker to install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights, thus achieving elevation of privilege.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to exploit this vulnerability. The vulnerability could not be exploited remotely or by anonymous users.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to exploit the vulnerability. They would need to run a specially crafted application."
