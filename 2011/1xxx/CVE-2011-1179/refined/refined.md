**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Crash:** Exploiting this vulnerability can lead to a crash of the Firefox browser.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** There is a possibility of an attacker executing arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Firefox.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is a malicious webpage. An attacker could trick a user into visiting a specially crafted webpage while the SPICE plugin is enabled in Firefox.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to host a malicious webpage and convince a user with the vulnerable SPICE plugin enabled to visit it using Firefox.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability exists in the `spice-xpi` component.
- The fix for this issue involves changes in how the `nsPluginInstance`, getters, and setters are handled within the SPICE plugin code, as indicated in the attached patch.
- Red Hat has issued security advisories (RHSA-2011:0426 and RHSA-2011:0427) to address the vulnerability in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6, respectively.
