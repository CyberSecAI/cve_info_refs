Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2011-1987:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how Microsoft Excel improperly indexes an array of memory locations. Specifically, the software fails to perform proper bounds checking when accessing array indices, which can lead to out-of-bounds reads or writes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Out-of-Bounds Array Indexing:**  The core vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read or write due to the lack of proper bounds checking during array index access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to remote code execution, allowing an attacker to take complete control of the affected system.
*   **Full System Control:** An attacker can gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker can gain full control of the system, including the ability to install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Specially Crafted Excel Files:** The primary attack vector involves opening a specially crafted Excel file that triggers the out-of-bounds access during processing.
*   **Email Attachments:** An attacker can send the malicious Excel file as an email attachment.
*   **Web-Based Attacks:** An attacker can host the malicious Excel file on a website, enticing the user to visit it and open the file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to Craft Malicious Excel Files:** The attacker needs the ability to create an Excel file that exploits the out-of-bounds array indexing vulnerability.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to convince a user to open the malicious Excel file. This can be achieved through social engineering via email or by enticing the user to visit a malicious webpage and download the file.

**Additional Notes:**

*   Microsoft Office File Validation feature can help to mitigate this vulnerability, as it prompts the user before opening a potentially dangerous file.
*   Workarounds such as disabling the opening of files that fail file validation or using MOICE are suggested to prevent exploitation until the security update is applied.
*   The vulnerability is rated as "Important" by Microsoft because Office applications typically prompt a user before opening a document, meaning that an attacker must convince a user to take multiple actions to complete an exploit.
*   The vulnerability affects multiple versions of Microsoft Excel, including Microsoft Excel 2003, 2007, 2010, and the Excel Viewer, as well as Office for Mac.
