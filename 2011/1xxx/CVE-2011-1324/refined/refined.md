- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The management screen of multiple Buffalo routers contains a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability due to an issue in the handling of user requests.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can potentially alter router settings, including the login password, by tricking a logged-in user into visiting a malicious page.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to convince a logged-in user to visit a malicious page. This could be done via a malicious link or by embedding the malicious request in a viewed file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious page that sends the crafted request to the router, and the user must be logged into the management interface of the affected router when visiting this page.
