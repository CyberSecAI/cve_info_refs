```
{
  "CVE-2011-1885": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a null pointer de-reference due to the way kernel-mode drivers keep track of pointers to certain kernel-mode driver objects.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Null pointer de-reference",
      "Improper management of pointers to kernel-mode driver objects"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in kernel mode and take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full administrative rights.",
    "Attack vectors": "A locally logged-on attacker can run a specially crafted application to trigger the vulnerability.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to the system."
