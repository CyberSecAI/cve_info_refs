Based on the provided documents, here's the information related to CVE-2011-1239:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is caused by improper management of kernel-mode driver objects within the Windows kernel. Specifically, a "use-after-free" condition exists when these objects are not handled correctly.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Win32k Use-After-Free Vulnerability:** This is the primary vulnerability. The issue arises from improper handling of kernel-mode driver objects, leading to a situation where memory is accessed after it has been freed. This can lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Elevation of Privilege:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in kernel mode, taking complete control of the affected system.
*   **Complete System Control:** Attackers can install programs; view, change, or delete data; and create new accounts with full administrative rights.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Local Access:** An attacker needs to have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to the affected system.
*   **Malicious Application:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability by running a specially crafted application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Valid Logon Credentials:** The attacker needs to have a valid user account on the target machine.
*   **Local Access:** The attacker must be able to log on to the target system directly. Remote or anonymous exploitation is not possible.

**Additional details:**
*   The vulnerability is located in the `win32k.sys` driver, which is responsible for window management, screen output, and input collection.
*   Microsoft's security bulletin MS11-034 addresses this along with other related vulnerabilities.
*   This vulnerability was not publicly disclosed before the security bulletin was released, and there were no reports of exploitation at the time.
