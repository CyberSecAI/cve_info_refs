Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-1099:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation within the 'Quick Polls' application's `index.php` file, specifically when processing the `fct` and `p` parameters. The application fails to properly sanitize the `p` parameter, allowing for null-byte injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
1. **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** By manipulating the `p` parameter with path traversal sequences (e.g., `../../../../..`) and appending a null byte (`%00`), an attacker can include and view arbitrary files on the server.
2. **Local File Deletion (LFD):** Similarly, by manipulating the `p` parameter with path traversal and a null byte, an attacker can potentially delete arbitrary files on the server.
3.  **Null byte injection:** The application does not properly handle null bytes in the file path parameters, leading to premature string termination and unintended file access or deletion.

**Impact of exploitation:**
1.  **Information Disclosure:** Successful LFI exploitation allows attackers to read sensitive system files, such as `/etc/passwd`, potentially revealing user account information and other critical details.
2. **Data Loss/Denial of Service**:  Successful LFD exploitation can lead to deletion of crucial files, potentially causing application or system malfunction, data loss, or denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests to the `index.php` file of the `Quick Polls` application, with malicious values for the `fct` and `p` parameters, specifically injecting path traversal sequences and null bytes.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable `Quick Polls` application. No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability. The attacker must also know the application path. The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network. The vulnerability requires the `magic_quotes_gpc` PHP setting to be disabled.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerable version of the software is 1.0.1.
- The vulnerability was addressed in version 1.0.2.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 5.8/10, with exploitability being relatively high (8.6/10).
