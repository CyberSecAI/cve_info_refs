CVE-2011-1469
```
Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2011-1469:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance**
   - The content includes a bug report ([Bug #54092](bug.php?id=54092)) from bugs.php.net which describes a segmentation fault when using an FTP proxy.
   - In the security content of "OS X Lion v10.7.2 and Security Update 2011-006", it states that "Multiple vulnerabilities in PHP 5.3.4", including CVE-2011-1469, are addressed by updating PHP to version 5.3.6.
   - The provided content also has a change log for PHP version 5.3.6 and it lists CVE-2011-1469.
   - Based on this information, the content is relevant to CVE-2011-1469.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability**
   - The root cause lies in the way PHP handled stream context data associated with FTP wrappers when using an HTTP proxy.
   - Specifically, the `php_stream->wrapperdata` was incorrectly used to store arbitrary pointers. This pointer should have been an array `zval` (as its `zval*` type indicates). The correct location for the wrapper to drop an arbitrary pointer was `.wrapperthis`. The ftp dir wrapper should have used `.abstract` to store the stream instance specific data.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**
   - Improper management of memory within the FTP stream wrapper when using an HTTP proxy.
   - Incorrect use of `php_stream->wrapperdata`.

**4. Impact of Exploitation**
   - Exploitation could lead to a segmentation fault.
   - More severe consequences are possible due to the nature of the memory corruption, but this is not specifically detailed in the provided context.

**5. Attack Vectors**
   - The attack vector involves using the FTP stream wrapper with an HTTP proxy.
   - A specially crafted PHP script that utilizes `fopen()` with an FTP URI and a stream context configured to use a proxy can trigger the vulnerability.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**
   - An attacker needs the ability to execute a PHP script, which could be through a web server, CLI, or any other supported SAPI.
   - The attacker must also control or have access to an HTTP proxy.

**Additional Notes**
   - The bug report mentions that the issue was reproducible with Apache acting as the proxy.
   - The fix was implemented in SVN with revision number 308734 and involved changing the storage location of the wrapper data.
   - The report explicitly states that this issue is fixed in PHP 5.3.6, implying it affects prior versions, especially 5.2.17, which is the reported version used by the reporter in the bug report.
   - The vulnerability is present in both cli and web contexts, based on the report and the description from Apple.
