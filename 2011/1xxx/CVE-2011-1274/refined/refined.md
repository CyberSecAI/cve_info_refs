**CVE-2011-1274: Excel Out of Bounds Array Access Vulnerability**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is caused by a memory handling error when Microsoft Excel validates record information while parsing a specially crafted Excel file. This leads to an out-of-bounds array access, which can corrupt system memory.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Out-of-bounds array access during the parsing of a specially crafted Excel file.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the logged-on user. This could lead to complete control of the affected system, including the ability to install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts.
