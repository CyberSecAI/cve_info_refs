{
  "CVE-2011-1254": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists because Internet Explorer attempts to access an object that has not been correctly initialized or has been deleted.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Memory corruption due to improper object access."
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution with the same privileges as the logged-on user. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A specially crafted website that exploits the vulnerability when a user performs a drag-and-drop operation.",
      "Embedding a malicious ActiveX control marked 'safe for initialization' in an application or Microsoft Office document that hosts the IE rendering engine.",
       "Compromised websites or those hosting user-provided content or advertisements could also host the malicious content."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would need to create a specially crafted website and convince the user to visit the site and perform a drag-and-drop operation. Alternatively, an attacker may need to embed malicious ActiveX content in a document and convince a user to open it.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability is triggered during drag-and-drop operations on a specially crafted web page.  Users with fewer privileges may be less impacted than those with administrative rights. Internet Explorer 9 is not affected."
