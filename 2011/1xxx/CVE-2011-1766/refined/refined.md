Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-1766:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how MediaWiki handles user authentication when the `$wgBlockDisablesLogin` configuration option is enabled. Specifically, the `User::loadFromSession()` function loads user rights before verifying authentication tokens. This allowed an attacker to forge cookies with a victim's user ID and username and gain the victim's rights under certain circumstances, even if the attacker was unauthenticated.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure User Object Initialization:**  The user object's rights are populated based on the forged cookies *before* authentication token verification takes place.
*   **Insufficient Cache Clearing:** When authentication fails, the user rights cache `$this->mRights` is not properly cleared, allowing rights from the forged cookies to persist.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** Unauthenticated users can gain the privileges of a victim account, potentially leading to complete control over the affected wiki, depending on the rights of the victim. For example, a malicious user could gain sysop rights by forging the cookies of a sysop user.
*   **Account Takeover:** The vulnerability also allows a form of trivial account takeover, as described by liangent, where if a sysop logs in without the "Remember me" option, another person can use the same browser with the sysop's user ID cookie and cause the bug to appear.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Forged Cookies:** An attacker can craft cookies containing the user ID and username of a victim account.
*  **Browser Reuse:** A sysop logging in without using the "Remember me" functionality and then leaving the computer without logging out can expose their session to the next user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Forge Cookies:** The attacker needs to be able to set arbitrary cookie values in the user's browser.
*   **Targeted Wiki Configuration:** The target wiki must have the `$wgBlockDisablesLogin` setting enabled.
*  **Access to a previous user session (in the case of browser reuse scenario)**

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the `User::loadFromSession()` function in MediaWiki's codebase.
*   The fix involves moving the authentication token check before the blocked status check in `User::loadFromSession()`. An alternative fix is also described which clears the cache.
*   The original fix was found to be insufficient and was corrected with a more robust implementation that created a separate user object and only copied the validated rights to the actual user object.
*   The vulnerability is considered critical because of its potential for easy privilege escalation.
