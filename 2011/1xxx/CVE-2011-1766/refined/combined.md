| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=702512#c0)  Vincent Danen    2011-05-05 23:04:28 UTC  ``` Mediawiki 1.16.5 was released [1] to correct two security flaws:  The first issue is yet another recurrence of the Internet Explorer 6 XSS vulnerability that caused the release of 1.16.4. It was pointed out that there are dangerous extensions with more than four characters, so the regular expressions we introduced had to be updated to match longer extensions. ([CVE-2011-1765](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1765))  For more details, see <https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=28534>  The second issue allows unauthenticated users to gain additional rights, on wikis where $wgBlockDisablesLogin is enabled. By default, it is disabled. The issue occurs when a malicious user sends cookies which contain the user name and user ID of a "victim" account. In certain circumstances, the rights of the victim are loaded and persist throughout the malicious request, allowing the malicious user to perform actions with the victim's rights. ([CVE-2011-1766](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1766))  $wgBlockDisablesLogin is a feature which is sometimes used on private wikis to prevent users who have an account from logging in and viewing content on the wiki.  For more details, see <https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=28639>  [1] <http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/mediawiki-announce/2011-May/000098.html>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=702512#c1)  Vincent Danen    2011-05-05 23:08:29 UTC  ``` Created mediawiki tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 702513](show_bug.cgi?id=702513 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2011-1765 mediawiki: two vulnerabilities fixed in 1.16.5 [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=702512#c2)  Vincent Danen    2011-05-05 23:08:31 UTC  ``` Created mediawiki116 tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: epel-all [[bug 696362](show_bug.cgi?id=696362 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2011-1578 CVE-2011-1579 CVE-2011-1580 CVE-2011-1765 mediawiki116 various flaws [epel-all]")]   ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Description

Liangent reported the following vulnerability:

* Set $wgBlockDisablesLogin = true; in LocalSettings.php
* Make sure you're logged out in MediaWiki
* Set the wikiUserID and wikiUserName cookies to match those of a sysop
* Visit a sysop-only special page such as Special:BlockIP
* The special page will let you do whatever you want, because you have all the rights of the user whose cookies you forged, despite being an anon according to the user tools section

The following things happen in User::loadFromSession():

* $this->mId is set to the user ID from the forged cookie (line 900)
* isBlocked() is called (line 907), which calls getBlockedStatus() which calls isAllowed( 'ipblock-exempt' ) (line 1116), which calls getRights(), which fills the $this->mRights cache with the rights of the targeted user
* When the auth token mismatches, loadDefault() is called, but it doesn't clear the $this->mRights cache

The soon-to-be-attached patch fixes this by moving the auth token check up to before the blocked status check. An alternative fix would be to call clearInstanceCache( 'defaults' ) instead of loadDefault(), but I think this makes more sense.

It seems wikiUserName is unnecessary because the check before ->isBlocked() does not include user name check.

This does not happen only when someone has the ability to forge cookies. When a sysop is logging in without "Remember my password" checked, only session and/or token cookies are set as session cookies (cleared when the browser is closed). So after he/she closed the browser and thought he/she has logged out and left, the second person using this browser can have the sysop's user id cookie, causing this bug to appear.

The patch fixed the initial bug but didn't fix another related one which exists before.

If I'm a sysop on a $wgBlockDisablesLogin = true; site but I'm blocked by someone else, and I'm logging in with the correct password, it will still run into ->isBlocked() then finally ->getRights(), having ->mRights filled. Just as above, ->loadDefault() is called later after knowing I'm blocked, but I'll get all sysop rights.

Good catch. Attached updated patch that calls clearInstanceCache( 'defaults' ) instead of loadDefaults() in that code path.

Ouch. I had not realized this bug could be exploited by accident like that.

That was how I found this bug...

Patch that avoids putting strange things in $wgUser altogether

Roan's patch seems unconvincing to me. $wgUser is meant to be a representation of what the current user's rights are, the idea of having it set up to be an unauthenticated admin for any period of time makes me uneasy.

I made a patch which creates a separate user object for the user proposed by the cookie or session. Then it copies the relevant data into $wgUser once all checks are complete. It's attached. It should be harder for future developers to screw up. I don't really trust developers to read comments, even when they are written in capitals.

# [MediaWiki-announce] MediaWiki security release 1.16.5

Hash: SHA1

I would like to announce the release of MediaWiki 1.16.5. Two security
issues were discovered.

The first issue is yet another recurrence of the Internet Explorer 6
XSS vulnerability that caused the release of 1.16.4. It was pointed
out that there are dangerous extensions with more than four
characters, so the regular expressions we introduced had to be updated
to match longer extensions.

For more details, see <https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=28534>

The second issue allows unauthenticated users to gain additional
rights, on wikis where $wgBlockDisablesLogin is enabled. By default,
it is disabled. The issue occurs when a malicious user sends cookies
which contain the user name and user ID of a "victim" account. In
certain circumstances, the rights of the victim are loaded and persist
throughout the malicious request, allowing the malicious user to
perform actions with the victim's rights.

$wgBlockDisablesLogin is a feature which is sometimes used on private
wikis to prevent users who have an account from logging in and viewing
content on the wiki.

For more details, see <https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=28639>
