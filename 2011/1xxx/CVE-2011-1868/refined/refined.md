The provided content relates to **CVE-2011-1868**.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by the Microsoft Distributed File System (DFS) client improperly validating fields within specially crafted DFS responses.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory corruption vulnerability due to improper validation of fields in DFS responses.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution.
- An attacker could gain complete control of an affected system, install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.
- System may stop responding and restart upon exploitation attempts

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker can host a specially crafted server designed to exploit this vulnerability and convince a user to initiate a DFS connection with it.
- An attacker on the local network could perform a man-in-the-middle attack to respond to a legitimate DFS request with a malformed DFS response.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- No authentication required.
- Ability to send specially crafted DFS responses to a client-initiated DFS request.
- Ability to intercept network traffic (for man-in-the-middle attack).
