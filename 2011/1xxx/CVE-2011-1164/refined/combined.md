| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=553477#c0)  David Woodhouse    2010-01-08 00:05:47 UTC  ``` When vino-preferences starts, it spends a while "Checking the connectivity of this machine..." and then reports:  "Your desktop is only reachable over the local network. Others can access your computer using the address 90.155.92.250 or macbook.local."  This is nonsense. It's reachable from anywhere. And why on earth hasn't it managed a reverse DNS lookup?   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=553477#c1)  Jerry Amundson    2010-09-02 04:17:39 UTC  ``` My assumption is that the Assigned To here is either, 1. Deceased, or 2. Not interested.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=553477#c2)  Jerry Amundson    2010-09-02 17:36:35 UTC  ``` Or, 3. Assigned To is busy, and has other priorities!  My apologies for the earlier remark - I have bugs with no activity for months and assumed otherwise. But I see updates by sandmann as recently as 2010-08-24 09:11:27 EDT.  I'll try to help by marking duplicates. Sorry for the noise.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=553477#c3)  David Woodhouse    2010-09-02 20:14:12 UTC  ``` This might be considered a security bug. If my VNC server is accessible from the public Internet but I'm being told that it's only available to the local network, that's quite a serious bug -- it might lead to me leaving it passwordless or leaving it enabled when I wouldn't otherwise.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=553477#c4)  Bug Zapper    2010-11-04 01:35:06 UTC  ```  This message is a reminder that Fedora 12 is nearing its end of life. Approximately 30 (thirty) days from now Fedora will stop maintaining and issuing updates for Fedora 12.  It is Fedora's policy to close all bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained.  At that time this bug will be closed as WONTFIX if it remains open with a Fedora  'version' of '12'.  Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the 'version'  to a later Fedora version prior to Fedora 12's end of life.  Bug Reporter: Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that  we may not be able to fix it before Fedora 12 is end of life.  If you  would still like to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it  against a later version of Fedora please change the 'version' of this  bug to the applicable version.  If you are unable to change the version,  please add a comment here and someone will do it for you.  Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's  lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events.  Often a  more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes  bugs or makes them obsolete.  The process we are following is described here:  <http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/BugZappers/HouseKeeping>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=553477#c5)  David Woodhouse    2010-11-11 11:25:27 UTC  ``` Still happening in Fedora 14.  I have real public IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, yet vino-preferences tells me "Your desktop is only reachable over the local network.".   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=553477#c6)  Josh Bressers    2010-11-12 00:57:03 UTC  ``` Perhaps this is related to this upstream bug: <https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=596190>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=553477#c7)  David Woodhouse    2010-11-12 01:16:01 UTC  ``` Partly, perhaps — but this isn't just about IPv6. These machines have public Legacy IP addresses too, and it *still* tells me:  "Your desktop is only reachable over the local network. Others can access your computer using the address 90.155.92.250 or macbook.local."   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=553477#c8)  David Woodhouse    2010-11-12 01:20:01 UTC  ``` Ah, I cannot reproduce that specific error right now — that was a cut and paste from above. The problem with Legacy IP addresses now seems to be that it'll pick *one* of the system's addresses, seemingly at random, and analyse that.  So if it picks my public IP address (for this F14 machine) 90.155.92.217 it *does* manage to give a vaguely coherent response, albeit with a broken reverse DNS lookup: "Others can access your computer using the address 90.155.92.217 or i7.local."  But it's equally likely to pick one of the virt-manager bridges and instead tell me:  "Your desktop is only reachable over the local network. Others can access your computer using the address 172.31.0.1 or i7.local."  So the bug has changed form a little.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=553477#c9)  Vincent Danen    2011-03-22 20:34:43 UTC  ``` On RHEL6, it indicates that it is only reachable on the local network (using 192.168.250.141 or odvrhel6.local).   netstat shows me vino is listening to all interfaces.  If I look at the UPnP status on my firewall (pfSense) I see plenty of stuff, but nothing for port 5900 and nothing pointing to the IP address of this machine, so it is correct when it says local network and prints the local IP address.  Of course, if this is a direct connection to the internet and it were to report the same thing, then that would be misinformation.  The problem here is that this is a static string, that is translated:   vino-2.28.1% grep -r 'only reachable over the' * capplet/vino-preferences.c:  message = g_string_new (_("Your desktop is only reachable over the local network.")); po/eu.po:msgid "Your desktop is only reachable over the local network."  And poking around in the error_message() function in vino-preferences.c tells me that it will _always_ say that, whether it's true or not.  Looking in the "Security" section, there is a "Configure network automatically to accept connections".  Once this is enabled, and if the local iptables rules allow incoming connections to port 5900 _then_ I see the change to UPnP on the firewall.  I'm not sure we can call it a security flaw when there are a few things that need to be done (and the issue is the fact that the word "only" is present (i.e. "Your desktop is reachable over the local network" is a whole lot different than when the word "only" is there).  1) You have to enable vino 2) You have to either disable iptables (on by default) or open port 5900 3) You have to tell it to configure the network automatically to get the UPnP support  (the last is only if you are behind a firewall, of course).  If all of these things were done for you without you knowing about it, I might agree with this being a security flaw, but there are some pretty deliberate steps that are required first.  As an aside, I also went back to look at Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, but this is not an issue there.  vino-preferences simply says "Users can view your desktop using this command: vncviewer odvrhel5.annvix.ca:0".  That version of Vino also has no UPnP support.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=553477#c10)  Vincent Danen    2011-03-23 19:32:40 UTC  ``` Upstream does not plan on correcting strings or documentation until GNOME 3.0 is completed.  The root of this problem is not how vino operates, but the feedback that vino provides when certain options are selected.  Statement:  This issue did not affect the version of vino as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 or 5 as they did not include support for Universal Plug and Play (UPnP).  A future update in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 may address this flaw.  To mitigate this issue, users should ensure that confirmation is requested on each inbound connection attempt, that a password is required to connect, and that automatic network configuration is disabled.  This will prevent vino from using UPnP to allow access to the VNC port, and will ensure that any connections require a password and that the user is notified on any connection attempts.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=553477#c13)  David Woodhouse    2012-06-20 20:11:11 UTC  ``` I don't understand why there's any talk of uPNP here.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=678846#c0)  Robert Townley    2011-02-20 10:40:13 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 479752](attachment.cgi?id=479752 "Screenshot of what UPnP means.") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=479752&action=edit "Screenshot of what UPnP means.") Screenshot of what UPnP means.  Description of problem: System --->  Preferences --->  Remote Desktop does not sufficiently warn that UPnP is being used to open ports on your router.  When end user is testing, he very  well may disables confirmation and password.  Because there is no very explicit UPnP warning, he just unwittingly enabled anybody on the internet to connect to his desktop.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): vino 2.32.0-1.fc14   How reproducible: parts always, UPnP success at opening router port varies.  Sometimes, it successfully opens a port, other times it does not.   Steps to Reproduce: 1.System --> Preferences --> Remote Desktop 2.uncheck confirmation, uncheck password 3.check "Configure network to automatically accept connections."      Actual results: Changed router configuration without telling user.  Expose machine to internet usage with no password and no confirmation.  Expected results: Text should be more explicit that this uses UPnP.  The pop up message mentions UPnP, but it at least should be a red warning.  Especially when no confirmation and no password is required.     Additional info: All machines tested have multiple NICs.  selinux enabled.  iptables turned off.  It may take several attempts to open up ports on router using UPnP.  Not sure what happens upon reboot of workstation and router -- UPnP may work to open ports that were not open before.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=678846#c1)  Robert Townley    2011-02-20 10:51:20 UTC  ``` Discussion of Ubuntu user that was "hacked" when really the user interface was not explicit enough.   [http://www.dslreports.com/forum/r25446313-Ubuntu-computer-hijacked-by-hacker~start=40](http://www.dslreports.com/forum/r25446313-Ubuntu-computer-hijacked-by-hacker~start%3D40)  VNC does not have encryption.  I am glad to see that xrdp and is used in RHEL 6 because encryption can be built-in.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=678846#c2)  Vincent Danen    2011-03-23 16:35:49 UTC  ``` Upstream does not plan on correcting strings or documentation until GNOME 3.0 is completed.  The root of this problem is not how vino operates, but the feedback that vino provides when certain options are selected.  Statement:  This issue did not affect the version of vino as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 or 5 as they did not include support for Universal Plug and Play (UPnP).  A future update in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 may address this flaw.  To mitigate this issue, users should ensure that confirmation is requested on each inbound connection attempt, that a password is required to connect, and that automatic network configuration is disabled.  This will prevent vino from using UPnP to allow access to the VNC port, and will ensure that any connections require a password and that the user is notified on any connection attempts.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=678846#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-01-21 22:37:14 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2013:0169 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0169.html>   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=596190#c0)  Marc Deslauriers    2009-09-24 14:05:39 UTC  ``` Vino displays "Your desktop is only reachable over the local network." after performing a connectivity test. It appears the connectivity test doesn't try with IPv6, resulting in a misleading message. This may lead to someone thinking their installation is secure, when in fact it is open to IPv6 traffic. This could be considered a security issue.  Ubuntu bug report:  [https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/vino/+bug/344489](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/vino/%2Bbug/344489) ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=596190#c1)  Michael Trausch    2010-01-21 20:44:34 UTC  ``` I can confirm this bug report.  I have IPv6 functionality (both a site local and a global IPv6 address).  In my case it tells me that vino can only be connected to from 172.16.0.35 or fennel.local, when in fact, it is also reachable by the following slightly redacted IPv6 numbers (the host portion is removed):    inet6 addr: fdf3:950f:4983:0:XXXX:XXXX:XXXX:XXXX/64 Scope:Global   inet6 addr: 2001:470:1f11:3f:XXXX:XXXX:XXXX:XXXX/64 Scope:Global  The system is in DNS but I see no need to actually publish its name since it is nonrelevant to the bug report save for the fact that it exists and properly resolves to the global address (the 2001:470:1f11:3f address, that is).  Note that the first address is roughly equivalent to 10/8, 172.16/12, and 192.168/16 in IPv4. These addresses are generated in response to RAs being sent on the network as part of stateless autoconfiguration, so the host is aware of its status being on the IPv6 network. Furthermore, the system is actually on the IPv6 Internet and can reach e.g., Google's IPv6 site at ipv6.google.com. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=596190#c2)  David Woodhouse    2010-11-12 01:26:58 UTC  ``` It doesn't need IPv6. It doesn't work right for Legacy IP either.  For example, my workstation has the public Legacy IP address 90.155.92.217, as well as a couple of bridges for virt-manager. Sometimes it picks the private IP address on a virt-manager bridge and tells me:   "Your desktop is only reachable over the local network. Others can access your   computer using the address 172.31.0.1 or i7.local."  Other times it *does* pick the right interface and tell me that the machine is globally reachable, but it screws up the reverse DNS lookup:   "Others can access your computer using the address 90.155.92.217 or i7.local."  Seriously, if you want to pick just one interface to check on global routing, then make a UDP socket and connect() to www.google.com or something, then use getsockname() to work out which local interface is used for that public-facing connection. And don't forget to do with IPv6 as well as Legacy IP. And get the reverse DNS right (and check that forward DNS matches the reverse, of course).  Adding 'security' keyword, since telling people that their VNC server is only reachable from the local network when that's not true is really quite a naughty thing to do. If it can't be fixed in short order, this 'feature' should be disabled completely. ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=596190#c3)  David King    2011-03-20 10:10:27 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 604053](show_bug.cgi?id=604053 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - Desktop sharing preferences can not show the correct IP address if VirtualBox is installed") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=596190#c4)  David King    2011-03-21 16:53:24 UTC  ``` Vino 2.99.4 removes the network reachability message from the UI. I will add it back when a fix is available. This is highly unlikely before 3.0 is released, so expect the fix for 3.2, and a backport to 3.0 (and older). ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=596190#c5)  Tobias Mueller    2017-08-05 17:46:18 UTC  ``` So what's the status here? Is this bug report OBSOLETE because the message is gone? ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=596190#c6)  AndrÃ© Klapper    2019-09-29 18:18:53 UTC  ``` No reply; let's assume so. ``` |  |

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=553477#c0)  David Woodhouse    2010-01-08 00:05:47 UTC  ``` When vino-preferences starts, it spends a while "Checking the connectivity of this machine..." and then reports:  "Your desktop is only reachable over the local network. Others can access your computer using the address 90.155.92.250 or macbook.local."  This is nonsense. It's reachable from anywhere. And why on earth hasn't it managed a reverse DNS lookup?   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=553477#c1)  Jerry Amundson    2010-09-02 04:17:39 UTC  ``` My assumption is that the Assigned To here is either, 1. Deceased, or 2. Not interested.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=553477#c2)  Jerry Amundson    2010-09-02 17:36:35 UTC  ``` Or, 3. Assigned To is busy, and has other priorities!  My apologies for the earlier remark - I have bugs with no activity for months and assumed otherwise. But I see updates by sandmann as recently as 2010-08-24 09:11:27 EDT.  I'll try to help by marking duplicates. Sorry for the noise.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=553477#c3)  David Woodhouse    2010-09-02 20:14:12 UTC  ``` This might be considered a security bug. If my VNC server is accessible from the public Internet but I'm being told that it's only available to the local network, that's quite a serious bug -- it might lead to me leaving it passwordless or leaving it enabled when I wouldn't otherwise.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=553477#c4)  Bug Zapper    2010-11-04 01:35:06 UTC  ```  This message is a reminder that Fedora 12 is nearing its end of life. Approximately 30 (thirty) days from now Fedora will stop maintaining and issuing updates for Fedora 12.  It is Fedora's policy to close all bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained.  At that time this bug will be closed as WONTFIX if it remains open with a Fedora  'version' of '12'.  Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the 'version'  to a later Fedora version prior to Fedora 12's end of life.  Bug Reporter: Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that  we may not be able to fix it before Fedora 12 is end of life.  If you  would still like to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it  against a later version of Fedora please change the 'version' of this  bug to the applicable version.  If you are unable to change the version,  please add a comment here and someone will do it for you.  Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's  lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events.  Often a  more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes  bugs or makes them obsolete.  The process we are following is described here:  <http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/BugZappers/HouseKeeping>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=553477#c5)  David Woodhouse    2010-11-11 11:25:27 UTC  ``` Still happening in Fedora 14.  I have real public IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, yet vino-preferences tells me "Your desktop is only reachable over the local network.".   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=553477#c6)  Josh Bressers    2010-11-12 00:57:03 UTC  ``` Perhaps this is related to this upstream bug: <https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=596190>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=553477#c7)  David Woodhouse    2010-11-12 01:16:01 UTC  ``` Partly, perhaps — but this isn't just about IPv6. These machines have public Legacy IP addresses too, and it *still* tells me:  "Your desktop is only reachable over the local network. Others can access your computer using the address 90.155.92.250 or macbook.local."   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=553477#c8)  David Woodhouse    2010-11-12 01:20:01 UTC  ``` Ah, I cannot reproduce that specific error right now — that was a cut and paste from above. The problem with Legacy IP addresses now seems to be that it'll pick *one* of the system's addresses, seemingly at random, and analyse that.  So if it picks my public IP address (for this F14 machine) 90.155.92.217 it *does* manage to give a vaguely coherent response, albeit with a broken reverse DNS lookup: "Others can access your computer using the address 90.155.92.217 or i7.local."  But it's equally likely to pick one of the virt-manager bridges and instead tell me:  "Your desktop is only reachable over the local network. Others can access your computer using the address 172.31.0.1 or i7.local."  So the bug has changed form a little.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=553477#c9)  Vincent Danen    2011-03-22 20:34:43 UTC  ``` On RHEL6, it indicates that it is only reachable on the local network (using 192.168.250.141 or odvrhel6.local).   netstat shows me vino is listening to all interfaces.  If I look at the UPnP status on my firewall (pfSense) I see plenty of stuff, but nothing for port 5900 and nothing pointing to the IP address of this machine, so it is correct when it says local network and prints the local IP address.  Of course, if this is a direct connection to the internet and it were to report the same thing, then that would be misinformation.  The problem here is that this is a static string, that is translated:   vino-2.28.1% grep -r 'only reachable over the' * capplet/vino-preferences.c:  message = g_string_new (_("Your desktop is only reachable over the local network.")); po/eu.po:msgid "Your desktop is only reachable over the local network."  And poking around in the error_message() function in vino-preferences.c tells me that it will _always_ say that, whether it's true or not.  Looking in the "Security" section, there is a "Configure network automatically to accept connections".  Once this is enabled, and if the local iptables rules allow incoming connections to port 5900 _then_ I see the change to UPnP on the firewall.  I'm not sure we can call it a security flaw when there are a few things that need to be done (and the issue is the fact that the word "only" is present (i.e. "Your desktop is reachable over the local network" is a whole lot different than when the word "only" is there).  1) You have to enable vino 2) You have to either disable iptables (on by default) or open port 5900 3) You have to tell it to configure the network automatically to get the UPnP support  (the last is only if you are behind a firewall, of course).  If all of these things were done for you without you knowing about it, I might agree with this being a security flaw, but there are some pretty deliberate steps that are required first.  As an aside, I also went back to look at Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, but this is not an issue there.  vino-preferences simply says "Users can view your desktop using this command: vncviewer odvrhel5.annvix.ca:0".  That version of Vino also has no UPnP support.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=553477#c10)  Vincent Danen    2011-03-23 19:32:40 UTC  ``` Upstream does not plan on correcting strings or documentation until GNOME 3.0 is completed.  The root of this problem is not how vino operates, but the feedback that vino provides when certain options are selected.  Statement:  This issue did not affect the version of vino as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 or 5 as they did not include support for Universal Plug and Play (UPnP).  A future update in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 may address this flaw.  To mitigate this issue, users should ensure that confirmation is requested on each inbound connection attempt, that a password is required to connect, and that automatic network configuration is disabled.  This will prevent vino from using UPnP to allow access to the VNC port, and will ensure that any connections require a password and that the user is notified on any connection attempts.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=553477#c13)  David Woodhouse    2012-06-20 20:11:11 UTC  ``` I don't understand why there's any talk of uPNP here. There is no uPNP in the setup against which I filed this bug. The machine has a public IP address, and I still get the bogus message.   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=553477#c16)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-01-21 22:37:04 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2013:0169 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0169.html>   ``` |  |

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A0169)

## Topic

An updated vino package that fixes several security issues is now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Vino is a Virtual Network Computing (VNC) server for GNOME. It allows
remote users to connect to a running GNOME session using VNC.

It was found that Vino transmitted all clipboard activity on the system
running Vino to all clients connected to port 5900, even those who had not
authenticated. A remote attacker who is able to access port 5900 on a
system running Vino could use this flaw to read clipboard data without
authenticating. (CVE-2012-4429)

Two out-of-bounds memory read flaws were found in the way Vino processed
client framebuffer requests in certain encodings. An authenticated client
could use these flaws to send a specially-crafted request to Vino, causing
it to crash. (CVE-2011-0904, CVE-2011-0905)

In certain circumstances, the vino-preferences dialog box incorrectly
indicated that Vino was only accessible from the local network. This could
confuse a user into believing connections from external networks are not
allowed (even when they are allowed). With this update, vino-preferences no
longer displays connectivity and reachable information. (CVE-2011-1164)

There was no warning that Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) was used to open
ports on a user's network router when the "Configure network automatically
to accept connections" option was enabled (it is disabled by default) in
the Vino preferences. This update changes the option's description to avoid
the risk of a UPnP router configuration change without the user's consent.
(CVE-2011-1165)

All Vino users should upgrade to this updated package, which contains
backported patches to resolve these issues. The GNOME session must be
restarted (log out, then log back in) for this update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>
