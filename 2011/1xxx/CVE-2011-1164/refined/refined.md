{
  "vulnerability": {
    "cveID": "CVE-2011-1164",
    "description": "The vino-preferences dialog box incorrectly indicated that Vino was only accessible from the local network. This could confuse a user into believing connections from external networks are not allowed (even when they are allowed). With this update, vino-preferences no longer displays connectivity and reachable information.",
    "affectedSoftware": [
      "vino"
    ],
    "rootCause": "The application incorrectly determines network reachability and displays a misleading message. The root cause is a static string in `vino-preferences.c` that always reports \"Your desktop is only reachable over the local network,\" regardless of the actual network configuration.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Misleading user interface"
    ],
    "impact": "Users may believe their VNC server is only accessible on the local network, even when it's exposed to the public internet. This misunderstanding could lead users to disable security measures, like passwords or confirmations, that they would otherwise use.",
     "attackVector": "The vulnerability is not directly exploitable; it's a misrepresentation of the system's network status in the GUI which could lead to insecure configurations by the user.",
    "attackerCapabilities": "No specific attacker capabilities are needed. It is a flaw in UI of vino-preferences.",
     "additionalInformation": "The issue is related to how `vino` provides feedback on network configuration. The message is generated by a static string and not based on the actual network configuration. The fix involves removing the misleading message."
