inotify: fix double free/corruption of stuct user

```
On an error path in inotify_init1 a normal user can trigger a double
free of struct user.  This is a regression introduced by [a2ae4cc](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/a2ae4cc9a16e211c8a128ba10d22a85431f093ab)
("inotify: stop kernel memory leak on file creation failure").

We fix this by making sure that if a group exists the user reference is
dropped when the group is cleaned up.  We should not explictly drop the
reference on error and also drop the reference when the group is cleaned
up.

The new lifetime rules are that an inotify group lives from
inotify_new_group to the last fsnotify_put_group.  Since the struct user
and inotify_devs are directly tied to this lifetime they are only
changed/updated in those two locations.  We get rid of all special
casing of struct user or user->inotify_devs.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=691793#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-03-29 13:49:00 UTC  ``` Originally, the [CVE-2010-4250](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-4250) identifier has been assigned to the following vulnerability:  Memory leak in the inotify_init() system call could, in some cases, leak a group, allowing a local, unprivileged user to eventually cause a denial of service.  References: [1] <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2010-4250>  Later, it was found that relevant upstream commit: a2ae4cc9a16e211c8a128ba10d22a85431f093ab, v2.6.37-rc5  did not properly address the issue / introduced a regression (slab corruption by double free of user_struct in inotify_init1), which could allow a local, unprivileged user to cause a denial of service (kernel crash).   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=691793#c5)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2011-04-11 03:28:36 UTC  ``` Upstream commit: <http://git.kernel.org/linus/d0de4dc584ec6aa3b26fffea320a8457827768fc>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=691793#c6)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2011-04-11 03:36:16 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect the versions of Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5. This has been addressed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG via <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0498.html> and <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-1253.html>.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=691793#c8)  Chuck Ebbert    2011-04-14 01:54:42 UTC  ``` The fix will also be in 2.6.38.3 .   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=691793#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-09-12 19:45:08 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    MRG for RHEL-6 v.2  Via RHSA-2011:1253 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-1253.html>   ``` |  |

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=691793#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-03-29 13:49:00 UTC  ``` Originally, the [CVE-2010-4250](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-4250) identifier has been assigned to the following vulnerability:  Memory leak in the inotify_init() system call could, in some cases, leak a group, allowing a local, unprivileged user to eventually cause a denial of service.  References: [1] <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2010-4250>  Later, it was found that relevant upstream commit: a2ae4cc9a16e211c8a128ba10d22a85431f093ab, v2.6.37-rc5  did not properly address the issue / introduced a regression (slab corruption by double free of user_struct in inotify_init1), which could allow a local, unprivileged user to cause a denial of service (kernel crash).   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=691793#c5)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2011-04-11 03:28:36 UTC  ``` Upstream commit: <http://git.kernel.org/linus/d0de4dc584ec6aa3b26fffea320a8457827768fc>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=691793#c6)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2011-04-11 03:36:16 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect the versions of Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5. This has been addressed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG via <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0498.html> and <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-1253.html>.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=691793#c8)  Chuck Ebbert    2011-04-14 01:54:42 UTC  ``` The fix will also be in 2.6.38.3 .   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=691793#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-09-12 19:45:08 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    MRG for RHEL-6 v.2  Via RHSA-2011:1253 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-1253.html>   ``` |  |
