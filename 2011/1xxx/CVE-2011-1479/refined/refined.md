{
  "CVE-2011-1479": {
    "Description": "The vulnerability is a double free/corruption of `struct user` in the inotify subsystem of the Linux kernel, specifically within the `inotify_init1` function.",
    "Root cause": "A regression was introduced in commit a2ae4cc which attempted to fix a memory leak in inotify_init. The fix incorrectly handled the reference counting of the `struct user`, leading to a double free if an error occurred during initialization of the inotify group.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of reference counts",
      "Double free vulnerability"
    ],
    "Impact": "A local, unprivileged user could trigger a kernel crash due to the double free, resulting in a denial of service (DoS).",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by a local user by calling the `inotify_init1` system call in a specific sequence that causes an error during initialization.",
    "Required capabilities": "Local unprivileged user access to the system."
  }
