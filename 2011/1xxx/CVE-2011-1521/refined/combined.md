| ``` We received the following on the security list. With the OP's permission I am now filing a public bug with a patch, with the intent to submit the patch ASAP (in time for MvL's planned April security release of Python 2.5).  The OP's description is below; I will attach a patch to this issue as soon as I have figured out how.   description: -------------------- The Python urllib and urllib2 modules are typically used to fetch web pages but by default also contains handlers for ftp:// and file:// URL schemes.  Now unfortunately it appears that it is possible for a web server to redirect (HTTP 302) a urllib request to any of the supported schemes. Examples on how this could turn bad:   1) File disclosure: A web application, that normally fetches and  displays a web page, is redirected to file:///etc/passwd and  discloses it.   2) Denial of Service: An application is redirected to a system device  (e.g. file:///dev/zero) which will result in excessive CPU/memory/disk  usage.  Affected versions: ------------------ The urllib and urllib2 modules of python 2.4.6 and 2.6.5 where tested but this likely affects all versions.  Possible solution: ------------------ The default handlers could be reduced but this will probably break existing python scripts.  Alternatively the default HTTPRedirectHandler behaviour can be changed to only allow redirects to HTTP, HTTPS and FTP by checking the scheme of the location URL (this seems to be a common practise in browsers) ``` | | | |

| ``` > Which patch should be reviewed? They seem to be different.  Both. Mine's for the Python 2 line while Senthil seems to deal with Python 3. (However the presence of Senthil's patch somehow overrode my patch in Rietveld. It looks like Martin didn't think of this use case.) I'd like to have agreement over the Python 2 patch first, then we can think about forward porting.  > Senthil's patch allows a redirect to ftp while Guido's doesn't.  That is a good question. Should we? It doesn't look like ftp: participates in the vulnerability, but I'm not sure how useful it is either.  > Senthil's patch doesn't seem to fix urllib-inherited code, only urllib2- (see FancyURLopener.redirect_internal()).  Right, that's for Python 3.  > Guido's patch doesn't close the file (fp.close()) when the redirect is denied.  But the calling code does. Note that when there is no URI or Location header, redirect_internal() also returns without closing the file; if the error handler returns no result, http_error() will call http_error_default() which closes the file.  > Both patches apparently return silently (?), while it might be better to raise an exception.  This follows the tradition of returning silently when no URI or Location header is found. The 302 error will be treated the same as any other error.  > Both would deserve a test :)  If someone would contribute one I'd appreciate it. Otherwise I will get on it myself. ``` | | | |

| ``` Here is a more complete patch with tests. Please review this. Yes, it is against the default branch (3.x codeline). We can backport this behavior to 2.x codeline.  I have raised an URLError exception when the direct to invalid_schemes is detected.  Also, ftp redirection should be allowed. It is common to see ISO download mirrors which will redirect itself to an ftp url. Also the security report says about allowing to http, https and ftp.  Thanks. ``` | | | |

Agreed. Updated the hg repository by raising HTTPError instead of URLError.  Thing to note - HTTPError does not change anything from the redirection. It would still give the code as 302 with an additional message saying that Redirection to 'newurl' is not allowed. ``` | | | |

## Django 1.2.7 released

Posted by **James Bennett** on Sept. 10, 2011

[Yesterday's security disclosure](https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2011/sep/09/security-releases-issued/) included a release -- Django 1.2.6 -- from the Django 1.2 release branch. Although the release branch itself, and [the 1.2.6 release tag](https://code.djangoproject.com/browser/django/tags/releases/1.2.6/) in the Django repository, both contain the patches for the security issues, it has come to our attention that the release package itself was missing at least some of those patches.

To remedy this, we are immediately issuing Django 1.2.7, which is simply the (correct, as it includes all security patches) state of the current 1.2 release branch. All users of the Django 1.2 series are urged to upgrade immediately.

To obtain Django 1.2.7:

* Download [the 1.2.7 package](https://www.djangoproject.com/m/releases/1.2/Django-1.2.7.tar.gz).
* Verify the package using [the signed checksums for 1.2.7](https://www.djangoproject.com/m/pgp/Django-1.2.7.checksum.txt).

We apologize for any inconvenience caused by this issue.

  stdout mode is binary and the length is greater than 66,000 bytes (or less,
  depending on heap usage).

- Issue #11320: fix bogus memory management in Modules/getpath.c, leading to
  a possible crash when calling Py_SetPath().

- Issue #11432: A bug was introduced in subprocess.Popen on posix systems with
  3.2.0 where the stdout or stderr file descriptor being the same as the stdin
  file descriptor would raise an exception. webbrowser.open would fail. fixed.

- Issue #11450: Don't truncate hg version info in Py_GetBuildInfo() when
  there are many tags (e.g. when using mq).  Patch by Nadeem Vawda.

  UTF-8 (with replace error handler) instead of ISO-8859-1 (in strict mode).
  Patch written by Ray Allen.

- Issue #11286: Raise a ValueError from calling PyMemoryView_FromBuffer with
  a buffer struct having a NULL data pointer.

- Issue #11272: On Windows, input() strips '\r' (and not only '\n'), and

  narrow build.

- Check for NULL result in PyType_FromSpec.

  relative to Python2 and the result is now the same as it was in Python2.

- Issue #9298: base64 bodies weren't being folded to line lengths less than 78,
  which was a regression relative to Python2.  Unlike Python2, the last line
  of the folded body now ends with a carriage return.

- Issue #11560: shutil.unpack_archive now correctly handles the format
  parameter. Patch by Evan Dandrea.

- Issue #11133: fix two cases where inspect.getattr_static can trigger code
  execution. Patch by Andreas Stührk.

- Issue #11053: Fix IDLE "Syntax Error" windows to behave as in 2.x,
  preventing a confusing hung appearance on OS X with the windows
  obscured.

- Issue #10940: Workaround an IDLE hang on Mac OS X 10.6 when using the
  menu accelerators for Open Module, Go to Line, and New Indent Width.
  The accelerators still work but no longer appear in the menu items.

- Issue #10989: Fix a crash on SSLContext.load_verify_locations(None, True).

- Issue #11020: Command-line pyclbr was broken because of missing 2-to-3
  conversion.

- Issue #11019: Fixed BytesGenerator so that it correctly handles a Message
  with a None body.

- Issue #11014: Make 'filter' argument in tarfile.Tarfile.add() into a
  keyword-only argument.  The preceding positional argument was deprecated,
  so it made no sense to add filter as a positional argument.

- Issue #11004: Repaired edge case in deque.count().

- Issue #10974: IDLE no longer crashes if its recent files list includes files
  with non-ASCII characters in their path names.

- Have hashlib.algorithms_available and hashlib.algorithms_guaranteed both
  return sets instead of one returning a tuple and the other a frozenset.

- Issue #10987: Fix the recursion limit handling in the _pickle module.

- Issue #10983: Fix several bugs making tunnel requests in http.client.

- Issue #10955: zipimport uses ASCII encoding instead of cp437 to decode
  filenames, at bootstrap, if the codec registry is not ready yet. It is still
  possible to have non-ASCII filenames using the Unicode flag (UTF-8 encoding)
  for all file entries in the ZIP file.

- Issue #10949: Improved robustness of rotating file handlers.

- Issue #10955: Fix a potential crash when trying to mmap() a file past its
  length.  Initial patch by Ross Lagerwall.

- Issue #10898: Allow compiling the posix module when the C library defines
  a symbol named FSTAT.

- Issue #10980: the HTTP server now encodes headers with iso-8859-1 (latin1)
  encoding.  This is the preferred encoding of PEP 3333 and the base encoding
  of HTTP 1.1.

- To match the behaviour of HTTP server, the HTTP client library now also
  encodes headers with iso-8859-1 (latin1) encoding.  It was already doing
  that for incoming headers which makes this behaviour now consistent in
  both incoming and outgoing direction.

- Issue #9509: argparse now properly handles IOErrors raised by
  argparse.FileType.

- Issue #10961: The new pydoc server now better handles exceptions raised
  during request handling.

- Issue #10680: Fix mutually exclusive arguments for argument groups in
  argparse.

Build
-----

- Issue #11054: Allow Mac OS X installer builds to again work on 10.5 with
  the system-provided Python.

What's New in Python 3.2 Release Candidate 1
============================================

*Release date: 16-Jan-2011*

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- Issue #10889: range indexing and slicing now works correctly on ranges with
  a length that exceeds sys.maxsize.

- Issue #10892: Don't segfault when trying to delete __abstractmethods__ from a
  class.

- Issue #8020: Avoid a crash where the small objects allocator would read
  non-Python managed memory while it is being modified by another thread.  Patch
  by Matt Bandy.

- Issue #10841: On Windows, set the binary mode on stdin, stdout, stderr and all
  io.FileIO objects (to not translate newlines, \r\n <=> \n).  The Python parser
  translates newlines (\r\n => \n).

- Remove buffer API from stable ABI for now, see #10181.

- Issue #8651: PyArg_Parse*() functions raise an OverflowError if the file
  doesn't have PY_SSIZE_T_CLEAN define and the size doesn't fit in an int
  (length bigger than 2^31-1 bytes).

- Issue #9015, #9611: FileIO.readinto(), FileIO.write(), os.write() and
  stdprinter.write() clamp the length to 2^31-1 on Windows.

- Issue #8278: On Windows and with a NTFS filesystem, os.stat() and os.utime()
  can now handle dates after 2038.

- Issue #10780: PyErr_SetFromWindowsErrWithFilename() and
  PyErr_SetExcFromWindowsErrWithFilename() decode the filename from the
  filesystem encoding instead of UTF-8.

- Issue #10779: PyErr_WarnExplicit() decodes the filename from the filesystem
  encoding instead of UTF-8.

- Add sys.flags attribute for the new -q command-line option.

Library
-------

- Issue #10916: mmap should not segfault when a file is mapped using 0 as length
  and a non-zero offset, and an attempt to read past the end of file is made
  (IndexError is raised instead).  Patch by Ross Lagerwall.

- Issue #10907: Warn OS X 10.6 IDLE users to use ActiveState Tcl/Tk 8.5, rather
  than the currently problematic Apple-supplied one, when running with the
  64-/32-bit installer variant.

- Issue #4953: cgi.FieldStorage and cgi.parse() parse the request as bytes, not
  as unicode, and accept binary files. Add encoding and errors attributes to
  cgi.FieldStorage. Patch written by Pierre Quentel (with many inputs by Glenn
  Linderman).

- Add encoding and errors arguments to urllib.parse_qs() and urllib.parse_qsl().

- Issue #10899: No function type annotations in the standard library.  Removed
  function type annotations from _pyio.py.

- Issue #10875: Update Regular Expression HOWTO; patch by 'SilentGhost'.

- Issue #10872: The repr() of TextIOWrapper objects now includes the mode
  if available.

- Issue #10869: Fixed bug where ast.increment_lineno modified the root node
  twice.

- Issue #5871: email.header.Header.encode now raises an error if any
  continuation line in the formatted value has no leading white space and looks
  like a header.  Since Generator uses Header to format all headers, this check
  is made for all headers in any serialized message at serialization time.  This
  provides protection against header injection attacks.

- Issue #10859: Make ``contextlib.GeneratorContextManager`` officially
  private by renaming it to ``_GeneratorContextManager``.

- Issue #10042: Fixed the total_ordering decorator to handle cross-type
  comparisons that could lead to infinite recursion.

- Issue #10686: the email package now :rfc:`2047`\ -encodes headers with
  non-ASCII bytes (parsed by a Bytes Parser) when doing conversion to 7bit-clean
  presentation, instead of replacing them with ?s.

- email.header.Header was incorrectly encoding folding white space when
  rfc2047-encoding header values with embedded newlines, leaving them without
  folding whitespace.  It now uses the continuation_ws, as it does for
  continuation lines that it creates itself.

- Issue #1777412, #10827: Changed the rules for 2-digit years. The
  time.asctime(), time.ctime() and time.strftime() functions will now format
  any year when ``time.accept2dyear`` is False and will accept years >= 1000
  otherwise. ``time.mktime`` and ``time.strftime`` now accept full range
  supported by the OS. With Visual Studio or on Solaris, the year is limited to
  the range [1; 9999]. Conversion of 2-digit years to 4-digit is deprecated.

- Issue #7858: Raise an error properly when os.utime() fails under Windows
  on an existing file.

- Issue #3839: wsgiref should not override a Content-Length header set by
  the application.  Initial patch by Clovis Fabricio.

- Issue #10492: bdb.Bdb.run() only traces the execution of the code, not the
  compilation (if the input is a string).

- Issue #7995: When calling accept() on a socket with a timeout, the returned
  socket is now always blocking, regardless of the operating system.

- Issue #10756: atexit normalizes the exception before displaying it. Patch by
  Andreas Stührk.

- Issue #10790: email.header.Header.append's charset logic now works correctly
  for charsets whose output codec is different from its input codec.

- Issue #10819: SocketIO.name property returns -1 when its closed, instead of
  raising a ValueError, to fix repr().

- Issue #8650: zlib.compress() and zlib.decompress() raise an OverflowError if
  the input buffer length doesn't fit into an unsigned int (length bigger than
  2^32-1 bytes).

- Issue #6643: Reinitialize locks held within the threading module after fork to
  avoid a potential rare deadlock or crash on some platforms.

- Issue #10806, issue #9905: Fix subprocess pipes when some of the standard file
  descriptors (0, 1, 2) are closed in the parent process.  Initial patch by Ross
  Lagerwall.

- `unittest.TestCase` can be instantiated without a method name; for simpler
  exploration from the interactive interpreter.

- Issue #10798: Reject supporting concurrent.futures if the system has too
  few POSIX semaphores.

- Issue #10807: Remove base64, bz2, hex, quopri, rot13, uu and zlib codecs from
  the codec aliases. They are still accessible via codecs.lookup().

- Issue #10801: In zipfile, support different encodings for the header and the
  filenames.

- Issue #6285: IDLE no longer crashes on missing help file; patch by Scott
  David Daniels.

- Fix collections.OrderedDict.setdefault() so that it works in subclasses that
  define __missing__().

- Issue #10786: unittest.TextTestRunner default stream no longer bound at import
  time. `sys.stderr` now looked up at instantiation time.  Fix contributed by
  Mark Roddy.

- Issue #10753: Characters ';', '=' and ',' in the PATH_INFO environment variable
  won't be quoted when the URI is constructed by the wsgiref.util's request_uri
  method. According to RFC 3986, these characters can be a part of params in
  PATH component of URI and need not be quoted.

- Issue #10738: Fix webbrowser.Opera.raise_opts.

- Issue #9824: SimpleCookie now encodes , and ; in values to cater to how
  browsers actually parse cookies.

- Issue #9333: os.symlink now available regardless of user privileges.  The
  function now raises OSError on Windows >=6.0 when the user is unable to create
  symbolic links. XP and 2003 still raise NotImplementedError.

- Issue #10783: struct.pack() no longer implicitly encodes unicode to UTF-8.

- Issue #10730: Add SVG mime types to mimetypes module.

- Issue #10768: Make the Tkinter ScrolledText widget work again.

- Issue #10777: Fix "dictionary changed size during iteration" bug in
  ElementTree register_namespace().

- Issue #10626: test_logging now preserves logger disabled states.

- Issue #10774: test_logging now removes temp files created during tests.

- Issue #5258/#10642: if site.py encounters a .pth file that generates an error,
  it now prints the filename, line number, and traceback to stderr and skips
  the rest of that individual file, instead of stopping processing entirely.

- Issue #10763: subprocess.communicate() closes stdout and stderr if both are
  pipes (bug specific to Windows).

- Issue #1693546: fix email.message RFC 2231 parameter encoding to be in better
  compliance (no "s around encoded values).

- Improved the diff message in the unittest module's assertCountEqual().

- Issue #1155362: email.utils.parsedate_tz now handles a missing space before
  the '-' of a timezone field as well as before a '+'.

- Issue #4871: The zipfile module now gives a more useful error message if
  an attempt is made to use a string to specify the archive password.

- Issue #10750: The ``raw`` attribute of buffered IO objects is now read-only.

- Deprecated assertDictContainsSubset() in the unittest module.

C-API
-----

- Issue #10913: Deprecate misleading functions PyEval_AcquireLock() and
  PyEval_ReleaseLock().  The thread-state aware APIs should be used instead.

- Issue #10333: Remove ancient GC API, which has been deprecated since Python
  2.2.

Build
-----

- Issue #10843: Update third-party library versions used in OS X 32-bit

  and RTREE enabled), and ncursesw 5.5 (wide-char support enabled).

- Issue #10820: Fix OS X framework installs to support version-specific
  scripts (#10679).

  and DragonFly BSD.  Patch by Nicolas Joly.

- Issue #10679: The "idle", "pydoc" and "2to3" scripts are now installed with
  a version-specific suffix on "make altinstall".

- Issue #10655: Fix the build on PowerPC on Linux with GCC when building with
  timestamp profiling (--with-tsc): the preprocessor test for the PowerPC
  support now looks for "__powerpc__" as well as "__ppc__": the latter seems to
  only be present on OS X; the former is the correct one for Linux with GCC.

- Issue #1099: Fix the build on MacOSX when building a framework with pydebug
  using GCC 4.0.

  (thanks to the mapping protocol API, the latter can be used to copy data
  between parsers).

- configparser: accepted INI file structure is now customizable, including
  comment prefixes, name of the DEFAULT section, empty lines in multiline
  values, and indentation.

- Issue #10326: unittest.TestCase instances can be pickled.

- Issue #9926: Wrapped TestSuite subclass does not get __call__ executed.

What's New in Python 3.2 Alpha 4?
=================================

*Release date: 13-Nov-2010*

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- Issue #10372: Import the warnings module only after the IO library is
  initialized, so as to avoid bootstrap issues with the '-W' option.

- Issue #10293: Remove obsolete field in the PyMemoryView structure, unused
  undocumented value PyBUF_SHADOW, and strangely-looking code in
  PyMemoryView_GetContiguous.

- Issue #6081: Add str.format_map(), similar to ``str.format(**mapping)``.

- If FileIO.__init__ fails, close the file descriptor.

- Issue #10221: dict.pop(k) now has a key error message that includes the
  missing key (same message d[k] returns for missing keys).

- Issue #5437: A preallocated MemoryError instance should not keep traceback
  data (including local variables caught in the stack trace) alive infinitely.

- Issue #10186: Fix the SyntaxError caret when the offset is equal to the length
  of the offending line.

- Issue #10089: Add support for arbitrary -X options on the command line.  They
  can be retrieved through a new attribute ``sys._xoptions``.

- Issue #4388: On Mac OS X, decode command line arguments from UTF-8, instead of
  the locale encoding.  If the LANG (and LC_ALL and LC_CTYPE) environment
  variable is not set, the locale encoding is ISO-8859-1, whereas most programs
  (including Python) expect UTF-8.  Python already uses UTF-8 for the filesystem
  encoding and to encode command line arguments on this OS.

- Issue #9713, #10114: Parser functions (e.g. PyParser_ASTFromFile) expect
  filenames encoded to the filesystem encoding with the surrogateescape error
  handler (to support undecodable bytes), instead of UTF-8 in strict mode.

- Issue #9997: Don't let the name "top" have special significance in scope
  resolution.

- Issue #9862: Compensate for broken PIPE_BUF in AIX by hard coding its value as
  the default 512 when compiling on AIX.

- Use locale encoding instead of UTF-8 to encode and decode filenames if
  Py_FileSystemDefaultEncoding is not set.

- Issue #10095: fp_setreadl() doesn't reopen the file, instead reuse the file
  descriptor.

- Issue #9418: Moved private string methods ``_formatter_parser`` and
  ``_formatter_field_name_split`` into a new ``_string`` module.

- Issue #9992: Remove PYTHONFSENCODING environment variable.

Library
-------

- Issue #10465: fix broken delegating of attributes by gzip._PaddedFile.

- Issue #10356: Decimal.__hash__(-1) should return -2.

- Issue #1553375: logging: Added stack_info kwarg to display stack information.

- Issue #5111: IPv6 Host in the Header is wrapped inside [ ]. Patch by Chandru.

- Fix Fraction.__hash__ so that Fraction.__hash__(-1) is -2.  (See also issue
  #10356.)

- Issue #4471: Add the IMAP.starttls() method to enable encryption on standard
  IMAP4 connections.  Original patch by Lorenzo M. Catucci.

- Issue #1466065: Add 'validate' option to base64.b64decode to raise an error if
  there are non-base64 alphabet characters in the input.

- Issue #10386: Add __all__ to token module; this simplifies importing in
  tokenize module and prevents leaking of private names through ``import *``.

- Issue #4471: Properly shutdown socket in IMAP.shutdown().  Patch by Lorenzo
  M. Catucci.

- Fix IMAP.login() to work properly.

- Issue #9244: multiprocessing pool worker processes could terminate
  unexpectedly if the return value of a task could not be pickled.  Only the
  ``repr`` of such errors are now sent back, wrapped in an
  ``MaybeEncodingError`` exception.

- Issue #9244: The ``apply_async()`` and ``map_async()`` methods of
  ``multiprocessing.Pool`` now accepts a ``error_callback`` argument.  This can
  be a callback with the signature ``callback(exc)``, which will be called if
  the target raises an exception.

- Issue #10022: The dictionary returned by the ``getpeercert()`` method of SSL
  sockets now has additional items such as ``issuer`` and ``notBefore``.

- ``usenetrc`` is now false by default for NNTP objects.

- Issue #1926: Add support for NNTP over SSL on port 563, as well as STARTTLS.
  Patch by Andrew Vant.

- Issue #10335: Add tokenize.open(), detect the file encoding using
  tokenize.detect_encoding() and open it in read only mode.

- Issue #10321: Add support for binary data to smtplib.SMTP.sendmail, and a new
  method send_message to send an email.message.Message object.

- Issue #6011: sysconfig and distutils.sysconfig use the surrogateescape error
  handler to parse the Makefile file.  Avoid a UnicodeDecodeError if the source
  code directory name contains a non-ASCII character and the locale encoding is
  ASCII.

- Issue #10329: The trace module writes reports using the input Python script
  encoding, instead of the locale encoding.  Patch written by Alexander
  Belopolsky.

- Issue #10126: Fix distutils' test_build when Python was built with
  --enable-shared.

- Issue #9281: Prevent race condition with mkdir in distutils.  Patch by
  Arfrever.

- Issue #10252: Close file objects in a timely manner in distutils code and
  tests.  Patch by Brian Brazil, completed by Éric Araujo.

  low-level signal handler.  Patch by Hallvard B Furuseth.

- Issue #10282: Add a ``nntp_implementation`` attribute to NNTP objects.

- Issue #10283: Add a ``group_pattern`` argument to NNTP.list().

- Issue #10155: Add IISCGIHandler to wsgiref.handlers to support IIS CGI
  environment better, and to correct unicode environment values for WSGI 1.0.1.

- Issue #10281: nntplib now returns None for absent fields in the OVER/XOVER
  response, instead of raising an exception.

- wsgiref now implements and validates PEP 3333, rather than an experimental
  extension of PEP 333.  (Note: earlier versions of Python 3.x may have
  incorrectly validated some non-compliant applications as WSGI compliant; if
  your app validates with Python <3.2b1+, but not on this version, it is likely
  the case that your app was not compliant.)

- Issue #10280: NNTP.nntp_version should reflect the highest version advertised
  by the server.

- Issue #10184: Touch directories only once when extracting a tarfile.

- Issue #10199: New package, ``turtledemo`` now contains selected demo scripts
  that were formerly found under Demo/turtle.

- Issue #10265: Close file objects explicitly in sunau.  Patch by Brian Brazil.

  pretty-printing multilevel objects.

- Issue #10253: FileIO leaks a file descriptor when trying to open a file for
  append that isn't seekable.  Patch by Brian Brazil.

- Close a file object in distutils.sysconfig in a timely manner.

- Close a file object in pkgutil in a timely manner.

- Issue #10233: Close file objects in a timely manner in the tarfile module and
  its test suite.

- Issue #10093: ResourceWarnings are now issued when files and sockets are
  deallocated without explicit closing.  These warnings are silenced by default,
  except in pydebug mode.

- tarfile.py: Add support for all missing variants of the GNU sparse extensions
  and create files with holes when extracting sparse members.

- Issue #10218: Return timeout status from ``Condition.wait`` in threading.

- Issue #7351: Add ``zipfile.BadZipFile`` spelling of the exception name and
  deprecate the old name ``zipfile.BadZipfile``.

- Issue #5027: The standard ``xml`` namespace is now understood by

- Issue #1349106: Generator (and BytesGenerator) flatten method and Header
  encode method now support a 'linesep' argument.

- Issue #5639: Add a *server_hostname* argument to ``SSLContext.wrap_socket`` in
  order to support the TLS SNI extension.  ``HTTPSConnection`` and ``urlopen()``
  also use this argument, so that HTTPS virtual hosts are now supported.

- Issue #10166: Avoid recursion in pstats Stats.add() for many stats items.

- Issue #10163: Skip unreadable registry keys during mimetypes initialization.

- logging: Made StreamHandler terminator configurable.

- logging: Allowed filters to be just callables.

- logging: Added tests for _logRecordClass changes.

- Issue #10092: Properly reset locale in calendar.Locale*Calendar classes.

- logging: Added _logRecordClass, getLogRecordClass, setLogRecordClass to
  increase flexibility of LogRecord creation.

- Issue #5117: Case normalization was needed on ntpath.relpath().  Also fixed
  root directory issue on posixpath.relpath().  (Ported working fixes from
  ntpath.)

- Issue #1343: xml.sax.saxutils.XMLGenerator now has an option
  short_empty_elements to direct it to use self-closing tags when appropriate.

- Issue #9807 (part 1): Expose the ABI flags in sys.abiflags.  Add --abiflags
  switch to python-config for command line access.

- Issue #5762: Fix AttributeError raised by ``xml.dom.minidom`` when an empty
  XML namespace attribute is encountered.

- Issue #2830: Add the ``html.escape()`` function, which quotes all problematic
  characters by default.  Deprecate ``cgi.escape()``.

- Issue #9409: Fix the regex to match all kind of filenames, for interactive
  debugging in doctests.

- Issue #9183: ``datetime.timezone(datetime.timedelta(0))`` will now return the
  same instance as ``datetime.timezone.utc``.

- Issue #7523: Add SOCK_CLOEXEC and SOCK_NONBLOCK to the socket module, where
  supported by the system.  Patch by Nikita Vetoshkin.

- Issue #10063: file:// scheme will stop accessing remote hosts via ftp
  protocol. file:// urls had fallback to access remote hosts via ftp. This was
  not correct, change is made to raise a URLError when a remote host is tried to
  access via file:// scheme.

- Issue #1710703: Write structures for an empty ZIP archive when a ZipFile is
  created in modes 'a' or 'w' and then closed without adding any files. Raise
  BadZipfile (rather than IOError) when opening small non-ZIP files.

- Issue #10041: The signature of optional arguments in socket.makefile() didn't
  match that of io.open(), and they also didn't get forwarded properly to
  TextIOWrapper in text mode.  Patch by Kai Zhu.

  provided by ExpatError.

- The Unicode database was updated to 6.0.0.

C-API
-----

  type has been introduced.

Tools/Demos
-----------

- Issue #10117: Tools/scripts/reindent.py now accepts source files that use
  encoding other than ASCII or UTF-8.  Source encoding is preserved when
  reindented code is written to a file.

- Issue #7287: Demo/imputil/knee.py was removed.

Tests

What's New in Python 3.2 Alpha 3?
=================================

*Release date: 09-Oct-2010*

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- Issue #10068: Global objects which have reference cycles with their module's
  dict are now cleared again. This causes issue #7140 to appear again.

- Issue #9738: Document PyErr_SetString() and PyErr_SetFromErrnoWithFilename()
  encodings.

- ast.literal_eval() can now handle negative numbers.  It is also a little more
  liberal in what it accepts without compromising the safety of the evaluation.
  For example, 3j+4 and 3+4+5 are both accepted.

- Issue #10006: type.__abstractmethods__ now raises an AttributeError.  As a
  result metaclasses can now be ABCs (see #9533).

- Issue #8670: ctypes.c_wchar supports non-BMP characters with 32 bits wchar_t.

- Issue #8670: PyUnicode_AsWideChar() and PyUnicode_AsWideCharString() replace
  UTF-16 surrogate pairs by single non-BMP characters for 16 bits Py_UNICODE and
  32 bits wchar_t (eg. Linux in narrow build).

- Issue #10003: Allow handling of SIGBREAK on Windows. Fixes a regression
  introduced by issue #9324.

- Issue #9979: Create function PyUnicode_AsWideCharString().

- Issue #7397: Mention that importlib.import_module() is probably what someone
  really wants to be using in __import__'s docstring.

- Issue #8521: Allow CreateKeyEx, OpenKeyEx, and DeleteKeyEx functions of winreg
  to use named arguments.

- Issue #9930: Remove bogus subtype check that was causing (e.g.)
  float.__rdiv__(2.0, 3) to return NotImplemented instead of the expected 1.5.

- Issue #9808: Implement os.getlogin for Windows. Patch by Jon Anglin.

- Issue #9901: Destroying the GIL in Py_Finalize() can fail if some other
  threads are still running.  Instead, reinitialize the GIL on a second call to
  Py_Initialize().

- All SyntaxErrors now have a column offset and therefore a caret when the error
  is printed.

- Issue #9252: PyImport_Import no longer uses a fromlist hack to return the
  module that was imported, but instead gets the module from sys.modules.

- Issue #9213: The range type_items now provides index() and count() methods, to
  conform to the Sequence ABC.  Patch by Daniel Urban and Daniel Stutzbach.

- Issue #7994: Issue a PendingDeprecationWarning if object.__format__ is called
  with a non-empty format string.  This is an effort to future-proof user
  code. If a derived class does not currently implement __format__ but later
  adds its own __format__, it would most likely break user code that had
  supplied a format string.  This will be changed to a DeprecationWaring in
  Python 3.3 and it will be an error in Python 3.4.

- Issue #9828: Destroy the GIL in Py_Finalize(), so that it gets properly
  re-created on a subsequent call to Py_Initialize().  The problem (a crash)
  wouldn't appear in 3.1 or 2.7 where the GIL's structure is more trivial.

- Issue #9210: Configure option --with-wctype-functions was removed.  Using the
  functions from the libc caused the methods .upper() and lower() to become
  locale aware and created subtly wrong results.

- Issue #9738: PyUnicode_FromFormat() and PyErr_Format() raise an error on a
  non-ASCII byte in the format string.

- Issue #4617: Previously it was illegal to delete a name from the local
  namespace if it occurs as a free variable in a nested block.  This limitation
  of the compiler has been lifted, and a new opcode introduced (DELETE_DEREF).

- Issue #9804: ascii() now always represents unicode surrogate pairs as a single
  ``\UXXXXXXXX``, regardless of whether the character is printable or not.
  Also, the "backslashreplace" error handler now joins surrogate pairs into a
  single character on UCS-2 builds.

- Issue #9757: memoryview objects get a release() method to release the
  underlying buffer (previously this was only done when deallocating the
  memoryview), and gain support for the context management protocol.

- Issue #9797: pystate.c wrongly assumed that zero couldn't be a valid
  thread-local storage key.

Library
-------

- Issue #2236: distutils' mkpath ignored the mode parameter.

- Fix typo in one sdist option (medata-check).

- Issue #9199: Fix incorrect use of distutils.cmd.Command.announce.

- Issue #1718574: Fix options that were supposed to accept arguments but did
  not in build_clib.

- Issue #9437: Fix building C extensions with non-default LDFLAGS.

- Issue #4661: email can now parse bytes input and generate either converted
  7bit output or bytes output.  Email version bumped to 5.1.0.

- Issue #1589: Add ssl.match_hostname(), to help implement server identity
  verification for higher-level protocols.

- Issue #9759: GzipFile now raises ValueError when an operation is attempted
  after the file is closed.  Patch by Jeffrey Finkelstein.

- Issue #9042: Fix interaction of custom translation classes and caching in
  gettext.

- Issue #6706: asyncore.dispatcher now provides a handle_accepted() method
  returning a (sock, addr) pair which is called when a connection has been
  established with a new remote endpoint.  This is supposed to be used as a
  replacement for old handle_accept() and avoids the user to call accept()
  directly.

- Issue #9065: tarfile no longer uses "root" as the default for the uname and
  gname field.

- Issue #8980: Fixed a failure in distutils.command check that was shadowed by
  an environment that does not have docutils.  Patch by Arfrever.

- Issue #1050268: parseaddr now correctly quotes double quote and backslash
  characters that appear inside quoted strings in email addresses.

- Issue #10004: quoprimime no longer generates a traceback when confronted with
  invalid characters after '=' in a Q-encoded word.

- Issue #1491: BaseHTTPServer nows send a ``100 Continue`` response before
  sending a 200 OK for the Expect: 100-continue request header.

- Issue #9360: Cleanup and improvements to the nntplib module.  The API now
  conforms to the philosophy of bytes and unicode separation in Python 3.  A
  test suite has also been added.

- Issue #9962: GzipFile now has the peek() method.

- Issue #9090: When a socket with a timeout fails with EWOULDBLOCK or EAGAIN,
  retry the select() loop instead of bailing out.  This is because select() can
  incorrectly report a socket as ready for reading (for example, if it received
  some data with an invalid checksum).

- Issue #3612: Added new types to ctypes.wintypes. (CHAR and pointers)

- Issue #9950: Fix socket.sendall() crash or misbehaviour when a signal is
  received.  Now sendall() properly calls signal handlers if necessary, and
  retries sending if these returned successfully, including on sockets with a
  timeout.

- Issue #9947: logging: Fixed locking bug in stopListening.

- Issue #9945: logging: Fixed locking bugs in addHandler/removeHandler.

- Issue #9936: Fixed executable lines' search in the trace module.

- Issue #9790: Rework imports necessary for samefile and sameopenfile
  in ntpath.

- Issue #9928: Properly initialize the types exported by the bz2 module.

- Issue #1675951: Allow GzipFile to work with unseekable file objects.  Patch by
  Florian Festi.

- Logging: Added QueueListener class to facilitate logging usage for
  performance-critical threads.

- Issue #9916: Add some missing errno symbols.

- Issue #9877: Expose sysconfig.get_makefile_filename()

- logging: Added hasHandlers() method to Logger and LoggerAdapter.

- Issue #9908: Fix os.stat() on bytes paths under Windows 7.

- Issue #2643: msync() is not called anymore when deallocating an open mmap
  object, only munmap().

- logging: Changed LoggerAdapter implementation internally, to make it easier to
  subclass in a useful way.

- logging: hasHandlers method was added to Logger, and isEnabledFor,
  getEffectiveLevel, hasHandlers and setLevel were added to LoggerAdapter.
  LoggerAdapter was introduced into the unit tests for logging.

- Issue #1686: Fix string.Template when overriding the pattern attribute.

- Issue #9854: SocketIO objects now observe the RawIOBase interface in
  non-blocking mode: they return None when an operation would block (instead of
  raising an exception).

- Issue #1730136: Fix the comparison between a tk.font.Font and an object of
  another kind.

- Issue #9441: logging has better coverage for rotating file handlers.

- Issue #9865: collections.OrderedDict now has a __sizeof__ method.

- Issue #9854: The default read() implementation in io.RawIOBase now handles
  non-blocking readinto() returning None correctly.

- Issue #1552: socket.socketpair() now returns regular socket.socket objects
  supporting the whole socket API (rather than the "raw" _socket.socket
  objects).

- Issue #9853: Fix the signature of SSLSocket.recvfrom() and SSLSocket.sendto()
  to match the corresponding socket methods.

- Issue #9840: Added a decorator to reprlib for wrapping __repr__ methods to make
  them handle recursive calls within the same thread.

- logging: Enhanced HTTPHandler with secure and credentials initializers.

- Issue #767645: Set os.path.supports_unicode_filenames to True on Mac OS X.

- Issue #9837: The read() method of ZipExtFile objects (as returned by
  ZipFile.open()) could return more bytes than requested.

- Issue #9826: OrderedDict.__repr__ can now handle self-referential values:
  d['x'] = d.

- Issue #9825: Using __del__ in the definition of collections.OrderedDict made
  it possible for the user to create self-referencing ordered dictionaries which
  become permanently uncollectable GC garbage.  Reinstated the Python 3.1
  approach of using weakref proxies so that reference cycles never get created
  in the first place.

- Issue #9579, #9580: Fix os.confstr() for value longer than 255 bytes and
  encode the value with filesystem encoding and surrogateescape (instead of
  utf-8 in strict mode) . Patch written by David Watson.

- Issue #9632: Remove sys.setfilesystemencoding() function: use PYTHONFSENCODING
  environment variable to set the filesystem encoding at Python startup.
  sys.setfilesystemencoding() creates inconsistencies because it is unable to
  reencode all filenames in all objects.

- Issue #9410: Various optimizations to the pickle module, leading to speedups
  up to 4x (depending on the benchmark).  Mostly ported from Unladen Swallow;
  initial patch by Alexandre Vassalotti.

- The pprint module now supports printing OrderedDicts in their given order
  (formerly, it would sort the keys).

- Logging: Added QueueHandler class to facilitate logging usage with
  multiprocessing.

- Issue #9707: Rewritten reference implementation of threading.local which is
  friendlier towards reference cycles.  This change is not normally visible
  since an optimized C implementation (_thread._local) is used instead.

- Issue #6394: os.getppid() is now supported on Windows.  Note that it will
  still return the id of the parent process after it has exited.  This process
  id may even have been reused by another unrelated process.

- Issue #9792: In case of connection failure, socket.create_connection() would
  swallow the exception and raise a new one, making it impossible to fetch the
  original errno, or to filter timeout errors.  Now the original error is
  re-raised.

- Issue #9758: When fcntl.ioctl() was called with mutable_flag set to True, and
  the passed buffer was exactly 1024 bytes long, the buffer wouldn't be updated
  back after the system call.  Original patch by Brian Brazil.

- Updates to the random module:

  * Document which parts of the module are guaranteed to stay the same across
    versions and which parts are subject to change.

  * Update the seed() method to use all of the bits in a string instead of just
    the hash value.  This makes better use of the seed value and assures the
    seeding is platform independent.  Issue #7889.

  * Improved the random()-->integer algorithm used in choice(), shuffle(),
    sample(), randrange(), and randint().  Formerly, it used int(n*random())
    which has a slight bias whenever n is not a power of two.  Issue #9025.

  * Improved documentation of arguments to randrange().  Issue #9379.

- collections.OrderedDict now supports a new method for repositioning keys to
  either end.

- Issue #9754: Similarly to assertRaises and assertRaisesRegexp, unittest test
  cases now also have assertWarns and assertWarnsRegexp methods to check that a
  given warning type was triggered by the code under test.

- Issue #5506: BytesIO objects now have a getbuffer() method exporting a view of
  their contents without duplicating them.  The view is both readable and
  writable.

- Issue #7566: Implement os.path.sameopenfile for Windows.

- Issue #9293: I/O streams now raise ``io.UnsupportedOperation`` when an
  unsupported operation is attempted (for example, writing to a file open only
  for reading).

- hashlib has two new constant attributes: algorithms_guaranteed and
  algorithms_avaiable that respectively list the names of hash algorithms
  guaranteed to exist in all Python implementations and the names of hash
  algorithms available in the current process.

- A new package ``concurrent.futures`` as defined by PEP 3148.

C-API
-----

- Add PyErr_SyntaxLocationEx, which supports passing a column offset.

What's New in Python 3.2 Alpha 2?
=================================

*Release date: 05-Sep-2010*

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- Issue #9225: Remove the ROT_FOUR and DUP_TOPX opcode, the latter replaced by
  the new (and simpler) DUP_TOP_TWO.  Performance isn't changed, but our
  bytecode is a bit simplified.  Patch by Demur Rumed.

- Issue #9766: Rename poorly named variables exposed by _warnings to prevent
  confusion with the proper variables names from 'warnings' itself.

- Issue #9212: dict_keys and dict_items now provide the isdisjoint() method, to
  conform to the Set ABC.  Patch by Daniel Urban.

- Issue #9737: Fix a crash when trying to delete a slice or an item from a
  memoryview object.

- Issue #9549: sys.setdefaultencoding() and PyUnicode_SetDefaultEncoding() are
  now removed, since their effect was inexistent in 3.x (the default encoding is
  hardcoded to utf-8 and cannot be changed).

- Issue #7415: PyUnicode_FromEncodedObject() now uses the new buffer API
  properly.  Patch by Stefan Behnel.

- Issue #5553: The Py_LOCAL_INLINE macro now results in inlining on most
  platforms.  Previously, it inlined only when using Microsoft Visual C.

- Issue #9712: Fix tokenize on identifiers that start with non-ascii names.

- Issue #9688: __basicsize__ and __itemsize__ must be accessed as Py_ssize_t.

- Issue #9684: Added a definition for SIZEOF_WCHAR_T to PC/pyconfig.h, to match
  the pyconfig.h generated by configure on other systems.

- Issue #9666: Only catch AttributeError in hasattr(). All other exceptions that
  occur during attribute lookup are now propagated to the caller.

- Issue #8622: Add PYTHONFSENCODING environment variable to override the
  filesystem encoding.

- Issue #5127: The C functions that access the Unicode Database now accept and
  return characters from the full Unicode range, even on narrow unicode builds
  (Py_UNICODE_TOLOWER, Py_UNICODE_ISDECIMAL, and others).  A visible difference
  in Python is that unicodedata.numeric() now returns the correct value for
  large code points, and repr() may consider more characters as printable.

- Issue #9425: Create PyModule_GetFilenameObject() function to get the filename
  as a unicode object, instead of a byte string. Function needed to support
  unencodable filenames. Deprecate PyModule_GetFilename() in favor on the new
  function.

- Issue #8063: Call _PyGILState_Init() earlier in Py_InitializeEx().

- Issue #9612: The set object is now 64-bit clean under Windows.

- Issue #8202: sys.argv[0] is now set to '-m' instead of '-c' when searching for
  the module file to be executed with the -m command line option.

- Issue #9599: Create PySys_FormatStdout() and PySys_FormatStderr() functions to
  write a message formatted by PyUnicode_FromFormatV() to sys.stdout and
  sys.stderr.

- Issue #9542: Create PyUnicode_FSDecoder() function, a ParseTuple converter:
  decode bytes objects to unicode using PyUnicode_DecodeFSDefaultAndSize(); str
  objects are output as-is.

- Issue #9203: Computed gotos are now enabled by default on supported compilers
  (which are detected by the configure script).  They can still be disable
  selectively by specifying --without-computed-gotos.

- Issue #9425: Create PyErr_WarnFormat() function, similar to PyErr_WarnEx() but
  use PyUnicode_FromFormatV() to format the warning message.

- Issue #8530: Prevent stringlib fastsearch from reading beyond the front of an
  array.

- Issue #5319: Print an error if flushing stdout fails at interpreter shutdown.

- Issue #9337: The str() of a float or complex number is now identical to its
  repr().

- Issue #9416: Fix some issues with complex formatting where the output with no
  type specifier failed to match the str output:

    - format(complex(-0.0, 2.0), '-') omitted the real part from the output,
    - format(complex(0.0, 2.0), '-') included a sign and parentheses.

Extension Modules
-----------------

- Issue #8013: time.asctime and time.ctime no longer call system
  asctime and ctime functions.  The year range for time.asctime is now
  1900 through maxint.  The range for time.ctime is the same as for
  time.localtime.  The string produced by these functions is longer
  than 24 characters when year is greater than 9999.

- Issue #6608: time.asctime is now checking struct tm fields its input
  before passing it to the system asctime.  Patch by MunSic Jeong.

- Issue #8734: Avoid crash in msvcrt.get_osfhandle() when an invalid file
  descriptor is provided.  Patch by Pascal Chambon.

  socket module, and fix the width of socket descriptors to be correctly
  detected under 64-bit Windows.

- Issue #1027206: Support IDNA in gethostbyname, gethostbyname_ex, getaddrinfo
  and gethostbyaddr.  getnameinfo is now restricted to numeric addresses as
  input.

- Fix memory leak in ssl._ssl._test_decode_cert.

- Issue #8065: Fix memory leak in readline module (from failure to free the
  result of history_get_history_state()).

- Issue #9450: Fix memory leak in readline.replace_history_item and
  readline.remove_history_item for readline version >= 5.0.

- Issue #8105: Validate file descriptor passed to mmap.mmap on Windows.

- Issue #8046: Add context manager protocol support and .closed property to mmap

  single keyword arguments.

- Address XXX comment in dis.py by having inspect.py prefer to reuse the dis.py

  for use with the statvfs() function.  Patch by Adam Jackson.

- Issue #8688: MANIFEST files created by distutils now include a magic comment
  indicating they are generated.  Manually maintained MANIFESTs without this

What's New in Python 3.2 Alpha 1?
=================================

*Release date: 01-Aug-2010*

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- Issue #8991: convertbuffer() rejects discontigious buffers.

- Issue #7616: Fix copying of overlapping memoryview slices with the Intel
  compiler.

- Issue #8413: structsequence now subclasses tuple.

- Issue #8271: during the decoding of an invalid UTF-8 byte sequence, only the
  start byte and the continuation byte(s) are now considered invalid, instead of
  the number of bytes specified by the start byte.  E.g.:
  '\xf1\x80AB'.decode('utf-8', 'replace') now returns u'\ufffdAB' and replaces
  with U+FFFD only the start byte ('\xf1') and the continuation byte ('\x80')
  even if '\xf1' is the start byte of a 4-bytes sequence.  Previous versions
  returned a single u'\ufffd'.

- Issue #9011: A negated imaginary literal (e.g., "-7j") now has real part -0.0
  rather than 0.0.  So "-7j" is now exactly equivalent to "-(7j)".

- Be more specific in error messages about positional arguments.

- Issue #8949: "z" format of PyArg_Parse*() functions doesn't accept bytes
  objects, as described in the documentation.

- Issue #6543: Write the traceback in the terminal encoding instead of utf-8.
  Fix the encoding of the modules filename.  Patch written by Amaury Forgeot
  d'Arc.

- Issue #9011: Remove buggy and unnecessary (in 3.x) ST->AST compilation code
  dealing with unary minus applied to a constant.  The removed code was mutating
  the ST, causing a second compilation to fail.

- Issue #850997: mbcs encoding (Windows only) handles errors argument: strict
  mode raises unicode errors.  The encoder only supports "strict" and "replace"
  error handlers, the decoder only supports "strict" and "ignore" error
  handlers.  Patch written by Mark Hammond.

- Issue #8850: Remove "w" and "w#" formats from PyArg_Parse*() functions, use
  "w*" format instead. Add tests for "w*" format.

- Issue #8592: PyArg_Parse*() functions raise a TypeError for "y", "u" and "Z"
  formats if the string contains a null byte/character.  Write unit tests for
  string formats.

- Issue #7490: To facilitate sharing of doctests between 2.x and 3.x test
  suites, the IGNORE_EXCEPTION_DETAIL directive now also ignores the module
  location of the raised exception.

- Issue #8969: On Windows, use mbcs codec in strict mode to encode and decode
  filenames and enable os.fsencode().

- Issue #9058: Remove assertions about INT_MAX in UnicodeDecodeError.

- Issue #8941: Decoding big endian UTF-32 data in UCS-2 builds could crash the
  interpreter with characters outside the Basic Multilingual Plane (higher than
  0x10000).

- Issue #8950: (See also issue #5080).  Py_ArgParse*() functions now raise
  TypeError instead of giving a DeprecationWarning when a float is parsed using
  the 'L' code (for long long).  (All other integer codes already raise
  TypeError in this case.)

- Issue #8922: Normalize the encoding name in PyUnicode_AsEncodedString() to
  enable shortcuts for upper case encoding name. Add also a shortcut for
  "iso-8859-1" in PyUnicode_AsEncodedString() and PyUnicode_Decode().

- Issue #8838: Remove codecs.charbuffer_encode() function.  The buffer protocol
  doesn't support "char buffer" anymore in Python 3.

- Issue #8339: Remove "t#" format of PyArg_Parse*() functions, use "s#" or "s*"
  instead.  codecs.charbuffer_encode() now accepts modifiable buffer objects
  like bytearray.

- Issue #8837: Remove "O?" format of PyArg_Parse*() functions.  The format is no
  used anymore and it was never documented.

- In str.format(), raise a ValueError when indexes to arguments are too large.

- Issue #2844: Make int('42', n) consistently raise ValueError for invalid
  integers n (including n = -909).

- Issue #8188: Introduce a new scheme for computing hashes of numbers (instances
  of int, float, complex, decimal.Decimal and fractions.Fraction) that makes it
  easy to maintain the invariant that hash(x) == hash(y) whenever x and y have
  equal value.

- Issue #8748: Fix two issues with comparisons between complex and integer
  objects.  (1) The comparison could incorrectly return True in some cases
  (2**53+1 == complex(2**53) == 2**53), breaking transitivity of equality.
  (2) The comparison raised an OverflowError for large integers, leading to
  unpredictable exceptions when combining integers and complex objects in sets
  or dicts.

- Issue #8766: Initialize _warnings module before importing the first module.
  Fix a crash if an empty directory called "encodings" exists in sys.path.

- Issue #8589: Decode PYTHONWARNINGS environment variable with the file system
  encoding and surrogateescape error handler instead of the locale encoding to
  be consistent with os.environ.  Add PySys_AddWarnOptionUnicode() function.

- PyObject_Dump() encodes unicode objects to utf8 with backslashreplace (instead
  of strict) error handler to escape surrogates.

- Issue #8715: Create PyUnicode_EncodeFSDefault() function: Encode a Unicode
  object to Py_FileSystemDefaultEncoding with the "surrogateescape" error
  handler, and return bytes.  If Py_FileSystemDefaultEncoding is not set, fall
  back to UTF-8.

- Enable shortcuts for common encodings in PyUnicode_AsEncodedString() for any
  error handler, not only the default error handler (strict).

- Issue #8610: Load file system codec at startup, and display a fatal error on
  failure.  Set the file system encoding to utf-8 (instead of None) if getting
  the locale encoding failed, or if nl_langinfo(CODESET) function is missing.

- PyFile_FromFd() uses PyUnicode_DecodeFSDefault() instead of
  PyUnicode_FromString() to support surrogates in the filename and use the right
  encoding.

- Issue #7507: Quote "!" in pipes.quote(); it is special to some shells.

- PyUnicode_DecodeFSDefaultAndSize() uses surrogateescape error handler.

- Issue #8419: Prevent the dict constructor from accepting non-string keyword
  arguments.

- Issue #8124: PySys_WriteStdout() and PySys_WriteStderr() don't execute
  indirectly Python signal handlers anymore because mywrite() ignores exceptions
  (KeyboardInterrupt).

- Issue #8092: Fix PyUnicode_EncodeUTF8() to support error handler producing
  unicode string (eg. backslashreplace).

- Issue #8485: PyUnicode_FSConverter() doesn't accept byteearray objects
  anymore, you have to convert your bytearray filenames to bytes.

- Issue #7332: Remove the 16KB stack-based buffer in
  PyMarshal_ReadLastObjectFromFile, which doesn't bring any noticeable benefit
  compared to the dynamic memory allocation fallback.  Patch by Charles-François
  Natali.

- Issue #8417: Raise an OverflowError when an integer larger than sys.maxsize is
  passed to bytes or bytearray.

- Issue #7301: Add environment variable $PYTHONWARNINGS.

- Issue #8329: Don't return the same lists from select.select when no fds are
  changed.

  is unknown.

- Issue #1583863: A str subclass can now override the __str__ method.

- Issue #8014: Setting a T_UINT or T_PYSSIZET attribute of an object with
  PyMemberDefs could produce an internal error; raise TypeError instead.

- Issue #7845: Rich comparison methods on the complex type now return
  NotImplemented rather than raising a TypeError when comparing with an
  incompatible type; this allows user-defined classes to implement their own
  comparisons with complex.

- Issue #3137: Don't ignore errors at startup, especially a keyboard interrupt
  (SIGINT). If an error occurs while importing the site module, the error is
  printed and Python exits. Initialize the GIL before importing the site module.

- Issue #7173: Generator finalization could invalidate sys.exc_info().

- Issue #7544: Preallocate thread memory before creating the thread to avoid a
  fatal error in low memory condition.

- Issue #7820: The parser tokenizer restores all bytes in the right if the BOM
  check fails.

- Handle errors from looking up __prepare__ correctly.

- Issue #5939: Add additional runtime checking to ensure a valid capsule in
  Modules/_ctypes/callproc.c.

  UnicodeEncodeError, UnicodeDecodeError, and UnicodeTranslateError to strings.

- Issue #6902: Fix problem with built-in types format incorrectly with 0
  padding.

- Issue #7988: Fix default alignment to be right aligned for complex.__format__.
  Now it matches other numeric types.

- Issue #5988: Remove deprecated functions PyOS_ascii_formatd,
  PyOS_ascii_strtod, and PyOS_ascii_atof.  Use PyOS_double_to_string and
  PyOS_string_to_double instead.  See issue #5835 for the original deprecations.

- Issue #7385: Fix a crash in `MemoryView_FromObject` when `PyObject_GetBuffer`
  fails.  Patch by Florent Xicluna.

- Issue #7788: Fix an interpreter crash produced by deleting a list slice with
  very large step value.

- Issue #7766: Change sys.getwindowsversion() return value to a named tuple and
  add the additional members returned in an OSVERSIONINFOEX structure.  The new
  members are service_pack_major, service_pack_minor, suite_mask, and
  product_type.

- Issue #7561: Operations on empty bytearrays (such as `int(bytearray())`) could
  crash in many places because of the PyByteArray_AS_STRING() macro returning
  NULL.  The macro now returns a statically allocated empty string instead.

- Issue #6690: Optimize the bytecode for expressions such as `x in {1, 2, 3}`,
  where the right hand operand is a set of constants, by turning the set into a
  frozenset and pre-building it as a constant.  The comparison operation is made
  against the constant instead of building a new set each time it is executed (a
  similar optimization already existed which turned a list of constants into a
  pre-built tuple).  Patch and additional tests by Dave Malcolm.

- Issue #7622: Improve the split(), rsplit(), splitlines() and replace() methods
  of bytes, bytearray and unicode objects by using a common implementation based
  on stringlib's fast search.  Patch by Florent Xicluna.

- Issue #7632: Fix various str -> float conversion bugs present in 2.7 alpha 2,
  including: (1) a serious 'wrong output' bug that could occur for long (> 40
  digit) input strings, (2) a crash in dtoa.c that occurred in debug builds when
  parsing certain long numeric strings corresponding to subnormal values, (3) a
  memory leak for some values large enough to cause overflow, and (4) a number
  of flaws that could lead to incorrectly rounded results.

- The __complex__ method is now looked up on the class of instances to make it
  consistent with other special methods.

- Issue #7462: Implement the stringlib fast search algorithm for the `rfind`,
  `rindex`, `rsplit` and `rpartition` methods.  Patch by Florent Xicluna.

- Issue #7604: Deleting an unset slotted attribute did not raise an
  AttributeError.

- Issue #7534: Fix handling of IEEE specials (infinities, nans, negative zero)
  in ** operator.  The behaviour now conforms to that described in C99 Annex F.

- Issue #1811: improve accuracy and cross-platform consistency for true division
  of integers: the result of a/b is now correctly rounded for ints a and b (at
  least on IEEE 754 platforms), and in particular does not depend on the
  internal representation of an int.

- Issue #6834: replace the implementation for the 'python' and 'pythonw'
  executables on OSX.

  These executables now work properly with the arch(1) command: ``arch -ppc
  python`` will start a universal binary version of python in PPC mode (unlike
  previous releases).

- Issue #7466: Segmentation fault when the garbage collector is called in the
  middle of populating a tuple.  Patch by Florent Xicluna.

- Issue #6970: Remove redundant calls when comparing objects that don't
  implement the relevant rich comparison methods.

- Issue #7298: Fixes for range and reversed(range(...)).  Iteration over
  range(a, b, c) incorrectly gave an empty iterator when a, b and c fit in C
  long but the length of the range did not.  Also fix several cases where
  reversed(range(a, b, c)) gave wrong results, and fix a refleak for
  reversed(range(a, b, c)) with large arguments.

- Issue #7244: itertools.izip_longest() no longer ignores exceptions raised
  during the formation of an output tuple.

- Issue #3297: On wide unicode builds, do not split unicode characters into
  surrogates.

- Remove length limitation when constructing a complex number from a string.

- Issue #1087418: Boost performance of bitwise operations for longs.

- Support for AtheOS has been completely removed from the code base. It was
  disabled since Python 3.0.

  libraries are: Mach C threads, SunOS LWP, GNU pth, Irix threads. Support code
  will be entirely removed in 3.3.

- Support for OSF* has been disabled. If nobody stands up, support will be
  removed in 3.3. See <http://bugs.python.org/issue8606>.

- Peephole constant folding had missed UNARY_POSITIVE.

  byte values greater than 127.  Patch by Derk Drukker.

- Issue #1571184: The Unicode database contains properties for more characters.
  The tables for code points representing numeric values, white spaces or line
  breaks are now generated from the official Unicode Character Database files,
  and include information from the Unihan.txt file.

- Issue #7019: Raise ValueError when unmarshalling bad long data, instead of
  producing internally inconsistent Python longs.

- Issue #6990: Fix threading.local subclasses leaving old state around after a
  reference cycle GC which could be recycled by new locals.

  and not an int.  Fix the corresponding error message, and the documentation.

- The deprecated PyCObject has been removed.

- Issue #6347: Include inttypes.h as well as stdint.h in pyport.h.  This fixes a
  build failure on HP-UX: int32_t and uint32_t are defined in inttypes.h instead
  of stdint.h on that platform.

- Issue #6373: Fixed a SystemError when encoding with the latin-1 codec and the
  'surrogateescape' error handler, a string which contains unpaired surrogates.

- Issue #4856: Remove checks for win NT.

- Issue #6687: PyBytes_FromObject() no longer accepts an integer as its argument
  to construct a null-initialized bytes object.

- Issue #8084: PEP 370 now conforms to system conventions for framework builds
  on MacOS X. That is, "python setup.py install --user" will install into
  "~/Library/Python/2.7" instead of "~/.local".

C-API
-----

- Issue #2443: A new macro, `Py_VA_COPY`, copies the state of the
  variable argument list.  `Py_VA_COPY` is equivalent to C99
  `va_copy`, but available on all python platforms.

- PySlice_GetIndicesEx now clips the step to [-PY_SSIZE_T_MAX, PY_SSIZE_T_MAX]
  instead of [-PY_SSIZE_T_MAX-1, PY_SSIZE_T_MAX].  This makes it safe to do
  "step = -step" when reversing a slice.

- Issue #5753: A new C API function, `PySys_SetArgvEx`, allows embedders of the
  interpreter to set sys.argv without also modifying sys.path.  This helps fix
  `CVE-2008-5983
  <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-5983>`_.

- Add PyArg_ValidateKeywordArguments, which checks if all keyword arguments are
  strings in an efficient manner.

- Issue #8276: PyEval_CallObject() is now only available in macro form.  The
  function declaration, which was kept for backwards compatibility reasons, is
  now removed (the macro was introduced in 1997!).

- Issue #7767: New function PyLong_AsLongLongAndOverflow added, analogous to
  PyLong_AsLongAndOverflow.

- Make PyUnicode_CompareWithASCIIString return not equal if the Python string
  has '\0' at the end.

- Issue #5080: The argument parsing functions PyArg_ParseTuple,
  PyArg_ParseTupleAndKeywords, PyArg_VaParse, PyArg_VaParseTupleAndKeywords and
  PyArg_Parse now raise a DeprecationWarning for float arguments passed with the
  'L' format code.  This will become a TypeError in a future version of Python,
  to match the behaviour of the other integer format codes.

- Issue #7033: Function ``PyErr_NewExceptionWithDoc()`` added.

- Issue #7414: 'C' code wasn't being skipped properly (for keyword arguments) in
  PyArg_ParseTupleAndKeywords.

- Issue #7228: Add '%lld' and '%llu' support to PyString_FromFormat(V) and
  PyErr_Format, on machines with HAVE_LONG_LONG defined.

- Issue #6151: Made PyDescr_COMMON conform to standard C (like PyObject_HEAD in
  PEP 3123).  The PyDescr_TYPE and PyDescr_NAME macros should be should used for
  accessing the d_type and d_name members of structures using PyDescr_COMMON.

- Issue #6405: Remove duplicate type declarations in descrobject.h.

- The code flags for old __future__ features are now available again.

- Issue #5954: Add a PyFrame_GetLineNumber() function to replace most uses of
  PyCode_Addr2Line().

- Issue #5959: Add a PyCode_NewEmpty() function to create a new empty code
  object at a specified file, function, and line number.

- Issue #1419652: Change the first argument to PyImport_AppendInittab() to
  ``const char *`` as the string is stored beyond the call.

- Issue #2422: When compiled with the ``--with-valgrind`` option, the pymalloc
  allocator will be automatically disabled when running under Valgrind.  This
  gives improved memory leak detection when running under Valgrind, while taking
  advantage of pymalloc at other times.

Library
-------

- In pdb, when Ctrl-C is entered while defining commands for a breakpoint, the
  old commands are restored.

- For traceback debugging, the pdb listing now also shows the locations where
  the exception was originally (re)raised, if it differs from the last line
  executed (e.g. in case of finally clauses).

- The pdb command "source" has been added.  It displays the source code for a
  given object, if possible.

  for the current function.

- Issue #1503502: Make pdb.Pdb easier to subclass by putting message and error
  output into methods.

- Issue #9384: ``python -m tkinter`` will now display a simple demo applet.

- The default size of the re module's compiled regular expression cache has been
  increased from 100 to 500 and the cache replacement policy has changed from
  simply clearing the entire cache on overflow to forgetting the least recently
  used cached compiled regular expressions.  This is a performance win for
  applications that use a lot of regular expressions and limits the impact of
  the performance hit anytime the cache is exceeded.

- Issue #7113: Speed up loading in configparser. Patch by Łukasz Langa.

- Issue #9032: XML-RPC client retries the request on EPIPE error.  The EPIPE
  error occurs when the server closes the socket and the client sends a big

  getopt doesn't accept a value (eg. --help= is rejected if getopt uses
  ['help='] long options).

- Issue #7989: Added pure python implementation of the `datetime` module.  The C
  module is renamed to `_datetime` and if available, overrides all classes
  defined in datetime with fast C impementation.  Python implementation is based
  on the original python prototype for the datetime module by Tim Peters with
  minor modifications by the PyPy project.  The test suite now tests `datetime`
  module with and without `_datetime` acceleration using the same test cases.

- Issue #7895: platform.mac_ver() no longer crashes after calling os.fork().

  and the exponent is tiny (for example, ``Decimal(10) **
  Decimal('1e-999999999')``).

  giving the number of frames to go.

- Issue #9018: os.path.normcase() now raises a TypeError if the argument is not
  ``str`` or ``bytes``.

- Issue #9075: In the ssl module, remove the setting of a ``debug`` flag on an
  OpenSSL structure.

- Issue #8682: The ssl module now temporary increments the reference count of a
  socket object got through ``PyWeakref_GetObject``, so as to avoid possible
  deallocation while the object is still being used.

- Issue #1368368: FancyURLOpener class changed to throw an Exception on wrong
  password instead of presenting an interactive prompt.  Older behavior can be
  obtained by passing retry=True to http_error_xxx methods of FancyURLOpener.

- Issue #8720: Fix regression caused by fix for #4050 by making getsourcefile
  smart enough to find source files in the linecache.

- Issue #5610: feedparser no longer eats extra characters at the end of a body
  part if the body part ends with a ``\r\n``.

  between -27.3 and -30.0 on some platforms.

- Issue #8784: Set tarfile default encoding to 'utf-8' on Windows.

- Issue #8966: If a ctypes structure field is an array of c_char, convert its
  value to bytes instead of str (as done for c_char and c_char_p).

- Issue #8188: Comparisons between Decimal and Fraction objects are now
  permitted, returning a result based on the exact numerical values of the
  operands.  This builds on issue #2531, which allowed Decimal-to-float
  comparisons; all comparisons involving numeric types (bool, int, float,
  complex, Decimal, Fraction) should now act as expected.

  Initial idea by Sridhar Ratnakumar.

- Issue #6662: Fix parsing of malformatted charref (&#bad;), patch written by
  Fredrik Håård.

- Issue #8540: Decimal module: rename the Context._clamp attribute to
  Context.clamp and make it public.  This is useful in creating contexts that
  correspond to the decimal interchange formats specified in IEEE 754.

- Issue #6268: Fix seek() method of codecs.open(), don't read or write the BOM
  twice after seek(0). Fix also reset() method of codecs, UTF-16, UTF-32 and
  StreamWriter classes.

- Issue #3798: sys.exit(message) writes the message to sys.stderr file, instead

  protocol versions, when used in combination with `PROTOCOL_SSLv23`.

- Issue #8759: Fixed user paths in sysconfig for posix and os2 schemes.

- Issue #8663: distutils.log emulates backslashreplace error handler. Fix

  stdout is not a TTY).

- Issue #8513: os.get_exec_path() supports b'PATH' key and bytes value.
  subprocess.Popen() and os._execvpe() support bytes program name. Add
  os.supports_bytes_environ flag: True if the native OS type of the environment
  is bytes (eg. False on Windows).

- Issue #8633: tarfile is now able to read and write archives with "raw" binary
  pax headers as described in POSIX.1-2008.

  for use in the file system, environment variables or the command line.

- Issue #8571: Fix an internal error when compressing or decompressing a chunk
  larger than 1GB with the zlib module's compressor and decompressor objects.

- Issue #8603: Support bytes environmental variables on Unix: Add os.environb
  mapping and os.getenvb() function. os.unsetenv() encodes str argument to the
  file system encoding with the surrogateescape error handler (instead of
  utf8/strict) and accepts bytes. posix.environ keys and values are now bytes.

- Issue #8573: asyncore _strerror() function might throw ValueError.

- Issue #8483: asyncore.dispatcher's __getattr__ method produced confusing error
  messages when accessing undefined class attributes because of the cheap
  inheritance with the underlying socket object.  The cheap inheritance has been
  deprecated.

- Issue #4265: shutil.copyfile() was leaking file descriptors when disk fills.
  Patch by Tres Seaver.

  handled.  In many cases this order wasn't being followed, leading to the wrong
  Python exception being raised.

  and mappings.

- Issue #2302: Fix a race condition in SocketServer.BaseServer.shutdown, where
  the method could block indefinitely if called just before the event loop
  started running.  This also fixes the occasional freezes witnessed in
  test_httpservers.

- Issue #8524: When creating an SSL socket, the timeout value of the original
  socket wasn't retained (instead, a socket with a positive timeout would be
  turned into a non-blocking SSL socket).

- Issue #5103: SSL handshake would ignore the socket timeout and block
  indefinitely if the other end didn't respond.

- The do_handshake() method of SSL objects now adjusts the blocking mode of the
  SSL structure if necessary (as other methods already do).

- Issue #8391: os.execvpe() and os.getenv() supports unicode with surrogates and
  bytes strings for environment keys and values.

- Issue #8467: Pure Python implementation of subprocess encodes the error
  message using surrogatepass error handler to support surrogates in the
  message.

- Issue #8468: bz2.BZ2File() accepts str with surrogates and bytes filenames.

- Issue #8451: Syslog module now uses basename(sys.argv[0]) instead of the
  string "python" as the *ident*.  openlog() arguments are all optional and
  keywords.

- Issue #8108: Fix the unwrap() method of SSL objects when the socket has a
  non-infinite timeout.  Also make that method friendlier with applications
  wanting to continue using the socket in clear-text mode, by disabling
  OpenSSL's internal readahead.  Thanks to Darryl Miles for guidance.

- Issue #8496: make mailcap.lookup() always return a list, rather than an
  iterator.  Patch by Gregory Nofi.

- Issue #8195: Fix a crash in sqlite Connection.create_collation() if the
  collation name contains a surrogate character.

  Locke and Hans Ulrich Niedermann.

- Issue #5277: Fix quote counting when parsing RFC 2231 encoded parameters.

- Issue #7316: The acquire() method of lock objects in the :mod:`threading`
  module now takes an optional timeout argument in seconds.  Timeout support
  relies on the system threading library, so as to avoid a semi-busy wait loop.

- Issue #8383: pickle and pickletools use surrogatepass error handler when
  encoding unicode as utf8 to support lone surrogates and stay compatible with
  Python 2.x and 3.x.

- Issue #7585: difflib context and unified diffs now place a tab between
  filename and date, conforming to the 'standards' they were originally designed
  to follow.  This improves compatibility with patch tools.

- Issue #7472: Fixed typo in email.encoders module; messages using ISO-2022
  character sets will now consistently use a Content-Transfer-Encoding of 7bit
  rather than sometimes being marked as 8bit.

  using the new attributes `ssl.OPENSSL_VERSION`, `ssl.OPENSSL_VERSION_INFO` and
  `ssl.OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER`.

- Add functools.total_ordering() and functools.cmp_to_key().

- Issue #8257: The Decimal construct now accepts a float instance directly,
  converting that float to a Decimal of equal value:

     >>> Decimal(1.1)
     Decimal('1.100000000000000088817841970012523233890533447265625')

- Issue #8294: The Fraction constructor now accepts Decimal and float instances
  directly.

- Issue #7279: Comparisons involving a Decimal signaling NaN now signal
  InvalidOperation instead of returning False.  (Comparisons involving a quiet
  NaN are unchanged.)  Also, Decimal quiet NaNs are now hashable; Decimal
  signaling NaNs remain unhashable.

- Issue #2531: Comparison operations between floats and Decimal instances now
  return a result based on the numeric values of the operands; previously they
  returned an arbitrary result based on the relative ordering of id(float) and
  id(Decimal).  See also issue #8188, which adds Decimal-to-Fraction
  comparisons.

- Added a subtract() method to collections.Counter().

- Issue #8233: When run as a script, py_compile.py optionally takes a single
  argument `-` which tells it to read files to compile from stdin.  Each line is
  read on demand and the named file is compiled immediately.  (Original patch by
  Piotr Ożarowski).

- Backwards incompatible change: Unicode codepoints line tabulation (0x0B) and
  form feed (0x0C) are now considered linebreaks, as specified in Unicode
  Standard Annex #14.  See issue #7643.  http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr14/

- Comparisons using one of <, <=, >, >= between a complex instance and a
  Fractions instance now raise TypeError instead of returning True/False.  This
  makes Fraction <=> complex comparisons consistent with int <=> complex, float
  <=> complex, and complex <=> complex comparisons.

- Issue #8139: ossaudiodev didn't initialize its types properly, therefore some
  methods (such as oss_mixer_device.fileno()) were not available.  Initial patch
  by Bertrand Janin.

- Issue #8205: Remove the "Modules" directory from sys.path when Python is
  running from the build directory (POSIX only).

- Issue #7512: shutil.copystat() could raise an OSError when the filesystem
  didn't support chflags() (for example ZFS under FreeBSD).  The error is now
  silenced.

- Issue #7860: platform.uname now reports the correct 'machine' type when Python
  is running in WOW64 mode on 64 bit Windows.

- Issue #3890, #8222: Fix recv() and recv_into() on non-blocking SSL sockets.
  Also, enable the SSL_MODE_AUTO_RETRY flag on SSL sockets, so that blocking
  reads and writes are always retried by OpenSSL itself.

  locale.

- The internals of the subprocess module on POSIX systems have been replaced by
  an extension module (_posixsubprocess) so that the fork()+exec() can be done
  safely without the possibility of deadlock in multithreaded applications.

- subprocess.Popen now has restore_signals and start_new_session features.  The
  default of restore_signals=True is a new behavior compared to earlier Python
  versions.  This means that signals such as SIGPIPE are not ignored by default
  in subprocesses launched by Python (Issue #1652).

- Issue #6472: The xml.etree package is updated to ElementTree 1.3.  The
  cElementTree module is updated too.

- Issue #7774: Set sys.executable to an empty string if argv[0] has been set to
  an non existent program name and Python is unable to retrieve the real program
  name.

- Issue #7880: Fix sysconfig when the python executable is a symbolic link.

- Issue #6509: fix re.sub to work properly when the pattern, the string, and the
  replacement were all bytes.  Patch by Antoine Pitrou.

  messages parsed by email.Parser.HeaderParser.

- Issue #7361: Importlib was not properly checking the number of bytes in
  bytecode file when it was less then 8 bytes.

- Issue #7633: In the decimal module, Context class methods (with the exception
  of canonical and is_canonical) now accept instances of int and long wherever a
  Decimal instance is accepted, and implicitly convert that argument to Decimal.
  Previously only some arguments were converted.

- Issue #7835: shelve should no longer produce mysterious warnings during
  interpreter shutdown.

- Issue #2746: Don't escape ampersands and angle brackets ("&", "<", ">") in XML
  processing instructions and comments.  These raw characters are allowed by the
  XML specification, and are necessary when outputting e.g.  PHP code in a
  processing instruction.  Patch by Neil Muller.

- Issue #6233: ElementTree failed converting unicode characters to XML entities
  when they could't be represented in the requested output encoding.  Patch by
  Jerry Chen.

- Issue #6003: add an argument to ``zipfile.Zipfile.writestr`` to specify the
  compression type.

- Issue #4772: Raise a ValueError when an unknown Bluetooth protocol is
  specified, rather than fall through to AF_PACKET (in the `socket` module).
  Also, raise ValueError rather than TypeError when an unknown TIPC address type
  is specified.  Patch by Brian Curtin.

- Issue #6939: Fix file I/O objects in the `io` module to keep the original file
  position when calling `truncate()`.  It would previously change the file
  position to the given argument, which goes against the tradition of
  ftruncate() and other truncation APIs.  Patch by Pascal Chambon.

- Issue #7610: Reworked implementation of the internal
  :class:`zipfile.ZipExtFile` class used to represent files stored inside an
  archive.  The new implementation is significantly faster and can be wrapped in
  a :class:`io.BufferedReader` object for more speedups.  It also solves an
  issue where interleaved calls to `read()` and `readline()` give wrong results.
  Patch by Nir Aides.

- Issue #6963: Added "maxtasksperchild" argument to multiprocessing.Pool,
  allowing for a maximum number of tasks within the pool to be completed by the
  worker before that worker is terminated, and a new one created to replace it.

  file). Initial patch by Collin Winter.

- Issue #7617: Make sure distutils.unixccompiler.UnixCCompiler recognizes gcc
  when it has a fully qualified configuration prefix. Initial patch by Arfrever.

  TypeError when given an `str` object (rather than a `bytes`-like object).
  Patch by Victor Stinner and Florent Xicluna.

- Issue #7349: Make methods of file objects in the io module accept None as an
  argument where file-like objects (ie StringIO and BytesIO) accept them to mean
  the same as passing no argument.

- Issue #7357: tarfile no longer suppresses fatal extraction errors by default.

- Issue #5949: added check for correct lineends in input from IMAP server in

  access to the initgroups(3) C library call on Unix systems which implement it.
  Patch by Jean-Paul Calderone.

- Issue #7408: Fixed distutils.tests.sdist so it doesn't check for group
  ownership when the group is not forced, because the group may be different
  from the user's group and inherit from its container when the test is run.

- Issue #4486: When an exception has an explicit cause, do not print its
  implicit context too.  This affects the `traceback` module as well as built-in

  Collins.

- Issue #7403: logging: Fixed possible race condition in lock creation.

  returning the total number of seconds in the duration.  Patch by Brian
  Quinlan.

- Issue #7133: SSL objects now support the new buffer API.

- Issue #1488943: difflib.Differ() doesn't always add hints for tab characters.

- Issue #6123: tarfile now opens empty archives correctly and consistently
  raises ReadError on empty files.

  execute file paths that refer to source or compiled Python files as well as
  zipfiles, directories and other valid sys.path entries that contain a
  __main__.py file.  This allows applications that run other Python scripts to
  support the same flexibility as the CPython command line itself.

- Issue #7318: multiprocessing now uses a timeout when it fails to establish a
  connection with another process, rather than looping endlessly.  The default
  timeout is 20 seconds, which should be amply sufficient for local connections.

  unpickled.  This fixes crashes under Windows when trying to run
  test_multiprocessing in verbose mode.

- Issue #7893: ``unittest.TextTestResult`` is made public and a ``resultclass``
  argument added to the TextTestRunner constructor allowing a different result
  class to be used without having to subclass.

- Issue #7588: ``unittest.TextTestResult.getDescription`` now includes the test
  name in failure reports even if the test has a docstring.

- Issue #3001: Add a C implementation of recursive locks which is used by
  default when instantiating a `threading.RLock` object. This makes recursive
  locks as fast as regular non-recursive locks (previously, they were slower by
  10x to 15x).

- Issue #7282: Fix a memory leak when an RLock was used in a thread other than
  those started through `threading.Thread` (for example, using
  `_thread.start_new_thread()`).

  write new bytecode when it was made read-only.

- Issue #7264: Fix a possible deadlock when deallocating thread-local objects
  which are part of a reference cycle.

- Issue #7211: Allow 64-bit values for the `ident` and `data` fields of kevent
  objects on 64-bit systems.  Patch by Michael Broghton.

- Issue #6896: mailbox.Maildir now invalidates its internal cache each time a
  modification is done through it.  This fixes inconsistencies and test failures
  on systems with slightly bogus mtime behaviour.

- Issue #7246 & Issue #7208: getpass now properly flushes input before reading
  from stdin so that existing input does not confuse it and lead to incorrect
  entry or an IOError.  It also properly flushes it afterwards to avoid the
  terminal echoing the input afterwards on OSes such as Solaris.

- Issue #7233: Fix a number of two-argument Decimal methods to make sure that
  they accept an int or long as the second argument.  Also fix buggy handling of
  large arguments (those with coefficient longer than the current precision) in
  shift and rotate.

  anachronisms in the code which were a relic of 1.5.2 compatibility.

- Issue #7082: When falling back to the MIME 'name' parameter, the correct place
  to look for it is the Content-Type header.

- Make tokenize.detect_coding() normalize utf-8 and iso-8859-1 variants like the
  builtin tokenizer.

- Issue #7048: Force Decimal.logb to round its result when that result is too
  large to fit in the current precision.

  type specifier.

- Issue #6239: ctypes.c_char_p return value must return bytes.

- Issue #6838: Use a list to accumulate the value instead of repeatedly
  concatenating strings in http.client's HTTPResponse._read_chunked providing a
  significant speed increase when downloading large files servend with a
  Transfer-Encoding of 'chunked'.

- Trying to import a submodule from a module that is not a package, ImportError
  should be raised, not AttributeError.

- When the globals past to importlib.__import__() has __package__ set to None,
  fall back to computing what __package__ should be instead of giving up.

- Raise a TypeError when the name of a module to be imported for
  importlib.__import__ is not a string (was raising an AttributeError before).

  DO/DONT correctly.

- Issue #1424152: Fix for http.client, urllib.request to support SSL while
  working through proxy.  Original patch by Christopher Li, changes made by
  Senthil Kumaran.

- Add importlib.abc.ExecutionLoader to represent the PEP 302 protocol for
  loaders that allow for modules to be executed. Both importlib.abc.PyLoader and
  PyPycLoader inherit from this class and provide implementations in relation to
  other methods required by the ABCs.

- importlib.abc.PyLoader did not inherit from importlib.abc.ResourceLoader like
  the documentation said it did even though the code in PyLoader relied on the
  abstract method required by ResourceLoader.

- Issue #6431: Make Fraction type return NotImplemented when it doesn't know how
  to handle a comparison without loss of precision.  Also add correct handling
  of infinities and nans for comparisons with float.

- Issue #6415: Fixed warnings.warn segfault on bad formatted string.

- Issue #6358: The exit status of a command started with os.popen() was reported
  differently than it did with python 2.x.

- Issue #6323: The pdb debugger did not exit when running a script with a syntax
  error.

  when file descriptors are large; communicate() now uses poll() when possible.

- Issue #6369: Fix an RLE decompression bug in the binhex module.

- Issue #6344: Fixed a crash of mmap.read() when passed a negative argument.

- The deprecated function string.maketrans has been removed.

  sys.path.

- Issue #6218: io.StringIO and io.BytesIO instances are now picklable.

- The os.get_exec_path() function to return the list of directories that will be
  searched for an executable when launching a subprocess was added.

- Issue #7481: When a threading.Thread failed to start it would leave the
  instance stuck in initial state and present in threading.enumerate().

- Issue #1068268: The subprocess module now handles EINTR in internal os.waitpid
  and os.read system calls where appropriate.

- Issue #6729: Added ctypes.c_ssize_t to represent ssize_t.

- Issue #6247: The argparse module has been added to the standard library.

- Issue #8235: _socket: Add the constant ``SO_SETFIB``.  SO_SETFIB is a socket
  option available on FreeBSD 7.1 and newer.

- Issue #9315: Fix for the trace module to record correct class name
  for tracing methods.

Extension Modules
-----------------

- Issue #9959: Tweak formula used for computing math.log of an integer,
  making it marginally more accurate for exact powers of 2.

- Issue #9422: Fix memory leak when re-initializing a struct.Struct object.

- Issue #7900: The getgroups(2) system call on MacOSX behaves rather oddly
  compared to other unix systems. In particular, os.getgroups() does not reflect
  any changes made using os.setgroups() but basicly always returns the same
  information as the id command. os.getgroups() can now return more than 16
  groups on MacOSX.

- Issue #6095: Make directory argument to os.listdir optional.

- Issue #9277: Fix bug in struct.pack for bools in standard mode (e.g.,
  struct.pack('>?')): if conversion to bool raised an exception then that
  exception wasn't properly propagated on machines where char is unsigned.

- Issue #5180: Fixed a bug that prevented loading 2.x pickles in 3.x python when
  they contain instances of old-style classes.

- Issue #9165: Add new functions math.isfinite and cmath.isfinite, to accompany
  existing isinf and isnan functions.

- Issue #1578269: Implement os.symlink for Windows 6.0+.  Patch by Jason
  R. Coombs.

- In struct.pack, correctly propogate exceptions from computing the truth of an
  object in the '?' format.

- Issue #9000: datetime.timezone objects now have eval-friendly repr.

- In the math module, correctly lookup __trunc__, __ceil__, and __floor__ as
  special methods.

- Issue #9005: Prevent utctimetuple() from producing year 0 or year 10,000.
  Prior to this change, timezone adjustment in utctimetuple() could produce
  tm_year value of 0 or 10,000.  Now an OverflowError is raised in these edge
  cases.

- Issue #6641: The ``datetime.strptime`` method now supports the ``%z``
  directive.  When the ``%z`` directive is present in the format string, an
  aware ``datetime`` object is returned with ``tzinfo`` bound to a
  ``datetime.timezone`` instance constructed from the parsed offset.  If both
  ``%z`` and ``%Z`` are present, the data in ``%Z`` field is used for timezone
  name, but ``%Z`` data without ``%z`` is discarded.

- Issue #5094: The ``datetime`` module now has a simple concrete class
  implementing ``datetime.tzinfo`` interface.  Instances of the new class,
  ``datetime.timezone``, return fixed name and UTC offset from their
  ``tzname(dt)`` and ``utcoffset(dt)`` methods.  The ``dst(dt)`` method always
  returns ``None``.  A class attribute, ``utc`` contains an instance
  representing the UTC timezone.  Original patch by Rafe Kaplan.

- Issue #8973: Add __all__ to struct module; this ensures that help(struct)
  includes documentation for the struct.Struct class.

- Issue #3129: Trailing digits in struct format string are no longer ignored.
  For example, "1" or "ilib123" are now invalid formats and cause
  ``struct.error`` to be raised.  Patch by Caleb Deveraux.

- Issue #7384: If the system readline library is linked against ncurses, the
  curses module must be linked against ncurses as well. Otherwise it is not safe
  to load both the readline and curses modules in an application.

- Issue #2810: Fix cases where the Windows registry API returns ERROR_MORE_DATA,
  requiring a re-try in order to get the complete result.

- Issue #8692: Optimize math.factorial: replace the previous naive algorithm
  with an improved 'binary-split' algorithm that uses fewer multiplications and
  allows many of the multiplications to be performed using plain C integer
  arithmetic instead of PyLong arithmetic.  Also uses a lookup table for small
  arguments.

- Issue #8674: Fixed a number of incorrect or undefined-behaviour-inducing
  overflow checks in the audioop module.

- Issue #8644: The accuracy of td.total_seconds() has been improved (by
  calculating with integer arithmetic instead of float arithmetic internally):
  the result is now always correctly rounded, and is equivalent to ``td /
  timedelta(seconds=1)``.

- Issue #2706: Allow division of a timedelta by another timedelta: timedelta /
  timedelta, timedelta % timedelta, timedelta // timedelta and divmod(timedelta,
  timedelta) are all supported.

- Issue #8314: Fix unsigned long long bug in libffi on Sparc v8.

- Issue #8300: When passing a non-integer argument to struct.pack with any
  integer format code, struct.pack first attempts to convert the non-integer
  using its __index__ method.  If that method is non-existent or raises
  TypeError it goes on to try the __int__ method, as described below.

- Issue #8142: Update libffi to the 3.0.9 release.

- Issue #6949: Allow the _dbm extension to be built with db 4.8.x.

- Issue #6544: Fix a reference leak in the kqueue implementation's error
  handling.

- Stop providing crtassem.h symbols when compiling with Visual Studio 2010, as
  msvcr100.dll is not a platform assembly anymore.

- Issue #6508: Add posix.{getresuid,getresgid,setresuid,setresgid}.

- Issue #7078: Set struct.__doc__ from _struct.__doc__.

- Issue #3366: Add erf, erfc, expm1, gamma, lgamma functions to math module.

- Issue #6877: It is now possible to link the readline extension to the libedit
  readline emulation on OSX 10.5 or later.

- Issue #6848: Fix curses module build failure on OS X 10.6.

- Fix a segfault that could be triggered by expat with specially formed input.

- Issue #6561: '\d' in a regex now matches only characters with Unicode category
  'Nd' (Number, Decimal Digit).  Previously it also matched characters with
  category 'No'.

- Issue #4509: Array objects are no longer modified after an operation failing
  due to the resize restriction in-place when the object has exported buffers.

- Issue #2389: Array objects are now pickled in a portable manner.

- Expat: Fix DoS via XML document with malformed UTF-8 sequences
  (CVE_2009_3560).

- Issue #7242: On Solaris 9 and earlier calling os.fork() from within a thread
  could raise an incorrect RuntimeError about not holding the import lock.  The
  import lock is now reinitialized after fork.

- Issue #7999: os.setreuid() and os.setregid() would refuse to accept a -1
  parameter on some platforms such as OS X.

- Build the ossaudio extension on GNU/kFreeBSD.

- Issue #7347: winreg: Add CreateKeyEx and DeleteKeyEx, as well as fix a bug in
  the return value of QueryReflectionKey.

  OPT or EXTRA_CFLAGS, although those variables are still present for
  backward-compatibility.

- Issue #8854: Fix finding Visual Studio 2008 on Windows x64.

- Issue #1759169, #8864: Drop _XOPEN_SOURCE on Solaris, define it for
  multiprocessing only.

- Issue #8625: Turn off optimization in --with-pydebug builds with gcc.
  (Optimization was unintentionally turned on in gcc --with-pydebug builds as a
  result of the issue #1628484 fix, combined with autoconf's strange choice of
  default CFLAGS produced by AC_PROG_CC for gcc.)

- Issue #3646: It is now easily possible to install a Python framework into your
  home directory on MacOSX, see Mac/README for more information.

  tests from compileall.

- Issue #3920, #7903: Define _BSD_SOURCE on OpenBSD 4.4 through 4.9.

- Issue #7632: When Py_USING_MEMORY_DEBUGGER is defined, disable the private
  memory allocation scheme in dtoa.c and use PyMem_Malloc and PyMem_Free
  instead.  Also disable caching of powers of 5.

- Issue #6491: Allow --with-dbmliborder to specify that no dbms will be built.

- Issue #6943: Use pkg-config to find the libffi headers when the
  --with-system-ffi flag is used.

- Issue #7609: Add a --with-system-expat option that causes the system's expat
  library to be used for the pyexpat module instead of the one included with
  Python.

- Issue #7449: Skip test_socketserver if threading support is disabled.

- Issue #8672: Add a zlib test ensuring that an incomplete stream can be handled
  by a decompressor object without errors (it returns incomplete uncompressed
  data).

- Issue #8533: regrtest uses backslashreplace error handler for stdout to avoid
  UnicodeEncodeError (write non-ASCII character to stdout using ASCII encoding).

  test_multiprocessing.  Patch by Paul Moore.

- Issue #7449: Fix many tests to support Python compiled without thread
  support. Patches written by Jerry Seutter.

- Issue #8108: test_ftplib's non-blocking SSL server now has proper handling of
  SSL shutdowns.

- Issues #8279, #8330, #8437, #8480, #8495: Fix test_gdb failures, patch written
  by Dave Malcolm.

- Issue #3864: Skip three test_signal tests on freebsd6 because they fail if any
  thread was previously started, most likely due to a platform bug.

- Issue #8193: Fix test_zlib failure with zlib 1.2.4.

- Issue #8248: Add some tests for the bool type.  Patch by Gregory Nofi.

- Issue #8263: Now regrtest.py will report a failure if it receives a
  KeyboardInterrupt (SIGINT).

- Issue #8180 and #8207: Fix test_pep277 on OS X and add more tests for special
  Unicode normalization cases.

- Issue #7783: test.support.open_urlresource invalidates the outdated files from
  the local cache.

- Issue #7849: Now the utility ``check_warnings`` verifies if the warnings are
  effectively raised.

- The four path modules (genericpath, macpath, ntpath, posixpath) share a common
  TestCase for some tests: test_genericpath.CommonTest.

- Print platform information when running the whole test suite, or using the
  --verbose flag.

- Issue #767675: enable test_pep277 on POSIX platforms with Unicode-friendly
  filesystem encoding.

- Issue #6292: for the moment at least, the test suite runs cleanly if python is
  run with the -OO flag.  Tests requiring docstrings are skipped.

- Issue #7712: test.support gained a new `temp_cwd` context manager which is now
  also used by regrtest to run all the tests in a temporary directory.  The
  original CWD is saved in `support.SAVEDCWD`.  Thanks to Florent Xicluna who
  helped with the patch.

- Issue #7924: Fix an intermittent 'XXX undetected error' failure in test_capi
  (only seen so far on platforms where the curses module wasn't built), due to
  an uncleared exception.

- Issue #7728: test_timeout was changed to use support.bind_port instead of a
  hard coded port.

- Issue #7376: Instead of running a self-test (which was failing) when called
  with no arguments, doctest.py now gives a usage message.

- Issue #7396: fix regrtest -s, which was broken by the -j enhancement.

- Issue #7498: test_multiprocessing now uses test.support.find_unused_port
  instead of a hardcoded port number in test_rapid_restart.

- Issue #7431: Use TESTFN in test_linecache instead of trying to create a file
  in the Lib/test directory, which might be read-only for the user running the
  tests.

  of an option with no handler.

- Issue #7312: Add a -F flag to run the selected tests in a loop until a test
  fails.  Can be combined with -j.

- Issue #6551: test_zipimport could import and then destroy some modules of the
  encodings package, which would make other tests fail further down the road
  because the internally cached encoders and decoders would point to empty
  global variables.

- Issue #7295: Do not use a hardcoded file name in test_tarfile.

- Issue #7270: Add some dedicated unit tests for multi-thread synchronization
  primitives such as Lock, RLock, Condition, Event and Semaphore.

- Issue #7248 (part 2): Use a unique temporary directory for importlib source
  tests instead of tempfile.tempdir. This prevents the tests from sharing state
  between concurrent executions on the same system.

- Issue #7248: In importlib.test.source.util a try/finally block did not make
  sure that some referenced objects actually were created in the block before
  calling methods on the object.

- Issue #7222: Make thread "reaping" more reliable so that reference
  leak-chasing test runs give sensible results. The previous method of reaping
  threads could return successfully while some Thread objects were still
  referenced. This also introduces a new private function:
  :func:`_thread._count()`.

- Issue #7151: Fixed regrtest -j so that output to stderr from a test no longer
  runs the risk of causing the worker thread to fail.

- Issue #7055: test___all__ now greedily detects all modules which have an
  __all__ attribute, rather than using a hardcoded and incomplete list.

- Issue #7058: Added save/restore for things like sys.argv and cwd to
  runtest_inner in regrtest, with warnings if the called test modifies them, and
  a new section in the summary report at the end.

- Issue #7042: Fix test_signal (test_itimer_virtual) failure on OS X 10.6.

- Fixed tests in importlib.test.source.test_abc_loader that were masking the
  proper exceptions that should be raised for missing or improper code object
  bytecode.

- Removed importlib's custom test discovery code and switched to
  unittest.TestLoader.discover().

Tools/Demos
-----------

- Issue #5464, #8974: Implement plural forms in msgfmt.py.

- iobench (a file I/O benchmark) and ccbench (a concurrency benchmark) were
  added to the `Tools/` directory.  They were previously living in the sandbox.

  errors property.  Additionally, the errors and encoding properties of StringIO
  are always None now.

- Issue #6137: The pickle module now translates module names when loading
  or dumping pickles with a 2.x-compatible protocol, in order to make data
  sharing and migration easier. This behaviour can be disabled using the
  new `fix_imports` optional argument.

- Removed the ipaddr module.

- Issue #3613: base64.{encode,decode}string are now called

  function with __func__.

- Added support for multiple context managers in the same with-statement.
  Deprecated contextlib.nested() which is no longer needed.

- Issue #5829: complex("1e500") no longer raises OverflowError.  This
  makes it consistent with float("1e500") and interpretation of real
  and imaginary literals.

- Issue #3527: Removed Py_WIN_WIDE_FILENAMES which is not used any more.

- Issue #5994: the marshal module now has docstrings.

- Issue #5981: Fix three minor inf/nan issues in float.fromhex:
  (1) inf and nan strings with trailing whitespace were incorrectly
  rejected;  (2) parsing of strings representing infinities and nans
  was locale aware; and (3) the interpretation of fromhex('-nan')
  didn't match that of float('-nan').

Library
-------

- Issue #4859: Implement PEP 383 for pwd, spwd, and grp.

- smtplib 'login' and 'cram-md5' login are also fixed (see Issue #5259).

- Issue #6121: pydoc now ignores leading and trailing spaces in the
  argument to the 'help' function.

- Issue #6118: urllib.parse.quote_plus ignored the encoding and errors
  arguments for strings with a space in them.

- collections.namedtuple() was not working with the following field
  names:  cls, self, tuple, itemgetter, and property.

- In unittest, using a skipping decorator on a class is now equivalent to
  skipping every test on the class.  The ClassTestSuite class has been removed.

- Issue #6050: Don't fail extracting a directory from a zipfile if
  the directory already exists.

- Issue #1309352: fcntl now converts its third arguments to a C `long` rather
  than an int, which makes some operations possible under 64-bit Linux (e.g.
  DN_MULTISHOT with F_NOTIFY).

- Issue #5761: Add the name of the underlying file to the repr() of various
  IO objects.

- Issue #5259: smtplib plain auth login no longer gives a traceback.  Fix
  by Musashi Tamura, tests by Marcin Bachry.

- Issue #1983: Fix functions taking or returning a process identifier to use
  the dedicated C type ``pid_t`` instead of a C ``int``. Some platforms have

- Issue #1664: Make nntplib IPv6-capable. Patch by Derek Morr.

- Issue #5006: Better handling of unicode byte-order marks (BOM) in the io
  library. This means, for example, that opening an UTF-16 text file in
  append mode doesn't add a BOM at the end of the file if the file isn't
  empty.

- Issue #4050: inspect.findsource/getsource now raise an IOError if the 'source'
  file is a binary.  Patch by Brodie Rao, tests by Daniel Diniz.  This fix
  corrects a pydoc regression.

- Issue #5955: aifc's close method did not close the file it wrapped,
  now it does.  This also means getfp method now returns the real fp.

Installation
------------

- Issue #6047: fullinstall has been removed because Python 3's executable will
  now be known as python3.

- Lib/smtpd.py is no longer installed as a script.

Extension Modules
-----------------

- Issue #3061: Use wcsftime for time.strftime where available.

  and a python3.pc symlink in the $(LIBDIR)/pkgconfig directory. Patch by
  Clinton Roy.

Tests
-----

- Issue #5442: Tests for importlib were not properly skipping case-sensitivity
  tests on darwin even when the OS was installed on a case-sensitive
  filesystem. Also fixed tests that should not be run when

What's New in Python 3.1 beta 1?
================================

*Release date: 2009-05-06*

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- Issue #5914: Add new C API function PyOS_string_to_double, and
  deprecate PyOS_ascii_strtod and PyOS_ascii_atof.

- Issue #3382: float.__format__, complex.__format__, and %-formatting
  no longer map 'F' to 'f'. Because of issue #5859 (below), this only
  affects nan -> NAN and inf -> INF.

- Issue #5799: ntpath (ie, os.path on Windows) fully supports UNC pathnames
  in all operations, including splitdrive, split, etc.  splitunc() now issues
  a PendingDeprecation warning.

- Issue #5920: For float.__format__, change the behavior with the
  empty presentation type (that is, not one of 'e', 'f', 'g', or 'n')
  to be like 'g' but with at least one decimal point and with a
  default precision of 12. Previously, the behavior the same but with
  a default precision of 6.  This more closely matches str(), and
  reduces surprises when adding alignment flags to the empty
  presentation type. This also affects the new complex.__format__ in
  the same way.

- Implement PEP 383, Non-decodable Bytes in System Character Interfaces.

- Issue #5890: in subclasses of 'property' the __doc__ attribute was
  shadowed by classtype's, even if it was None.  property now
  inserts the __doc__ into the subclass instance __dict__.

- Issue #4426: The UTF-7 decoder was too strict and didn't accept some legal
  sequences. Patch by Nick Barnes and Victor Stinner.

- Issue #3672: Reject surrogates in utf-8 codec; add surrogatepass error handler.

- Issue #5883: In the io module, the BufferedIOBase and TextIOBase ABCs have
  received a new method, detach().  detach() disconnects the underlying stream
  from the buffer or text IO and returns it.

- Issue #5859: Remove switch from '%f' to '%g'-style formatting for
  floats with absolute value over 1e50.  Also remove length
  restrictions for float formatting: '%.67f' % 12.34 and '%.120e' %
  12.34 no longer raise an exception.

- Issue #1588: Add complex.__format__. For example,
  format(complex(1, 2./3), '.5') now produces a sensible result.

- Issue #5864: Fix empty format code formatting for floats so that it
  never gives more than the requested number of significant digits.

- Issue #5793: Rationalize isdigit / isalpha / tolower, etc. Includes
  new Py_ISDIGIT / Py_ISALPHA / Py_TOLOWER, etc. in pctypes.h.

- Issue #5835: Deprecate PyOS_ascii_formatd.

- Issue #4971: Fix titlecase for characters that are their own
  titlecase, but not their own uppercase.

- Issue #5283: Setting __class__ in __del__ caused a segfault.

- Issue #5816: complex(repr(z)) now recovers z exactly, even when
  z involves nans, infs or negative zeros.

- Issue #3166: Make int -> float conversions correctly rounded.

- Issue #1869 (and many duplicates): make round(x, n) correctly
  rounded for a float x, by using the decimal <-> binary conversions
  from Python/dtoa.c.  As a consequence, (e.g.) round(x, 2) now
  consistently agrees with format(x, '.2f').

- Issue #5787: object.__getattribute__(some_type, "__bases__") segfaulted on
  some builtin types.

- Issue #5772: format(1e100, '<') produces '1e+100', not '1.0e+100'.

- Issue #5515: str.format() type 'n' combined with commas and leading
  zeros no longer gives odd results with ints and floats.

- Implement PEP 378, Format Specifier for Thousands Separator, for
  floats.

- The str function switches to exponential notation at
  1e11, not 1e12.  This avoids printing 13 significant digits in
  situations where only 12 of them are correct.  Example problem
  value: str(1e11 + 0.5).  (This minor issue has existed in 2.x for a
  long time.)

- Issue #1580: On most platforms, use a 'short' float repr: for a
  finite float x, repr(x) now outputs a string based on the shortest
  sequence of decimal digits that rounds to x.  Previous behaviour was
  to output 17 significant digits and then strip trailing zeros.
  Another minor difference is that the new repr switches to
  exponential notation at 1e16 instead of the previous 1e17; this
  avoids misleading output in some cases.

  There's a new sys attribute sys.float_repr_style, which takes
  the value 'short' to indicate that we're using short float repr,
  and 'legacy' if the short float repr isn't available for one
  reason or another.

  The float repr change involves incorporating David Gay's 'perfect
  rounding' code into the Python core (it's in Python/dtoa.c).  As a
  secondary consequence, all string-to-float and float-to-string
  conversions (including all float formatting operations) will be
  correctly rounded on these platforms.

  See issue #1580 discussions for details of platforms for which
  this change does not apply.

- Issue #5759: float() didn't call __float__ on str subclasses.

- The string.maketrans() function is deprecated; there is a new static method
  maketrans() on the bytes and bytearray classes.  This removes confusion about
  the types string.maketrans() is supposed to work with, and mirrors the
  methods available on the str class.

- Issue #2170: refactored xml.dom.minidom.normalize, increasing both
  its clarity and its speed.

- Issue #1113244: Py_XINCREF, Py_DECREF, Py_XDECREF: Add ``do { ... } while (0)``
  to avoid compiler warnings.

- Issue #3739: The unicode-internal encoder now reports the number of characters
  consumed like any other encoder (instead of the number of bytes).

  that's valid for float() is now valid for Fraction(), with the
  exception of strings representing NaNs and infinities.

What's New in Python 3.1 alpha 2?
=================================

*Release date: 2009-4-4*

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- Implement PEP 378, Format Specifier for Thousands Separator, for
  integers.

- Issue #5666: Py_BuildValue's 'c' code should create byte strings.

- Issue #5499: The 'c' code for argument parsing functions now only accepts a
  byte, and the 'C' code only accepts a unicode character.

- Fix a problem in PyErr_NormalizeException that leads to "undetected errors"
  when hitting the recursion limit under certain circumstances.

- Issue #1665206: Remove the last eager import in _warnings.c and make it lazy.

- Fix a segfault when running test_exceptions with coverage, caused by
  insufficient checks in accessors of Exception.__context__.

- Issue #5604: non-ASCII characters in module name passed to
  imp.find_module() were converted to UTF-8 while the path is
  converted to the default filesystem encoding, causing nonsense.

- Issue #5126: str.isprintable() returned False for space characters.

- Issue #4865: On MacOSX /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages is added to
  the end sys.path, for compatibility with the system install of Python.

- Issue #4688: Add a heuristic so that tuples and dicts containing only
  untrackable objects are not tracked by the garbage collector. This can
  reduce the size of collections and therefore the garbage collection overhead
  on long-running programs, depending on their particular use of datatypes.

- Issue #5512: Rewrite PyLong long division algorithm (x_divrem) to
  improve its performance.  Long divisions and remainder operations
  are now between 50% and 150% faster.

- Issue #4258: Make it possible to use base 2**30 instead of base
  2**15 for the internal representation of integers, for performance
  reasons.  Base 2**30 is enabled by default on 64-bit machines.  Add
  --enable-big-digits option to configure, which overrides the
  default.  Add sys.int_info structseq to provide information about
  the internal format.

- Issue #4474: PyUnicode_FromWideChar now converts characters outside
  the BMP to surrogate pairs, on systems with sizeof(wchar_t) == 4
  and sizeof(Py_UNICODE) == 2.

- Issue #5237: Allow auto-numbered fields in str.format(). For
  example: '{} {}'.format(1, 2) == '1 2'.

- Issue #5392: when a very low recursion limit was set, the interpreter would
  abort with a fatal error after the recursion limit was hit twice.

- Issue #3845: In PyRun_SimpleFileExFlags avoid invalid memory access with
  short file names.

Library
-------

- Issue #2625: added missing items() call to the for loop in
  mailbox.MH.get_message().

- Issue #5640: Fix _multibytecodec so that CJK codecs don't repeat
  error substitutions from non-strict codec error callbacks in
  incrementalencoder and StreamWriter.

- Issue #5656: Fix the coverage reporting when running the test suite with
  the -T argument.

- Issue #5647: MutableSet.__iand__() no longer mutates self during iteration.

- Issue #5624: Fix the _winreg module name still used in several modules.

- Issue #5628: Fix io.TextIOWrapper.read() with a unreadable buffer.

- Issue #5619: Multiprocessing children disobey the debug flag and causes
  popups on windows buildbots. Patch applied to work around this issue.

- Issue #5400: Added patch for multiprocessing on netbsd compilation/support

- Issue #5387: Fixed mmap.move crash by integer overflow.

- Issue #5261: Patch multiprocessing's semaphore.c to support context
  manager use: "with multiprocessing.Lock()" works now.

- Issue #5236: Change time.strptime() to only take strings. Didn't work with
  bytes already but the failure was non-obvious.

- Issue #5177: Multiprocessing's SocketListener class now uses
  socket.SO_REUSEADDR on all connections so that the user no longer needs
  to wait 120 seconds for the socket to expire.

- Issue #5595: Fix UnboundedLocalError in ntpath.ismount().

- Issue #1174606: Calling read() without arguments of an unbounded file
  (typically /dev/zero under Unix) could crash the interpreter.

- The max_buffer_size arguments of io.BufferedWriter, io.BufferedRWPair, and
  io.BufferedRandom have been deprecated for removal in Python 3.2.

- Issue #5068: Fixed the tarfile._BZ2Proxy.read() method that would loop
  forever on incomplete input. That caused tarfile.open() to hang when used
  with mode 'r' or 'r:bz2' and a fileobj argument that contained no data or
  partial bzip2 compressed data.

- Issue #2110: Add support for thousands separator and 'n' type
  specifier to Decimal.__format__

- Fix Decimal.__format__ bug that swapped the meanings of the '<' and
  '>' alignment characters.

- The error detection code in FileIO.close() could fail to reflect the `errno`
  value, and report it as -1 instead.

- Issue #5016: FileIO.seekable() could return False if the file position
  was negative when truncated to a C int. Patch by Victor Stinner.

Extension Modules
-----------------

- Issue #5391: mmap now deals exclusively with bytes.

- Issue #5463: In struct module, remove deprecated overflow wrapping
  when packing an integer: struct.pack('=L', -1) now raises
  struct.error instead of returning b'\xff\xff\xff\xff'.  The
  _PY_STRUCT_RANGE_CHECKING and _PY_STRUCT_OVERFLOW_MASKING constants
  have been removed from the struct module.

What's New in Python 3.1 alpha 1
================================

*Release date: 2009-03-07*

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- The io module has been reimplemented in C for speed.

- Give dict views an informative __repr__.

- Issue #5247: Improve error message when unknown format codes are
  used when using str.format() with str, int, and float arguments.

- Issue #5249: time.strftime returned malformed string when format string
  contained non ascii character on windows.

- Issue #4626: compile(), exec(), and eval() ignore the coding cookie if the
  source has already been decoded into str.

- Issue #5186: Reduce hash collisions for objects with no __hash__ method by
  rotating the object pointer by 4 bits to the right.

- Issue #4575: Fix Py_IS_INFINITY macro to work correctly on x87 FPUs:
  it now forces its argument to double before testing for infinity.

- Issue #5137: Make len() correctly raise a TypeError when a __len__ method
  returns a non-number type.

- Issue #5182: Removed memoryview.__str__.

- Issue #1717: Removed builtin cmp() function, dropped tp_compare
  slot, the C API functions PyObject_Compare and PyUnicode_Compare and
  the type definition cmpfunc.  The tp_compare slot has been renamed
  to tp_reserved, and is reserved for future usage.

- Issue #1242657: the __len__() and __length_hint__() calls in several tools
  were suppressing all exceptions.  These include list() and bytearray().

- Issue #4707: round(x, n) now returns an integer if x is an integer.
  Previously it returned a float.

- Issue #4753: By enabling a configure option named '--with-computed-gotos'
  on compilers that support it (notably: gcc, SunPro, icc), the bytecode
  evaluation loop is compiled with a new dispatch mechanism which gives
  speedups of up to 20%, depending on the system, on various benchmarks.

- Issue #4874: Most builtin decoders now reject unicode input.

- Issue #4842: Don't allow trailing 'L' when constructing an integer
  from a string.

- Issue #4991: os.fdopen now raises an OSError for invalid file descriptors.

- Issue #4838: When a module is deallocated, free the memory backing the
  optional module state data.

- Issue #4910: Rename nb_long slot to nb_reserved, and change its
  type to ``(void *)``.

- Issue #4935: The overflow checking code in the expandtabs() method common
  to str, bytes and bytearray could be optimized away by the compiler, letting
  the interpreter segfault instead of raising an error.

- Issue #3720: Fix a crash when an iterator modifies its class and removes its
  __next__ method.

- Issue #4910: Builtin int() function and PyNumber_Long/PyNumber_Int API
  function no longer attempt to call the __long__ slot to convert an object
  to an integer.  Only the __int__ and __trunc__ slots are examined.

- Issue #4893: Use NT threading on CE.

- Issue #4915: Port sysmodule to Windows CE.

- Issue #4868: utf-8, utf-16 and latin1 decoding are now 2x to 4x faster. The
  common cases are optimized thanks to a dedicated fast path and a moderate
  amount of loop unrolling.

- Issue #4074: Change the criteria for doing a full garbage collection (i.e.
  collecting the oldest generation) so that allocating lots of objects without
  destroying them does not show quadratic performance. Based on a proposal by
  Martin von Löwis at
  http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2008-June/080579.html.

- Issue #4604: Some objects of the I/O library could still be used after
  having been closed (for instance, a read() call could return some
  previously buffered data). Patch by Dmitry Vasiliev.

- Issue #4705: Fix the -u ("unbuffered binary stdout and stderr") command-line
  flag to work properly. Furthermore, when specifying -u, the text stdout
  and stderr streams have line-by-line buffering enabled (the default being
  to buffer arbitrary chunks of data).

- The internal table, _PyLong_DigitValue, is now an array of unsigned chars
  instead of ints (reducing its size from 4 to 8 times thereby reducing
  Python's overall memory).

- Issue #1180193: When importing a module from a .pyc (or .pyo) file with
  an existing .py counterpart, override the co_filename attributes of all
  code objects if the original filename is obsolete (which can happen if the
  file has been renamed, moved, or if it is accessed through different paths).
  Patch by Ziga Seilnacht and Jean-Paul Calderone.

- Issue #4580: Fix slicing of memoryviews when the item size is greater than
  one byte. Also fixes the meaning of len() so that it returns the number of
  items, rather than the size in bytes.

- Issue #4075: Use OutputDebugStringW in Py_FatalError.

- Issue #4747: When the terminal does not use utf-8, executing a script with
  non-ascii characters in its name could fail with a "SyntaxError: None" error.

- Issue #4797: IOError.filename was not set when ``_fileio.FileIO`` failed
  to open file with a bytes filename on Windows.

- Issue #3680: Reference cycles created through a dict, set or deque iterator
  did not get collected.

- Issue #4701: PyObject_Hash now implicitly calls PyType_Ready on types
  where the tp_hash and tp_dict slots are both NULL.

- Issue #4759: None is now allowed as the first argument of
  bytearray.translate().  It was always allowed for bytes.translate().

- Added test case to ensure attempts to read from a file opened for writing
  fail.

- Issue #3106: Speedup some comparisons (str/str and int/int).

- Issue #2183: Simplify and optimize bytecode for list, dict and set
  comprehensions. Original patch for list comprehensions by Neal Norwitz.

- Issue #2467: gc.DEBUG_STATS reported invalid elapsed times. Also, always
  print elapsed times, not only when some objects are uncollectable /
  unreachable. Original patch by Neil Schemenauer.

- Issue #3439: Add a bit_length method to int.

- Issue #2173: When getting device encoding, check that return value of
  nl_langinfo is not the empty string.  This was causing silent build
  failures on OS X.

- Issue #4597: Fixed several opcodes that weren't always propagating
  exceptions.

- Issue #4589: Fixed exception handling when the __exit__ function of a
  context manager returns a value that cannot be converted to a bool.

- Issue #4445: Replace "sizeof(PyBytesObject)" with
  "offsetof(PyBytesObject, ob_sval) + 1" when allocating memory for
  bytes instances.  On a typical machine this saves 3 bytes of memory
  (on average) per allocation of a bytes instance.

- Issue #4533: File read operation was dreadfully slow due to a slowly
  growing read buffer. Fixed by using the same growth rate algorithm as
  Python 2.x.

- Issue #4509: Various issues surrounding resize of bytearray objects to
  which there are buffer exports (e.g. memoryview instances).

- Issue #4233: Changed semantic of ``_fileio.FileIO``'s ``close()``
  method on file objects with closefd=False. The file descriptor is still
  kept open but the file object behaves like a closed file. The ``FileIO``
  object also got a new readonly attribute ``closefd``.

- Issue #4569: Interpreter crash when mutating a memoryview with an item size
  larger than 1.

- Issue #4748: Lambda generators no longer return a value.

- The re.sub(), re.subn() and re.split() functions now accept a flags parameter.

- Issue #5108: Handle %s like %S, %R and %A in PyUnicode_FromFormatV(): Call
  PyUnicode_DecodeUTF8() once, remember the result and output it in a second
  step. This avoids problems with counting UTF-8 bytes that ignores the effect
  of using the replace error handler in PyUnicode_DecodeUTF8().

  for old-style extensions.

- Issue #5976: Fixed Distutils test_check_environ.

- Issue #5941: Distutils build_clib command was not working anymore because
  of an incomplete costumization of the archiver command. Added ARFLAGS in the

  loader). Original patch by Alexander Belopolsky.

- Issue #4201: pdb can now access and display source code loaded via
  zipimport (or any other conformant PEP 302 loader). Original patch by
  Alexander Belopolsky.

- Issue #4197: doctests in modules loaded via zipimport (or any other PEP
  302 conformant loader) will now work correctly in most cases (they

  that should cause a test to be skipped are now done using import_module
  from test support, which does the conversion.

# USN-1613-1: Python 2.5 vulnerabilities

17 October 2012

Several security issues were fixed in Python 2.5.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)

## Packages

* [python2.5](/security/cves?package=python2.5) - An interactive high-level object-oriented language (version 2.5)

## Details

It was discovered that Python would prepend an empty string to sys.path

under certain circumstances. A local attacker with write access to the

current working directory could exploit this to execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2008-5983](/security/CVE-2008-5983))

It was discovered that the audioop module did not correctly perform input

validation. If a user or automatated system were tricked into opening a

crafted audio file, an attacker could cause a denial of service via

application crash. ([CVE-2010-1634](/security/CVE-2010-1634), [CVE-2010-2089](/security/CVE-2010-2089))

Giampaolo Rodola discovered several race conditions in the smtpd module.

A remote attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service via

daemon outage. ([CVE-2010-3493](/security/CVE-2010-3493))

It was discovered that the CGIHTTPServer module did not properly perform

input validation on certain HTTP GET requests. A remote attacker could

potentially obtain access to CGI script source files. ([CVE-2011-1015](/security/CVE-2011-1015))

Niels Heinen discovered that the urllib and urllib2 modules would process

Location headers that specify a redirection to file: URLs. A remote

attacker could exploit this to obtain sensitive information or cause a

denial of service. ([CVE-2011-1521](/security/CVE-2011-1521))

It was discovered that SimpleHTTPServer did not use a charset parameter in

the Content-Type HTTP header. An attacker could potentially exploit this

to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks against Internet Explorer 7

users. ([CVE-2011-4940](/security/CVE-2011-4940))

It was discovered that Python distutils contained a race condition when

creating the ~/.pypirc file. A local attacker could exploit this to obtain

sensitive information. ([CVE-2011-4944](/security/CVE-2011-4944))

It was discovered that SimpleXMLRPCServer did not properly validate its

input when handling HTTP POST requests. A remote attacker could exploit

this to cause a denial of service via excessive CPU utilization.

([CVE-2012-0845](/security/CVE-2012-0845))

It was discovered that the Expat module in Python 2.5 computed hash values

without restricting the ability to trigger hash collisions predictably. If

a user or application using pyexpat were tricked into opening a crafted XML

file, an attacker could cause a denial of service by consuming excessive

CPU resources. ([CVE-2012-0876](/security/CVE-2012-0876))

Tim Boddy discovered that the Expat module in Python 2.5 did not properly

handle memory reallocation when processing XML files. If a user or

application using pyexpat were tricked into opening a crafted XML file, an

attacker could cause a denial of service by consuming excessive memory

resources. ([CVE-2012-1148](/security/CVE-2012-1148))

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)

## Packages

* [python2.4](/security/cves?package=python2.4) - An interactive high-level object-oriented language (version 2.4)

## Details

USN-1613-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Python 2.5. This update provides the

corresponding updates for Python 2.4.

Original advisory details:

It was discovered that Python would prepend an empty string to sys.path

under certain circumstances. A local attacker with write access to the

current working directory could exploit this to execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2008-5983](/security/CVE-2008-5983))

It was discovered that the audioop module did not correctly perform input

validation. If a user or automatated system were tricked into opening a

crafted audio file, an attacker could cause a denial of service via

application crash. ([CVE-2010-1634](/security/CVE-2010-1634), [CVE-2010-2089](/security/CVE-2010-2089))

Giampaolo Rodola discovered several race conditions in the smtpd module.

A remote attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service via

daemon outage. ([CVE-2010-3493](/security/CVE-2010-3493))

It was discovered that the CGIHTTPServer module did not properly perform

input validation on certain HTTP GET requests. A remote attacker could

potentially obtain access to CGI script source files. ([CVE-2011-1015](/security/CVE-2011-1015))

Niels Heinen discovered that the urllib and urllib2 modules would process

Location headers that specify a redirection to file: URLs. A remote

attacker could exploit this to obtain sensitive information or cause a

denial of service. ([CVE-2011-1521](/security/CVE-2011-1521))

It was discovered that SimpleHTTPServer did not use a charset parameter in

the Content-Type HTTP header. An attacker could potentially exploit this

to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks against Internet Explorer 7

users. ([CVE-2011-4940](/security/CVE-2011-4940))

It was discovered that Python distutils contained a race condition when

creating the ~/.pypirc file. A local attacker could exploit this to obtain

sensitive information. ([CVE-2011-4944](/security/CVE-2011-4944))

It was discovered that SimpleXMLRPCServer did not properly validate its

input when handling HTTP POST requests. A remote attacker could exploit

this to cause a denial of service via excessive CPU utilization.

([CVE-2012-0845](/security/CVE-2012-0845))

It was discovered that the Expat module in Python 2.5 computed hash values

without restricting the ability to trigger hash collisions predictably. If

a user or application using pyexpat were tricked into opening a crafted XML

file, an attacker could cause a denial of service by consuming excessive

CPU resources. ([CVE-2012-0876](/security/CVE-2012-0876))

Tim Boddy discovered that the Expat module in Python 2.5 did not properly

handle memory reallocation when processing XML files. If a user or

application using pyexpat were tricked into opening a crafted XML file, an

attacker could cause a denial of service by consuming excessive memory

resources. ([CVE-2012-1148](/security/CVE-2012-1148))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 8.04

* [python2.4-minimal](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/python2.4)
  -
  [2.4.5-1ubuntu4.4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/python2.4/2.4.5-1ubuntu4.4)
* [python2.4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/python2.4)
  -
  [2.4.5-1ubuntu4.4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/python2.4/2.4.5-1ubuntu4.4)

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

# USN-1596-1: Python 2.6 vulnerabilities

4 October 2012

Several security issues were fixed in Python 2.6.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 11.10](/security/notices?release=oneiric)
* [Ubuntu 11.04](/security/notices?release=natty)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [python2.6](/security/cves?package=python2.6) - An interactive high-level object-oriented language

## Details

It was discovered that Python would prepend an empty string to sys.path

under certain circumstances. A local attacker with write access to the

current working directory could exploit this to execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2008-5983](/security/CVE-2008-5983))

It was discovered that the audioop module did not correctly perform input

validation. If a user or automatated system were tricked into opening a

crafted audio file, an attacker could cause a denial of service via

application crash. ([CVE-2010-1634](/security/CVE-2010-1634), [CVE-2010-2089](/security/CVE-2010-2089))

Giampaolo Rodola discovered several race conditions in the smtpd module.

A remote attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service via

daemon outage. ([CVE-2010-3493](/security/CVE-2010-3493))

It was discovered that the CGIHTTPServer module did not properly perform

input validation on certain HTTP GET requests. A remote attacker could

potentially obtain access to CGI script source files. ([CVE-2011-1015](/security/CVE-2011-1015))

Niels Heinen discovered that the urllib and urllib2 modules would process

Location headers that specify a redirection to file: URLs. A remote

attacker could exploit this to obtain sensitive information or cause a

denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 11.04. ([CVE-2011-1521](/security/CVE-2011-1521))

It was discovered that SimpleHTTPServer did not use a charset parameter in

the Content-Type HTTP header. An attacker could potentially exploit this

to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks against Internet Explorer 7

users. This issue only affected Ubuntu 11.04. ([CVE-2011-4940](/security/CVE-2011-4940))

It was discovered that Python distutils contained a race condition when

creating the ~/.pypirc file. A local attacker could exploit this to obtain

sensitive information. ([CVE-2011-4944](/security/CVE-2011-4944))

It was discovered that SimpleXMLRPCServer did not properly validate its

input when handling HTTP POST requests. A remote attacker could exploit

this to cause a denial of service via excessive CPU utilization.

([CVE-2012-0845](/security/CVE-2012-0845))

It was discovered that Python was susceptible to hash algorithm attacks.

An attacker could cause a denial of service under certian circumstances.

This update adds the '-R' command line option and honors setting the

PYTHONHASHSEED environment variable to 'random' to salt str and datetime

objects with an unpredictable value. ([CVE-2012-1150](/security/CVE-2012-1150))

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

No there aren't particular Fedora release specific bugs (since the updates were scheduled sooner than this main bug existed).  > I'm interested in > the fix for EPEL, and I'd like to help with the testing if possible.  But looks the latest version in EPEL-6 is still Django-v1.2.6 based, thus created new one (previous comment) to ensure update to v1.2.7.  Hope this helps, Jan.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=737366#c8)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-10-19 13:25:04 UTC  ``` The CVE identifiers: [CVE-2011-4136](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-4136), [CVE-2011-4137](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-4137), [CVE-2011-4138](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-4138), [CVE-2011-4139](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-4139), [CVE-2011-4140](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-4140) with the following description have been assigned to these issues by Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures:  1) * Name: CVE-2011-4136:  django.contrib.sessions in Django before 1.2.7 and 1.3.x before 1.3.1, when session data is stored in the cache, uses the root namespace for both session identifiers and application-data keys, which allows remote attackers to modify a session by triggering use of a key that is equal to that session's identifier.

References: [17] <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-4139> [18] <http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/09/11/1> [19] <http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/09/13/2> [20] <https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2011/sep/09/> [21] <https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2011/sep/10/127/>  5) * Name: CVE-2011-4140:  The CSRF protection mechanism in Django through 1.2.7 and 1.3.x through 1.3.1 does not properly handle web-server configurations supporting arbitrary HTTP Host headers, which allows remote attackers to trigger unauthenticated forged requests via vectors involving a DNS CNAME record and a web page containing JavaScript code.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: CVE Request -- Python (urllib, urllib2): Improper management of ftp://
 and file:// URL schemes

Hello Steve, vendors,

   A security flaw was found in the way handlers for ftp:// and
file:// URL schemes in the Python urllib and urllib2 extensible
libraries processed the urllib open URL request. A remote attacker
could use this flaw to access sensitive information or cause
a denial of service (excessive CPU and memory use) of a Python
web application, processing URLs, via a specially-crafted urllib
open URL request.

References:
[1] <http://bugs.python.org/issue11662>
[2] <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=690560>

Could you allocate a CVE id for this?

Thanks && Regards, Jan.

What's New in Python 2.7.2?
===========================

*Release date: XXXX-XX-XX*

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- Issue #11144: Ensure that int(a_float) returns an int whenever possible.
  Previously, there were some corner cases where a long was returned even
  though the result was within the range of an int.

- Issue #11450: Don't truncate hg version info in Py_GetBuildInfo() when
  there are many tags (e.g. when using mq).  Patch by Nadeem Vawda.

- Issue #11662: Make urllib and urllib2 ignore redirections if the
  scheme is not HTTP, HTTPS or FTP (CVE-2011-1521).

- Issue #10451: memoryview objects could allow to mutate a readable buffer.
  Initial patch by Ross Lagerwall.

- Issue #10892: Don't segfault when trying to delete __abstractmethods__ from a
  class.

- Issue #8020: Avoid a crash where the small objects allocator would read
  non-Python managed memory while it is being modified by another thread.
  Patch by Matt Bandy.

- Issue #11004: Repaired edge case in deque.count().

- Issue #8278: On Windows and with a NTFS filesystem, os.stat() and os.utime()
  can now handle dates after 2038.

- Issue #4236: Py_InitModule4 now checks the import machinery directly
  rather than the Py_IsInitialized flag, avoiding a Fatal Python
  error in certain circumstances when an import is done in __del__.

- Issue #10674: Remove unused 'dictmaker' rule from grammar.

- Issue #10596: Fix float.__mod__ to have the same behaviour as
  float.__divmod__ with respect to signed zeros.  -4.0 % 4.0 should be
  0.0, not -0.0.

- Issue #11386: bytearray.pop() now throws IndexError when the bytearray is
  empty, instead of OverflowError.

Library

- Issue #9696: Fix exception incorrectly raised by xdrlib.Packer.pack_int when
  trying to pack a negative (in-range) integer.

- Issue #11675: multiprocessing.[Raw]Array objects created from an integer size
  are now zeroed on creation.  This matches the behaviour specified by the
  documentation.

- Issue #11666: let help() display named tuple attributes and methods
  that start with a leading underscore.

  ensure that it will be found regardless of the shell PATH. This ensures
  that multiprocessing.cpu_count works on default installs of MacOSX.

- Issue #11500: Fixed a bug in the os x proxy bypass code for fully qualified
  IP addresses in the proxy exception list.

- Issue #11131: Fix sign of zero in plus and minus operations when
  the context rounding mode is ROUND_FLOOR.

- Issue #5622: Fix curses.wrapper to raise correct exception if curses
  initialization fails.

- Issue #11391: Writing to a mmap object created with
  ``mmap.PROT_READ|mmap.PROT_EXEC`` would segfault instead of raising a
  TypeError.  Patch by Charles-François Natali.

- Issue #11306: mailbox in certain cases adapts to an inability to open
  certain files in read-write mode.  Previously it detected this by
  checking for EACCES, now it also checks for EROFS.

- Issue #11265: asyncore now correctly handles EPIPE, EBADF and EAGAIN errors
  on accept(), send() and recv().

- Issue #11326: Add the missing connect_ex() implementation for SSL sockets,

  membership of non-weakrefable objects.

- Issue #10549: Fix pydoc traceback when text-documenting certain classes.

- Issue #940286: pydoc.Helper.help() ignores input/output init parameters.

- Issue #11171: Fix detection of config/Makefile when --prefix !=
  --exec-prefix, which caused Python to not start.

- Issue #11116: any error during addition of a message to a mailbox now causes
  a rollback, instead of leaving the mailbox partially modified.

- Issue #8275: Fix passing of callback arguments with ctypes under Win64.
  Patch by Stan Mihai.

- Issue #10940: Workaround an IDLE hang on Mac OS X 10.6 when using the
  menu accelerators for Open Module, Go to Line, and New Indent Width.
  The accelerators still work but no longer appear in the menu items.

- Issue #10907: Warn OS X 10.6 IDLE users to use ActiveState Tcl/Tk 8.5, rather
  than the currently problematic Apple-supplied one, when running with the
  64-/32-bit installer variant.

- Issue #11052: Correct IDLE menu accelerators on Mac OS X for Save
  commands.

  length and a non-zero offset, and an attempt to read past the end of file
  is made (IndexError is raised instead).  Patch by Ross Lagerwall.

- Issue #10875: Update Regular Expression HOWTO; patch by 'SilentGhost'.

- Issue #10827: Changed the rules for 2-digit years.  The time.asctime
  function will now format any year when ``time.accept2dyear`` is
  false and will accept years >= 1000 otherwise.  The year range
  accepted by ``time.mktime`` and ``time.strftime`` is still system
  dependent, but ``time.mktime`` will now accept full range supported
  by the OS.  Conversion of 2-digit years to 4-digit is deprecated.

- Issue #10869: Fixed bug where ast.increment_lineno modified the root
  node twice.

- Issue #7858: Raise an error properly when os.utime() fails under Windows
  on an existing file.

- Issue #3839: wsgiref should not override a Content-Length header set by
  the application.  Initial patch by Clovis Fabricio.

- Issue #10806, issue #9905: Fix subprocess pipes when some of the standard
  file descriptors (0, 1, 2) are closed in the parent process.  Initial
  patch by Ross Lagerwall.

  variable won't be quoted when the URI is constructed by the wsgiref.util 's
  request_uri method. According to RFC 3986, these characters can be a part of
  params in PATH component of URI and need not be quoted.

- Issue #10738: Fix webbrowser.Opera.raise_opts

- Issue #9824: SimpleCookie now encodes , and ; in values to cater to how
  browsers actually parse cookies.

- Issue #1379416: eliminated a source of accidental unicode promotion in
  email.header.Header.encode.

- Issue #5258/#10642: if site.py encounters a .pth file that generates an error,

- Issue #10242: unittest.TestCase.assertItemsEqual makes too many assumptions
  about input.

- Issue #10406: Enable Rstrip IDLE extension on OSX (just like on other
  platforms).

- Issue #10478: Reentrant calls inside buffered IO objects (for example by
  way of a signal handler) now raise a RuntimeError instead of freezing the
  current process.

- Issue #10497: Fix incorrect use of gettext in argparse.

- Issue #10464: netrc now correctly handles lines with embedded '#' characters.

- Issue #1731717: Fixed the problem where subprocess.wait() could cause an

- Issue #7616: Fix copying of overlapping memoryview slices with the Intel
  compiler.

  ZipFile.open()) could return more bytes than requested.

- Issue #9825: removed __del__ from the definition of collections.OrderedDict.
  This prevents user-created self-referencing ordered dictionaries from
  becoming permanently uncollectable GC garbage.  The downside is that
  removing __del__ means that the internal doubly-linked list has to wait for
  GC collection rather than freeing memory immediately when the refcnt drops
  to zero.

- Issue #9816: random.Random.jumpahead(n) did not produce a sufficiently
  different internal state for small values of n.  Fixed by salting the

  falling into recursion.

- Issue #1194222: email.utils.parsedate now returns RFC2822 compliant four
  character years even if the message contains RFC822 two character years.

- Issue #8750: Fixed MutableSet's methods to correctly handle
  reflexive operations, namely x -= x and x ^= x.

- Issue #9129: smtpd.py is vulnerable to DoS attacks deriving from missing
  error handling when accepting a new connection.

- Issue #658749: asyncore's connect() method now correctly interprets winsock
  errors.

- Issue #9501: Fixed logging regressions in cleanup code.

- Issue #9214: Set operations on KeysView or ItemsView in the collections
  module now correctly return a set.  (Patch by Eli Bendersky.)

- Issue #9617: Signals received during a low-level write operation aren't
  ignored by the buffered IO layer anymore.

- Issue #2521: Use weakrefs on for caching in the abc module, so that classes
  are not held onto after they are deleted elsewhere.

- Issue #9626: the view methods for collections.OrderedDict() were returning
  the unordered versions inherited from dict.  Those methods are now
  overridden to provide ordered views.

- Issue #8688: MANIFEST files created by distutils now include a magic
  comment indicating they are generated.  Manually maintained MANIFESTs
  without this marker will not be overwritten or removed.

- Issue #7467: when reading a file from a ZIP archive, its CRC is checked
  and a BadZipfile error is raised if it doesn't match (as used to be the
  case in Python 2.5 and earlier).

- Issue #9550: a BufferedReader could issue an additional read when the
  original read request had been satisfied, which could block indefinitely
  when the underlying raw IO channel was e.g. a socket.  Report and original
  patch by Jason V. Miller.

- Issue #9551: Don't raise TypeError when setting the value to None for
  SafeConfigParser instances constructed with allow_no_value == True.

- Issue #6915: Under Windows, os.listdir() didn't release the Global
  Interpreter Lock around all system calls.  Original patch by Ryan Kelly.

- Issue #3757: thread-local objects now support cyclic garbage collection.

What's New in Python 2.7 Release Candidate 1?
=============================================

*Release date: 2010-06-05*

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- Issue #8271: during the decoding of an invalid UTF-8 byte sequence, only the
  start byte and the continuation byte(s) are now considered invalid, instead
  of the number of bytes specified by the start byte.
  E.g.: '\xf1\x80AB'.decode('utf-8', 'replace') now returns u'\ufffdAB' and
  replaces with U+FFFD only the start byte ('\xf1') and the continuation byte
  ('\x80') even if '\xf1' is the start byte of a 4-bytes sequence.
  Previous versions returned a single u'\ufffd'.

- Issue #8627: Remove bogus "Overriding __cmp__ blocks inheritance of
  __hash__ in 3.x" warning.  Also fix "XXX undetected error" that
  arises from the "Overriding __eq__ blocks inheritance ..." warning
  when turned into an exception: in this case the exception simply
  gets ignored.

- Issue #8748: Fix two issues with comparisons between complex and integer
  objects.  (1) The comparison could incorrectly return True in some cases
  (2**53+1 == complex(2**53) == 2**53), breaking transivity of equality.
  (2) The comparison raised an OverflowError for large integers, leading
  to unpredictable exceptions when combining integers and complex objects
  in sets or dicts.

- Issue #5211: Implicit coercion for the complex type is now completely
  removed.  (Coercion for arithmetic operations was already removed in 2.7
  alpha 4, but coercion for rich comparisons was accidentally left in.)

- Issue #3798: Write sys.exit() message to sys.stderr to use stderr encoding
  and error handler, instead of writing to the C stderr file in utf-8

- Issue #7902: When using explicit relative import syntax, don't try implicit
  relative import semantics.

- Issue #7079: Fix a possible crash when closing a file object while using it
  from another thread.  Patch by Daniel Stutzbach.

- Issue #8868: Fix that ensures that python scripts have access to the
  Window Server again in a framework build on MacOSX 10.5 or earlier.

C-API
-----

- Issue #5753: A new C API function, :cfunc:`PySys_SetArgvEx`, allows embedders
  of the interpreter to set sys.argv without also modifying sys.path.  This
  helps fix `CVE-2008-5983
  <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-5983>`_.

Library
-------

- Issue #8302: SkipTest in unittest.TestCase.setUpClass or setUpModule is now
  reported as a skip rather than an error.

- Issue #5099: The ``__del__()`` method of ``subprocess.Popen`` (and the methods
  it calls) referenced global objects, causing errors to pop up during
  interpreter shutdown.

Extension Modules
-----------------

- Issue #7384: If the system readline library is linked against ncurses,
  the curses module must be linked against ncurses as well. Otherwise it
  is not safe to load both the readline and curses modules in an application.

- Issue #2810: Fix cases where the Windows registry API returns
  ERROR_MORE_DATA, requiring a re-try in order to get the complete result.

- Issue #8674: Fixed a number of incorrect or undefined-behaviour-inducing
  overflow checks in the ``audioop`` module.

- Issue #8835: test_support.transient_internet() catches gaierror(EAI_NONAME)
  and gaierror(EAI_NODATA)

- Issue #7449: Skip test_socketserver if threading support is disabled

- On darwin, ``test_site`` assumed that a framework build was being used,

What's New in Python 2.7 beta 2?
================================

*Release date: 2010-05-08*

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- Run Clang 2.7's static analyzer for ``Objects/`` and ``Python/``.

- Issue #1533: Fix inconsistency in range function argument processing: any
  non-float non-integer argument is now converted to an integer (if possible)
  using its __int__ method.  Previously, only small arguments were treated this
  way; larger arguments (those whose __int__ was outside the range of a C long)
  would produce a TypeError.

- Issue #8202: ``sys.argv[0]`` is now set to '-m' instead of '-c' when searching
  for the module file to be executed with the -m command line option.

- Issue #7319: When -Q is used, do not silence DeprecationWarning.

- Issue #7332: Remove the 16KB stack-based buffer in
  ``PyMarshal_ReadLastObjectFromFile``, which doesn't bring any noticeable
  benefit compared to the dynamic memory allocation fallback.  Patch by
  Charles-François Natali.

- Issue #8417: Raise an OverflowError when an integer larger than sys.maxsize is
  passed to bytearray.

- Issue #7072: ``isspace(0xa0)`` is true on Mac OS X.

- Issue #8404: Fix set operations on dictionary views.

- Issue #8084: PEP 370 now conforms to system conventions for framework builds
  on MacOS X. That is, ``python setup.py install --user`` will install into
  ``~/Library/Python/2.7`` instead of ``~/.local``.

Library
-------

- Issue #8681: Make the zlib module's error messages more informative when the
  zlib itself doesn't give any detailed explanation.

- Issue #8571: Fix an internal error when compressing or decompressing a chunk
  larger than 1GB with the zlib module's compressor and decompressor objects.

- Issue #8573: asyncore ``_strerror()`` function might throw ValueError.

- Issue #8483: asyncore.dispatcher's __getattr__ method produced confusing error
  messages when accessing undefined class attributes because of the cheap
  inheritance with the underlying socket object.  The cheap inheritance has been
  deprecated.

- Issue #4265: ``shutil.copyfile()`` was leaking file descriptors when disk
  fills.  Patch by Tres Seaver.

- Issue #7755: Use an unencumbered audio file for tests.

- Issue #8621: ``uuid.uuid4()`` returned the same sequence of values in the
  parent and any children created using ``os.fork`` on Mac OS X 10.6.

- Issue #8313: ``traceback.format_exception_only()`` encodes unicode message to
  ASCII with backslashreplace error handler if ``str(value)`` failed.

- Issue #8567: Fix precedence of signals in Decimal module: when a Decimal
  operation raises multiple signals and more than one of those signals is
  trapped, the specification determines the order in which the signals should be
  handled.  In many cases this order wasn't being followed, leading to the wrong
  Python exception being raised.

- Issue #7865: The close() method of :mod:`io` objects should not swallow
  exceptions raised by the implicit flush().  Also ensure that calling close()
  several times is supported.  Patch by Pascal Chambon.

- Issue #8576: logging updated to remove usage of find_unused_port().

- Issue #4687: Fix accuracy of garbage collection runtimes displayed with
  gc.DEBUG_STATS.

- Issue #8354: The siginterrupt setting is now preserved for all signals, not
  just SIGCHLD.

- Issue #7192: ``webbrowser.get("firefox")`` now works on Mac OS X, as does
  ``webbrowser.get("safari")``.

- Issue #8577: ``distutils.sysconfig.get_python_inc()`` now makes a difference
  between the build dir and the source dir when looking for "python.h" or
  "Include".

- Issue #8464: tarfile no longer creates files with execute permissions set when
  mode="w|" is used.

- Issue #7834: Fix connect() of Bluetooth L2CAP sockets with recent versions of
  the Linux kernel.  Patch by Yaniv Aknin.

- Issue #6312: Fix http HEAD request when the transfer encoding is chunked.  It
  should correctly return an empty response now.

- Issue #7490: To facilitate sharing of doctests between 2.x and 3.x test
  suites, the ``IGNORE_EXCEPTION_DETAIL`` directive now also ignores the module
  location of the raised exception.  Based on initial patch by Lennart Regebro.

- Issue #8086: In :func:`ssl.DER_cert_to_PEM_cert()`, fix missing newline before
  the certificate footer.  Patch by Kyle VanderBeek.

- Issue #8546: Reject None given as the buffering argument to ``_pyio.open()``.

- Issue #8549: Fix compiling the _ssl extension under AIX.  Patch by Sridhar
  Ratnakumar.

- Issue #6656: Fix locale.format_string to handle escaped percents and mappings.

- Issue #2302: Fix a race condition in SocketServer.BaseServer.shutdown, where
  the method could block indefinitely if called just before the event loop
  started running.  This also fixes the occasional freezes witnessed in
  test_httpservers.

- Issue #5103: SSL handshake would ignore the socket timeout and block
  indefinitely if the other end didn't respond.

- The do_handshake() method of SSL objects now adjusts the blocking mode of the
  SSL structure if necessary (as other methods already do).

- Issue #7507: Quote "!" in pipes.quote(); it is special to some shells.

- Issue #5238: Calling makefile() on an SSL object would prevent the underlying
  socket from being closed until all objects get truely destroyed.

- Issue #7943: Fix circular reference created when instantiating an SSL socket.
  Initial patch by Péter Szabó.

- Issue #8451: Syslog module now uses basename(sys.argv[0]) instead of the
  string "python" as the *ident*.  openlog() arguments are all optional and
  keywords.

- Issue #8108: Fix the unwrap() method of SSL objects when the socket has a
  non-infinite timeout.  Also make that method friendlier with applications
  wanting to continue using the socket in clear-text mode, by disabling
  OpenSSL's internal readahead.  Thanks to Darryl Miles for guidance.

- Issue #8484: Load all ciphers and digest algorithms when initializing the _ssl
  extension, such that verification of some SSL certificates doesn't fail
  because of an "unknown algorithm".

- Issue #8437: Fix test_gdb failures, patch written by Dave Malcolm

- Issue #4814: The timeout parameter is now applied also for connections
  resulting from PORT/EPRT commands.

- Issue #8463: Add missing reference to bztar in shutil's documentation.

- Issue #8438: Remove reference to the missing "surrogateescape" encoding error
  handler from the new IO library.

- Issue #3817: ftplib.FTP.abort() method now considers 225 a valid response code
  as stated in RFC-959 at chapter 5.4.

- Issue #8279: Fix test_gdb failures.

- Issue #8322: Add a *ciphers* argument to SSL sockets, so as to change the
  available cipher list.  Helps fix test_ssl with OpenSSL 1.0.0.

- Issue #2987: RFC 2732 support for urlparse (IPv6 addresses).  Patch by Tony
  Locke and Hans Ulrich Niedermann.

- Issue #7585: difflib context and unified diffs now place a tab between
  filename and date, conforming to the 'standards' they were originally designed
  to follow.  This improves compatibility with patch tools.

- Issue #7472: Fixed typo in email.encoders module; messages using ISO-2022
  character sets will now consistently use a Content-Transfer-Encoding of 7bit
  rather than sometimes being marked as 8bit.

- Issue #8330: Fix expected output in test_gdb.

- Issue #8374: Update the internal alias table in the :mod:`locale` module to
  cover recent locale changes and additions.

Extension Modules
-----------------

- Issue #8644: Improved accuracy of ``timedelta.total_seconds()``.

- Use Clang 2.7's static analyzer to find places to clean up some code.

- Build the ossaudio extension on GNU/kFreeBSD.

- On Windows, ctypes does no longer check the stack before and after calling a
  foreign function.  This allows to use the unmodified libffi library.

Tests
-----

- Issue #8672: Add a zlib test ensuring that an incomplete stream can be handled
  by a decompressor object without errors (it returns incomplete uncompressed
  data).

- Issue #8490: asyncore now has a more solid test suite which actually tests its
  API.

- Issue #8576: Remove use of find_unused_port() in test_smtplib and
  test_multiprocessing.  Patch by Paul Moore.

- Issue #7449: Fix many tests to support Python compiled without thread support.

  SSL shutdowns.

Build
-----

- Issue #8625: Turn off optimization in ``--with-pydebug`` builds with gcc.
  (Optimization was unintentionally turned on in gcc --with-pydebug builds in
  2.7 beta1 as a result of the issue #1628484 fix, combined with autoconf's
  strange choice of default CFLAGS produced by AC_PROG_CC for gcc.)

- Issue #8509: Fix quoting in help strings and code snippets in configure.in.

- Issue #3646: It is now easily possible to install a Python framework into your
  home directory on Mac OS X, see Mac/README for more information.

- Issue #8510: Update to autoconf 2.65.

Misc
----

- Update the Vim syntax highlight file.

What's New in Python 2.7 beta 1?
================================

*Release date: 2010-04-10*

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- Issue #7301: Add environment variable $PYTHONWARNINGS.

- Issue #8329: Don't return the same lists from select.select when no fds are
  changed.

- Issue #8259: ``1L << (2**31)`` no longer produces an 'outrageous shift error'
  on 64-bit machines.  The shift count for either left or right shift is
  permitted to be up to sys.maxsize.

- Ensure that tokenization of identifiers is not affected by locale.

- Issue #1222585: Added LDCXXSHARED for C++ support.  Patch by Arfrever.

- Raise a TypeError when trying to delete a T_STRING_INPLACE struct member.

- Issue #7994: Issue a PendingDeprecationWarning if object.__format__ is called
  with a non-empty format string. This is an effort to future-proof user
  code. If a derived class does not currently implement __format__ but later
  adds its own __format__, it would most likely break user code that had
  supplied a format string. This will be changed to a DeprecationWarning in
  Python 3.3 and it will be an error in Python 3.4.

- Issue #8268: Old-style classes (not just instances) now support weak
  references.

- Issue #8211: Save/restore CFLAGS around AC_PROG_CC in configure.in, in case it
  is set.

- Issue #1583863: An unicode subclass can now override the __unicode__ method

- Issue #6474: Make error message from passing an inadequate number of keyword
  arguments to a function correct.

- Issue #8164: Don't allow lambda functions to have a docstring.

- Issue #3137: Don't ignore errors at startup, especially a keyboard interrupt
  (SIGINT).  If an error occurs while importing the site module, the error is
  printed and Python exits.  Initialize the GIL before importing the site
  module.

- Code objects now support weak references.

Library
-------

- Issue #5277: Fix quote counting when parsing RFC 2231 encoded parameters.

- Issue #8321: Give access to OpenSSL version numbers from the `ssl` module,
  using the new attributes `ssl.OPENSSL_VERSION`, `ssl.OPENSSL_VERSION_INFO` and
  `ssl.OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER`.

- Issue #8310: Allow dis to examine new style classes.

- Issue #8257: The Decimal construct now accepts a float instance directly,
  converting that float to a Decimal of equal value:

     >>> Decimal(1.1)
     Decimal('1.100000000000000088817841970012523233890533447265625')

- collections.Counter() now supports a subtract() method.

- The functools module now has a total_ordering() class decorator to simplify
  the specification of rich comparisons.

- The functools module also adds cmp_to_key() as a tool to transition old-style
  comparison functions to new-style key-functions.

- Issue #8294: The Fraction constructor now accepts Decimal and float instances
  directly.

- Issue #7279: Comparisons involving a Decimal signaling NaN now signal
  InvalidOperation instead of returning False.  (Comparisons involving a quiet
  NaN are unchanged.)  Also, Decimal quiet NaNs are now hashable; Decimal
  signaling NaNs remain unhashable.

- Issue #2531: Comparison operations between floats and Decimal instances now
  return a result based on the numeric values of the operands; previously they
  returned an arbitrary result based on the relative ordering of id(float) and
  id(Decimal).

- Issue #8233: When run as a script, py_compile.py optionally takes a single
  argument `-` which tells it to read files to compile from stdin.  Each line is
  read on demand and the named file is compiled immediately.  (Original patch by
  Piotr Ożarowski).

- Issue #3135: Add ``inspect.getcallargs()``, which binds arguments to a
  function like a normal call.

- Backwards incompatible change: Unicode codepoints line tabulation (0x0B) and
  form feed (0x0C) are now considered linebreaks, as specified in Unicode
  Standard Annex #14.  See issue #7643.  http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr14/

- Comparisons using one of <, <=, >, >= between a complex instance and a
  Fractions instance now raise TypeError instead of returning True/False.  This
  makes Fraction <=> complex comparisons consistent with int <=> complex, float
  <=> complex, and complex <=> complex comparisons.

- Addition of ``WeakSet`` to the ``weakref`` module.

- logging: Added LOG_FTP to SysLogHandler and updated documentation.

- Issue #8205: Remove the "Modules" directory from sys.path when Python is
  running from the build directory (POSIX only).

- Issue #7667: Fix doctest failures with non-ASCII paths.

- Issue #7512: shutil.copystat() could raise an OSError when the filesystem
  didn't support chflags() (for example ZFS under FreeBSD).  The error is now
  silenced.

- Issue #7703: ctypes supports both buffer() and memoryview().  The former is
  deprecated.

- Issue #7860: platform.uname now reports the correct 'machine' type when Python
  is running in WOW64 mode on 64 bit Windows.

- logging: Added getChild utility method to Logger and added isEnabledFor method
  to LoggerAdapter.

- Issue #8201: logging: Handle situation of non-ASCII and Unicode logger names
  existing at the same time, causing a Unicode error when configuration code
  attempted to sort the existing loggers.

- Issue #8200: logging: Handle errors when multiprocessing is not fully loaded
  when logging occurs.

- Issue #3890, #8222: Fix recv() and recv_into() on non-blocking SSL sockets.
  Also, enable the SSL_MODE_AUTO_RETRY flag on SSL sockets, so that blocking
  reads and writes are always retried by OpenSSL itself.

- Issue #8179: Fix macpath.realpath() on a non-existing path.

- Issue #8024: Update the Unicode database to 5.2.

- Issue #8104: socket.recv_into() and socket.recvfrom_into() now support writing
  into objects supporting the new buffer API, for example bytearrays or
  memoryviews.

- Issue #4961: Inconsistent/wrong result of askyesno function in tkMessageBox
  with Tcl/Tk-8.5.

- Issue #8140: Extend compileall to compile single files.  Add -i option.

- Issue #7356: ctypes.util: Make parsing of ldconfig output independent of the
  locale.

- Issue #7774: Set sys.executable to an empty string if ``argv[0]`` has been set
  to an non existent program name and Python is unable to retrieve the real
  program name.

- Issue #8117: logging: Improved algorithm for computing initial rollover time
  for ``TimedRotatingFileHandler`` by using the modification time of an existing
  log file to compute the next rollover time.  If the log file does not exist,
  the current time is used as the basis for the computation.

- Issue #6472: The ``xml.etree`` package is updated to ElementTree 1.3.  The
  cElementTree module is updated too.

- Issue #7880: Fix sysconfig when the python executable is a symbolic link.

- Issue #7624: Fix ``isinstance(foo(), collections.Callable)`` for old-style
  classes.

- Issue #7143: email: ``get_payload()`` used to strip any trailing newline from
  a base64 transfer-encoded payload *after* decoding it; it no longer does.
  This is a behavior change, so email's minor version number is now bumped, to
  version 4.0.2, for the 2.7 release.

- Issue #8235: _socket: Add the constant ``SO_SETFIB``.  SO_SETFIB is
  a socket option available on FreeBSD 7.1 and newer.

- Issue #8038: unittest.TestCase.assertNotRegexpMatches

- Addition of -b command line option to unittest for buffering stdout / stderr
  during test runs.

- Issue #1220212: Added os.kill support for Windows, including support for
  sending CTRL+C and CTRL+BREAK events to console subprocesses.

Extension Modules
-----------------

- Issue #8314: Fix unsigned long long bug in libffi on Sparc v8.

- Issue #1039, #8154: Fix os.execlp() crash with missing 2nd argument.

- Issue #8156: bsddb module updated to version 4.8.4.
  http://www.jcea.es/programacion/pybsddb.htm#bsddb3-4.8.4.  This update drops
  support for Berkeley DB 4.0, and adds support for 4.8.

- Issue #3928: os.mknod() now available in Solaris, also.

- Issue #8142: Update libffi to the 3.0.9 release.

- Issue #8300: When passing a non-integer argument to struct.pack with any
  integer format code, struct.pack first attempts to convert the non-integer
  using its __index__ method.  If that method is non-existent or raises
  TypeError it goes on to try the __int__ method, as described below.

- Issue #1530559: When passing a non-integer argument to struct.pack with *any*
  integer format code (one of 'bBhHiIlLqQ'), struct.pack attempts to use the
  argument's __int__ method to convert to an integer before packing.  It also
  produces a DeprecationWarning in this case.  (In Python 2.6, the behaviour was
  inconsistent: __int__ was used for some integer codes but not for others, and
  the set of integer codes for which it was used differed between native packing
  and standard packing.)

- Issue #7347: _winreg: Add CreateKeyEx and DeleteKeyEx, as well as fix a bug in
  the return value of QueryReflectionKey.

Tools/Demos
-----------

- Issue #7993: Add a test of IO packet processing bandwidth to ccbench.  It
  measures the number of UDP packets processed per second depending on the
  number of background CPU-bound Python threads.

- python-config now supports multiple options on the same command line.

Build
-----

- Issue #8032: For gdb7, a python-gdb.py file is added to the build, allowing to
  use advanced gdb features when debugging Python.

- Issue #1628484: The Makefile doesn't ignore the CFLAGS environment variable
  anymore.  It also forwards the LDFLAGS settings to the linker when building a
  shared library.

- Issue #6716: Quote -x arguments of compileall in MSI installer.

- Issue #7705: Fix linking on FreeBSD.

- Make sure that the FreeBSD build of the included libffi uses the proper
  assembly file.

C-API
-----

- Issue #8276: PyEval_CallObject() is now only available in macro form.  The
  function declaration, which was kept for backwards compatibility reasons, is
  now removed (the macro was introduced in 1997!).

- Issue #7992: A replacement PyCObject API, PyCapsule, has been backported from
  Python 3.1.  All existing Python CObjects in the main distribution have been
  converted to capsules.  To address backwards-compatibility concerns,
  PyCObject_AsVoidPtr() was changed to understand capsules.

Tests
-----

- Issue #3864: Skip three test_signal tests on freebsd6 because they fail if any
  thread was previously started, most likely due to a platform bug.

- Issue #8348: Fix test ftp url in test_urllib2net.

- Issue #8204: Fix test_ttk notebook test by forcing focus.

- Issue #8344: Fix test_ttk bug on FreeBSD.

  to Decimal.  Previously only some arguments were converted.

- Issue #6003: Add an argument to ``zipfile.Zipfile.writestr`` to specify the
  compression type.

  bugs and allows loading SQLite extensions from shared libraries.

- Issue #7808: Fix reference leaks in _bsddb and related tests.

- Issue #6544: Fix a reference leak in the kqueue implementation's error
  handling.

- Stop providing crtassem.h symbols when compiling with Visual Studio 2010, as
  msvcr100.dll is not a platform assembly anymore.

- Issue #7242: On Solaris 9 and earlier calling ``os.fork()`` from within a
  thread could raise an incorrect RuntimeError about not holding the import
  lock.  The import lock is now reinitialized after fork.

- Issue #7999: ``os.setreuid()`` and ``os.setregid()`` would refuse to accept a
  -1 parameter on some platforms such as OS X.

Tests
-----

  filesystem encoding.

- Issue #6292: For the moment at least, the test suite runs cleanly if python
  is run with the -OO flag.  Tests requiring docstrings are skipped.

- Issue #7712: test_support gained a new ``temp_cwd`` context manager which is
  now also used by regrtest to run all the tests in a temporary directory.  The
  original CWD is saved in ``test.test_support.SAVEDCWD``.  Thanks to Florent
  Xicluna who helped with the patch.

Build
-----

- Issue #3920, #7903: Define _BSD_SOURCE on OpenBSD 4.4 through 4.9.

What's New in Python 2.7 alpha 3?
=================================

*Release date: 2010-02-06*

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- Issue #5677: Explicitly forbid write operations on read-only file objects,
  and read operations on write-only file objects.  On Windows, the system C
  library would return a bogus result; on Solaris, it was possible to crash the
  interpreter.  Patch by Stefan Krah.

- Issue #7853: Normalize exceptions before they are passed to a context
  manager's ``__exit__()`` method.

- Issue #7385: Fix a crash in ``PyMemoryView_FromObject()`` when
  ``PyObject_GetBuffer()`` fails.  Patch by Florent Xicluna.

- Issue #7819: Check ``sys.call_tracing()`` arguments types.

- Issue #7788: Fix an interpreter crash produced by deleting a list slice with
  very large step value.

- Issue #7766: Change ``sys.getwindowsversion()`` return value to a named tuple
  and add the additional members returned in an OSVERSIONINFOEX structure.  The
  new members are service_pack_major, service_pack_minor, suite_mask, and
  product_type.

- Issue #7561: Operations on empty bytearrays (such as ``int(bytearray())``)
  could crash in many places because of the ``PyByteArray_AS_STRING()`` macro
  returning NULL.  The macro now returns a statically allocated empty string
  instead.

- Issue #7622: Improve the split(), rsplit(), splitlines() and replace()
  methods of bytes, bytearray and unicode objects by using a common
  implementation based on stringlib's fast search.  Patch by Florent Xicluna.

- Issue #7632: Fix various str -> float conversion bugs present in 2.7 alpha 2,
  including:

  (1) a serious 'wrong output' bug that could occur for long (> 40 digit) input
      strings,
  (2) a crash in dtoa.c that occurred in debug builds when parsing certain long
      numeric strings corresponding to subnormal values,
  (3) a memory leak for some values large enough to cause overflow, and
  (4) a number of flaws that could lead to incorrectly rounded results.

- Issue #7319, #7770: Silence ``DeprecationWarning`` by default when the -3
  option is not used.

- Issue #2335: Backport set literals syntax from Python 3.x.

- Issue #2333: Backport set and dict comprehensions syntax from Python 3.x.

- Issue #1967: Backport dictionary views from Python 3.x.

Library
-------

- Issue #9137: Fix issue in MutableMapping.update, which incorrectly
  treated keyword arguments called 'self' or 'other' specially.

- Issue #7835: shelve should no longer produce mysterious warnings during
  interpreter shutdown.

- Issue #2746: Don't escape ampersands and angle brackets ("&", "<", ">") in
  XML processing instructions and comments.  These raw characters are allowed
  by the XML specification, and are necessary when outputting e.g.  PHP code in
  a processing instruction.  Patch by Neil Muller.

- Issue #7869: logging: Improved diagnostic for format-time errors.

- Issue #7868: logging: Added loggerClass attribute to Manager.

- Issue #7851: logging: Clarification on logging configuration files.

- Issue #4772: Raise a ValueError when an unknown Bluetooth protocol is
  specified, rather than fall through to AF_PACKET (in the ``socket`` module).
  Also, raise ValueError rather than TypeError when an unknown TIPC address
  type is specified.  Patch by Brian Curtin.

- logging: Implemented PEP 391.

- Issue #6939: Fix file I/O objects in the `io` module to keep the original
  file position when calling `truncate()`.  It would previously change the file
  position to the given argument, which goes against the tradition of
  ftruncate() and other truncation APIs.  Patch by Pascal Chambon.

- Issue #7610: Reworked implementation of the internal ``zipfile.ZipExtFile``
  class used to represent files stored inside an archive.  The new
  implementation is significantly faster and can be wrapped in a
  ``io.BufferedReader`` object for more speedups.  It also solves an issue
  where interleaved calls to ``read()`` and ``readline()`` give wrong results.
  Patch by Nir Aides.

- Removed the deprecated functions ``verify()`` and ``vereq()`` from
  Lib/test/test_support.py.

- Issue #7773: Fix an UnboundLocalError in ``platform.linux_distribution()``
  when the release file is empty.

- Issue #7748: Since unicode values are supported for some metadata options in
  Distutils, the DistributionMetadata get_* methods will now return an utf-8
  encoded string for them.  This ensures that the upload and register commands
  send the correct values to PyPI without any error.

- Issue #1670765: Prevent ``email.generator.Generator`` from re-wrapping
  headers in multipart/signed MIME parts, which fixes one of the sources of
  invalid modifications to such parts by Generator.

  by Brian Curtin.

- Issue #5827: Make sure that normpath preserves unicode.  Initial patch by
  Matt Giuca.

- Issue #5372: Drop the reuse of .o files in Distutils' ccompiler (since

What's New in Python 2.7 alpha 2?
=================================

*Release date: 2010-01-09*

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- The ``__complex__()`` method is now looked up on the class of instances to
  make it consistent with other special methods.

- Issue #7462: Implement the stringlib fast search algorithm for the `rfind`,
  `rindex`, `rsplit` and `rpartition` methods.  Patch by Florent Xicluna.

- Issue #5080: A number of functions and methods previously produced a
  DeprecationWarning when passed a float argument where an integer was expected.
  These functions and methods now raise TypeError instead.  The majority of the
  effects of this change are in the extension modules, but some core functions
  and methods are affected: notably the 'chr', 'range' and 'xrange' builtins,
  and many unicode/str methods.

- Issue #7604: Deleting an unset slotted attribute did not raise an
  AttributeError.

- Issue #7534: Fix handling of IEEE specials (infinities, nans, negative zero)
  in ** operator.  The behaviour now conforms to that described in C99 Annex F.

- Issue #7579: The msvcrt module now has docstrings for all its functions.

- Issue #7413: Passing '\0' as the separator to datetime.datetime.isoformat()
  used to drop the time part of the result.

- Issue #1811: Improve accuracy and cross-platform consistency for true division
  of integers: the result of a/b is now correctly rounded for ints a and b (at
  least on IEEE 754 platforms), and in particular does not depend on the
  internal representation of a long.

- Issue #6108: ``unicode(exception)`` and ``str(exception)`` should return the
  same message when only ``__str__()`` (and not ``__unicode__()``) is overridden
  in the subclass.

- Issue #6834: Replace the implementation for the 'python' and 'pythonw'
  executables on OSX.

  These executables now work properly with the arch(1) command: ``arch -ppc
  python`` will start a universal binary version of python in PPC mode (unlike
  previous releases).

- Issue #1680159: Unicode coercion during an 'in' operation no longer masks the
  underlying error when the coercion fails for the left hand operand.

- Issue #7491: Metaclass's __cmp__ method was ignored.

- Issue #7466: Segmentation fault when the garbage collector is called in the
  middle of populating a tuple.  Patch by Florent Xicluna.

Library
-------

- Issue #6963: Added "maxtasksperchild" argument to ``multiprocessing.Pool``,
  allowing for a maximum number of tasks within the pool to be completed by the
  worker before that worker is terminated, and a new one created to replace it.

- Issue #7617: Make sure distutils.unixccompiler.UnixCCompiler recognizes gcc
  when it has a fully qualified configuration prefix.  Initial patch by
  Arfrever.

- Issue #7092: Remove py3k warning when importing cPickle.  2to3 handles
  renaming of `cPickle` to `pickle`.  The warning was annoying since there's no
  alternative to cPickle if you care about performance.  Patch by Florent
  Xicluna.

- Issue #7455: Fix possible crash in cPickle on invalid input.  Patch by Victor
  Stinner.

- Issue #7092: Fix the DeprecationWarnings emitted by the standard library when
  using the -3 flag.  Patch by Florent Xicluna.

- Issue #7471: Improve the performance of GzipFile's buffering mechanism, and
  make it implement the ``io.BufferedIOBase`` ABC to allow for further speedups
  by wrapping it in an ``io.BufferedReader``.  Patch by Nir Aides.

- Issue #3972: ``httplib.HTTPConnection`` now accepts an optional source_address
  parameter to allow specifying where your connections come from.

- ``socket.create_connection()`` now accepts an optional source_address
  parameter.

- Issue #5511: ``zipfile.ZipFile`` can now be used as a context manager.
  Initial patch by Brian Curtin.

- Distutils now correctly identifies the build architecture as "x86_64" when
  building on OSX 10.6 without "-arch" flags.

- Issue #7556: Distutils' msvc9compiler now opens the MSVC Manifest file in text
  mode.

- Issue #7552: Removed line feed in the base64 Authorization header in the
  Distutils upload command to avoid an error when PyPI reads it.  This occurs on
  long passwords.  Initial patch by JP St. Pierre.

- Issue #7231: urllib2 cannot handle https with proxy requiring auth.  Patch by
  Tatsuhiro Tsujikawa.

- Issue #7349: Make methods of file objects in the io module accept None as an
  argument where file-like objects (ie StringIO and BytesIO) accept them to mean
  the same as passing no argument.

- Issue #7348: ``StringIO.StringIO.readline(-1)`` now acts as if it got no
  argument like other file objects.

- Issue #7357: tarfile no longer suppresses fatal extraction errors by default.

- Issue #7470: logging: Fix bug in Unicode encoding fallback.

- Issue #5949: Fixed IMAP4_SSL hang when the IMAP server response is missing
  proper end-of-line termination.

- Issue #7457: Added a read_pkg_file method to
  ``distutils.dist.DistributionMetadata``.

- Issue #3745: Undo the 2.7a1 change to have hashlib to reject unicode and non
  buffer API supporting objects as input.  That behavior is for 3.x only.

C-API
-----

- Issue #7767: New function ``PyLong_AsLongLongAndOverflow()`` added, analogous
  to ``PyLong_AsLongAndOverflow()``.

- Issue #5080: The argument parsing functions ``PyArg_ParseTuple()``,
  ``PyArg_ParseTupleAndKeywords()``, ``PyArg_VaParse()``,
  ``PyArg_VaParseTupleAndKeywords()`` and ``PyArg_Parse()`` no longer accept
  float arguments for integer format codes (other than 'L'): previously an
  attempt to pass a float resulted in a DeprecationWarning; now it gives a
  TypeError.  For the 'L' format code (which previously had no warning) there is
  now a DeprecationWarning.

- Issue #7033: Function ``PyErr_NewExceptionWithDoc()`` added.

Build
-----

- Issue #6491: Allow --with-dbmliborder to specify that no dbms will be built.

- Issue #6943: Use pkg-config to find the libffi headers when the
  ``--with-system-ffi`` flag is used.

- Issue #7609: Add a ``--with-system-expat`` option that causes the system's
  expat library to be used for the pyexpat module instead of the one included
  with Python.

- Issue #7589: Only build the nis module when the correct header files are
  found.

- Switch to OpenSSL 0.9.8l and sqlite 3.6.21 on Windows.

- Issue #7541: when using ``python-config`` with a framework install the
  compiler might use the wrong library.

Tests
-----

- Issue #7376: Instead of running a self-test (which was failing) when called
  with no arguments, doctest.py now gives a usage message.

- Issue #7396: Fix regrtest -s, which was broken by the -j enhancement.

- Issue #7498: test_multiprocessing now uses test_support.find_unused_port
  instead of a hardcoded port number in test_rapid_restart.

What's New in Python 2.7 alpha 1
================================

*Release date: 2009-12-05*

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- Issue #7419: ``locale.setlocale()`` could crash the interpreter on Windows
  when called with invalid values.

- Issue #3382: 'F' formatting for float and complex now convert the result to
  upper case.  This only affects 'inf' and 'nan', since 'f' no longer converts
  to 'g' for large values.

- Remove switch from "%f" formatting to "%g" formatting for floats larger than
  1e50 in absolute value.

- Remove restrictions on precision when formatting floats.  E.g., "%.120g" %
  1e-100 used to raise OverflowError, but now gives the requested 120
  significant digits instead.

- Add Py3k warnings for parameter names in parentheses.

- Issue #7362: Give a proper error message for ``def f((x)=3): pass``.

- Issue #7085: Fix crash when importing some extensions in a thread on MacOSX
  10.6.

- Issue #7117: ``repr(x)`` for a float x returns a result based on the shortest
  decimal string that's guaranteed to round back to x under correct rounding
  (with round-half-to-even rounding mode).  Previously it gave a string based on
  rounding x to 17 decimal digits.  repr(x) for a complex number behaves
  similarly.  On platforms where the correctly-rounded strtod and dtoa code is
  not supported (see below), repr is unchanged.

- Issue #7117: On almost all platforms: float-to-string and string-to-float
  conversions within Python are now correctly rounded.  Places these conversions
  occur include: str for floats and complex numbers; the float and complex
  constructors; old-style and new-style numeric formatting; serialization and
  deserialization of floats and complex numbers using marshal, pickle and json;
  parsing of float and imaginary literals in Python code; Decimal-to-float
  conversion.

  The conversions use a Python-adapted version of David Gay's well-known dtoa.c,
  providing correctly-rounded strtod and dtoa C functions.  This code is
  supported on Windows, and on Unix-like platforms using gcc, icc or suncc as
  the C compiler.  There may be a small number of platforms on which correct
  operation of this code cannot be guaranteed, so the code is not used: notably,
  this applies to platforms where the C double format is not IEEE 754 binary64,
  and to platforms on x86 hardware where the x87 FPU is set to 64-bit precision
  and Python's configure script is unable to determine how to change the FPU
  precision.  On these platforms conversions use the platform strtod and dtoa,
  as before.

- Issue #7117: Backport round implementation from Python 3.x.  ``round()`` now
  uses the correctly-rounded string <-> float conversions described above (when
  available), and so produces correctly rounded results that will display nicely
  under the float repr.  There are two related small changes: (1) round now
  accepts any class with an ``__index__()`` method for its second argument (but
  no longer accepts floats for the second argument), and (2) an excessively
  large second integer argument (e.g., ``round(1.234, 10**100)``) no longer
  raises an exception.

- Issue #1757126: Fix the cyrillic-asian alias for the ptcp154 encoding.

- Fix several issues with ``compile()``.  The input can now contain Windows and
  Mac newlines and is no longer required to end in a newline.

- Remove length limitation when constructing a complex number from a unicode
  string.

- Issue #7244: ``itertools.izip_longest()`` no longer ignores exceptions raised
  during the formation of an output tuple.

- Issue #1087418: Boost performance of bitwise operations for longs.

- Issue #1722344: ``threading._shutdown()`` is now called in ``Py_Finalize()``,
  which fixes the problem of some exceptions being thrown at shutdown when the
  interpreter is killed.  Patch by Adam Olsen.

- Issue #7168: Document ``PyFloat_AsString()`` and ``PyFloat_AsReprString()``,
  and note that they are unsafe and deprecated.

- Issue #7120: logging: Remove import of multiprocessing which is causing crash
  in GAE.

- Issue #7140: The ``__dict__`` of a module should not be cleared unless the
  module is the only object holding a reference to it.

- Issue #1754094: Improve the stack depth calculation in the compiler.  There
  should be no other effect than a small decrease in memory use.  Patch by
  Christopher Tur Lesniewski-Laas.

- Issue #7084: Fix a (very unlikely) crash when printing a list from one thread,
  and mutating it from another one.  Patch by Scott Dial.

- Issue #1571184: The Unicode database contains properties for more characters.
  The tables for code points representing numeric values, white spaces or line
  breaks are now generated from the official Unicode Character Database files,
  and include information from the Unihan.txt file.

- Issue #7050: Fix a SystemError when trying to use unpacking and augmented
  assignment.

- Issue #5329: Fix ``os.popen*`` regression from 2.5 with commands as a sequence
  running through the shell.  Patch by Jean-Paul Calderone and Jani Hakala.

- Issue #7019: Raise ValueError when unmarshalling bad long data, instead of
  producing internally inconsistent Python longs.

- Issue #6990: Fix ``threading.local`` subclasses leaving old state around after
  a reference cycle GC which could be recycled by new locals.

- Issue #6300: unicode.encode, unicode.decode, str.decode, and str.encode now
  take keyword arguments.

- Issue #6922: Fix an infinite loop when trying to decode an invalid UTF-32
  stream with a non-raising error handler like "replace" or "ignore".

- Issue #6713: Improve performance of base 10 int -> string and long -> string
  conversions.

- Issue #1590864: Fix potential deadlock when mixing threads and fork().

- Issue #6844: Do not emit DeprecationWarnings when accessing a "message"
  attribute on exceptions that was set explicitly.

- Issue #6846: Fix bug where bytearray.pop() returns negative integers.

- ``classmethod()`` no longer checks if its argument is callable.

- Issue #6750: A text file opened with ``io.open()`` could duplicate its output
  when writing from multiple threads at the same time.

- Issue #6704: Improve the col_offset in AST for "for" statements with a target
  of tuple unpacking.

- Issue #6707: ``dir()`` on an uninitialized module caused a crash.

- Issue #6540: Fixed crash for ``bytearray.translate()`` with invalid parameters.

- Issue #6573: ``set.union()`` stopped processing inputs if an instance of self
  occurred in the argument chain.

- Issue #1616979: Added the cp720 (Arabic DOS) encoding.

- Issue #6070: On posix platforms import no longer copies the execute bit from
  the .py file to the .pyc file if it is set.  Patch by Marco N.

- Issue #4618: When unicode arguments are passed to ``print()``, the default
  separator and end should be unicode also.

- Issue #6119: Fixed an incorrect Py3k warning about order comparisons of
  built-in functions and methods.

- Issue #6347: Include inttypes.h as well as stdint.h in pyport.h.  This fixes a
  build failure on HP-UX: int32_t and uint32_t are defined in inttypes.h instead
  of stdint.h on that platform.

- Issue #4856: Remove checks for win NT.

- Issue #2016: Fixed a crash in a corner case where the dictionary of keyword
  arguments could be modified during the function call setup.

- Removed the ipaddr module.

- Issue #6329: Fixed iteration for memoryview objects (it was being blocked
  because it wasn't recognized as a sequence).

- Issue #6289: Encoding errors from ``compile()`` were being masked.

- When no module is given in a relative import, the module field of the
  ImportFrom AST node is now None instead of an empty string.

- Assignment to None using import statements now raises a SyntaxError.

- Issue #4547: When debugging a very large function, it was not always possible
  to update the lineno attribute of the current frame.

- Issue #5330: C functions called with keyword arguments were not reported by
  the various profiling modules (profile, cProfile).  Patch by Hagen Fürstenau.

- Issue #5982: staticmethod and classmethod now expose the wrapped function with
  ``__func__``.

- Added support for multiple context managers in the same with-statement.
  Deprecated ``contextlib.nested()`` which is no longer needed.

- Issue #6101: A new opcode, SETUP_WITH, has been added to speed up the with
  statement and correctly lookup the __enter__ and __exit__ special methods.

- Issue #5829: complex("1e500") no longer raises OverflowError.  This makes it
  consistent with float("1e500") and interpretation of real and imaginary
  literals.

- Issue #3527: Removed Py_WIN_WIDE_FILENAMES which is not used any more.

- ``__instancecheck__()`` and ``__subclasscheck__()`` are now completely ignored
  on classic classes and instances.

- Issue #5994: The marshal module now has docstrings.

- Issue #5981: Fix three minor inf/nan issues in float.fromhex:

  (1) inf and nan strings with trailing whitespace were incorrectly rejected;
  (2) parsing of strings representing infinities and nans was locale aware; and
  (3) the interpretation of fromhex('-nan') didn't match that of float('-nan').

- Issue #5920: For ``float.__format__()``, change the behavior with the empty
  presentation type (that is, not one of 'e', 'f', 'g', or 'n') to be like 'g'
  but with at least one decimal point and with a default precision
  of 12. Previously, the behavior the same but with a default precision of 6.
  This more closely matches ``str()``, and reduces surprises when adding
  alignment flags to the empty presentation type. This also affects the new
  complex.__format__ in the same way.

- Issue #5890: In subclasses of 'property' the __doc__ attribute was shadowed by
  classtype's, even if it was None.  property now inserts the __doc__ into the
  subclass instance __dict__.

- Issue #4426: The UTF-7 decoder was too strict and didn't accept some legal
  sequences.  Patch by Nick Barnes and Victor Stinner.

- Issue #1588: Add complex.__format__. For example, ``format(complex(1, 2./3),
  '.5')`` now produces a sensible result.

- Issue #5864: Fix empty format code formatting for floats so that it never
  gives more than the requested number of significant digits.

- Issue #5793: Rationalize isdigit / isalpha / tolower, etc. Includes new
  Py_ISDIGIT / Py_ISALPHA / Py_TOLOWER, etc. in pctypes.h.

- Issue #4971: Fix titlecase for characters that are their own titlecase, but
  not their own uppercase.

- Issue #5835: Deprecate PyOS_ascii_formatd and replace it with
  _PyOS_double_to_string or PyOS_double_to_string.

- Issue #5283: Setting __class__ in __del__ caused a segfault.

- Issue #5816: ``complex(repr(z))`` now recovers z exactly, even when z involves
  nans, infs or negative zeros.

- Implement PEP 378, Format Specifier for Thousands Separator, for floats, ints,
  and longs.

- Issue #5515: 'n' formatting for ints, longs, and floats handles leading zero
  formatting poorly.

- Issue #5772: For float.__format__, don't add a trailing ".0" if we're using no
  type code and we have an exponent.

- Issue #3166: Make long -> float (and int -> float) conversions correctly
  rounded.

- Issue #5787: ``object.__getattribute__(some_type, "__bases__")`` segfaulted on
  some built-in types.

- Issue #1869: Fix a couple of minor round() issues.  ``round(5e15+1)`` was
  giving 5e15+2; ``round(-0.0)`` was losing the sign of the zero.

- Issue #5759: float() didn't call __float__ on str subclasses.

- Issue #5704: The "-3" command-line option now implies "-t".

- Issue #2170: Refactored ``xml.dom.minidom.normalize``, increasing both its
  clarity and its speed.

- Issue #2396: The memoryview object was backported from Python 3.1.

- Fix a problem in PyErr_NormalizeException that leads to "undetected errors"
  when hitting the recursion limit under certain circumstances.

- Issue #1665206: Remove the last eager import in _warnings.c and make it lazy.

- Issue #4865: On MacOSX /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages is added to the end
  sys.path, for compatibility with the system install of Python.

- Issue #4688: Add a heuristic so that tuples and dicts containing only
  untrackable objects are not tracked by the garbage collector. This can reduce
  the size of collections and therefore the garbage collection overhead on
  long-running programs, depending on their particular use of datatypes.

- Issue #5512: Rewrite PyLong long division algorithm (x_divrem) to improve its
  performance.  Long divisions and remainder operations are now between 50% and
  150% faster.

- Issue #4258: Make it possible to use base 2**30 instead of base 2**15 for the
  internal representation of integers, for performance reasons.  Base 2**30 is
  enabled by default on 64-bit machines.  Add --enable-big-digits option to
  configure, which overrides the default.  Add sys.long_info structseq to
  provide information about the internal format.

- Issue #4034: Fix weird attribute error messages of the traceback object. (As a
  result traceback.__members__ no longer exists.)

- Issue #4474: PyUnicode_FromWideChar now converts characters outside the BMP to
  surrogate pairs, on systems with sizeof(wchar_t) == 4 and sizeof(Py_UNICODE)
  == 2.

- Issue #5237: Allow auto-numbered fields in str.format(). For example: ``'{}
  {}'.format(1, 2) == '1 2'``.

- Issue #3652: Make the 'line' argument for ``warnings.showwarning()`` a
  requirement.  Means the DeprecationWarning from Python 2.6 can go away.

- Issue #5247: Improve error message when unknown format codes are used when
  using ``str.format()`` with str, unicode, long, int, and float arguments.

- Running Python with the -3 option now also warns about classic division for
  ints and longs.

- Issue #5260: Long integers now consume less memory: average saving is 2 bytes
  per long on a 32-bit system and 6 bytes per long on a 64-bit system.

- Issue #5186: Reduce hash collisions for objects with no __hash__ method by
  rotating the object pointer by 4 bits to the right.

- Issue #4575: Fix Py_IS_INFINITY macro to work correctly on x87 FPUs: it now
  forces its argument to double before testing for infinity.

- Issue #4978: Passing keyword arguments as unicode strings is now allowed.

- Issue #1242657: the __len__() and __length_hint__() calls in several tools
  were suppressing all exceptions.  These include list(), filter(), map(),
  zip(), and bytearray().

- os.ftruncate raises OSErrors instead of IOErrors for consistency with other os
  functions.

- Issue #4991: Passing invalid file descriptors to io.FileIO now raises an
  OSError.

- Issue #4807: Port the _winreg module to Windows CE.

- Issue #4935: The overflow checking code in the expandtabs() method common to
  str, bytes and bytearray could be optimized away by the compiler, letting the
  interpreter segfault instead of raising an error.

- Issue #3720: Fix a crash when an iterator modifies its class and removes its
  __next__ method.

- Issue #4893: Use NT threading on CE.

- Issue #4915: Port sysmodule to Windows CE.

- Issue #4074: Change the criteria for doing a full garbage collection (i.e.
  collecting the oldest generation) so that allocating lots of objects without
  destroying them does not show quadratic performance. Based on a proposal by
  Martin von Löwis at

- Issue #4850: Change COUNT_ALLOCS variables to Py_ssize_t.

- Issue #1180193: When importing a module from a .pyc (or .pyo) file with an
  existing .py counterpart, override the co_filename attributes of all code
  objects if the original filename is obsolete (which can happen if the file has
  been renamed, moved, or if it is accessed through different paths).  Patch by
  Ziga Seilnacht and Jean-Paul Calderone.

- Issue #4075: Use ``OutputDebugStringW()`` in Py_FatalError.

- Issue #4797: IOError.filename was not set when _fileio.FileIO failed to open
  file with `str' filename on Windows.

- Issue #3680: Reference cycles created through a dict, set or deque iterator
  did not get collected.

- Issue #4701: PyObject_Hash now implicitly calls PyType_Ready on types where
  the tp_hash and tp_dict slots are both NULL.

- Issue #4764: With io.open, IOError.filename is set when trying to open a
  directory on POSIX systems.

- Issue #4764: IOError.filename is set when trying to open a directory on POSIX
  systems.

- Issue #4759: None is now allowed as the first argument of
  ``bytearray.translate()``.  It was always allowed for ``bytes.translate()``.

- Added test case to ensure attempts to read from a file opened for writing
  fail.

- Issue #2467: gc.DEBUG_STATS reported invalid elapsed times. Also, always print
  elapsed times, not only when some objects are uncollectable/unreachable.
  Original patch by Neil Schemenauer.

- Issue #3439: Add a bit_length method to int and long.

- Issue #2183: Simplify and optimize bytecode for list comprehensions.  Original
  patch by Neal Norwitz.

- Issue #4597: Fixed exception handling when the __exit__ function of a context
  manager returns a value that cannot be converted to a bool.

- Issue #4597: Fixed several opcodes that weren't always propagating exceptions.

- Issue #4445: Replace ``sizeof(PyStringObject)`` with
  ``offsetof(PyStringObject, ob_sval) + 1`` when allocating memory for str
  instances.  On a typical machine this saves 3 bytes of memory (on average) per
  string allocation.

- Issue #3996: On Windows, the PyOS_CheckStack function would cause the
  interpreter to abort ("Fatal Python error: Could not reset the stack!")
  instead of throwing a MemoryError.

- Issue #3689: The list reversed iterator now supports __length_hint__ instead
  of __len__.  Behavior now matches other reversed iterators.

- Issue #4367: Python would segfault during compiling when the unicodedata
  module couldn't be imported and \N escapes were present.

- Issue #4233: Changed semantic of ``_fileio.FileIO``'s ``close()`` method on
  file objects with closefd=False. The file descriptor is still kept open but
  the file object behaves like a closed file. The ``FileIO`` object also got a
  new readonly attribute ``closefd``.

- Issue #4348: Some bytearray methods returned that didn't cause any change to
  the bytearray, returned the same bytearray instead of a copy.

- Issue #4317: Fixed a crash in the ``imageop.rgb2rgb8()`` function.

- Issue #4230: If ``__getattr__`` is a descriptor, it now functions correctly.

- Issue #4048: The parser module now correctly validates relative imports.

- Issue #4225: ``from __future__ import unicode_literals`` didn't work in an
  exec statement.

- Issue #4176: Fixed a crash when pickling an object which ``__reduce__`` method
  does not return iterators for the 4th and 5th items.

- Issue #4209: Enabling unicode_literals and the print_function in the same
  __future__ import didn't work.

- Using ``nonlocal`` as a variable name will now raise a Py3k SyntaxWarning
  because it is a reserved word in 3.x.

- On windows, ``os.chdir()`` given unicode was not working if
  GetCurrentDirectoryW returned a path longer than MAX_PATH. (But It's doubtful
  this code path is really executed because I cannot move to such directory on
  win2k)

- Issue #4069: When ``set.remove(element)`` is used with a set element, the
  element is temporarily replaced with an equivalent frozenset.  But the
  eventual KeyError would always report the empty ``frozenset()`` as the missing
  key.  Now it correctly refers to the initial element.

- Issue #4509: Various issues surrounding resize of bytearray objects to which
  there are buffer exports.

- Issue #4748: Lambda generators no longer return a value.

- Issue #3582: Use native TLS functions on Windows

- The re.sub(), re.subn() and re.split() functions now accept a flags parameter.

- Issue #3845: In PyRun_SimpleFileExFlags avoid invalid memory access with short
  file names.

- Issue #1113244: Py_XINCREF, Py_DECREF, Py_XDECREF: Add `do { ... } while (0)'
  to avoid compiler warnings.

- Issue #5705: os.setuid() would not accept values > 2**31-1 but pwd.getpwnam()
  returned them on 64bit platforms.

- Issue #5108: Handle %s like %S and %R in PyUnicode_FromFormatV(): Call
  PyUnicode_DecodeUTF8() once, remember the result and output it in a second
  step. This avoids problems with counting UTF-8 bytes that ignores the effect
  of using the replace error handler in PyUnicode_DecodeUTF8().

- Issue #3739: The unicode-internal encoder now reports the number of characters
  consumed like any other encoder (instead of the number of bytes).

- Issue #2422: When compiled with the ``--with-valgrind`` option, the pymalloc
  allocator will be automatically disabled when running under Valgrind.  This
  gives improved memory leak detection when running under Valgrind, while taking
  advantage of pymalloc at other times.

  execute file paths that refer to source or compiled Python files as well as
  zipfiles, directories and other valid sys.path entries that contain a
  __main__.py file. This allows applications that run other Python scripts to
  support the same flexibility as the CPython command line itself.

- Issue #7318: multiprocessing now uses a timeout when it fails to establish a
  connection with another process, rather than looping endlessly. The default
  timeout is 20 seconds, which should be amply sufficient for local connections.

  failures on systems with slightly bogus mtime behaviour.

- Issue #7246 & Issue #7208: getpass now properly flushes input before reading
  from stdin so that existing input does not confuse it and lead to incorrect
  entry or an IOError.  It also properly flushes it afterwards to avoid the

  DN_MULTISHOT with F_NOTIFY).

- Issue #1424152: Fix for httplib, urllib2 to support SSL while working through
  proxy. Original patch by Christopher Li, changes made by Senthil Kumaran.

- Issue #1983: Fix functions taking or returning a process identifier to use the

  equality operator.

- Issue #6001: Test discovery for unittest. Implemented in
  unittest.TestLoader.discover and from the command line.

- Issue #5679: The methods unittest.TestCase.addCleanup and doCleanups were
  added.  addCleanup allows you to add cleanup functions that will be called

- Issue #5008: When a file is opened in append mode with the new IO library, do
  an explicit seek to the end of file (so that e.g. tell() returns the file size

  file object.

- Issue #5013: Fixed a bug in FileHandler which occurred when the delay
  parameter was set.

- Issue #4998: The memory saving effect of __slots__ had been lost on Fractions

  based on __file__).  Original patch by Alexander Belopolsky.

- Issues #4082 and #4512: Add runpy support to zipimport in a manner that allows

Extension Modules
-----------------

- Issue #6508: Add posix.{getresuid,getresgid,setresuid,setresgid}.

- Issue #7078: Set struct.__doc__ from _struct.__doc__.

- Issue #3366: Add erf, erfc, expm1, gamma, lgamma functions to math module.

- Issue #6823: Allow time.strftime() to accept a tuple with a isdst field
  outside of the range of [-1, 1] by normalizing the value to within that range.

- Issue #6877: Make it possible to link the readline extension to libedit on
  OSX.

- Issue #6944: Fix a SystemError when socket.getnameinfo() was called with
  something other than a tuple as first argument.

- Issue #6865: Fix reference counting issue in the initialization of the pwd
  module.

- Issue #6848: Fix curses module build failure on OS X 10.6.

- Fix a segfault in expat when given a specially crafted input lead to the
  tokenizer not stopping. CVE-2009-3720.

- Issue #6561: '\d' in a regex now matches only characters with Unicode category
  'Nd' (Number, Decimal Digit).  Previously it also matched characters with
  category 'No'.

- Issue #1523: Remove deprecated overflow wrapping for struct.pack with an
  integer format code ('bBhHiIlLqQ').  Packing an out-of-range integer now
  consistently raises struct.error.

- Issues #1530559, #1741130: Fix various struct.pack inconsistencies for the
  integer formats ('bBhHiIlLqQ').  In the following, '*' represents any of '=',
  '<', '>'.

    - Packing a float now always gives a Deprecation Warning.  Previously it
      only warned for 'I', 'L', '*B', '*H', '*I', '*L'.

    - If x is not an int, long or float, then packing x will always result in
      struct.error.  Previously an x with an __int__ method could be packed by
      'b', 'B', 'h', 'H', 'i', 'l', '*b', '*h' ,'*i', '*l', and an x with a
      __long__ method could be packed by 'q', 'Q', '*q', '*Q'; for x with
      neither __int__ nor __long__, TypeError used to be raised (with a
      confusing error message) for 'I', 'L', '*B', '*H', '*I', '*L', and
      struct.error in other cases.

  Note: as of Python 2.7 beta 1, the above is out of date.  In 2.7 beta 1, any
  argument with an __int__ method can be packed, but use of this feature
  triggers a DeprecationWarning.

  primitives such as Lock, RLock, Condition, Event and Semaphore.

- Issue #7222: Make thread "reaping" more reliable so that reference
  leak-chasing test runs give sensible results.  The previous method of reaping
  threads could return successfully while some Thread objects were still
  referenced.  This also introduces a new private function: ``thread._count()``.

- Issue #7151: Fixed regrtest -j so that output to stderr from a test no longer
  runs the risk of causing the worker thread to fail.

- Issue #7055: test___all__ now greedily detects all modules which have an
  __all__ attribute, rather than using a hardcoded and incomplete list.

- Issue #7058: Added save/restore for things like sys.argv and cwd to
  runtest_inner in regrtest, with warnings if the called test modifies them,
  and a new section in the summary report at the end.

- Issue #7042: Fix test_signal (test_itimer_virtual) failure on OS X 10.6.

- Issue #6806: test_platform failed under OS X 10.6.0 because ``sw_ver`` leaves
  off the trailing 0 in the version number.

- Issue #5450: Moved tests involving loading tk from Lib/test/test_tcl to
  Lib/lib-tk/test/test_tkinter/test_loadtk. With this, these tests demonstrate
  the same behaviour as test_ttkguionly (and now also test_tk) which is to skip
  the tests if DISPLAY is defined but can't be used.

- Issue #6152: New option '-j'/'--multiprocess' for regrtest allows running
  regression tests in parallel, shortening the total runtime.

- Issue #5354: New test support function import_fresh_module() makes it easy to
  import both normal and optimised versions of modules.  test_heapq and
  test_warnings have been adjusted to use it, tests for other modules with both
  C and Python implementations in the stdlib can be adjusted to use it over
  time.

- Fix test_warnings to no longer reset the warnings filter.

- Fix test_logging to no longer reset the warnings filter.

- Issue #5635: Fix running test_sys with tracing enabled.

- regrtest no longer treats ImportError as equivalent to SkipTest.  Imports that
  should cause a test to be skipped are now done using import_module from test
  support, which does the conversion.

- Issue #5083: New 'gui' resource for regrtest.

- Issue #5837: Certain sequences of calls to set() and unset() for
  support.EnvironmentVarGuard objects restored the environment variables
  incorrectly on __exit__.

- Issue #2389: Array objects are now pickled in a portable manner.

Misc
----

- Issue #5611: Auto-detect whether a C file uses tabs or spaces in Vim.

What's New in Python 2.6 final
==============================

*Release date: 01-Oct-2008*

Core and Builtins

- Issue #3967: Fixed a crash in the count() and find() methods of string-like
  objects, when the "start" parameter is a huge value.

- Issue #3965: Fixed a crash on Windows when open() is given an invalid
  filename or mode, and the filename is a unicode string.

- Bug #3951: Py_USING_MEMORY_DEBUGGER should not be enabled by default.

Library
-------

- Issue #3965: Allow repeated calls to turtle.Screen, by making it a
  true singleton object.

- Issue #3895: It was possible to crash the interpreter when an external timer
  was used with cProfile that returned an object that could not be converted
  into a float.

- Issue #3950: Made turtle respect scale factors.

- Issue #3547: Fixed ctypes structures bitfields of varying integer
  sizes.

- Issue #3879: A regression in urllib.getproxies_enviroment was fixed.

What's New in Python 2.6 release candidate 2?
=============================================

*Release date: 17-Sep-2008*

Core and Builtins
-----------------

Extension Modules
-----------------

- Security Issue #2: imageop did not validate arguments correctly and could
  segfault as a result.

- Issue #3886: Possible integer overflows in the _hashopenssl module were
  closed.

Tools/Demos
-----------

- Issue #3850: recursion tests in Tools/scripts/find_recursion_limit.py can raise
  AttributeError instead of RuntimeError, depending in which C API call
  exactly the recursion limit is exceeded. Consequently, both exception types
  are caught and silenced.

Build
-----

- Issue #3617: Include a licensing statement regarding the Microsoft
  C runtime in the Windows installer.

What's New in Python 2.6 release candidate 1?
=============================================

*Release date: 12-Sep-2008*

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- Issue #3642: Suppress warning in obmalloc when size_t is larger than uint.

- Issue #3743: In a few places, PY_FORMAT_SIZE_T was incorrectly used with
  PyString_FromFormat or PyErr_Format to display size_t values. The macro
  PY_FORMAT_SIZE_T is designed to select the correct format for the OS
  ``printf`` function, whereas PyString_FromFormat has an independent
  implementation and uses "%zd" on all platforms for size_t values.
  This makes a difference on win64, where ``printf`` needs "%Id" to display
  64bit values.

- Issue #3634: _weakref.ref(Exception).__init__() gave invalid return value on
  error.

- Issue #3777: long() applied to a float object now always return a long
  object; previously an int would be returned for small values. the __long__
  method is allowed to return either an int or a long, but the behaviour of
  float objects should not change to respect backward compatibility.

- Issue #3751: str.rpartition would perform a left-partition when called with
  a unicode argument.

- Issue #3683: Fix compilation when --without-threads is given.

- Issue #3668: Fix a memory leak with the "s*" argument parser in
  PyArg_ParseTuple and friends, which occurred when the argument for "s*"
  was correctly parsed but parsing of subsequent arguments failed.

- Issue #2534: speed up isinstance() and issubclass() by 50-70%, so as to
  match Python 2.5 speed despite the __instancecheck__ / __subclasscheck__
  mechanism. In the process, fix a bug where isinstance() and issubclass(),
  when given a tuple of classes as second argument, were looking up
  __instancecheck__ / __subclasscheck__ on the tuple rather than on each
  type object.

- Fix crashes on memory allocation failure found with failmalloc.

- Fix memory leaks found with valgrind and update suppressions file.

- Fix compiler warnings in opt mode which would lead to invalid memory reads.

- Fix problem using wrong name in decimal module reported by pychecker.

- Silenced another compiler warning about a used but not defined
  function 'stringlib_contains_obj'.

- Added warnings on the use of ``__getslice__``, ``__setslice__``, or
  ``__delslice__``.

- Issue #3678: Correctly pass LDFLAGS and LDLAST to the linker on shared
  library targets in the Makefile.

- Issue #1204: The configure script now tests for additional libraries
  that may be required when linking against readline.  This fixes issues
  with x86_64 builds on some platforms (a few Linux flavors and OpenBSD).

C-API
-----

- Aliased PyObject_Bytes to PyObject_Str.

Library
-------

- Issue #3640: Pickling a list or a dict uses less local variables, to reduce
  stack usage in the case of deeply nested objects.

- Issue #3629: Fix sre "bytecode" validator for an end case.

- Issue #3811: The Unicode database was updated to 5.1.

- Issue #3781: Further warnings.catch_warnings() cleanup to prevent
  silent misbehaviour when a single instance is nested in multiple
  with statements, or when the methods are invoked in the wrong order.

- Issue #3809: Fixed spurious 'test.blah' file left behind by test_logging.

- Issue #3781: Clean up the API for warnings.catch_warnings() by having it
  return a list or None rather than a custom object.

- Issue #1638033: Cookie.Morsel gained the httponly attribute.

- Issue #3535: zipfile couldn't read some zip files larger than 2GB.

- Issue #3776: Deprecate the bsddb package for removal in 3.0.

- Issue #3762: platform.architecture() fails if python is lanched via
  its symbolic link.

- Issue #3772: Fixed regression problem in StreamHandler.emit().

- Issue #600362: Relocated parse_qs() and parse_qsl(), from the cgi module
  to the urlparse one.  Added a PendingDeprecationWarning in the old
  module, it will be deprecated in the future.

- Issue #2562: Fix distutils PKG-INFO writing logic to allow having
  non-ascii characters and Unicode in setup.py meta-data.

- Issue #3726: Allow spaces in separators in logging configuration files.

- Issue #3719: platform.architecture() fails if there are spaces in the
  path to the Python binary.

- Issue #3602: Moved test.test_support.catch_warning() to
  warnings.catch_warnings() along with some API cleanup. Expanding the tests
  for catch_warnings() also led to an improvement in the raising of a
  DeprecationWarning related to warnings.warn_explicit().

- The deprecation warnings for the old camelCase threading API were removed.

- logging: fixed lack of use of encoding attribute specified on a stream.

- Silenced a trivial compiler warning in the sqlite module.

- Fixed two format strings in the _collections module.

- Issue #3703: _fileio.FileIO gave unhelpful error message when trying to open a
  directory.

- Issue #3708: os.urandom no longer goes into an infinite loop when passed a
  non-integer floating point number.

- Issue #3110: multiprocessing fails to compiel on solaris 10 due to missing
  SEM_VALUE_MAX.

Extension Modules
-----------------

- Issue #4301: Patch the logging module to add processName support, remove
  _check_logger_class from multiprocessing.

- Issue #2975: When compiling several extension modules with Visual Studio 2008
  from the same python interpreter, some environment variables would grow
  without limit.

- Issue #3643: Added a few more checks to _testcapi to prevent segfaults by
  exploitation of poor argument checking.

- sqlite3: Changed docstring of iterdump() to mark method as "Non-standard".

- Issue #3103: Reduced globals symbols used by sqlite3 module and made sure all
  remaining ones have "pysqlite_" prefix.

- Issue #3846: Release the GIL during sqlite3_prepare calls. This improves
  concurrent access to the same SQLite database from multiple
  threads/processes.

Tests
-----

- Issue #3781: Add test.test_support.check_warnings() as a convenience
  wrapper for warnings.catch_warnings() that makes it easier to check
  that expected warning messages are being reported.

- Issue #3796: Some tests functions were not enabled in test_float.

- Issue #3768: Move test_py3kwarn over to the new API for catch_warnings().

Build
-----

- Issue #3833: Use a different upgrade code for Win64 installers.

- Issue #2271: Set SecureCustomProperties so that installation will properly
  use the TARGETDIR even for unprivileged users.

- Allow passing the MSI file name to merge.py.

- Issue #3758: Rename the 'check' target to 'patchcheck' so as to not clash
  with GNU build target guidelines.

What's New in Python 2.6 beta 3?
================================

*Release date: 20-Aug-2008*

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- Issue #1878: Remove Py_TPFLAGS_HAVE_VERSION_TAG from
  Py_TPFLAGS_DEFAULT when not building the core.  This means 3rd party
  extensions do not automatically benefit from the class attribute
  cache; they will have to explicitly add Py_TPFLAGS_HAVE_VERSION_TAG
  to their tp_flags field if they care.  This is a backwards
  compatibility feature; in 3.0, all types will use the cache by
  default.

- Keyword arguments can now follow starred arguments. (``f(a, *args,
  keyword=23)`` is now valid syntax.)

- ctypes function pointers that are COM methods have a boolean True
  value again.

- Issue #3139: Make buffer-interface thread-safe wrt. PyArg_ParseTuple,
  by denying s# to parse objects that have a releasebuffer procedure,
  and introducing s*.

- Issue #3537: Fix an assertion failure when an empty but presized dict
  object was stored in the freelist.

- Issue #1481296: Make long(float('nan')) and int(float('nan')) raise
  ValueError consistently across platforms.

- Issue #3479: On platforms where sizeof(int) is smaller than sizeof(long)
  (64bit Unix, for example), unichr() would truncate its argument and return
  u'\x00' for unichr(2**32). Now it properly raises an OverflowError.

- Apply security patches from Apple.

- Issue #2542: Now that issubclass() may call arbitrary code, ensure that
  PyErr_ExceptionMatches returns 0 when an exception occurs there.

- Issue #1819: function calls with several named parameters are now on
  average 35% faster (as measured by pybench).

- Issue #2378: An unexpected UnboundLocalError or NameError could appear when
  the python debugger steps into a class statement: the free variables (local
  variables defined in an outer scope) would be deleted from the outer scope.

- Issue #2620: Overflow checking when allocating or reallocating memory
  was not always being done properly in some python types and extension
  modules.  PyMem_MALLOC, PyMem_REALLOC, PyMem_NEW and PyMem_RESIZE have
  all been updated to perform better checks and places in the code that
  would previously leak memory on the error path when such an allocation
  failed have been fixed.

Library
-------

- Issue #3612: Added some missing basic types in ctypes.wintypes.

- The methods ``is_in_tuple()``, ``is_vararg()``, and ``is_keywordarg()`` of
  symtable.Symbol have been deprecated for removal in 3.0 and the next release.

- Issue #2234: distutils failed for some versions of the cygwin compiler. The
  version reported by these tools does not necessarily follow the python
  version numbering scheme, so the module is less strict when parsing it.

- Issue #2235: Added Py3k warnings for types which will become unhashable
  under the stricter __hash__ inheritance rules in 3.0. Several types
  which did not meet the rules for hash invariants and were already
  unhashable in 3.0 have now been explicitly flagged as unhashable in
  2.6 as well (collections.Mapping, collections.Set, unittest.TestSuite,
  xml.dom.minidom.NamedNodeMap, numbers.Number, UserList.UserList)

- Update __all__ for cookielib, csv, os, urllib2, and weakref to include things
  imported into the module but exposed as part of the module's API.

- Remove an unneeded import of abc.ABCMeta from 'inspect'.

- Remove unneeded imports of 'sys' and 'warnings' from 'io'.

- Remove unneeded imports of 'warnings' from shelve, filecmp, and dummy_thread.

- Issue #3575: Incremental decoder's decode function now takes bytearray
  by using 's*' instead of 't#'.

- Issue #2222: Fixed reference leak when occurred os.rename()
  fails unicode conversion on 2nd parameter. (windows only)

- Issue #2464: urllib2 now supports a malformation in the URL received
  in a redirect.

- Silence the DeprecationWarning raised when importing mimetools in
  BaseHTTPServer, cgi (and rfc822), httplib.

- Issue #2776: fixed small issue when handling an URL with double slash
  after a 302 response in the case of not going through a proxy.

- Issue #2676: in the email package, content-type parsing was hanging on
  pathological input because of quadratic or exponential behaviour of a
  regular expression.

- Issue #3476: binary buffered reading through the new "io" library is now
  thread-safe.

- Silence the DeprecationWarning of rfc822 when it is imported by mimetools
  since mimetools itself is deprecated. Because modules are cached, all
  subsequent imports of rfc822 will not raise a visible DeprecationWarning.

- Issue #3134: shutil referenced undefined WindowsError symbol.

- Issue #1342811: Fix leak in Tkinter.Menu.delete. Commands associated to
  menu entries were not deleted.

- Copied the implementation of reduce() to _functools.reduce() to have a
  version that did not raise a DeprecationWarning under -3.

- Issue #3205: When iterating over a BZ2File fails allocating memory, raise
  a MemoryError rather than silently stop the iteration.

- Issue #3487: sre "bytecode" validator.  Passing invalid "re-bytecode"
  to _sre.compile() will now be rejected.  This should not affect anybody
  since the re.compile() function never generates invalid re-bytecode.

- Issue #3436: Make csv.DictReader's fieldnames attribute a property so that
  upon first access it can be automatically initialized from the csv file if
  it wasn't initialized during instantiation.

- Issue #2338: Create imp.reload() to help with transitioning to Python 3.0 as
  the reload() built-in has been removed.

- Changed code in the following modules/packages to remove warnings raised
  while running under the ``-3`` flag: aifc, asynchat, asyncore, bdb, bsddb,
  ConfigParser, cookielib, csv, difflib, distutils, DocXMLRPCServer, email,
  filecmp, fileinput, inspect, logging, modulefinder, pdb, pickle, profile,
  pstats, pydoc, re, rlcompleter, SimpleXMLRPCServer, shelve, socket,
  subprocess, sqlite3, tarfile, Tkinter, test.test_support, textwrap,
  threading, tokenize, traceback, urlparse, wsgiref, xml, xmlrpclib.

- Issue #3039: Fix tarfile.TarFileCompat.writestr() which always
  raised an AttributeError.

- Issue #2523: Fix quadratic behaviour when read()ing a binary file without
  asking for a specific length. This problem only affected files opened
  using the new "io" module, not the built-in open() function.

- Issue #3449: Update decimal module to use most recent specification
  (v. 1.68) and tests (v. 2.58) from IBM.

- Issue #3437: Bug fix in robotparser parsing of Allow: lines.

- Issue #1592:  Improve error reporting when operations are attempted
  on a closed shelf.

- Deprecate the "ast" parser function aliases.

- Issue #3120: On 64-bit Windows the subprocess module was truncating handles.

- Issue #3303: Fix a crash in locale.strcoll() when calling it with
  invalid arguments.

- Issue #3302: Fix several crashes when calling locale's gettext functions
  with None arguments.

- Issue #3389: Allow resolving dotted names for handlers in logging
  configuration files.

- Deprecate the sunaudio module for removal in Python 3.0.

- Issue #3394: zipfile.writestr sets external attributes when passed a
  file name rather than a ZipInfo instance, so files are extracted with
  mode 0600 rather than 000 under Unix.

- Issue #1857: subprocess.Popen.poll gained an additional _deadstate keyword
  argument in python 2.5, this broke code that subclassed Popen to include its
  own poll method.  Fixed my moving _deadstate to an _internal_poll method.

Build
-----

- Generate the PatternGrammar pickle during "make install".

Documentation
-------------

- Issue #2235: the C API function PyObject_HashNotImplemented and its
  interaction with the tp_hash slot (added in 2.6b2) are now documented

- Issue #643841: The language reference now provides more detailed
  coverage of the lookup process for special methods. The disclaimers
  regarding lack of coverage of new-style classes have also been
  removed, since the coverage is now fairly reasonable.

What's New in Python 2.6 beta 2?
================================

*Release date: 17-Jul-2008*

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- Issue #3156: Fix inconsistent behavior of the bytearray type: all
  its methods now allow for items objects that can be converted to
  an integer using operator.index().

- Issue #3360: Fix incorrect parsing of '020000000000.0', which
  produced a ValueError instead of giving the correct float.

- Issue #3083: Add alternate (#) formatting for bin, oct, hex output
  for str.format().  This adds the prefix 0b, 0o, or 0x, respectively.

- Issue #3008: the float type has a new instance method 'float.hex'
  and a new class method 'float.fromhex' to convert floating-point
  numbers to and from hexadecimal strings, respectively.

- Issue #2235: __hash__ is once again inherited by default. To allow
  collections.Hashable to remain meaningful in the presence of the
  default hash implementation (object.__hash__), it is now possible
  to explicit block inheritance of hash by setting __hash__=None at
  the Python level, or tp_hash=PyObject_HashNotImplemented at the C
  level.

- Issue #3221: Issue a RuntimeWarning instead of raising SystemError if
  the parent module cannot be found while performing an absolute import.
  This means that an incorrectly defined __package__ attribute will
  now only prevent relative imports in that module rather than causing
  all imports from that module to fail.

- Issue #2517: Allow unicode messages in Exceptions again by correctly
  bypassing the instance dictionary when looking up __unicode__ on
  new-style classes.

- Issue #3242: Fix a crash inside the print statement, if sys.stdout is
  set to a custom object whose write() method happens to install
  another file in sys.stdout.

- Issue #3088: Corrected a race condition in classes derived from
  threading.local: the first member set by a thread could be saved in
  another thread's dictionary.

- Issue #3004: Minor change to slice.indices(): the start and stop
  arguments are now treated identically, making the behaviour easier
  to describe and understand.  For example, slice(None, -10,
  1).indices(9) now returns (0, 0, 1) instead of (0, -1, 1), and
  slice(None, 10, -1).indices(10) returns (9, 9, -1) instead of (9,
  10, -1).

- Issue #3219: Calling a function with repeated keyword arguments,
  f(a=2, a=23), would not cause a syntax error.  This was a regression
  from 2.4 caused by the switch to the new compiler.

- Issue #2862: Make int and float freelist management consistent with
  other freelists.  Changes their CompactFreeList apis into
  ClearFreeList apis and calls them via gc.collect().

Library
-------

- Issue #3554: ctypes.string_at and ctypes.wstring_at did call Python
  api functions without holding the GIL, which could lead to a fatal
  error when they failed.

- Issue #799428: Fix Tkinter.Misc._nametowidget to unwrap Tcl command objects.

- Issue #3395: fix reference in test_multiprocessing to old debugInfo method

- Issue #3312: Fix two crashes in sqlite3.

- Issue #1608818: Fix misbehavior in os.listdir() if readdir() fails.

- Issue #3125: Remove copy_reg in multiprocessing and replace it with
  ForkingPickler.register() to resolve conflict with ctypes.

- Issue #3090: Fixed ARCHFLAGS parsing on OS/X

- Issue #3313: Fixed a crash when a failed dlopen() call does not set
  a valid dlerror() message.

- Issue #3258: Fixed a crash when a ctypes POINTER type to an
  incomplete structure was created.

- Issue #3339: dummy_thread.acquire() should not return None.

- Issue #3285: Fractions from_float() and from_decimal() accept Integral arguments.

- Issue #3301: Bisect module behaved badly when lo was negative.

- Issue #839496: SimpleHTTPServer used to open text files in text mode. This is
  both unnecessary (HTTP allows text content to be sent in several forms) and
  wrong because the actual transmitted size could differ from the
  content-length.  The problem had been corrected in the 2.4 branch, but never
  merged into trunk.

- Issue #2663: add filtering capability to shutil.copytree().

- Issue #1622: Correct interpretation of various ZIP header fields.

- Issue #1526: Allow more than 64k files to be added to Zip64 file.

- Issue #1746: Correct handling of zipfile archive comments (previously
  archives with comments over 4k were flagged as invalid). Allow writing
  Zip files with archives by setting the 'comment' attribute of a ZipFile.

- Issue #449227: The rlcompleter module now adds "(" to callable objects
  when completed.

- Issue #3190: Pydoc now hides the automatic module attribute __package__ (the
  handling is now the same as that of other special attributes like __name__).

- Issue #2885 (partial): The urllib.urlopen() function has been deprecated for
  removal in Python 3.0 in favor of urllib2.urlopen().

- Issue #2113: Fix error in subprocess.Popen if the select system call is
  interrupted by a signal.

- Issue #3309: Fix bz2.BZFile iterator to release its internal lock
  properly when raising an exception due to the bz2file being closed.
  Prevents a deadlock.

- Issue #3094: httplib.HTTPSConnection Host: headers no longer include the
  redundant ":443" port number designation when the connection is using the
  default https port (443).

- Issue #874900: after an os.fork() call the threading module state is cleaned
  up in the child process to prevent deadlock and report proper thread counts
  if the new process uses the threading module.

Tests
-----

- test.test_support.catch_warning now keeps track of all warnings it sees
  and is now better documented. Explicit unit tests for this context manager
  have been added to test_warnings.

Build
-----

- Issue #3215: Build sqlite3 as sqlite3.dll, not sqlite3.pyd.

Documentation
-------------

- Document that robotparser has been renamed to urllib.robotparser in
  Python 3.0.

- Document that urlparse has been renamed to urllib.parse in Python 3.0.

- Document that urllib2 is split across multiple modules and renamed in
  Python 3.0.

- Document that urllib is split across multiple modules and renamed in
  Python 3.0.

What's New in Python 2.6 beta 1?
================================

*Release date: 18-June-2008*

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- Issue #3211: warnings.warn_explicit() did not guard against its 'registry'
  argument being anything other than a dict or None. Also fixed a bug in error
  handling when 'message' and 'category' were both set to None, triggering a
  bus error.

- Issue #3100: Corrected a crash on deallocation of a subclassed weakref which
  holds the last (strong) reference to its referent.

- Add future_builtins.ascii().

- Several set methods now accept multiple arguments:  update(), union(),
  intersection(), intersection_update(), difference(), and difference_update().

- Issue #2898: Added sys.getsizeof() to retrieve size of objects in bytes.

- New environment variable PYTHONIOENCODING.

- Patch #2488: Add sys.maxsize.

- Issue #2353: file.xreadlines() now emits a Py3k warning.

- Issue #2863: generators now have a ``gen.__name__`` attribute that
  equals ``gen.gi_code.co_name``, like ``func.__name___`` that equals
  ``func.func_code.co_name``.  The repr() of a generator now also
  contains this name.

- Issue #2831: enumerate() now has a ``start`` argument.

- Issue #2801: fix bug in the float.is_integer method where a
  ValueError was sometimes incorrectly raised.

- Issue #2790: sys.flags was not properly exposing its bytes_warning
  attribute.

- Issue #2196: hasattr() now lets exceptions which do not inherit
  Exception (KeyboardInterrupt, and SystemExit) propagate instead of
  ignoring them.

- Added checks for integer overflows, contributed by Google. Some are
  only available if asserts are left in the code, in cases where they
  can't be triggered from Python code.

Extension Modules
-----------------
- Issue #1179: [CVE-2007-4965] Integer overflow in imageop module.

- Issue #3116:  marshal.dumps() had quadratic behavior for strings > 32Mb.

- Issue #2138: Add factorial() to the math module.

- The heapq module does comparisons using LT instead of LE.  This
  makes its implementation match that used by list.sort().

- Issue #2819: add full-precision summation function to math module,
  based on Hettinger's ASPN Python Cookbook recipe.

- Issue #2592: delegate nb_index and the floor/truediv slots in
  weakref.proxy.

- Support os.O_ASYNC and fcntl.FASYNC if the constants exist on the
  platform.

- Support for Windows 9x has been removed from the winsound module.

- bsddb module updated to version 4.7.3.
  http://www.jcea.es/programacion/pybsddb.htm#bsddb3-4.7.3. This

  PyString names.

What's New in Python 2.6 alpha 3?
=================================

*Release date: 08-May-2008*

Core and builtins
-----------------

- Issue #2719: backported the ``next()`` builtin from Python 3.

- Issue #2681: The octal literal ``0o8`` was incorrecly acctepted. Now
  it properly raises a SyntaxError.

- Issue #2617: Reserved -J and -X arguments for Jython, IronPython and
  other implementations of Python.

- Implemented PEP 370: Per user site-packages directory.

Extension Modules
-----------------

- Issue #2670: Fix a failure in urllib2.build_opener(), when passed
  two handlers that derive the same default base class.

- Added kill, terminate and send_signal(sig) to subprocess.Popen.

- Added phase(z) -> phi, polar(z) -> r, phi and rect(r, phi) -> z to
  the cmath module.

- Four new methods were added to the math and cmath modules: acosh,
  asinh, atanh and log1p.

- zlib.decompressobj().flush(value) no longer crashes the interpreter
  when passed a value less than or equal to zero.

- Issue #1631171: Re-implement the 'warnings' module in C (the
  original Python code has been kept as backup). This will allow for
  using the 'warning's machinery in such places as the parser where
  use of pure Python code is not possible.  Both the ``showarning()``
  and ``formatwarning()`` gain an optional 'line' argument which is
  not called by default for backwards-compatibility reasons. Setting
  ``warnings.showwarning()`` to an implementation that lacks support
  for the ``line`` argument will raise a DeprecationWarning.

Library
-------

- The audiodev module has been deprecated for removal in Python 3.0.

- Issue #2750: Add the 'json' package. Based on simplejson 1.9 and
  contributed by Bob Ippolito.

- Issue #1734346: Support Unicode file names for zipfiles.

- Issue #2581: distutils: Vista UAC/elevation support for
  bdist_wininst.

- Issue #2635: Fix bug in 'fix_sentence_endings' textwrap.fill option,
  where an extra space was added after a word containing (but not
  ending in) '.', '!' or '?'.

- Add from_buffer() and from_buffer_copy() class methods to ctypes
  data types.

- Issue #2682: ctypes callback functions no longer contain a cyclic
  reference to themselves.

- The getpass module has been improved on Unix.  It now uses /dev/tty
  by default and uses stderr instead of stdout.  A GetPassWarning is
  issued when input echo cannot be controlled.

- Issue #2014: Allow XML-RPC datetime objects to have dates before
  1900-01-01.

- Issue #2439: Added new function pkgutil.get_data(), which is a
  convenience wrapper for the PEP 302 get_data() API.

- Issue #2616: The ctypes.pointer() and ctypes.POINTER() functions are
  now implemented in C for better performance.

- Issue #2408: The ``_types`` module, which was used as in
  implementation detail of the public ``types`` module, has been
  removed and replaced by pure python code.

- Issue #2513: distutils on Windows is now capable of cross-compiling
  extension modules between 32 and 64 bit platforms.  See the distutls
  build documentation for more information.

- Issue #815646: Individual file objects may now be used from multiple
  threads at once without fear of crashing the Python interpreter.  If
  file.close() is called while an object is in use by another thread
  an IOError exception will be raised and the file will not be closed.

- The bundled libffi copy is now in sync with the recently released
  libffi3.0.5 version, apart from some small changes to
  Modules/_ctypes/libffi/configure.ac.

- Issue #2385: distutils.core.run_script() makes __file__ available,
  so the controlled environment will more closely mirror the typical
  script environment.  This supports setup.py scripts that refer to
  data files.

Tests
-----

- Issue #2550: The approach used by client/server code for obtaining
  ports to listen on in network-oriented tests has been refined in an
  effort to facilitate running multiple instances of the entire
  regression test suite in parallel without issue.
  test_support.bind_port() has been fixed such that it will always
  return a unique port -- which wasn't always the case with the
  previous implementation, especially if socket options had been set
  that affected address reuse (i.e. SO_REUSEADDR, SO_REUSEPORT).  The
  new implementation of bind_port() will actually raise an exception
  if it is passed an AF_INET/SOCK_STREAM socket with either the
  SO_REUSEADDR or SO_REUSEPORT socket option set.  Furthermore, if
  available, bind_port() will set the SO_EXCLUSIVEADDRUSE option on
  the socket it's been passed.  This currently only applies to
  Windows.  This option prevents any other sockets from binding to the
  host/port we've bound to, thus removing the possibility of the
  'non-deterministic' behaviour, as Microsoft puts it, that occurs
  when a second SOCK_STREAM socket binds and accepts to a host/port
  that's already been bound by another socket.  The optional preferred
  port parameter to bind_port() has been removed.  Under no
  circumstances should tests be hard coding ports!

  test_support.find_unused_port() has also been introduced, which will
  pass a temporary socket object to bind_port() in order to obtain an
  unused port.  The temporary socket object is then closed and
  deleted, and the port is returned.  This method should only be used
  for obtaining an unused port in order to pass to an external program
  (i.e. the -accept [port] argument to openssl's s_server mode) or as
  a parameter to a server-oriented class that doesn't give you direct
  access to the underlying socket used.

  Finally, test_support.HOST has been introduced, which should be used
  for the host argument of any relevant socket calls (i.e. bind and
  connect).

  The following tests were updated to following the new conventions:
    test_socket, test_smtplib, test_asyncore, test_ssl, test_httplib,
    test_poplib, test_ftplib, test_telnetlib, test_socketserver,
    test_asynchat and test_socket_ssl.

  It is now possible for multiple instances of the regression test
  suite to run in parallel without issue.

Build
-----

- Issue #1496032: On alpha, use -mieee when gcc is the compiler.

- Issue #2544: On HP-UX systems, use 'gcc -shared' for linking when
  gcc is used as compiler.

- Issue #2573: On MacOS X it is now possible to install the framework
  with a different name using --with-framework-name=NAME.

C API
-----

- Added implementation of copysign, acosh, asinh, atanh and log1p to
  the new files Include/pymath.h and Python/pymath.h for platforms
  which provide the functions through their libm. The files also
  contains several helpers and constants for math.

- Added a new convenience macro, PyErr_WarnPy3k, for issuing Py3k warnings.

What's New in Python 2.6 alpha 2?
=================================

*Release date: 02-Apr-2008*

- Issue #2355: add Py3k warning for buffer().

- Issue #1477: With narrow Unicode builds, the unicode escape sequence
  \Uxxxxxxxx did not accept values outside the Basic Multilingual
  Plane.  This affected raw unicode literals and the
  'raw-unicode-escape' codec.  Now UTF-16 surrogates are generated in
  this case, like normal unicode literals and the 'unicode-escape'
  codec.

- Issue #2348: add Py3k warning for file.softspace.

- Issue #2346/#2347: add Py3k warnings for __methods__ and
  __members__.

  doesn't derive from BaseException.

- Issue #2321: use pymalloc for unicode object string data to reduce
  memory usage in some circumstances.

- PEP 3127: octal literals now start with "0o". Old-style octal
  literals are still valid. There are binary literals with a prefix of
  "0b".  This also affects int(x, 0).

- Issue #2359: Adding deprecation warnings for array.{read,write}.

- Issue #1779871: GNU gcc can now build Python on OS X because the
  flags -Wno-long-double, -no-cpp-precomp, and -mno-fused-madd are no
  longer passed.

- Add a warning when asserting a non-empty tuple which is always true.

- Issue #2179: speed up with statement execution by storing the exit
  method on the stack instead of in a temporary variable (patch by
  Jeffrey Yaskin)

- Issue #2238: Some syntax errors in *args and **kwargs expressions
  could give bogus error messages.

- Issue #2143: Fix embedded readline() hang on SSL socket EOF.

Extension Modules

  calculates rollovers correctly even when nothing is logged for a
  while.

- Issue #2317: logging.handlers: TimedRotatingFileHandler now uses
  improved logic for removing old files.

- Issue #2495: tokenize.untokenize now inserts a space between two
  consecutive string literals; previously, ["" ""] was rendered as
  [""""], which is incorrect python code.

- Issue #2248: return the result of the QUIT command. from
  SMTP.quit().

- Backport of Python 3.0's io module.

- Issue #2482: Make sure that the coefficient of a Decimal is always
  stored as a str instance, not as a unicode instance.  This ensures
  that str(Decimal) is always an instance of str.

- Issue #2478: fix failure of decimal.Decimal(0).sqrt()

- Issue #2432: give DictReader the dialect and line_num attributes
  advertised in the docs.

- Issue #2460: Make Ellipsis object copyable.

- Issue #1681432: Add triangular distribution to the random module

- Issue #2136: urllib2's auth handler now allows single-quoted realms
  in the WWW-Authenticate header.

- Issue #2434: Enhanced platform.win32_ver() to also work on Python
  installation which do not have the win32all package installed.

- Added support to platform.uname() to also report the machine and
  processor information on Windows XP and later. As a result,
  platform.machine() and platform.processor() will report this
  information as well.

- The library implementing the 2to3 conversion, lib2to3, was added to
  the standard distribution.

- Issue #1747858: Fix chown to work with large uid's and gid's on
  64-bit platforms.

- Issue #1202: zlib.crc32 and zlib.adler32 no longer return different
  values on 32-bit vs. 64-bit python interpreters.  Both were correct,
  but they now both return a signed integer object for consistency.

- Issue #1158: add %f format (fractions of a second represented as
  microseconds) to datetime objects.  Understood by both strptime and
  strftime.

- Issue #705836: struct.pack(">f", x) now raises OverflowError on all
  platforms when x is too large to fit into an IEEE 754 float;
  previously it only raised OverflowError on non IEEE 754 platforms.

  correctly under win32

- Patch #1858: distutils: added multiple server support in .pypirc

- Issue #1106316: pdb.post_mortem()'s parameter, "traceback", is now
  optional: it defaults to the traceback of the exception that is
  currently being handled (is mandatory to be in the middle of an
  exception, otherwise it raises ValueError).

- Issue #1193577: A .shutdown() method has been added to SocketServers
  which terminates the .serve_forever() loop.

- Issue #2220: handle rlcompleter attribute match failure more
  gracefully.

  root directory, and also exclude .hg, .git, .bzr, and _darcs.

- Issue #1872: The struct module typecode for _Bool has been changed
  from 't' to '?'.

- The bundled libffi copy is now in sync with the recently released
  libffi3.0.4 version, apart from some small changes to
  Modules/_ctypes/libffi/configure.ac.  On OS X, preconfigured libffi
  files are used.  On all linux systems the --with-system-ffi
  configure option defaults to "yes".

- Issue #1577: shutil.move() now calls os.rename() if the destination
  is a directory instead of copying-then-remove-source.

What's New in Python 2.6 alpha 1?
=================================

*Release date: 29-Feb-2008*

Core and builtins
-----------------

- Issue #2051: pyc and pyo files are no longer created with permission
  644. The mode is now inherited from the py file.

- Issue #2067: file.__exit__() now calls subclasses' close() method.

- Patch #1759: Backport of PEP 3129 class decorators.

- Issue #1881: An internal parser limit has been increased. Also see
  issue #215555 for a discussion.

- Added the future_builtins module, which contains hex() and oct().
  These are the PEP 3127 version of these functions, designed to be
  compatible with the hex() and oct() builtins from Python 3.0.  They
  differ slightly in their output formats from the existing, unchanged
  Python 2.6 builtins.  The expected usage of the future_builtins
  module is:
    from future_builtins import hex, oct

- Issue #1600: Modifed PyOS_ascii_formatd to use at most 2 digit
  exponents for exponents with absolute value < 100.  Follows C99
  standard.  This is a change on Windows, which would use 3 digits.
  Also, added 'n' to the formats that PyOS_ascii_formatd understands,
  so that any alterations it does to the resulting string will be
  available in stringlib/formatter.h (for float.__format__).

- Implemented PEP 3101, Advanced String Formatting.  This adds a new
  builtin format(); a format() method for str and unicode; a
  __format__() method to object, str, unicode, int, long, float, and
  datetime; the class string.Formatter; and the C API
  PyObject_Format().

- Fixed several potential crashes, all caused by specially crafted
  __del__ methods exploiting objects in temporarily inconsistent
  state.

- Issue #2115: Important speedup in setting __slot__ attributes.  Also
  prevent a possible crash: an Abstract Base Class would try to access
  a slot on a registered virtual subclass.

- Fixed repr() and str() of complex numbers with infinity or nan as
  real or imaginary part.

- Clear all free lists during a gc.collect() of the highest generation
  in order to allow pymalloc to free more arenas. Python may give back
  memory to the OS earlier.

- Issue #2045: Fix an infinite recursion triggered when printing a
  subclass of collections.defaultdict, if its default_factory is set
  to a bound method.

- Fixed a minor memory leak in dictobject.c. The content of the free
  list was not freed on interpreter shutdown.

- Limit free list of method and built-in function objects to 256
  entries each.

- Patch #1953: Added ``sys._compact_freelists()`` and the C API
  functions ``PyInt_CompactFreeList`` and ``PyFloat_CompactFreeList``
  to compact the internal free lists of pre-allocted ints and floats.

- Issue #1983: Fixed return type of fork(), fork1() and forkpty()
  calls.  Python expected the return type int but the fork familie
  returns pi_t.

  linebreak detection

- Added ``PyType_ClearCache()`` and ``sys._clear_type_cache`` to clear
  the internal lookup cache for ref leak tests.

- Patch #1473257: generator objects gain a gi_code attribute. This is
  the same object as the func_code attribute of the function that
  produced the generator.

- Issue #1920: "while 0" statements were completely removed by the
  compiler, even in the presence of an "else" clause, which is
  supposed to be run when the condition is false. Now the compiler
  correctly emits bytecode for the "else" suite.

- A few crashers fixed: weakref_in_del.py (issue #1377858);
  loosing_dict_ref.py (issue #1303614, test67.py);
  borrowed_ref_[34].py (not in tracker).

- Issue #1069410: The "can't load dll" message box on Windows is
  suppressed while an extension is loaded by calling SetErrorMode in
  dynload_win.c. The error is still reported properly.

- Issue #1915: Python compiles with --enable-unicode=no again. However
  several extension methods and modules do not work without unicode
  support.

- Issue #1882: when compiling code from a string, encoding cookies in the
  second line of code were not always recognized correctly.

- Issue #1679: "0x" was taken as a valid integer literal.

- Issue #1865: ``bytes`` as an alias for ``str`` and b"" as an alias "" were
  added.

- sys.float_info / PyFloat_GetInfo: The floating point information
  object was converted from a dict to a specialized structseq object.

- Patch #1816: Added sys.flags structseq. It exposes the status of
  most command line arguments and PYTHON* environment variables.

- Objects/structseq.c: Implemented new structseq representation. The
  patch makes structseqs (e.g. the return value of os.stat) more
  readable.

- Patch #1700288: added a type attribute cache that caches method
  accesses, resulting in speedups in heavily object-oriented code.

- Bug #1776: __import__() no longer accepts filenames on any platform.
  The first parameter to __import__() must be a valid module name.

- Patch #1668: renamed THREADDEBUG envvar to PYTHONTHREADDEBUG.

- Patch #602345: Add -B command line option, PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE
  envvar and sys.dont_write_bytecode attribute. All these can be set
  to forbid Python to attempt to write compiled bytecode files.

- Improve some exception messages when Windows fails to load an
  extension module. Now we get for example '%1 is not a valid Win32
  application' instead of 'error code 193'.

- Bug #1481296: Fixed long(float('nan')) != 0L.

- Issue #1640: Added math.isinf(x), math.isnan(x) and math.copysign(x,
  y) functions.

- Issue #1635: Platform independent creation and representation of NaN
  and INF. float("nan"), float("inf") and float("-inf") now work on
  every platform with IEEE 754 semantics.

- Compiler now generates simpler and faster code for dictionary
  literals.  The oparg for BUILD_MAP now indicates an estimated
  dictionary size.  There is a new opcode, STORE_MAP, for adding
  entries to the dictionary.

- Issue #1638: %zd configure test fails on Linux.

- Issue #1620: New property decorator syntax was modifying the
  decorator in place instead of creating a new decorator object.

- Issue #1538: Avoid copying string in split/rsplit if the split char
  is not found.

- Issue #1553: An erroneous __length_hint__ can make list() raise a
  SystemError.

- PEP 366: Allow explicit relative imports when executing modules
  inside packages with the -m switch via a new module level
  __package__ attribute.

- Issue #1402: Fix a crash on exit, when another thread is still
  running, and if the deallocation of its frames somehow calls the
  PyGILState_Ensure() / PyGILState_Release() functions.

- Expose the Py_Py3kWarningFlag as sys.py3kwarning.

- Issue #1445: Fix a SystemError when accessing the ``cell_contents``
  attribute of an empty cell object.

- Issue #1460: The utf-7 incremental decoder did not accept truncated
  input.  It now correctly saves its state between chunks of data.

- Patch #1739468: Directories and zipfiles containing a __main__.py
  file can now be directly executed by passing their name to the
  interpreter. The directory/zipfile is automatically inserted as the
  first entry in sys.path.

- Issue #1265: Fix a problem with sys.settrace, if the tracing
  function uses a generator expression when at the same time the
  executed code is closing a paused generator.

- sets and frozensets now have an isdisjoint() method.

- optimize the performance of builtin.sum().

- Fix warnings found by the new version of the Coverity checker.

- The enumerate() built-in function is no longer bounded to sequences
  smaller than LONG_MAX.  Formerly, it raised an OverflowError.  Now,
  automatically shifts from ints to longs.

- Issue #1686386: Tuple's tp_repr did not take into account the
  possibility of having a self-referential tuple, which is possible
  from C code.  Nor did object's tp_str consider that a type's tp_str
  could do something that could lead to an inifinite recursion.
  Py_ReprEnter() and Py_EnterRecursiveCall(), respectively, fixed the
  issues.

- Issue #1164: It was possible to trigger deadlock when using the
  'print' statement to write to a file since the GIL was not released
  as needed.  Now PyObject_Print() does the right thing along with
  various tp_print implementations of the built-in types and those in
  the collections module.

- Issue #1147: Exceptions were directly allowing string exceptions in
  their throw() method even though string exceptions no longer
  allowed.

- Issue #1096: Prevent a segfault from getting the repr of a very
  deeply nested list by using the recursion counter.

- Issue #1202533: Fix infinite recursion calls triggered by calls to
  PyObject_Call() never calling back out to Python code to trigger
  recursion depth updates/checks.  Required the creation of a static
  RuntimeError instance in case normalizing an exception put the
  recursion check value past its limit.  Fixes crashers
  infinite_rec_(1|2|4|5).py.

- Patch #1031213: Decode source line in SyntaxErrors back to its
  original source encoding.

- Patch #1673759: add a missing overflow check when formatting floats
  with %G.

  segfault when a large width is passed on 32-bit platforms.

- Issue #1733488: Fix compilation of bufferobject.c on AIX.

- Issue #1722485: remove docstrings again when running with -OO.

- Add new attribute names for function objects.  All the func_* become
  __*__ attributes.  (Some already existed, e.g., __doc__ and
  __name__.)

- Add -3 option to the interpreter to warn about features that are
  deprecated and will be changed/removed in Python 3.0.

- Patch #1686487: you can now pass any mapping after '**' in function
  calls.

- except clauses may now be spelled either "except E, target:" or
  "except E as target:". This is to provide forwards compatibility
  with Python 3.0.

- Deprecate BaseException.message as per PEP 352.

- Issue #1303614: don't expose object's __dict__ when the dict is
  inherited from a built-in base.

- When __slots__ are set to a unicode string, make it work the same as
  setting a plain string, ie don't expand to single letter identifiers.

- Request #1191699:  Slices can now be pickled.

- Request #1193128:  str.translate() now allows a None argument for
  translations that only remove characters without re-mapping the
  remaining characters.

- Patch #1682205: a TypeError while unpacking an iterable is no longer
  masked by a generic one with the message "unpack non-sequence".

- Remove unused file Python/fmod.c.

- Bug #1683368: The object.__init__() and object.__new__() methods are
  now stricter in rejecting excess arguments.  The only time when
  either allows excess arguments is when it is not overridden and the
  other one is.  For backwards compatibility, when both are
  overridden, it is a deprecation warning (for now; maybe a Py3k
  warning later).  Also, type.__init__() insists on the same signature
  as supported by type.__new__().

- Patch #1675423: PyComplex_AsCComplex() now tries to convert an
  object to complex using its __complex__() method before falling back
  to the __float__() method. Therefore, the functions in the cmath
  module now can operate on objects that define a __complex__()
  method.

- Patch #1623563: allow __class__ assignment for classes with
  __slots__.  The old and the new class are still required to have the
  same slot names.

- Patch #1642547: Fix an error/crash when encountering syntax errors
  in complex if statements.

- Patch #1462488: Python no longer segfaults when
  ``object.__reduce_ex__()`` is called with an object that is faking
  its type.

- Patch #1680015: Don't modify __slots__ tuple if it contains an
  unicode name.

- Patch #1444529: the builtin compile() now accepts keyword arguments.

- Bug #1678647: write a newline after printing an exception in any
  case, even when converting the value to a string failed.

- The dir() function has been extended to call the __dir__() method on
  its argument, if it exists. If not, it will work like before. This
  allows customizing the output of dir() in the presence of a
  __getattr__().

- Patch #922167: Python no longer segfaults when faced with infinitely
  self-recursive reload() calls (as reported by bug #742342).

- Patch #1675981: remove unreachable code from ``type.__new__()``
  method.

- Patch #1491866: change the complex() constructor to allow
  parthensized forms. This means complex(repr(x)) now works instead of
  raising a ValueError.

- Patch #703779: unset __file__ in __main__ after running a file. This
  makes the filenames the warning module prints much more sensible
  when a PYTHONSTARTUP file is used.

- Variant of patch #697613: don't exit the interpreter on a SystemExit
  exception if the -i command line option or PYTHONINSPECT environment
  variable is given, but break into the interactive interpreter just
  like on other exceptions or normal program exit.

- Patch #1638879: don't accept strings with embedded NUL bytes in
  long().

- Bug #1674503: close the file opened by execfile() in an error
  condition.

- Patch #1674228: when assigning a slice (old-style), check for the
  sq_ass_slice instead of the sq_slice slot.

- When printing an unraisable error, don't print exceptions. before
  the name.  This duplicates the behavior whening normally printing
  exceptions.

- Bug #1653736: Properly discard third argument to
  slot_nb_inplace_power.

- PEP 352: Raising a string exception now triggers a TypeError.
  Attempting to catch a string exception raises DeprecationWarning.

- Bug #1377858: Fix the segfaulting of the interpreter when an object
  created a weakref on itself during a __del__ call for new-style
  classes (classic classes still have the bug).

- Bug #1579370: Make PyTraceBack_Here use the current thread, not the
  frame's thread state.

- patch #1630975: Fix crash when replacing sys.stdout in
  sitecustomize.py.

- Prevent seg fault on shutdown which could occur if an object raised
  a warning.

- Bug #1566280: Explicitly invoke threading._shutdown from Py_Main, to
  avoid relying on atexit.

- Bug #1590891: random.randrange don't return correct value for big
  number.

- Patch #1586791: Better exception messages for some operations on
  strings, tuples and lists.

- Bug #1067760: Deprecate passing floats to file.seek.

- Bug #1591996: Correctly forward exception in instance_contains().

- Bug #1588287: fix invalid assertion for `1,2` in debug builds.

- Bug #1576657: when setting a KeyError for a tuple key, make sure
  that the tuple isn't used as the "exception arguments tuple".

  if the assigned value for structmember fields gets truncated.

- Update the peephole optimizer to remove more dead code (jumps after
  returns) and inline unconditional jumps to returns.

- Bug #1545497: when given an explicit base, int() did ignore NULs
  embedded in the string to convert.

- Bug #1569998: break inside a try statement (outside a loop) is now
  recognized and rejected.

- list.pop(x) accepts any object x following the __index__ protocol.

- A number of places, including integer negation and absolute value,
  were fixed to not rely on undefined behaviour of the C compiler
  anymore.

- Bug #1566800: make sure that EnvironmentError can be called with any
  number of arguments, as was the case in Python 2.4.

- Patch #1567691: super() and new.instancemethod() now don't accept
  keyword arguments any more (previously they accepted them, but
  didn't use them).

- Fix a bug in the parser's future statement handling that led to
  "with" not being recognized as a keyword after, e.g., this
  statement: from __future__ import division, with_statement

- Bug #1557232: fix seg fault with def f((((x)))) and def f(((x),)).

- Fix %zd string formatting on Mac OS X so it prints negative numbers.

- Allow exception instances to be directly sliced again.

- Bug #1551432: Exceptions do not define an explicit __unicode__
  method.  This allows calling unicode() on exceptions classes
  directly to succeed.

- Bug #1542051: Exceptions now correctly call PyObject_GC_UnTrack.
  Also make sure that every exception class has __module__ set to
  'exceptions'.

- Bug #1550983: emit better error messages for erroneous relative
  imports (if not in package and if beyond toplevel package).

- Overflow checking code in integer division ran afoul of new gcc
  optimizations.  Changed to be more standard-conforming.

- Patch #1542451: disallow continue anywhere under a finally.

- Patch #1546288: fix seg fault in dict_equal due to ref counting bug.

- The return tuple from str.rpartition(sep) is (tail, sep, head) where
  head is the original string if sep was not found.

- Bug #1520864: unpacking singleton tuples in list comprehensions and
  generator expressions (x for x, in ... ) works again.  Fixing this
  problem required changing the .pyc magic number.  This means that
  .pyc files generated before 2.5c2 will be regenerated.

- ``with`` and ``as`` are now keywords.

- Bug #1664966: Fix crash in exec if Unicode filename can't be
  decoded.

- Issue #1537: Changed GeneratorExit's base class from Exception to
  BaseException.

- Issue #1703448: A joined thread could show up in the
  threading.enumerate() list after the join() for a brief period until
  it actually exited.

  of an infinite recursion check.

- Removed plat-freebsd2 and plat-freebsd3 directories (and IN.py in
  the directories).

  (as opposed to the command line) will now write file names ending in
  ".cpp" too.

- As specified in RFC 2616, an HTTP response like 2xx indicates that

  work started with create_connection() and timeout in httplib, and
  closes patch #723312.

- Patch #1676823: Added create_connection() to socket.py, which may be
  called with a timeout, and use it from httplib (whose HTTPConnection

  to strings for the code to time and the setup code. Also added two
  convenience functions for instantiating a Timer and calling its

- Bug #1115886: os.path.splitext('.cshrc') gives now ('.cshrc', '').

- unittest now verifies more of its assumptions. In particular,
  TestCase and TestSuite subclasses (not instances) are no longer
  accepted in TestSuite.addTest(). This should cause no
  incompatibility since it never made sense with ordinary subclasses
  -- the failure just occurred later, with a more cumbersome
  exception.

  SMTP.ehlo_or_helo_if_needed() method.  Patch contributed by Bill
  Fenner.

  time so that opening a database previously created with the DB_DUP
  or DB_DUPSORT flag set will keep the proper behavior on subsequent
  opens.  Specifically: dictionary assignment to a DB object will
  replace all values for a given key when the database allows
  duplicate values.  DB users should use DB.put(k, v) when they want
  to store duplicates; not DB[k] = v.

- Add the bsddb.db.DBEnv.lock_id_free method.

- Bug #1686475: Support stat'ing open files on Windows again.

- Patch #1185447: binascii.b2a_qp() now correctly quotes binary

-----

- Refactor test_logging to use unittest.

- Refactor test_profile and test_cprofile to use the same code to
  profile.

  module being tested.  Was causing an error by __import__ doing a
  reload on the second run and thus suppressing bytecode recreation.

- Capture socket connection resets and timeouts in test_socket_ssl and
  test_urllib2net and raise test.test_support.ResourceDenied.

- Patch #1559413: Fix test_cmd_line if sys.executable contains a
  space.

  to surround calls to resources that are not guaranteed to work even
  if test.test_support.requires says that the resource should exist.

- Added a test for slicing of an exception.

- Added test.test_support.EnvironmentVarGuard.  It's a class that
  provides a context manager so that one can temporarily set or unset
  environment variables.

- Added some tests for modulefinder.

- Converted test_imp to use unittest.

- Fix bsddb test_basics.test06_Transactions to check the version
  number properly.

- test.test_support.catch_warning is a new context manager that can be
  used to catch the warnings issued by the warning framework.

Tools
-----

- Tools/scripts/reindent.py now creates the backup file using
  shutil.copy to preserve user/group and permissions. Added also a
  --nobackup option to not create the backup if the user is concerned
  regarding this.  Check issue #1050828 for more details.

- Tools/scripts/win_add2path.py was added. The simple script modifes
  the PATH environment var of the HKCU tree and adds the python bin
  and script directory.

- Tools/18n/pygettext.py was added to the list of scripts installed by
  Tools/scripts/setup.py (tracker item 642309).

- Added IronPython and Jython support to pybench (part of which was
  patch #1563844).

- Made some minor changes to pybench output to allow the user to see
  which Python version is running pybench.

- Added support for the new platform module feature
  platform.python_implementation(); this will now be saved in the
  benchmark pickle.

  file not to get reported properly.

Build
-----

- Have the search path for building extensions follow the declared

  2005 based on the VS 2008 build directory to PC/VS8.0. The script
  PCbuild/vs8to9.py was added to sync changes from PCbuild to
  PC/VS8.0.

- Moved PCbuild/ directory for VS 2003 to PC/VS7.1 and renamed
  PCBuild9/ directory to PCBuild/.

  platform.

- Bug #1655392: don't add -L/usr/lib/pythonX.Y/config to the LDFLAGS
  returned by python-config if Python was built with --enable-shared
  because that prevented the shared library from being used.

- Patch #1569798: fix a bug in distutils when building Python from a

- Fix build failure on kfreebsd and on the hurd.

- Fix the build of the library reference in info format.

- Allow Emacs 22 for building the documentation in info format.

- Makefile.pre.in(buildbottest): Run an optional script
  pybuildbot.identify to include some information about the build
  environment.

C API
-----

- Unified naming convention for free lists and their limits. All free
  lists in Object/ are named ``free_list``, the counter ``numfree``
  and the upper limit is a macro ``PyName_MAXFREELIST`` inside an
  #ifndef block.

- ``PySet_Add()`` can now modify a newly created frozenset.  Similarly
  to ``PyTuple_SetItem``, it can be used to populate a brand new
  frozenset; but it does not steal a reference to the added item.

- Added ``PySet_Check()`` and ``PyFrozenSet_Check()`` to the set API.

- Backport of PyUnicode_FromString(), _FromStringAndSize(), _Format
  and _FormatV from Python 3.0. Made PyLong_AsSsize_t and
  PyLong_FromSsize_t public functions.

- Patch #1720595: add T_BOOL to the range of structmember types.

- Issue #1534: Added ``PyFloat_GetMax()``, ``PyFloat_GetMin()`` and
  ``PyFloat_GetInfo()`` to the float API.

- Issue #1521: On 64bit platforms, using PyArgs_ParseTuple with the t#
  of w# format code incorrectly truncated the length to an int, even
  when PY_SSIZE_T_CLEAN is set.  The str.decode method used to return
  incorrect results with huge strings.

- Issue #1629: Renamed Py_Size, Py_Type and Py_Refcnt to Py_SIZE,
  Py_TYPE and Py_REFCNT.

- PEP 3123: Provide forward compatibility with Python 3.0, while
  keeping backwards compatibility. Add Py_Refcnt, Py_Type, Py_Size,
  and PyVarObject_HEAD_INIT.

- Py_ssize_t fields work in structmember when HAVE_LONG_LONG is not
  defined.

- Patch #1733960: Allow T_LONGLONG to accept ints.

- T_PYSSIZET can now be used in PyMemberDef lists for Py_ssize_t members.

- Added a new API function ``PyImport_ImportModuleNoBlock``.

- Bug #1637022: Prefix AST symbols with _Py_.

- Fix some leftovers from the conversion from int to Py_ssize_t
  (relevant to strings and sequences of more than 2**31 items).

- Make _PyGILState_NoteThreadState() static, it was not used anywhere
  outside of pystate.c and should not be necessary.

- ``PyImport_Import`` and ``PyImport_ImportModule`` now always do
  absolute imports. In earlier versions they might have used relative
  imports under some conditions.

- Added case insensitive comparison methods ``PyOS_stricmp(char*,
  char*)`` and ``PyOS_strnicmp(char*, char*, Py_ssize_t)``.

- Bug #1542693: remove semi-colon at end of PyImport_ImportModuleEx
  macro so it can be used as an expression.

Windows
-------

- Patch #1706: Drop support for Win9x, WinME and NT4. Python now
  requires Windows 2000 or greater. The _WINVER and NTDDI_VERSION
  macros are set to Win2k for x86/32bit builds and WinXP for AMD64
  builds.

- Conditionalize definition of _CRT_SECURE_NO_DEPRECATE and
  _CRT_NONSTDC_NO_DEPRECATE.

- Bug #1216: Restore support for Visual Studio 2002.

Mac
---

- cfmfile now raises a DeprecationWarning.

- buildtools now raises a DeprecationWarning.

- Removed the macfs module.  It had been deprecated since Python 2.5.
  This lead to the deprecation of macostools.touched() as it relied
  solely on macfs and was a no-op under OS X.

# USN-1592-1: Python 2.7 vulnerabilities

2 October 2012

Several security issues were fixed in Python 2.7.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 11.10](/security/notices?release=oneiric)
* [Ubuntu 11.04](/security/notices?release=natty)

## Packages

* [python2.7](/security/cves?package=python2.7) - An interactive high-level object-oriented language (version 2.7)

## Details

Niels Heinen discovered that the urllib and urllib2 modules would process

Location headers that specify a redirection to file: URLs. A remote

attacker could exploit this to obtain sensitive information or cause a

denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 11.04. ([CVE-2011-1521](/security/CVE-2011-1521))

It was discovered that SimpleHTTPServer did not use a charset parameter in

the Content-Type HTTP header. An attacker could potentially exploit this

to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks against Internet Explorer 7

users. This issue only affected Ubuntu 11.04. ([CVE-2011-4940](/security/CVE-2011-4940))

It was discovered that Python distutils contained a race condition when

creating the ~/.pypirc file. A local attacker could exploit this to obtain

sensitive information. ([CVE-2011-4944](/security/CVE-2011-4944))

It was discovered that SimpleXMLRPCServer did not properly validate its

input when handling HTTP POST requests. A remote attacker could exploit

this to cause a denial of service via excessive CPU utilization.

([CVE-2012-0845](/security/CVE-2012-0845))

It was discovered that Python was susceptible to hash algorithm attacks.

An attacker could cause a denial of service under certian circumstances.

This update adds the '-R' command line option and honors setting the

PYTHONHASHSEED environment variable to 'random' to salt str and datetime

objects with an unpredictable value. ([CVE-2012-1150](/security/CVE-2012-1150))

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
