Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-1521:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of `ftp://` and `file://` URL schemes by the Python `urllib` and `urllib2` libraries during redirection. Specifically, a web server could redirect a `urllib` request to any of the supported schemes, not just HTTP, HTTPS, or FTP, leading to potential security issues.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Unrestricted URL Redirection:** The `urllib` and `urllib2` libraries did not properly restrict the URL schemes that they would follow during an HTTP redirect. They would process `Location` headers with `ftp://` and `file://` schemes, which is not a typical practice for browsers and carries security risks.
- **Lack of Input Validation**: The libraries lacked input validation for redirection URLs, allowing schemes other than HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP to be processed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** A remote attacker could redirect a Python web application to `file:///etc/passwd` (or a similar local file) to disclose sensitive information.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker could redirect an application to a system device like `file:///dev/zero`, causing excessive CPU, memory, or disk usage.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP Redirect:** A remote attacker controls a malicious web server or an attacker-in-the-middle position intercepts a normal web request and injects a crafted HTTP 302 redirect response with a `Location` header containing a malicious `ftp://` or `file://` URL.
- **`urllib` and `urllib2` Usage:** A Python web application using the vulnerable `urllib` or `urllib2` to fetch and process URLs is a target. The application unknowingly processes the malicious redirect.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP responses to a vulnerable application, either by controlling the server the application is fetching data from or by being in a privileged network position to perform a man-in-the-middle attack.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs knowledge of this specific vulnerability in Python's `urllib` and `urllib2`.
- **No user interaction is required** for the exploitation of this vulnerability.

**Additional Details (Beyond the CVE Description):**

- **Affected versions**: Python 2.4.6, 2.6.5 and likely all other versions.
- The fix involves modifying the `HTTPRedirectHandler` to only process Location headers for http, https, and ftp protocols.
- The issue was first reported by Niels Heinen from the Google Security Team.
- Patches were applied to Python 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 3.1, 3.2, and the default (3.x) branches.
- The fix includes adding tests for the vulnerability.
- It also includes a change to return an HTTPError when an invalid URL is encountered, rather than silently failing.
