Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-1896:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by the Microsoft Forefront Unified Access Gateway (UAG) not properly sanitizing user-controlled input. Specifically, it fails to properly handle script in a specially crafted request. This allows the injection of malicious JavaScript content.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The vulnerability is a reflected XSS, where malicious script injected in a request is reflected back to the user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Elevation of Privilege: An attacker could read content they are not authorized to read.
- Information Disclosure: The attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive information.
- Malicious Content Injection: The attacker can inject malicious JavaScript that executes in the context of the user's browser, allowing them to perform actions on behalf of the user. This can include activities like reading data, tampering with the user's session or injecting additional malicious content.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Crafted URL: An attacker crafts a malicious URL containing JavaScript that targets a vulnerable endpoint on the UAG server.
- User Interaction: The attacker must persuade a UAG user to click on the specially crafted URL. This can be achieved via:
  - Email: Sending the malicious URL in an email and convincing the user to click it.
  - Web-Based Attacks: Hosting the malicious URL on a website, or compromising a site, and tricking the user into visiting the page and clicking the link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not require any special privileges or access to the UAG server.
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL containing the malicious script.
- The attacker needs to convince an authorized UAG user to visit the specially crafted URL via email or a website.
- No network-level access or direct access to the UAG server is needed. The attack is triggered through a user's web browser.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is part of a set of vulnerabilities addressed by Microsoft Security Bulletin MS11-079.
- The bulletin includes details on other vulnerabilities, such as CVE-2011-1895, CVE-2011-1897, CVE-2011-1969, and CVE-2011-2012.
- The provided information also mentions that Tenable Network Security reported the vulnerability.
- The fix for this vulnerability involves modifying how UAG handles specially crafted requests, preventing the reflection of malicious script back to the user's browser.
- There are no workarounds for this vulnerability; users must apply the security update.
