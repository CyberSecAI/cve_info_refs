Based on the provided documents, here's the breakdown of CVE-2011-1871:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the Windows TCP/IP stack's improper handling of a sequence of specially crafted Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) messages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  Improper processing of ICMP messages by the TCP/IP stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit could cause the target system to stop responding and automatically restart, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A remote, unauthenticated attacker can send a sequence of specially crafted ICMP messages to a target system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker can be remote and does not need authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
- They must be capable of crafting and sending specific ICMP message sequences.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects the `Tcpip.sys` component.
- While a workaround involves blocking ICMP at the firewall, this can negatively impact network performance by preventing TCP from optimizing network communication.
- Microsoft's Exploitability Index rated this vulnerability as "Exploitation More Likely" (1).
- The security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying the way that the Windows TCP/IP stack processes ICMP messages.
- This vulnerability was not publicly disclosed or exploited before the security update was released.
