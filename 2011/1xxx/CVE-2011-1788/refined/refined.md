- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The SOAP session ID can be retrieved by any user that is logged in to vCenter Server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Disclosure of the SOAP session ID.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local unprivileged user on vCenter Server could elevate their privileges by using the disclosed SOAP session ID.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access to the vCenter server is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be a logged in user on the vCenter server.
