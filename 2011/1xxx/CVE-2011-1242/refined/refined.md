  "CVE-2011-1242": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "A use-after-free vulnerability exists in Windows Kernel-Mode drivers due to improper management of kernel-mode driver objects. An attacker with local access and valid credentials can exploit this to run arbitrary code in kernel mode, potentially gaining full control of the system.",
    "root_cause": "Improper management of kernel-mode driver objects in Windows Kernel-Mode drivers leads to a use-after-free vulnerability.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Use-after-free"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to run arbitrary code in kernel mode, leading to a complete compromise of the system. This includes the ability to install programs, view, change, or delete data, and create new accounts with full administrative rights.",
    "attack_vectors": "Local access is required. An attacker must log on to the system and then run a specially crafted application to exploit the vulnerability.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs valid logon credentials and the ability to log on locally to the system.",
