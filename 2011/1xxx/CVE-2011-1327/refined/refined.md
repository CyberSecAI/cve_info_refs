**CVE ID:** CVE-2011-1327

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the key input encryption function of Trend Micro's Virus Buster 2009. It appears that the encryption mechanism employed for password input within web browsers was flawed, resulting in incomplete encryption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- If a keylogger is present on the system, it can intercept the user's keystrokes. Due to the incomplete encryption, some portion of the password input may be exposed in plaintext to the keylogger. This could potentially lead to unauthorized access to user accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A local attacker with a keylogger installed on a victim's system can exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to install and operate a keylogger on the target system running the vulnerable version of Virus Buster 2009.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is specific to Virus Buster 2009.
- Trend Micro has stated that Virus Buster 2010 and later versions are not affected by this vulnerability.
- The provided information suggests that an update to Virus Buster 2010 or 2011 is the recommended solution.
