  "vulnerability_details": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Lotus Domino Server Controller. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.  The flaw exists within the remote console functionality which listens by default on TCP port 2050. When handling A user authentication the server uses a user supplied COOKIEFILE path to retrieve stored credentials. The application then compares this data against the user provided username and cookie. The path to the COOKIEFILE can be a UNC path allowing the attacker to control both the known good credentials and the challenge credentials. A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of the SYSTEM user.",
  "root_cause": "The application uses a user-supplied COOKIEFILE path to retrieve stored credentials for user authentication. The path can be a UNC path, allowing an attacker to control both the known good credentials and challenge credentials.",
  "weaknesses": [
    "Insecure handling of user-supplied COOKIEFILE path",
    "Lack of proper authentication mechanisms for the remote console functionality",
     "Use of a user-controlled path to fetch credentials"

  "required_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to send network requests to the vulnerable service on port 2050. No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability."
