## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A1201)

## Topic

Updated tetex packages that fix multiple security issues are now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

teTeX is an implementation of TeX. TeX takes a text file and a set of
formatting commands as input, and creates a typesetter-independent DeVice
Independent (DVI) file as output.

teTeX embeds a copy of t1lib to rasterize bitmaps from PostScript Type 1
fonts. The following issues affect t1lib code:

Two heap-based buffer overflow flaws were found in the way t1lib processed
Adobe Font Metrics (AFM) files. If a specially-crafted font file was opened
by teTeX, it could cause teTeX to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user running teTeX. (CVE-2010-2642,
CVE-2011-0433)

An invalid pointer dereference flaw was found in t1lib. A specially-crafted
font file could, when opened, cause teTeX to crash or, potentially, execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running teTeX.
(CVE-2011-0764)

A use-after-free flaw was found in t1lib. A specially-crafted font file
could, when opened, cause teTeX to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user running teTeX. (CVE-2011-1553)

An off-by-one flaw was found in t1lib. A specially-crafted font file could,
when opened, cause teTeX to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code
with the privileges of the user running teTeX. (CVE-2011-1554)

An out-of-bounds memory read flaw was found in t1lib. A specially-crafted
font file could, when opened, cause teTeX to crash. (CVE-2011-1552)

teTeX embeds a copy of Xpdf, an open source Portable Document Format (PDF)
file viewer, to allow adding images in PDF format to the generated PDF
documents. The following issues affect Xpdf code:

An uninitialized pointer use flaw was discovered in Xpdf. If pdflatex was
used to process a TeX document referencing a specially-crafted PDF file, it
could cause pdflatex to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with
the privileges of the user running pdflatex. (CVE-2010-3702)

An array index error was found in the way Xpdf parsed PostScript Type 1
fonts embedded in PDF documents. If pdflatex was used to process a TeX
document referencing a specially-crafted PDF file, it could cause pdflatex
to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
user running pdflatex. (CVE-2010-3704)

Red Hat would like to thank the Evince development team for reporting
CVE-2010-2642. Upstream acknowledges Jon Larimer of IBM X-Force as the
original reporter of CVE-2010-2642.

All users of tetex are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Foolabs Xpdf contains a denial of service vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#376500

Original Release Date: 2011-03-21 | Last Revised: 2011-04-05

---

### Overview

Foolabs Xpdf contains a denial of service vulnerability caused by the t1lib library incorrectly parsing Type 1 fonts.

### Description

| According to [Foolabs](http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/about.html): *Xpdf is an open source viewer for Portable Document Format (PDF) files. (These are sometimes also called 'Acrobat' files, from the name of Adobe's PDF software.) The Xpdf project also includes a PDF text extractor, PDF-to-PostScript converter, and various other utilities.* Foolabs Xpdf contains a denial of service vulnerability caused by the t1lib library incorrectly parsing Type 1 fonts. This vulnerability may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker can cause the device to crash and may be able to execute arbitrary code. |
| --- |

### Solution

| The vendor has stated they will stop using t1lib in their product and users should build Xpdf without t1lib.  *To build Xpdf without t1lib, add the "--with-t1-library=no" flag to the**configure command:**./configure --with-t1-library=no .....**To double-check, run "xpdf --help". The "-freetype" option should be**listed, and the "-t1lib" option should NOT be listed. That indicates**that Xpdf was built with FreeType and without t1lib.**With this setting, Xpdf will use FreeType instead of t1lib to rasterize**Type 1 fonts. With recent versions of FreeType, the Type 1 quality is**as good or better than t1lib, so this should not present any problems.* |

### Vendor Statement

The vendor has stated they will stop using t1lib in their product and users should build Xpdf without t1lib.

*To build Xpdf without t1lib, add the "--with-t1-library=no" flag to the*
*configure command:*

*./configure --with-t1-library=no .....*

*To double-check, run "xpdf --help". The "-freetype" option should be*
*listed, and the "-t1lib" option should NOT be listed. That indicates*
*that Xpdf was built with FreeType and without t1lib.*

*With this setting, Xpdf will use FreeType instead of t1lib to rasterize*
*Type 1 fonts. With recent versions of FreeType, the Type 1 quality is*
*as good or better than t1lib, so this should not present any problems.*

- --[ Vulnerability Summary:
Date Published: 28/03/2011
Last Update: 28/03/2011
Advisory ID: TSSA-2011-01
CVE Name: CVE-2011-0764 (previously known as VU#376500)
Title: xpdf : multiple vulnerabilities in t1lib
Remotely Exploitable: Yes
Locally Exploitable: No
Impact: Arbitrary code execution
Advisory URL: http://www.toucan-system.com/advisories/tssa-2011-01.txt
- --[ Introduction:
Following 3 paragraphs taken from the vendors' documentation:
Xpdf is an open source viewer for Portable Document Format (PDF)
files. (These are also sometimes also called 'Acrobat' files, from
the name of Adobe's PDF software.) The Xpdf project also includes a
PDF text extractor, PDF-to-PostScript converter, and various other
utilities.
Xpdf runs under the X Window System on UNIX, VMS, and OS/2. The non-X
components (pdftops, pdftotext, etc.) also run on Win32 systems and
should run on pretty much any system with a decent C++ compiler.
Xpdf is designed to be small and efficient. It can use Type 1 or
TrueType fonts.
- --[ Synopsis:
The linux version of xpdf is linked against t1lib, which is vulnerable
to multiple vulnerabilities including off by ones, integer overflows
and heap corruptions. At least one of those is exploitable and allows
arbitrary code to be executed on the target machine when opening a
specially crafted pdf file.
- --[ Vulnerabilities overview:
When parsing specially crafted Type 1 fonts, the t1lib library
is subject to several memory corruption vulnerabilities. We will
exemplify only a few of them : t1lib being decomissioned by xpdf
anyways, it will probably never get fixed.
[\*] Invalid memory reads (off by few):
The following valgrind trace exemplifies an invalid read from
t1lib:
==24009== Invalid read of size 8
==24009== at 0x406364A: ??? (in /usr/lib/libt1.so.5.1.2)
==24009== by 0x4068A0D: ??? (in /usr/lib/libt1.so.5.1.2)

==24009== by 0x8062589: ??? (in /usr/bin/xpdf.bin)
==24009== by 0x80A690A: ??? (in /usr/bin/xpdf.bin)
==24009== by 0x80AB754: ??? (in /usr/bin/xpdf.bin)
==24009== by 0x80ACF46: ??? (in /usr/bin/xpdf.bin)
==24009== by 0x80E23D6: ??? (in /usr/bin/xpdf.bin)

==24009== by 0x80DEB0F: ??? (in /usr/bin/xpdf.bin)

==24009== by 0x458DB55: (below main) (libc-start.c:220)
Note: This given vulnerability cannot execute arbitrary code :
it only allows a remote denial of service of the xpdf reader.
[\*] Invalid memory writes:
In the same fashion, the following trace exemplifies an invalid
memory write, dur to a use after free():
==23165== Invalid write of size 2

In fact, there is an off by one in t1lib responsible for the wrong
reading
of 4 null bytes from a mapped (t1lib's data) location at:
=> 0x4005f348: mov DWORD PTR [ebx+0x32b8],eax
Later on, this memory location is used to initialize eax with the value
of a (wrong) function pointer :
=> 0x4005f86a: imul eax,DWORD PTR [ebx+0x32b8],0x68
(at this point, eax will be NULL).
Then a fixed offset is substrated to eax (0 here), resulting in the
integer
overflow by wrap around:
=> 0x4005f885: sub eax,0xd0
(eax now worhes 0 - 0xd = 0xffffff30)
This pointer is finally used in floating point arithmetic to read a
pointer
into the FPU stack from an unmapped location, resulting in an
unvalid pointer
dereference and in fine in a segmentation fault:
Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.

--[ Instruction:

By having ecx point 0x28 bytes to a location in the heap and
dereferencing a
pointer to this very same location, an attacker can execute
arbitrary shellcode,
hence performing arbitrary remote code execution on the target
machine uppon
opening of a given pdf file.
Reliability considerations: this particular bug is dependant on an
invalid
pointer dereferencing null data from a valid memory region. In order for
this to be performed without resulting in a segmentation fault, the
t1lib
library must read from a region wich is actually mapped, which
empirically
occures with a probability of around 10% of the cases on a machine
with ASLR
enabled.
- --[ Mitigation:
Instead of fixing the Type 1 library, the xpdf team has decided to
end support for this library and encourages to link xpdf against the
truetype library only. Versions starting with 3.02pl6 will therefor
deprecate the use of t1lib completely.
When compiling older versions manually, the CERT offers the following
compilation options, which mitigate the vulnerability by not linking
xpdf against the Type 1 library:
To build Xpdf without t1lib, add the "--with-t1-library=no" flag to the
configure command:
./configure --with-t1-library=no .....
To double-check, run "xpdf --help". The "-freetype" option should be
listed, and the "-t1lib" option should NOT be listed. That indicates
that Xpdf was built with FreeType and without t1lib.
With this setting, Xpdf will use FreeType instead of t1lib to rasterize
Type 1 fonts. With recent versions of FreeType, the Type 1 quality is
as good or better than t1lib, so this should not present any problems.
- --[ Vulnerable versions:
Vulnerable : Xpdf up to (including) version 3.02pl5.
Non vulnerable (non linked to t1lib) : Xpdf version 3.02pl6.
- --[ Disclosure timeline:
\* 05/01/2011: Contact Vendor and CERT, providing full description
and PoC samples to audit the issue.
\* 21/03/2011: The vendor releases a new version of the xpdf package,
decomissioning the t1lib entirely, hence mitigating the problem.
The CERT publishes a vulnerability note at the url:
http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/376500
\* 24/03/2011: The CERT assigns CVE number CVE-2011-0764 to this
vulnerability.

## Foolabs Xpdf contains a denial of service vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#376500

Original Release Date: 2011-03-21 | Last Revised: 2011-04-05

---

### Overview

Foolabs Xpdf contains a denial of service vulnerability caused by the t1lib library incorrectly parsing Type 1 fonts.

### Description

| According to [Foolabs](http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/about.html): *Xpdf is an open source viewer for Portable Document Format (PDF) files. (These are sometimes also called 'Acrobat' files, from the name of Adobe's PDF software.) The Xpdf project also includes a PDF text extractor, PDF-to-PostScript converter, and various other utilities.* Foolabs Xpdf contains a denial of service vulnerability caused by the t1lib library incorrectly parsing Type 1 fonts. This vulnerability may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker can cause the device to crash and may be able to execute arbitrary code. |
| --- |

### Solution

| The vendor has stated they will stop using t1lib in their product and users should build Xpdf without t1lib.  *To build Xpdf without t1lib, add the "--with-t1-library=no" flag to the**configure command:**./configure --with-t1-library=no .....**To double-check, run "xpdf --help". The "-freetype" option should be**listed, and the "-t1lib" option should NOT be listed. That indicates**that Xpdf was built with FreeType and without t1lib.**With this setting, Xpdf will use FreeType instead of t1lib to rasterize**Type 1 fonts. With recent versions of FreeType, the Type 1 quality is**as good or better than t1lib, so this should not present any problems.* |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

“We use MOABI to continually improve our Softwaree Development Life Cycle and check complex projects for flawlessness before they go into production. It’s a unique and useful product to have in your toolbox. The “0-days” function is real, as Moabi not only detects obvious flaws but goes deep into binaries to assess any potential flaws, then formalises a report with a clear description, with help for problem resolution. Finally, the support team is very responsive.”

“MOABI helped us achieve a unique synthesis to improve the quality of our software. I was very impressed by the level of detail and the different techniques used by MOABI in its scans, something I’ve never seen in other tools. Their support is of an excellent level of knowledge, is very available to discuss technical details and responds quickly to all our requests.”
