  "CVE-2011-1165": {
    "description": "The vino-preferences dialog box incorrectly indicated that Vino was only accessible from the local network. This could confuse a user into believing connections from external networks are not allowed (even when they are allowed). With this update, vino-preferences no longer displays connectivity and reachable information. There was no warning that Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) was used to open ports on a user's network router when the \"Configure network automatically to accept connections\" option was enabled (it is disabled by default) in the Vino preferences. This update changes the option's description to avoid the risk of a UPnP router configuration change without the user's consent.",
    "root_cause": "The Vino preferences dialog did not explicitly warn users about the use of UPnP to open ports, potentially leading to unintended exposure of their systems to the internet.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Lack of explicit warning about UPnP usage.",
      "Misleading description of network configuration options."
    ],
    "impact": "Users may unknowingly expose their systems to the internet by enabling the 'Configure network automatically' option, believing that it only allows local network access. This could result in unauthorized remote access to the user's desktop if no password and confirmation is set.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "User interface confusion",
        "Unintentional UPnP port forwarding"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "No specific attacker capabilities are required other than the ability to access the system's settings."
