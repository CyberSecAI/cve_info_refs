## Synopsis

Moderate: vino security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A0169)

## Topic

An updated vino package that fixes several security issues is now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Vino is a Virtual Network Computing (VNC) server for GNOME. It allows
remote users to connect to a running GNOME session using VNC.

It was found that Vino transmitted all clipboard activity on the system
running Vino to all clients connected to port 5900, even those who had not
authenticated. A remote attacker who is able to access port 5900 on a
system running Vino could use this flaw to read clipboard data without
authenticating. (CVE-2012-4429)

Two out-of-bounds memory read flaws were found in the way Vino processed
client framebuffer requests in certain encodings. An authenticated client
could use these flaws to send a specially-crafted request to Vino, causing
it to crash. (CVE-2011-0904, CVE-2011-0905)

In certain circumstances, the vino-preferences dialog box incorrectly
indicated that Vino was only accessible from the local network. This could
confuse a user into believing connections from external networks are not
allowed (even when they are allowed). With this update, vino-preferences no
longer displays connectivity and reachable information. (CVE-2011-1164)

There was no warning that Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) was used to open
ports on a user's network router when the "Configure network automatically
to accept connections" option was enabled (it is disabled by default) in
the Vino preferences. This update changes the option's description to avoid
the risk of a UPnP router configuration change without the user's consent.
(CVE-2011-1165)

All Vino users should upgrade to this updated package, which contains
backported patches to resolve these issues. The GNOME session must be
restarted (log out, then log back in) for this update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=678846#c0)  Robert Townley    2011-02-20 10:40:13 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 479752](attachment.cgi?id=479752 "Screenshot of what UPnP means.") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=479752&action=edit "Screenshot of what UPnP means.") Screenshot of what UPnP means.  Description of problem: System --->  Preferences --->  Remote Desktop does not sufficiently warn that UPnP is being used to open ports on your router.  When end user is testing, he very  well may disables confirmation and password.  Because there is no very explicit UPnP warning, he just unwittingly enabled anybody on the internet to connect to his desktop.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): vino 2.32.0-1.fc14   How reproducible: parts always, UPnP success at opening router port varies.  Sometimes, it successfully opens a port, other times it does not.   Steps to Reproduce: 1.System --> Preferences --> Remote Desktop 2.uncheck confirmation, uncheck password 3.check "Configure network to automatically accept connections."      Actual results: Changed router configuration without telling user.  Expose machine to internet usage with no password and no confirmation.  Expected results: Text should be more explicit that this uses UPnP.  The pop up message mentions UPnP, but it at least should be a red warning.  Especially when no confirmation and no password is required.     Additional info: All machines tested have multiple NICs.  selinux enabled.  iptables turned off.  It may take several attempts to open up ports on router using UPnP.  Not sure what happens upon reboot of workstation and router -- UPnP may work to open ports that were not open before.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=678846#c1)  Robert Townley    2011-02-20 10:51:20 UTC  ``` Discussion of Ubuntu user that was "hacked" when really the user interface was not explicit enough.   [http://www.dslreports.com/forum/r25446313-Ubuntu-computer-hijacked-by-hacker~start=40](http://www.dslreports.com/forum/r25446313-Ubuntu-computer-hijacked-by-hacker~start%3D40)  VNC does not have encryption.  I am glad to see that xrdp and is used in RHEL 6 because encryption can be built-in.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=678846#c2)  Vincent Danen    2011-03-23 16:35:49 UTC  ``` Upstream does not plan on correcting strings or documentation until GNOME 3.0 is completed.  The root of this problem is not how vino operates, but the feedback that vino provides when certain options are selected.  Statement:  This issue did not affect the version of vino as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 or 5 as they did not include support for Universal Plug and Play (UPnP).  A future update in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 may address this flaw.  To mitigate this issue, users should ensure that confirmation is requested on each inbound connection attempt, that a password is required to connect, and that automatic network configuration is disabled.  This will prevent vino from using UPnP to allow access to the VNC port, and will ensure that any connections require a password and that the user is notified on any connection attempts.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=678846#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-01-21 22:37:14 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2013:0169 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0169.html>   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=694455#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-04-07 12:48:12 UTC  ``` An out of bounds read flaw was found in the way vino, remote desktop system for GNOME processed certain framebuffer update requests from VNC client, when raw encoding was used. An attacker could use this flaw to send a specially-crafted request to vino, causing it to crash.  Upstream bug report: [1] <https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=641802>  Relevant upstream commits (for gnome-2-28, gnome-2-30, gnome-2-32, gnome-3-0 and master branches):  [2] <http://git.gnome.org/browse/vino/commit/?id=dff52694a384fe95195f2211254026b752d63ec4> [3] <http://git.gnome.org/browse/vino/commit/?id=0c2c9175963fc56bf2af10e42867181332f96ce0> [4] <http://git.gnome.org/browse/vino/commit/?id=e17bd4e369f90748654e31a4867211dc7610975d> [5] <http://git.gnome.org/browse/vino/commit/?id=456dadbb5c5971d3448763a44c05b9ad033e522f> [6] <http://git.gnome.org/browse/vino/commit/?id=8beefcf7792d343c10c919ee0c928c81f73b1279>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=694455#c4)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-04-07 13:14:49 UTC  ``` This issue affects the versions of the vino package, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5, and 6.

So this bug is about reading out of buffer, not about writing.   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=694455#c20)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-05-03 13:35:17 UTC  ``` Analysis from Petr Pisar (Red Hat libvncserver package maintainer) why various libvncserver package versions, as shipped within different products are not vulnerable to this flaw:   The libvncserver warning is produced in rfbserver.c:rfbProcessClientNormalMessage() when converting rectangle coordinates just after processing client packet of rfbFramebufferUpdateRequest type:      case rfbFramebufferUpdateRequest:         [...]         if ((n = rfbReadExact(cl, ((char *)&msg) + 1,                            sz_rfbFramebufferUpdateRequestMsg-1)) <= 0) {             [...]         }         [...]         /* The values come in based on the scaled screen, we need to convert          * them to values based on the main screen's coordinate system          */         if(!rectSwapIfLEAndClip(&msg.fur.x,&msg.fur.y,&msg.fur.w,&msg.fur.h,cl))         {                 rfbLog("Warning, ignoring rfbFramebufferUpdateRequest: "                     "%dXx%dY-%dWx%dH\n",                     msg.fur.x, msg.fur.y, msg.fur.w, msg.fur.h);                 return;         }         [...]  Not only the rectSwapIfLEAndClip() function converts values from network-order and scales the coordinates, it also clips requested rectangle (msg.fur members) to fit into server screen size:  rfbBool rectSwapIfLEAndClip(uint16_t* x,uint16_t* y,uint16_t* w,uint16_t* h,                 rfbClientPtr cl) {         /* Convert */         int x1=Swap16IfLE(*x);         int y1=Swap16IfLE(*y);         int w1=Swap16IfLE(*w);         int h1=Swap16IfLE(*h);          /* Scale */         rfbScaledCorrection(cl->scaledScreen, cl->screen, &x1, &y1, &w1, &h1,             "rectSwapIfLEAndClip");         *x = x1;         *y = y1;         *w = w1;         *h = h1;          /* Clip         rfbLog("Clipping: region(%uXx%uY-%uWx%uH) to screen(%dWx%dH)\n",                 *x, *y, *w, *h,                 cl->screen->width, cl->screen->height);         */         if(*w>cl->screen->width-*x)                 *w=cl->screen->width-*x;         /* possible underflow */         if(*w>cl->screen->width-*x)                 return FALSE;         if(*h>cl->screen->height-*y)                 *h=cl->screen->height-*y;         if(*h>cl->screen->height-*y)                 return FALSE;          return TRUE; }  And see the comment /* possible underflow */ (other comments added by me). It checks whether subtraction result fits into uint16_t. Otherwise it refuse the conversion and warning is printed and client request is refused. This is the output I get on server side with the Clipping log line:  Clipping: region(29696Xx32768Y-1Wx30975H) to screen(400Wx300H) Warning, ignoring rfbFramebufferUpdateRequest: 29696Xx32768Y-36240Wx30975H  The Cliping values correspond to the run_00108.input3 packet content: $ hexdump -C run_00108.input3 00000000  03 00 74 00 80 00 00 01  78 ff                    |..t.....x.|  03 00 is the request type probably 74 00 (29696) is X coordinate 80 00 (32768) is Y cooridnate 00 01 (1) is Width 78 ff (30975) is Height   Let's look on the clipping code closer and remember the *x and *w are uint16_t: if(*w>cl->screen->width-*x)         *w=cl->screen->width-*x; /* possible underflow */ if(*w>cl->screen->width-*x)         return FALSE;  If X fits into screen width, then substraction result is not negative and request width is clamped properly.  If X is out of screen width, then subtraction underruns and *W will be garbled (as can be seen in my output, 1W → 36240W), but still non-negative (because unsigned type). However subsequent underrun test will compare garbled non-negative value to negative subtraction result (the same as former one) resulting is true condition and causing `return FALSE'.  The same applies to vertical clipping.  Thus I conclude LIBVNCSERVER IS NOT VULNERABLE because it performs the range check on this place. One can see it's the same equation as in current patch:  +   /* Validate the rectangle given by the update packet. */ +   if (w + x > cl->scaledScreen->width || h + y > cl->scaledScreen->height) +       goto updateFailed;   -- Petr   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=694455#c21)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-05-03 16:12:27 UTC  ``` Created vino tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 701712](show_bug.cgi?id=701712 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2011-0904 CVE-2011-0905 vino various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=694455#c22)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-05-03 16:22:03 UTC  ``` Statement:  (none)   ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=694455#c25)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-01-21 22:37:20 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2013:0169 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0169.html>   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=678846#c0)  Robert Townley    2011-02-20 10:40:13 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 479752](attachment.cgi?id=479752 "Screenshot of what UPnP means.") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=479752&action=edit "Screenshot of what UPnP means.") Screenshot of what UPnP means.  Description of problem: System --->  Preferences --->  Remote Desktop does not sufficiently warn that UPnP is being used to open ports on your router.  When end user is testing, he very  well may disables confirmation and password.  Because there is no very explicit UPnP warning, he just unwittingly enabled anybody on the internet to connect to his desktop.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): vino 2.32.0-1.fc14   How reproducible: parts always, UPnP success at opening router port varies.  Sometimes, it successfully opens a port, other times it does not.   Steps to Reproduce: 1.System --> Preferences --> Remote Desktop 2.uncheck confirmation, uncheck password 3.check "Configure network to automatically accept connections."      Actual results: Changed router configuration without telling user.  Expose machine to internet usage with no password and no confirmation.  Expected results: Text should be more explicit that this uses UPnP.  The pop up message mentions UPnP, but it at least should be a red warning.  Especially when no confirmation and no password is required.     Additional info: All machines tested have multiple NICs.  selinux enabled.  iptables turned off.  It may take several attempts to open up ports on router using UPnP.  Not sure what happens upon reboot of workstation and router -- UPnP may work to open ports that were not open before.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=678846#c1)  Robert Townley    2011-02-20 10:51:20 UTC  ``` Discussion of Ubuntu user that was "hacked" when really the user interface was not explicit enough.   [http://www.dslreports.com/forum/r25446313-Ubuntu-computer-hijacked-by-hacker~start=40](http://www.dslreports.com/forum/r25446313-Ubuntu-computer-hijacked-by-hacker~start%3D40)  VNC does not have encryption.  I am glad to see that xrdp and is used in RHEL 6 because encryption can be built-in.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=678846#c2)  Vincent Danen    2011-03-23 16:35:49 UTC  ``` Upstream does not plan on correcting strings or documentation until GNOME 3.0 is completed.  The root of this problem is not how vino operates, but the feedback that vino provides when certain options are selected.  Statement:  This issue did not affect the version of vino as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 or 5 as they did not include support for Universal Plug and Play (UPnP).  A future update in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 may address this flaw.  To mitigate this issue, users should ensure that confirmation is requested on each inbound connection attempt, that a password is required to connect, and that automatic network configuration is disabled.  This will prevent vino from using UPnP to allow access to the VNC port, and will ensure that any connections require a password and that the user is notified on any connection attempts.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=678846#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-01-21 22:37:14 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2013:0169 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0169.html>   ``` |  |

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
