  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2011-1963",
    "description": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Internet Explorer accesses an object that has not been correctly initialized or has been deleted. The vulnerability may corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the logged-on user.",
    "technical_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to Internet Explorer accessing an object related to XSLT processing that has not been correctly initialized or has already been deleted, leading to memory corruption.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Memory corruption due to improper object handling."
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation allows arbitrary code execution in the context of the logged-on user. An attacker could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user, potentially leading to complete control of the affected system if the user has administrative rights. This includes the ability to install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Web-based attack scenario: An attacker hosts a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability, and convinces a user to visit this site.",
         "Embedding a malicious ActiveX control within an application or Microsoft Office document that hosts the IE rendering engine.",
        "Compromised websites or sites that accept user-provided content could host the malicious content."
      ],
     "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to host or inject malicious content into a website or document that a target user can access. The user must then interact with the malicious content through Internet Explorer."
