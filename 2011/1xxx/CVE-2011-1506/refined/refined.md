  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises from the switch from plaintext to TLS being implemented below the application's I/O buffering layer in some STARTTLS implementations.",

  "additional_notes": "The vulnerability is of practical concern for implementations that also perform correct certificate validation. Implementations which do not perform certificate validation are already inherently vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. Not all implementations of STARTTLS are affected. Some implementations of Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) could also be affected. Developers of STARTTLS-enabled applications should purge the application's I/O buffer immediately after switching to TLS."
