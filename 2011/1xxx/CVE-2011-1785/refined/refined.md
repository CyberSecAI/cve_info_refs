    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2011-1785",
      "root_cause": "A socket exhaustion vulnerability exists in VMware ESXi and ESX hosts.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The system does not properly manage socket resources."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could exhaust the available sockets by sending malicious network traffic. This prevents further connections to the host, causing a denial of service. Although virtual machines continue running, the ESXi/ESX host may require a reboot to restore connectivity.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Sending malicious network traffic to the ESXi or ESX host."
      ],
       "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to send network traffic to the vulnerable ESXi or ESX host."
