Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-1956:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the TCP dissector within Wireshark. Specifically, it involves accessing an invalid memory address while analyzing TCP packets.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  The core issue is an invalid memory access within the TCP dissector of Wireshark. This suggests a potential bug in how the dissector handles certain TCP packet structures or data, leading to a memory access violation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The primary impact of exploiting this vulnerability is a Denial-of-Service (DoS). Specifically, this bug will cause Wireshark (and TShark) to crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves crafting malicious TCP packets. By sending specially crafted TCP traffic to a system running a vulnerable version of Wireshark, an attacker can trigger the crash.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the capability to send network traffic (specifically TCP traffic) to a system running the vulnerable Wireshark instance. There is no requirement for a specific position relative to the target. An attacker only needs to send the malicious traffic to the system using Wireshark.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability only affects Wireshark version 1.4.5.
- It affects any TCP dissector in Wireshark.
- Wireshark 1.4.6 was released to fix this bug.
- The bug report includes a sample pcap file, `wiresharkcrash.pcap`, which can be used to reproduce the crash.
