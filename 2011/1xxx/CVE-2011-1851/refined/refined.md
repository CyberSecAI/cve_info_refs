- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `tftpserver.exe` component of HP 3Com/H3C Intelligent Management Center due to improper validation of the destination buffer size when handling the transfer mode field in a TFTP request.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow. The `tftpserver.exe` component, which listens on UDP port 69, converts the transfer mode field to uppercase using the `toupper` function before storing it in a local buffer on the stack. The process does not check if the destination buffer is large enough to hold the converted string, leading to a buffer overflow if the input is too large.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM user privileges on the vulnerable system.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending a crafted TFTP request with a long transfer mode string to UDP port 69. No authentication is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the vulnerable server on UDP port 69. No authentication is needed.
