Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The Pixelpost application (version 1.7.3) fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input passed through several POST parameters before using them in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks due to insufficient input sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database Compromise:** Attackers can compromise the entire database system.
- **Sensitive Information Exposure:** Attackers can view sensitive information stored in the database.
- **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can manipulate or modify data within the database.
- **System Access:** Successful exploitation can lead to gaining access to the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `admin/index.php` script with malicious SQL code in the following parameters: `findfid`, `id`, `selectfcat`, `selectfmon`, and `selectftag`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable application.
- No authentication is mentioned in the exploit description, therefore this is likely an unauthenticated vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to be able to access the web application.

**Additional Details:**
- The exploit-db entry provides a sample HTTP POST request showcasing how to inject SQL code through the vulnerable parameters, resulting in a SQL error message in the application's response which validates the vulnerability.
- The advisory from Zero Science Lab confirms the vulnerability, impact, and vulnerable parameters. It also provides links to additional references related to this CVE.
