{
  "CVE-2011-1080": {
    "description": "Struct tmp is copied from userspace. It is not checked whether the \"name\" field is NULL terminated. This may lead to buffer overflow and passing contents of kernel stack as a module name to try_then_request_module() and, consequently, to modprobe commandline. It would be seen by all userspace processes.",
    "root_cause": "The `do_replace` function in `net/bridge/netfilter/ebtables.c` does not validate if the 'name' field of the structure copied from userspace is null terminated.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Missing null termination check",
      "Buffer Overflow",
      "Information Leak"
    ],
    "impact": "A local user with the `CAP_NET_ADMIN` capability can trigger a buffer overflow and cause a kernel stack information leak by passing a non null-terminated string as the module name to `try_then_request_module()` which is then passed to `modprobe` and visible to all userspace processes.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access",
      "Abuse of the `do_replace` function via userspace interaction"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Local user with the `CAP_NET_ADMIN` capability."
