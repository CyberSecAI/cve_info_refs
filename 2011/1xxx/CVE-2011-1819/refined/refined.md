Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-1819:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is due to an issue where extensions could be injected into `chrome://` pages. This indicates a flaw in how Chrome handles extensions within its internal pages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Extension Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject extension code into internal `chrome://` pages. These pages are usually considered privileged and should not be modifiable by extensions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Potentially High Impact:** Although the severity is listed as medium, the ability to inject code into `chrome://` pages could lead to significant security breaches. `chrome://` pages are used for critical browser functionality, and unauthorized modification could lead to:
    - Manipulation of browser settings and behaviour.
    - Information disclosure
    - Session hijacking
    - Arbitrary code execution (depending on the specific capabilities within chrome:// pages).

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Extension:** The primary attack vector is through a malicious or compromised browser extension.
- **Extension Installation:** An attacker would need a way to get the malicious extension installed by the victim, likely through social engineering or by compromising the extension distribution channel.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Develop and Deploy Malicious Extension:** The attacker needs to be able to develop or modify a browser extension with the ability to perform the injection.
- **Extension Installation:** The attacker needs a vector to install the malicious extension into the user's browser.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was credited to Vladislavas Jarmalis, with a subsequent independent discovery by Sergey Glazunov.
- This was fixed in Chrome version 12.0.742.91.
