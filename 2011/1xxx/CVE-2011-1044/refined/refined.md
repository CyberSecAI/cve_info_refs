{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `ib_uverbs_poll_cq()` function in the Linux kernel's InfiniBand (IB) subsystem has a flaw related to handling completion queue (CQ) entries, where it doesn't initialize the response buffer properly.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uninitialized stack memory",
      "Information leak"
    ],
    "impact": "A local, unprivileged user can obtain sensitive kernel memory information by calling `ib_uverbs_poll_cq()` with specific parameters that lead to partial filling of the response buffer. This is achieved because the response buffer is not completely zeroed out before data is copied into it.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access",
        "Calling the `ib_uverbs_poll_cq()` function with specific parameters"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "A local, unprivileged user must be able to call the `ib_uverbs_poll_cq()` function through a RDMA device.",
    "additional_info": "This vulnerability is related to CVE-2010-4649, which describes an integer overflow issue in the same function. The fix for both issues was addressed by the same patch."
