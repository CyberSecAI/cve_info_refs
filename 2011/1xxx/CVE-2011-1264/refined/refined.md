Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2011-1264:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation of a request parameter on an Active Directory Certificate Services Web Enrollment site.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
-   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core issue is a reflected XSS vulnerability. This type of vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious client-side scripts into a user's web browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Elevation of Privilege:** An attacker could leverage the XSS vulnerability to elevate their privileges within the context of the targeted user on the vulnerable website.
-   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** By injecting malicious scripts, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the site in the context of the victim user.
-   **Content Spoofing:** Malicious scripts can be used to spoof content on the website, potentially misleading users.
-  **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially use the injected script to disclose sensitive information.
-   **Taking actions on behalf of the user:** An attacker could potentially perform any action that the user could perform on the site, but on the user's behalf.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **Specially Crafted Links:** The primary attack vector involves an attacker sending a specially crafted URL to a target user. This URL would contain malicious code designed to exploit the XSS vulnerability.
-   **Social Engineering:** Attackers need to persuade users to click on the malicious link. This is typically done through social engineering techniques, such as embedding the link in an email or instant message.
-   **Web-Based Attacks:** An attacker can host a webpage designed to exploit the vulnerability. Compromised websites and sites hosting user-generated content could also contain the malicious code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Ability to craft malicious URLs:** Attackers must be able to create URLs that contain the malicious JavaScript or other script code that exploits the vulnerability.
-   **Social engineering skills:** Attackers need to be able to persuade users to click on the malicious link, as there's no way to force users to visit the vulnerable page.
-   **No need for direct access to the server:** This vulnerability is client-side and does not require direct access to the server.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects Windows Server 2003, 2008, and 2008 R2, except for Itanium editions and Server Core installations.
-  Internet Explorer 8 and 9 include an XSS filter, which, if enabled, can mitigate the vulnerability, but this filter is not enabled by default for the Intranet zone.
