Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2011-1775:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way `vncviewer` in tigervnc handles the TLS handshake when using X.509 certificate-based authentication. Specifically, the client would prompt for and send authentication credentials (username and password) to the server *before* properly validating the server's X.509 certificate.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Premature Credential Transmission:** The primary weakness is that the client sends the user's credentials to the server before confirming the server's identity using the X.509 certificate.
*   **Lack of Proper Certificate Validation:** The client fails to validate the server's certificate before proceeding with authentication. This opens the door to potential attacks.
*   **Insecure Error Handling:**  The initial code returned `true` in `CSecurityTLS::processMsg` if the server indicated an issue (by sending a `0`), without properly handling the error, leading to the described issue.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** A malicious actor could set up a rogue VNC server with a fake certificate. Because the client doesn't validate the certificate first, it would send the user's login credentials to the attacker's server.
*   **Credential Theft:** The attacker could capture the username and password transmitted by the client, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the user's system or other resources.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** An attacker would need to be positioned on the network between the client and the legitimate VNC server. This could involve intercepting network traffic (e.g., via ARP poisoning or rogue Wi-Fi).
*   **Rogue VNC Server:** The attacker would set up a malicious VNC server, configured to offer an insecure X.509 connection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Proximity:**  The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic or redirect connections intended for the legitimate VNC server to their malicious server.
*   **Malicious VNC Server Setup:** The attacker requires the ability to create a VNC server that implements the vulnerable TLS handshake process with a fake or invalid certificate.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was introduced with the addition of X.509 certificate support in tigervnc (specifically, in svn r4200). Older versions of tigervnc that did not implement X.509 certificate handling were not vulnerable.
*   A patch was proposed to address this issue by inlining the error fetching code from `CConnection::processSecurityResultMsg` into `CSecurityTLS::processMsg` which throws an exception if the handshake fails.
