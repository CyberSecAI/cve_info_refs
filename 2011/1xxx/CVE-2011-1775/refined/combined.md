| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=702470#c0)  Vincent Danen    2011-05-05 18:21:42 UTC  ``` It was reported [1] that vncviewer could prompt for, and send, authentication credentials to a remote server without first properly validating the X.509 certificate.  This could allow a malicious server to obtain a client's credentials because the client does not indicate to the user that a certificate is bad or missing.  A proposed patch [2] is being discussed.  [1] [http://www.mail-archive.com/tigervnc-devel@lists.sourceforge.net/msg01342.html](http://www.mail-archive.com/tigervnc-devel%40lists.sourceforge.net/msg01342.html) [2] [http://www.mail-archive.com/tigervnc-devel@lists.sourceforge.net/msg01347.html](http://www.mail-archive.com/tigervnc-devel%40lists.sourceforge.net/msg01347.html)   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=702470#c2)  Vincent Danen    2011-05-06 14:33:26 UTC  ``` This flaw does not affect older versions of tigervnc due to X.509 certificate handling being a new feature (new to the forthcoming 1.1.0):  <http://tigervnc.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/tigervnc?view=revision&revision=4200>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=702470#c3)  Vincent Danen    2011-05-06 14:35:45 UTC  ``` Created tigervnc tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-15 [[bug 702672](show_bug.cgi?id=702672 "CLOSED ERRATA - tigervnc: vncviewer can send password to server without proper validation of the X.509 certificate [fedora-15]")]   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=702470#c5)  Vincent Danen    2011-05-09 22:54:56 UTC  ``` This has been assigned the name [CVE-2011-1775](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1775).   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=702470#c6)  Kurt Seifried    2011-05-09 23:52:13 UTC  ``` Confirmed Fedora 14 is not vulnerable, they ship 1.0.90 which is labeled "1.0.90 (1.1beta1)" on tigervnc download sit, but the 1.0.90 they ship is older (svn4123) and does not have the X509 support.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=702470#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-06-15 10:06:50 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2011:0871 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0871.html>   ``` |  |

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

```

Thanks for spotting this. The server should send 0, if he can't start the
handshake - so it
is still possible to sent the error messages back to the client.

The problem is, that a malicus server could send 0 and then authentification
succeded. It is caused by the fact, the I reused the common code for returing
the
error message.

A solution can be, that the error fetching code from
CConnection::processSecurityResultMsg
is inlined in CSecurityTLS::processMsg, like the following (untested):

diff --git a/common/rfb/CSecurityTLS.cxx b/common/rfb/CSecurityTLS.cxx
index 6028792..17ed93c 100644
--- a/common/rfb/CSecurityTLS.cxx

Hi,

I think that I just stumbled onto a possible security vulnerability in
CSecurityTLS.  It seems as though CSecurityTLS::processMsg returns true
before the handshake has completed (possibly due to the "if (is.readU8() ==
0)" test on line 174).  In the case of secTypes like x509plain, the user is
prompted for a username and password (meaning the client is processing phase
2 of the security stack) before the certificate has been verified.  I
noticed this while testing a known bad certificate - presumably this means
that the username & password are sent in the clear since the TLS handshake
never completes.
```

Message-ID: <20110506143928.GA9170@redhat.com>
Date: Fri, 6 May 2011 08:39:29 -0600
From: Vincent Danen <vdanen@...hat.com>
To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com
Subject: CVE request: tigervnc

The vncviewer in tigervnc had X.509 certificate support added in svn
r4200 (currently beta, slated for the 1.1.0 release).  It would prompt
for and send authentication credentials before properly validating the
X.509 certificate, which makes it susceptible to a man-in-the-middle
attack.

Could a CVE be assigned to this please?  Thanks.

Hello Brian,

thanks for notification about this issue, you are right that password
might been sent over network without proper validation of the X.509 certs.
```
```

Can you please test if attached patch solves this issue? It is Martin's
patch with little modification (result is rdr::U32 instead of int).

Regards, Adam
