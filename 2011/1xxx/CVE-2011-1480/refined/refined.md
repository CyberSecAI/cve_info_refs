Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is caused by the lack of proper sanitization of the `chng_uid` parameter in the `/admin.php` script of PHP-Nuke. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code through this parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Blind SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to blind SQL injection, meaning an attacker cannot directly see the output of the injected SQL queries. Instead, they must infer information based on the application's responses (e.g., success/failure of actions, time delays due to `SLEEP()` functions).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject and manipulate SQL queries in the back-end database.
- This allows for the potential manipulation or disclosure of arbitrary data stored within the database.
- An attacker could potentially modify, delete, or steal sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through an HTTP POST request to `/admin.php`.
- The malicious SQL code is injected within the `chng_uid` parameter using the `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` content type.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the server hosting the PHP-Nuke application.
- The attacker must be able to access the `/admin.php` page, indicating a need to access the administrative backend.
- The attacker must be able to modify the `chng_uid` parameter within the POST request.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in PHP-Nuke versions 8.0 and lower.
- The advisory suggests that paid versions 8.1 and 9.0 might also be vulnerable.
- No official patch is available, and the advisory recommends not using the product due to the lack of updates and vendor response.
- The vulnerability was discovered and disclosed by the YGN Ethical Hacker Group.
