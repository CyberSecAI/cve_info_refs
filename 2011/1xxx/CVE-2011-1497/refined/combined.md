\* Fixed XSS vulnerability in `auto\_link`. `auto\_link` no longer marks input as html safe. Please make sure that calls to auto\_link() are wrapped in a sanitize(), or a raw() depending on the type of input passed to auto\_link(). For example:
 <%= sanitize(auto\_link(some\_user\_input)) %>
 Thanks to Torben Schulz for reporting this. The fix can be found here: 61ee3449674c591747db95f9b3472c5c3bd9e84d
\* Fixes the output of `rake routes` to be correctly match to the behavior of the application, as the regular expression used to match the path is greedy and won't capture the format part by default [Prem Sichanugrist]
\* Fixes an issue with number\_to\_human when converting values which are less than 1 but greater than -1 [Josh Kalderimis]
\* Sensitive query string parameters (specified in config.filter\_parameters) will now be filtered out from the request paths in the log file. [Prem Sichanugrist, fxn]
\* URL parameters which return nil for to\_param are now removed from the query string [Andrew White]
\* Don't allow i18n to change the minor version, version now set to ~> 0.5.0 [Santiago Pastorino]
\* Make TranslationHelper#translate use the :rescue\_format option in I18n 0.5.0 [Sven Fuchs]
\* Fix regression: javascript\_include\_tag shouldn't raise if you register an expansion key with nil or [] value [Santiago Pastorino]
\* Fix Action caching bug where an action that has a non-cacheable response always renders a nil response body. It now correctly renders the response body. [Cheah Chu Yeow]
\*Rails 3.0.5 (February 26, 2011)\*
\* No changes.
\*Rails 3.0.4 (February 8, 2011)\*
\* No changes.
\*Rails 3.0.3 (November 16, 2010)\*
\* When ActiveRecord::Base objects are sent to predicate methods, the id of the object should be sent to ARel, not the ActiveRecord::Base object.
\* :constraints routing should only do sanity checks against regular expressions. String arguments are OK.
\*Rails 3.0.2 (November 15, 2010)\*
\* The helper number\_to\_currency accepts a new :negative\_format option to be able to configure how to render negative amounts. [Don Wilson]
\*Rails 3.0.1 (October 15, 2010)\*
\* No changes.
\*Rails 3.0.0 (August 29, 2010)\*
\* Symbols and strings in routes should yield the same behavior. Note this may break existing apps that were using symbols with the new routes API [José Valim]
\* Add clear\_helpers as a way to clean up all helpers added to this controller, maintaing just the helper with the same name as the controller. [José Valim]
\* Support routing constraints in functional tests. [Andrew White]
\* Add a header that tells Internet Explorer (all versions) to use the best available standards support. [Yehuda Katz]
\* Allow stylesheet/javascript extensions to be changed through railties. [Josh Kalderimis]
\* link\_to, button\_to, and tag/tag\_options now rely on html\_escape instead of escape\_once. [fxn]
\* url\_for returns always unescaped strings, and the :escape option is gone. [fxn]

\* Deprecate :name\_prefix in the new router DSL [José Valim]
\* Add shallow routes back to the new router [Diego Carrion, Andrew White]
 resources :posts do shallow do resources :comments end end
 You can now use comment\_path for /comments/1 instead of post\_comment\_path for /posts/1/comments/1.
\* Add support for multi-subdomain session by setting cookie host in session cookie so you can share session between www.example.com, example.com and user.example.com. #4818 [Guillermo Álvarez]
\* Removed textilize, textilize\_without\_paragraph and markdown helpers. [Santiago Pastorino]
\* Remove middleware laziness [José Valim]

\* Add support for shorthand routes like /projects/status(.:format) #4423 [Diego Carrion]
\* Changed translate helper so that it doesn’t mark every translation as safe HTML. Only keys with a "\_html" suffix and keys named "html" are considered to be safe HTML. All other translations are left untouched. [Craig Davey]
\* New option :as added to form\_for allows to change the object name. The old <% form\_for :client, @post %> becomes <% form\_for @post, :as => :client %> [spastorino]
\* Removed verify method in controllers. [JV] It's now available as a plugin at http://github.com/rails/verification
\* Removed input, form, error\_messages\_for and error\_message\_on from views. [JV] It's now available as a plugin at http://github.com/rails/dynamic\_form
\* Routes can be scoped by controller module. [Jeremy Kemper]
 # /session => Auth::SessionsController scope :module => 'auth' do resource :session end
\* Added #favicon\_link\_tag, it uses #image\_path so in particular the favicon gets an asset ID [fxn]
\* Fixed that default locale templates should be used if the current locale template is missing [DHH]
\* Added all the new HTML5 form types as individual form tag methods (search, url, number, etc) #3646 [Stephen Celis]
\* Changed the object used in routing constraints to be an instance of ActionDispatch::Request rather than Rack::Request [YK]
\* Changed ActionDispatch::Request#method to return a String, to be compatible with Rack::Request. Added ActionDispatch::Request#method\_symbol to return a symbol form of the request method. [YK]
\* Changed ActionDispatch::Request#method to return the original method and #request\_method to return the overridden method in the case of methodoverride being used (this means that #method returns "HEAD" and #request\_method returns "GET" in HEAD requests). This is for compatibility with Rack::Request [YK]
\* #concat is now deprecated in favor of using <%= %> helpers [YK]
\* Block helpers now return Strings, so you can use <%= form\_for @foo do |f| %>. <% form\_for do |f| %> still works with deprecation notices [YK]
\* Add a new #mount method on the router that does not anchor the PATH\_INFO at the end [YK & CL]
\* Create a new LookupContext object that is responsible for performantly finding a template for a given pattern [JV]
\* Removed relative\_url\_for in favor of respecting SCRIPT\_NAME [YK & CL]
\* Changed file streaming to use Rack::Sendfile middleware [YK]
\* ActionDispatch::Request#content\_type returns a String to be compatible with Rack::Request. Use #content\_mime\_type for the Mime::Type instance [YK]
\* Updated Prototype to 1.6.1 and Scriptaculous to 1.8.3 [ML]
\* Change the preferred way that URL helpers are included into a class[YK & CL]

 # for just url\_for include Rails.application.router.url\_for
\* Fixed that PrototypeHelper#update\_page should return html\_safe [DHH]
\* Fixed that much of DateHelper wouldn't return html\_safe? strings [DHH]
\* Fixed that fragment caching should return a cache hit as html\_safe (or it would all just get escaped) [DHH]
\* Added that ActionController::Base now does helper :all instead of relying on the default ApplicationController in Rails to do it [DHH]
\* Added ActionDispatch::Request#authorization to access the http authentication header regardless of its proxy hiding [DHH]
\* Added :alert, :notice, and :flash as options to ActionController::Base#redirect\_to that'll automatically set the proper flash before the redirection [DHH]. Examples:
 flash[:notice] = 'Post was created' redirect\_to(@post)
 ...becomes:
 redirect\_to(@post, :notice => 'Post was created')
\* Added ActionController::Base#notice/= and ActionController::Base#alert/= as a convenience accessors in both the controller and the view for flash[:notice]/= and flash[:alert]/= [DHH]
\* Introduce grouped\_collection\_select helper. #1249 [Dan Codeape, Erik Ostrom]
\* Make sure javascript\_include\_tag/stylesheet\_link\_tag does not append ".js" or ".css" onto external urls. #1664 [Matthew Rudy Jacobs]
\* Ruby 1.9: fix Content-Length for multibyte send\_data streaming. #2661 [Sava Chankov]
\* Ruby 1.9: ERB template encoding using a magic comment at the top of the file. [Jeremy Kemper] <%# encoding: utf-8 %>
\* Change integration test helpers to accept Rack environment instead of just HTTP Headers [Pratik Naik]
 Before : get '/path', {}, 'Accept' => 'text/javascript' After : get '/path', {}, 'HTTP\_ACCEPT' => 'text/javascript'
\* Instead of checking Rails.env.test? in Failsafe middleware, check env["rails.raise\_exceptions"] [Bryan Helmkamp]
\* Fixed that TestResponse.cookies was returning cookies unescaped #1867 [Doug McInnes]
\*2.3.2 [Final] (March 15, 2009)\*
\* Fixed that redirection would just log the options, not the final url (which lead to "Redirected to #<Post:0x23150b8>") [DHH]
\* Don't check authenticity tokens for any AJAX requests [Ross Kaffenberger/Bryan Helmkamp]
\* Added ability to pass in :public => true to fresh\_when, stale?, and expires\_in to make the request proxy cachable #2095 [Gregg Pollack]
\* Fixed that passing a custom form builder would be forwarded to nested fields\_for calls #2023 [Eloy Duran/Nate Wiger]
\* Form option helpers now support disabled option tags and the use of lambdas for selecting/disabling option tags from collections #837 [Tekin]
\* Added partial scoping to TranslationHelper#translate, so if you call translate(".foo") from the people/index.html.erb template, you'll actually be calling I18n.translate("people.index.foo") [DHH]
\* Fix a syntax error in current\_page?() that was prevent matches against URL's with multiple query parameters #1385, #1868 [chris finne/Andrew White]
\* Added localized rescue template when I18n.locale is set (ex: public/404.da.html) #1835 [José Valim]

\* Added grouped\_options\_for\_select helper method for wrapping option tags in optgroups. #977 [Jon Crawford]
\* Implement HTTP Digest authentication. #1230 [Gregg Kellogg, Pratik Naik] Example :
 class DummyDigestController < ActionController::Base USERS = { "lifo" => 'world' }
 before\_filter :authenticate
 def index render :text => "Hello Secret" end
 private
 def authenticate authenticate\_or\_request\_with\_http\_digest("Super Secret") do |username| # Return the user's password USERS[username] end end end
\* Improved i18n support for the number\_to\_human\_size helper. Changes the storage\_units translation data; update your translations accordingly. #1634 [Yaroslav Markin] storage\_units: # %u is the storage unit, %n is the number (default: 2 MB) format: "%n %u" units: byte: one: "Byte" other: "Bytes" kb: "KB" mb: "MB" gb: "GB" tb: "TB"
\* Added :silence option to BenchmarkHelper#benchmark and turned log\_level into a hash parameter and deprecated the old use [DHH]
\* Fixed the AssetTagHelper cache to use the computed asset host as part of the cache key instead of just assuming the its a string #1299 [DHH]
\* Make ActionController#render(string) work as a shortcut for render :file/:template/:action => string. [#1435] [Pratik Naik] Examples:
 # Instead of render(:action => 'other\_action') render('other\_action') # argument has no '/' render(:other\_action)
 # Instead of render(:template => 'controller/action') render('controller/action') # argument must not begin with a '/', but contain a '/'
 # Instead of render(:file => '/Users/lifo/home.html.erb') render('/Users/lifo/home.html.erb') # argument must begin with a '/'
\* Add :prompt option to date/time select helpers. #561 [Sam Oliver]
\* Fixed that send\_file shouldn't set an etag #1578 [Hongli Lai]
\* Allow users to opt out of the spoofing checks in Request#remote\_ip. Useful for sites whose traffic regularly triggers false positives. [Darren Boyd]
\* Deprecated formatted\_polymorphic\_url. [Jeremy Kemper]
\* Added the option to declare an asset\_host as an object that responds to call (see http://github.com/dhh/asset-hosting-with-minimum-ssl for an example) [David Heinemeier Hansson]
\* Added support for multiple routes.rb files (useful for plugin engines). This also means that draw will no longer clear the route set, you have to do that by hand (shouldn't make a difference to you unless you're doing some funky stuff) [David Heinemeier Hansson]
\* Dropped formatted\_\* routes in favor of just passing in :format as an option. This cuts resource routes generation in half #1359 [aaronbatalion]
\* Remove support for old double-encoded cookies from the cookie store. These values haven't been generated since before 2.1.0, and any users who have visited the app in the intervening 6 months will have had their cookie upgraded. [Michael Koziarski]
\* Allow helpers directory to be overridden via ActionController::Base.helpers\_dir #1424 [Sam Pohlenz]
\* Remove deprecated ActionController::Base#assign\_default\_content\_type\_and\_charset
\* Changed the default of ActionView#render to assume partials instead of files when not given an options hash [David Heinemeier Hansson]. Examples:
 # Instead of <%= render :partial => "account" %> <%= render "account" %>
 # Instead of <%= render :partial => "account", :locals => { :account => @buyer } %> <%= render "account", :account => @buyer %>
 # @account is an Account instance, so it uses the RecordIdentifier to replace # <%= render :partial => "accounts/account", :locals => { :account => @account } %> <%= render(@account) %>
 # @posts is an array of Post instances, so it uses the RecordIdentifier to replace # <%= render :partial => "posts/post", :collection => @posts %> <%= render(@posts) %>
\* Remove deprecated render\_component. Please use the plugin from http://github.com/rails/render\_component/tree/master [Pratik Naik]
\* Fixed RedCloth and BlueCloth shouldn't preload. Instead just assume that they're available if you want to use textilize and markdown and let autoload require them [David Heinemeier Hansson]
\*2.2.2 (November 21st, 2008)\*
\* I18n: translate number\_to\_human\_size. Add storage\_units: [Bytes, KB, MB, GB, TB] to your translations. #1448 [Yaroslav Markin]
\* Restore backwards compatible functionality for setting relative\_url\_root. Include deprecation
\* Switched the CSRF module to use the request content type to decide if the request is forgeable. #1145 [Jeff Cohen]
\* Added :only and :except to map.resources to let people cut down on the number of redundant routes in an application. Typically only useful for huge routesets. #1215 [Tom Stuart]
 map.resources :products, :only => :show do |product| product.resources :images, :except => :destroy end
\* Added render :js for people who want to render inline JavaScript replies without using RJS [David Heinemeier Hansson]
\* Fixed that polymorphic\_url should compact given array #1317 [hiroshi]
\* Fixed the sanitize helper to avoid double escaping already properly escaped entities #683 [antonmos/Ryan McGeary]
\* Fixed that FormTagHelper generated illegal html if name contained square brackets #1238 [Vladimir Dobriakov]
\* Fix regression bug that made date\_select and datetime\_select raise a Null Pointer Exception when a nil date/datetime was passed and only month and year were displayed #1289 [Bernardo Padua/Tor Erik]
\* Simplified the logging format for parameters (don't include controller, action, and format as duplicates) [David Heinemeier Hansson]
\* Remove the logging of the Session ID when the session store is CookieStore [David Heinemeier Hansson]
\* Fixed regex in redirect\_to to fully support URI schemes #1247 [Seth Fitzsimmons]
\* Fixed bug with asset timestamping when using relative\_url\_root #1265 [Joe Goldwasser]
\*2.2.0 [RC1] (October 24th, 2008)\*
\* Fix incorrect closing CDATA delimiter and that HTML::Node.parse would blow up on unclosed CDATA sections [packagethief]
\* Added stale? and fresh\_when methods to provide a layer of abstraction above request.fresh? and friends [David Heinemeier Hansson]. Example:
 class ArticlesController < ApplicationController def show\_with\_respond\_to\_block @article = Article.find(params[:id])
 # If the request sends headers that differs from the options provided to stale?, then # the request is indeed stale and the respond\_to block is triggered (and the options # to the stale? call is set on the response). # # If the request headers match, then the request is fresh and the respond\_to block is # not triggered. Instead the default render will occur, which will check the last-modified # and etag headers and conclude that it only needs to send a "304 Not Modified" instead # of rendering the template. if stale?(:last\_modified => @article.published\_at.utc, :etag => @article) respond\_to do |wants| # normal response processing end end end
 def show\_with\_implied\_render @article = Article.find(params[:id])
 # Sets the response headers and checks them against the request, if the request is stale # (i.e. no match of either etag or last-modified), then the default render of the template happens. # If the request is fresh, then the default render will return a "304 Not Modified" # instead of rendering the template. fresh\_when(:last\_modified => @article.published\_at.utc, :etag => @article) end end
\* Added inline builder yield to atom\_feed\_helper tags where appropriate [Sam Ruby]. Example:
 entry.summary :type => 'xhtml' do |xhtml| xhtml.p pluralize(order.line\_items.count, "line item") xhtml.p "Shipped to #{order.address}" xhtml.p "Paid by #{order.pay\_type}" end
\* Make PrototypeHelper#submit\_to\_remote a wrapper around PrototypeHelper#button\_to\_remote. [Tarmo Tänav]
\* Set HttpOnly for the cookie session store's cookie. #1046
\* Added FormTagHelper#image\_submit\_tag confirm option #784 [Alastair Brunton]
\* Fixed FormTagHelper#submit\_tag with :disable\_with option wouldn't submit the button's value when was clicked #633 [Jose Fernandez]
\* Stopped logging template compiles as it only clogs up the log [David Heinemeier Hansson]
\* Changed the X-Runtime header to report in milliseconds [David Heinemeier Hansson]
\* Changed BenchmarkHelper#benchmark to report in milliseconds [David Heinemeier Hansson]
\* Changed logging format to be millisecond based and skip misleading stats [David Heinemeier Hansson]. Went from:
 Completed in 0.10000 (4 reqs/sec) | Rendering: 0.04000 (40%) | DB: 0.00400 (4%) | 200 OK [http://example.com]
 ...to:
 Completed in 100ms (View: 40, DB: 4) | 200 OK [http://example.com]
\* Add support for shallow nesting of routes. #838 [S. Brent Faulkner]
 Example :
 map.resources :users, :shallow => true do |user| user.resources :posts end
 - GET /users/1/posts (maps to PostsController#index action as usual) named route "user\_posts" is added as usual.
 - GET /posts/2 (maps to PostsController#show action as if it were not nested) Additionally, named route "post" is added too.
\* Added button\_to\_remote helper. #3641 [Donald Piret, Tarmo Tänav]
\* Deprecate render\_component. Please use render\_component plugin from http://github.com/rails/render\_component/tree/master [Pratik Naik]
\* Routes may be restricted to lists of HTTP methods instead of a single method or :any. #407 [Brennan Dunn, Gaius Centus Novus] map.resource :posts, :collection => { :search => [:get, :post] } map.session 'session', :requirements => { :method => [:get, :post, :delete] }
\* Deprecated implicit local assignments when rendering partials [Josh Peek]
\* Introduce current\_cycle helper method to return the current value without bumping the cycle. #417 [Ken Collins]
\* Allow polymorphic\_url helper to take url options. #880 [Tarmo Tänav]
\* Switched integration test runner to use Rack processor instead of CGI [Josh Peek]
\* Made AbstractRequest.if\_modified\_sense return nil if the header could not be parsed [Jamis Buck]
\* Added back ActionController::Base.allow\_concurrency flag [Josh Peek]
\* AbstractRequest.relative\_url\_root is no longer automatically configured by a HTTP header. It can now be set in your configuration environment with config.action\_controller.relative\_url\_root [Josh Peek]
\* Update Prototype to 1.6.0.2 #599 [Patrick Joyce]
\* Conditional GET utility methods. [Jeremy Kemper] response.last\_modified = @post.updated\_at response.etag = [:admin, @post, current\_user]
 if request.fresh?(response) head :not\_modified else # render ... end
\* All 2xx requests are considered successful [Josh Peek]
\* Fixed that AssetTagHelper#compute\_public\_path shouldn't cache the asset\_host along with the source or per-request proc's won't run [David Heinemeier Hansson]
\* Removed config.action\_view.cache\_template\_loading, use config.cache\_classes instead [Josh Peek]
\* Get buffer for fragment cache from template's @output\_buffer [Josh Peek]
\* Set config.action\_view.warn\_cache\_misses = true to receive a warning if you perform an action that results in an expensive disk operation that could be cached [Josh Peek]
\* Refactor template preloading. New abstractions include Renderable mixins and a refactored Template class [Josh Peek]
\* Changed ActionView::TemplateHandler#render API method signature to render(template, local\_assigns = {}) [Josh Peek]
\* Changed PrototypeHelper#submit\_to\_remote to PrototypeHelper#button\_to\_remote to stay consistent with link\_to\_remote (submit\_to\_remote still works as an alias) #8994 [clemens]
\* Add :recursive option to javascript\_include\_tag and stylesheet\_link\_tag to be used along with :all. #480 [Damian Janowski]
\* Allow users to disable the use of the Accept header [Michael Koziarski]
 The accept header is poorly implemented by browsers and causes strange errors when used on public sites where crawlers make requests too. You can use formatted urls (e.g. /people/1.xml) to support API clients in a much simpler way.
 To disable the header you need to set:
 config.action\_controller.use\_accept\_header = false
\* Do not stat template files in production mode before rendering. You will no longer be able to modify templates in production mode without restarting the server [Josh Peek]
\* Deprecated TemplateHandler line offset [Josh Peek]
\* Allow caches\_action to accept cache store options. #416. [José Valim]. Example:
 caches\_action :index, :redirected, :if => Proc.new { |c| !c.request.format.json? }, :expires\_in => 1.hour
\* Remove define\_javascript\_functions, javascript\_include\_tag and friends are far superior. [Michael Koziarski]
\* Deprecate :use\_full\_path render option. The supplying the option no longer has an effect [Josh Peek]
\* Add :as option to render a collection of partials with a custom local variable name. #509 [Simon Jefford, Pratik Naik]
 render :partial => 'other\_people', :collection => @people, :as => :person
 This will let you access objects of @people as 'person' local variable inside 'other\_people' partial template.
\* time\_zone\_select: support for regexp matching of priority zones. Resolves #195 [Ernie Miller]
\* Made ActionView::Base#render\_file private [Josh Peek]
\* Refactor and simplify the implementation of assert\_redirected\_to. Arguments are now normalised relative to the controller being tested, not the root of the application. [Michael Koziarski]
 This could cause some erroneous test failures if you were redirecting between controllers in different namespaces and wrote your assertions relative to the root of the application.
\* Remove follow\_redirect from controller functional tests.
 If you want to follow redirects you can use integration tests. The functional test version was only useful if you were using redirect\_to :id=>...
\* Fix polymorphic\_url with singleton resources. #461 [Tammer Saleh]
\* Replaced TemplateFinder abstraction with ViewLoadPaths [Josh Peek]
\* Added block-call style to link\_to [Sam Stephenson/David Heinemeier Hansson]. Example:
 <% link\_to(@profile) do %> <strong><%= @profile.name %></strong> -- <span>Check it out!!</span> <% end %>
\* Performance: integration test benchmarking and profiling. [Jeremy Kemper]
\* Make caching more aware of mime types. Ensure request format is not considered while expiring cache. [Jonathan del Strother]
\* Drop ActionController::Base.allow\_concurrency flag [Josh Peek]
\* More efficient concat and capture helpers. Remove ActionView::Base.erb\_variable. [Jeremy Kemper]
\* Added page.reload functionality. Resolves #277. [Sean Huber]
\* Fixed Request#remote\_ip to only raise hell if the HTTP\_CLIENT\_IP and HTTP\_X\_FORWARDED\_FOR doesn't match (not just if they're both present) [Mark Imbriaco, Bradford Folkens]
\* Allow caches\_action to accept a layout option [José Valim]
\* Added Rack processor [Ezra Zygmuntowicz, Josh Peek]
\*2.1.0 (May 31st, 2008)\*
\* InstanceTag#default\_time\_from\_options overflows to DateTime [Geoff Buesing]
\* Fixed that forgery protection can be used without session tracking (Peter Jones) [#139]
\* Added session(:on) to turn session management back on in a controller subclass if the superclass turned it off (Peter Jones) [#136]
\* Change the request forgery protection to go by Content-Type instead of request.format so that you can't bypass it by POSTing to "#{request.uri}.xml" [Rick Olson]\* InstanceTag#default\_time\_from\_options with hash args uses Time.current as default; respects hash settings when time falls in system local spring DST gap [Geoff Buesing]
\* select\_date defaults to Time.zone.today when config.time\_zone is set [Geoff Buesing]
\* Fixed that TextHelper#text\_field would corrypt when raw HTML was used as the value (mchenryc, Kevin Glowacz) [#80]
\* Added ActionController::TestCase#rescue\_action\_in\_public! to control whether the action under test should use the regular rescue\_action path instead of simply raising the exception inline (great for error testing) [David Heinemeier Hansson]
\* Reduce number of instance variables being copied from controller to view. [Pratik Naik]
\* select\_datetime and select\_time default to Time.zone.now when config.time\_zone is set [Geoff Buesing]
\* datetime\_select defaults to Time.zone.now when config.time\_zone is set [Geoff Buesing]
\* Remove ActionController::Base#view\_controller\_internals flag. [Pratik Naik]
\* Add conditional options to caches\_page method. [Paul Horsfall]
\* Move missing template logic to ActionView. [Pratik Naik]
\* Introduce ActionView::InlineTemplate class. [Pratik Naik]
\* Automatically parse posted JSON content for Mime::JSON requests. [Rick Olson]
 POST /posts {"post": {"title": "Breaking News"}}
 def create @post = Post.create params[:post] # ... end
\* add json\_escape ERB util to escape html entities in json strings that are output in HTML pages. [Rick Olson]
\* Provide a helper proxy to access helper methods from outside views. Closes #10839 [Josh Peek] e.g. ApplicationController.helpers.simple\_format(text)
\* Improve documentation. [Xavier Noria, leethal, jerome]
\* Ensure RJS redirect\_to doesn't html-escapes string argument. Closes #8546 [Josh Peek, eventualbuddha, Pratik Naik]
\* Support render :partial => collection of heterogeneous elements. #11491 [Zach Dennis]
\* Avoid remote\_ip spoofing. [Brian Candler]
\* Added support for regexp flags like ignoring case in the :requirements part of routes declarations #11421 [NeilW]
\* Fixed that ActionController::Base#read\_multipart would fail if boundary was exactly 10240 bytes #10886 [ariejan]
\* Fixed HTML::Tokenizer (used in sanitize helper) didn't handle unclosed CDATA tags #10071 [esad, packagethief]
\* Improve documentation. [Ryan Bigg, Jan De Poorter, Cheah Chu Yeow, Xavier Shay, Jack Danger Canty, Emilio Tagua, Xavier Noria, Sunny Ripert]

\* Allow the #simple\_format text\_helper to take an html\_options hash for each paragraph. #2448 [François Beausoleil, Chris O'Sullivan]
\* Fix regression from filter refactoring where re-adding a skipped filter resulted in it being called twice. [Rick Olson]
\* Refactor filters to use Active Support callbacks. #11235 [Josh Peek]
\* Fixed that polymorphic routes would modify the input array #11363 [thomas.lee]
\* Added :format option to NumberHelper#number\_to\_currency to enable better localization support #11149 [lylo]
\* Fixed that TextHelper#excerpt would include one character too many #11268 [Irfy]
\* Fix more obscure nested parameter hash parsing bug. #10797 [thomas.lee]
\* Added ActionView::Helpers::register\_javascript/stylesheet\_expansion to make it easier for plugin developers to inject multiple assets. #10350 [lotswholetime]
\* Fix nested parameter hash parsing bug. #10797 [thomas.lee]
\* Allow using named routes in ActionController::TestCase before any request has been made. Closes #11273 [Eloy Duran]
\* Fixed that sweepers defined by cache\_sweeper will be added regardless of the perform\_caching setting. Instead, control whether the sweeper should be run with the perform\_caching setting. This makes testing easier when you want to turn perform\_caching on/off [David Heinemeier Hansson]
\* Make MimeResponds::Responder#any work without explicit types. Closes #11140 [jaw6]
\* Better error message for type conflicts when parsing params. Closes #7962 [spicycode, matt]

\* Refactor partial rendering into a PartialTemplate class. [Pratik Naik]
\* Added that requests with JavaScript as the priority mime type in the accept header and no format extension in the parameters will be treated as though their format was :js when it comes to determining which template to render. This makes it possible for JS requests to automatically render action.js.rjs files without an explicit respond\_to block [David Heinemeier Hansson]
\* Tests for distance\_of\_time\_in\_words with TimeWithZone instances. Closes #10914 [Ernesto Jimenez]
\* Remove support for multivalued (e.g., '&'-delimited) cookies. [Jamis Buck]

Subject: Re: CVE for ruby on rails XSS fixes

----- Original Message -----
> Hi,
>
> Can someone assign a CVE for the XSS issue described in
>
> <https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/38df020c95beca7e12f0188cb7e18f3c37789e20/actionpack/CHANGELOG>
>

Here is the changelog text:

*Rails 3.0.6 (April 5, 2011)

* Fixed XSS vulnerability in `auto_link`.  `auto_link` no longer marks
  input as html safe.  Please make sure that calls to auto_link() are
  wrapped in a sanitize(), or a raw() depending on the type of input passed
  to auto_link().
  For example:

    <%= sanitize(auto_link(some_user_input)) %>

  Thanks to Torben Schulz for reporting this.  The fix can be found here:
  61ee3449674c591747db95f9b3472c5c3bd9e84d

Use CVE-2011-1497

Thanks.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.
