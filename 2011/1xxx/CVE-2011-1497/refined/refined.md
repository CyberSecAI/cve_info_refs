Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2011-1497:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is in the `auto_link` function of Ruby on Rails. This function was incorrectly marking input as HTML safe, leading to potential XSS issues.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The `auto_link` function was not properly escaping user-provided input, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject malicious scripts into a web page, potentially leading to:
    - Stealing user cookies
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacing the website
    - Other malicious actions in the context of the user's browser.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker could provide malicious input that is processed by the `auto_link` function, typically user-provided text content like blog posts or comments that would be displayed in the application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to be able to provide input that is then processed by the vulnerable `auto_link` function, for example, by submitting a comment or forum post. No special privileges are required other than being able to interact with the application.

**Additional notes:**

- The fix was to stop `auto_link` from marking the input as HTML safe. Developers were instructed to wrap calls to `auto_link` with `sanitize()` or `raw()` depending on the input source to ensure it's either properly escaped or treated as trusted HTML.
- The vulnerability was reported by Torben Schulz.
- The fix can be found in commit `61ee3449674c591747db95f9b3472c5c3bd9e84d` in the rails repository on GitHub.
- The fix was released in Rails version 3.0.6.
