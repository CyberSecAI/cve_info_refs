{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `addmntent()` function in glibc does not report an error status when writing to `/etc/mtab` is truncated due to a low `RLIMIT_FSIZE` value. This allows unprivileged users to corrupt the `/etc/mtab` file.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper error handling in `addmntent()` within glibc.",
      "Suid mount helpers not properly handling potential failures when writing to `/etc/mtab` due to `RLIMIT_FSIZE`.",
      "Lack of proper temporary file usage and cleanup by some mount helpers.",
        "Insufficient input validation and sanitization of special characters when writing to `/etc/mtab`."
    ],
    "impact": "Unprivileged users can corrupt `/etc/mtab`, potentially manipulating mountpoint options or unmounting filesystems without authorization. Arbitrary appending to /etc/mtab through multiple invocations with truncated writes.",
    "attack_vectors": "Local exploitation through the use of suid mount helpers that call `addmntent()` to write to `/etc/mtab`.",
    "required_capabilities": "Ability to execute suid mount helper programs, ability to set `RLIMIT_FSIZE` to a value that is lower than the required write size."
