Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2011-1496

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `tmux` terminal multiplexer's handling of group privileges when invoked with the `-S` option. A Debian-specific patch caused tmux to not properly drop the group privileges it acquired due to its `setgid` installation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect privilege dropping:** When tmux is executed with the `-S` option it does not drop the group privileges obtained by its setgid installation, which allows unintended access to resources related to the group.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege escalation:** An attacker can escalate privileges to that of the `utmp` group, which allows for manipulation of system logs such as `lastlog`, `wtmp`, and `btmp`.
*   **Log manipulation:** By exploiting this vulnerability an attacker could clean logs or use log cleaning software without requiring local root access to the system. This can be used to hide evidence of malicious activity.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local exploitation:** The vulnerability is exploited by a local user with the ability to execute tmux.
*   **Command line:** The vulnerability is triggered via the `-S` option when invoking the `tmux` command.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have a local user account on the system with the ability to execute the `tmux` command.
*   The attacker must be able to execute commands in the shell of the targeted system.

**Summary of Exploit:**

The exploit involves using `tmux -S /tmp/.whateveryouwant -c <command>`. This allows the attacker to execute `<command>` with the effective group ID of the `utmp` group. This capability can then be abused to erase log files or execute other log cleaning utilities, effectively covering tracks.

**Additional notes:**

*   The exploit is specific to `tmux` versions 1.3 and 1.4, and to systems with the Debian patch that introduced the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability does not exist in the oldstable Debian distribution (lenny) because tmux was not included.
*   The vulnerability has been fixed in `tmux` version 1.3-2+squeeze1 for stable distribution (squeeze), and in 1.4-6 for testing (wheezy) and unstable distributions (sid).
