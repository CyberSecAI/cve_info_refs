{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises from the lack of proper permission checks in several JSON scripts used for AJAX interactions in Mahara. These scripts, intended for pagination and data retrieval, fail to verify if the logged-in user has the necessary permissions to access or modify the data they are requesting.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient authorization checks",
      "Information disclosure"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially access sensitive information or perform unauthorized actions by exploiting the lack of proper permission checks. This could include accessing blog posts, task lists, friend lists, or even suspending user accounts, depending on the specific script exploited.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vectors involve sending crafted AJAX requests to the vulnerable JSON scripts. These scripts are typically used for pagination and data retrieval within the Mahara application.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a logged-in user of the Mahara platform. Depending on the specific vulnerability exploited, the attacker might need specific user roles (e.g., administrator) for certain actions (e.g., user suspension)."

  "affected_scripts": [
    "newviewtoken.json.php",
    "admin/users/search.json.php",
     "tasks.json.php",
     "blog index.json.php",
     "viewtasks.json.php",
     "blog posts.json.php",
     "my friends pagination script"
  ],
    "additional_notes": "The identified vulnerabilities are addressed by adding proper permission checks to the vulnerable JSON scripts. These checks ensure that the logged-in user has the required authorization before accessing or modifying the requested data. Patches were created for Mahara versions 1.2, 1.3, and master to address these issues."
