Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2011-1022:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The `cgrulesengd` daemon in `libcgroup` failed to properly verify the origin of Netlink messages it received. It did not check if the messages originated from the kernel, allowing messages from other sources to be accepted as legitimate.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Netlink Message Validation:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper validation of the source of Netlink messages. The daemon did not verify the `from_nla_len` field or the sequence number, which could have indicated that the message came from a process rather than the kernel itself.
*  **Missing Length Check**: The provided content mentions that the code doesn't check `if (from_nla_len != sizeof(from_nla))`, which further contributes to the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Process Placement in Cgroups:** An attacker could craft a malicious Netlink message and send it to the `cgrulesengd` daemon, causing the daemon to place arbitrary processes into incorrect cgroups (control groups). This could allow a local attacker to bypass intended resource restrictions on processes.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** By moving processes into cgroups with different resource limits, an attacker could potentially escalate privileges. For example, a process could be moved to a cgroup with higher memory or CPU allocation than intended, allowing it to consume more resources than it should.
* **Incorrect Resource Allocation:** Processes could be moved to groups with more resources than intended, which can lead to a Denial of Service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack vector is local. An attacker needs to be a local user on the system where the vulnerable `cgrulesengd` daemon is running.
*   **Netlink Socket Manipulation:** The attacker would need to manipulate Netlink sockets to send spoofed messages to the daemon.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** The attacker must have a user account on the target system.
*   **Netlink Socket Access:** The attacker must be able to send messages to the Netlink socket used by `cgrulesengd`.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

*   The vulnerability is in the `cgre_receive_netlink_msg` function within the `cgrulesengd.c` file.
*   The default configuration of `cgrulesengd` does not include any rules, meaning exploitation is only useful if an administrator has specifically configured the daemon to enforce a policy.
*   The issue was reported on the oss-security mailing list on multiple occasions, including a report in November prior to the CVE request.
*   Patches were released to address the issue, and updates were made available in Debian, openSUSE, and Red Hat.

In summary, CVE-2011-1022 is a local privilege escalation vulnerability caused by the insufficient verification of Netlink messages within the `cgrulesengd` daemon of `libcgroup`, enabling attackers to manipulate the placement of processes in cgroups.
