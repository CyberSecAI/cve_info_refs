Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2011-1701

**Vulnerability Description:**
The vulnerability is a remote code execution flaw found in the `nipplib.dll` component of the Novell iPrint Client for Windows. This component is used by both ActiveX and Netscape-compatible browser plugins.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a buffer overflow in the `nipplib.dll`. Specifically, when handling the `profile-name` parameter from a user-specified printer URL, the process blindly copies user-supplied data into a fixed-length buffer located on the heap.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Heap-based buffer overflow:** User-provided data is copied without proper bounds checking into a fixed-size heap buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the target machine. The code will execute with the privileges of the user running the browser, potentially allowing the attacker to gain full control of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Web Page:** An attacker can embed the exploit within a malicious web page. When a user visits this page, the vulnerable `nipplib.dll` component attempts to process the malicious URL, leading to the buffer overflow and RCE.
- **Malicious File:** A malicious file could also be crafted with the malicious URL leading to the buffer overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker can be located remotely and does not need any prior access to the target system.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker requires the user to interact with the exploit by either visiting the malicious web page or opening a malicious file.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is documented in Novell knowledge base article KB 7008723.
- Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers were protected by filter ID 11175.
