Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-1921:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The content from `svn.apache.org` directly mentions `CVE-2011-1921` and provides a link to a descriptive advisory. The advisory text from `subversion.apache.org` further clarifies the vulnerability. The Debian security advisory `DSA-2251-1` and the Ubuntu security notice (`USN-1144-1`) also confirm that this CVE is related to Subversion's `mod_dav_svn` module, which indicates that the content is directly related to CVE-2011-1921.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause lies in how `mod_dav_svn` generates resource URLs for access control checks with Apache's authorization subsystem. Specifically, it incorrectly constructs the URLs in certain cases, leading to Apache checking permissions on the wrong resource.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect URL Generation:** The core vulnerability is the improper generation of resource URLs by `mod_dav_svn` during authorization subrequests.
- **Authorization Bypass:** This incorrect URL generation leads to a bypass of configured access control, potentially allowing unauthorized access to file contents.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could gain unauthorized access to the contents of files that were configured to be unreadable to them.
- The vulnerability is limited to specific scenarios. It only occurs with:
    * Files and directories that are configured as unreadable but are children of a readable directory.
    * The readable directory must have been copied/moved from an unreadable location.
    * The files must have been present in the directory at the time of the copy/move.
    * The attacker must use the 'replay' REPORT mechanism to access the history.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability is triggered through specially crafted HTTP requests to the `mod_dav_svn` module on an Apache server.
- **Specific HTTP Request:** The attacker must use the `replay` REPORT mechanism to access the extended history of the repository.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Subversion server.
- **Understanding of Subversion History:** The attacker needs to be aware of the Subversion repository structure and history to craft the specific requests that trigger the vulnerability.
- **No authentication requirement:** The vulnerability is present in the authorization checks, which happen after the authentication. So, no specific authentication is required.
-  The attacker must also understand how to use the 'replay' REPORT mechanism.

**Technical details and descriptions:**

The advisory from subversion.apache.org provides the following key details:

- The vulnerability is triggered by `mod_dav_svn` when handling access control.
- It occurs when `mod_dav_svn` constructs resource URLs, causing Apache to check permissions for the wrong resources.
- The vulnerability is limited to files and directories that are children of a readable directory copied/moved from an unreadable location, and the files must be present at the time of the copy/move.
- The attacker needs to use the 'replay' REPORT mechanism to exploit the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is not triggerable if `SVNPathAuthz short_circuit` is configured but CVE-2011-1783 makes that a bad workaround.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is specific to `mod_dav_svn` in Apache HTTPD servers. The `svnserve` is not vulnerable.
- Patches are available to address this issue.
- The severity is rated as allowing the leakage of privileged documents to users who shouldn't have access to them.
- There is a mention that the leak may be limited to a specific revision of the documents, but it has not been verified.
- Red Hat's bug report also mentions that this issue affects versions of Subversion as shipped with RHEL 5 and 6, and Fedora releases 13, 14, and 15.

The provided information gives a comprehensive overview of the vulnerability, how it can be exploited, and the necessary steps to mitigate the risk.
