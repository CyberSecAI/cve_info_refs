How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

FreeBSD-SA-11:02.bind Security Advisory
The FreeBSD Project
Topic: BIND remote DoS with large RRSIG RRsets and negative caching
Category: contrib
Module: bind
Announced: 2011-05-28
Credits: Frank Kloeker, Michael Sinatra.
Affects: All supported versions of FreeBSD.
Corrected: 2011-05-28 00:58:19 UTC (RELENG\_7, 7.4-STABLE)
2011-05-28 08:44:39 UTC (RELENG\_7\_3, 7.3-RELEASE-p6)
2011-05-28 08:44:39 UTC (RELENG\_7\_4, 7.4-RELEASE-p2)
2011-05-28 00:33:06 UTC (RELENG\_8, 8.2-STABLE)
2011-05-28 08:44:39 UTC (RELENG\_8\_1, 8.1-RELEASE-p4)
2011-05-28 08:44:39 UTC (RELENG\_8\_2, 8.2-RELEASE-p2)
CVE Name: CVE-2011-1910
For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit .
I. Background
BIND 9 is an implementation of the Domain Name System (DNS) protocols.
The named(8) daemon is an Internet Domain Name Server.
DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) provides data integrity, origin
authentication and authenticated denial of existence to resolvers.
II. Problem Description
Very large RRSIG RRsets included in a negative response can trigger
an assertion failure that will crash named(8) due to an off-by-one error
in a buffer size check.
III. Impact
If named(8) is being used as a recursive resolver, an attacker who
controls a DNS zone being resolved can cause named(8) to crash,
resulting in a denial of (DNS resolving) service.
DNSSEC does not need to be enabled on the resolver for it to be
vulnerable.
IV. Workaround
No workaround is available, but systems not running the BIND DNS server
or using it exclusively as an authoritative name server (i.e., not as a
caching resolver) are not vulnerable.
V. Solution
Perform one of the following:
1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to 7-STABLE or 8-STABLE,
or to the RELENG\_8\_2, RELENG\_8\_1, RELENG\_7\_4, or RELENG\_7\_3
security branch dated after the correction date.
2) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:
The following patches have been verified to apply to FreeBSD
7.3, 7.4, 8.1 and 8.2 systems.
a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-11:02/bind.patch
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-11:02/bind.patch.asc
b) Execute the following commands as root:
# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch
# cd /usr/src/lib/bind
# make obj && make depend && make && make install
# cd /usr/src/usr.sbin/named
# make obj && make depend && make && make install
# /etc/rc.d/named restart
3) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:
Systems running 7.3-RELEASE, 7.4-RELEASE, 8.1-RELEASE, or 8.2-RELEASE
on the i386 or amd64 platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8)
utility:
# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install
VI. Correction details
The following list contains the revision numbers of each file that was
corrected in FreeBSD.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : bind9
Vulnerability  : incorrect boundary condition
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-1910

It was discovered that BIND, an implementation of the DNS protocol,
does not correctly process certain large RRSIG record sets in DNSSEC
responses.  The resulting assertion failure causes the name server
process to crash, making name resolution unavailable.  (CVE-2011-1910)

In addition, this update fixes handling of certain signed/unsigned
zone combinations when a DLV service is used.  Previously, data from
certain affected zones could become unavailable from the resolver.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:9.6.ESV.R4+dfsg-0+lenny2.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:9.7.3.dfsg-1~squeeze2.

The testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution (sid)
will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your bind9 packages.

## ISC BIND named negative caching vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#795694

Original Release Date: 2011-05-27 | Last Revised: 2011-06-01

---

### Overview

ISC BIND contains a vulnerability in the processing of large RRSIG RRsets included in a negative cache response.

### Description

| According to [ISC](http://www.isc.org/software/bind/advisories/cve-2011-1910):  *DNS systems use negative caching to improve DNS response time. This will keep a DNS resolver from repeatedly looking up domains that do not exist. Any NXDOMAIN or NODATA/NOERROR response will be put into the negative cache.The authority data will be cached along with the negative cache information. These authoritative “Start of Authority” (SOA) and NSEC/NSEC3 records prove the nonexistence of the requested name/type. In DNSSEC, all of these records are signed; this adds one additional RRSIG record, per DNSSEC key, for each record returned in the authority section of the response.In this vulnerability, very large RRSIG RRsets included in a negative response can trigger an assertion failure that will crash named (BIND 9 DNS) due to an off-by-one error in a buffer size check.The nature of this vulnerability would allow remote exploit. An attacker can set up a DNSSEC signed authoritative DNS server with large RRSIG RRsets to act as the trigger. The attacker would then find ways to query an organization’s caching resolvers for non-existent names in the domain served by the bad server, getting a response that would “trigger” the vulnerability. The attacker would require access to an organization’s caching resolvers; access to the resolvers can be direct (open resolvers), through malware (using a BOTNET to query negative caches), or through driving DNS resolution (a SPAM run that has a domain in the E-mail that will cause the client to perform a lookup).* |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker can cause the named daemon to crash creating a denial of service condition. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**Users who obtain BIND from a third-party vendor, such as their operating system vendor, should see the vendor information portion of this document for a partial list of affected vendors.This vulnerability is addressed in ISC BIND versions 9.4-ESV-R4-P1, 9.6-ESV-R4-P1, 9.7.3-P1 and 9.8.0-P2. Users of BIND from the original source distribution should upgrade to this version.See also <http://www.isc.org/software/bind/advisories/cve-2011-1910> |
| --- |

| According to [ISC](http://www.isc.org/software/bind/advisories/cve-2011-1910):*Restricting access to the DNS caching resolver infrastructure will provide partial mitigation. Active exploitation can be accomplished through malware or SPAM/Malvertizing actions that will force authorized clients to look up domains that would trigger this vulnerability.* |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=708301#c0)  Mark J. Cox    2011-05-27 08:08:03 UTC  ``` Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures assigned an identifier [CVE-2011-1910](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1910) to the following vulnerability:  A BIND 9 DNS server set up to be a caching resolver is vulnerable to a user querying a domain with very large resource record sets (RRSets) when trying to negatively cache a response. This can cause the BIND 9 DNS server (named process) to crash.   <http://www.isc.org/software/bind/advisories/cve-2011-1910>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=708301#c1)  Mark J. Cox    2011-05-27 08:08:44 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 708296](show_bug.cgi?id=708296) has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=708301#c4)  Mark J. Cox    2011-05-27 09:58:55 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect bind packages shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5. It affected bind97 packages shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and bind packages shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=708301#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-05-31 14:53:01 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2011:0845 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0845.html>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=708301#c6)  Usman Ahmad    2011-06-03 06:52:51 UTC  ```  How can i verify that my current BIND version (9.4.3-P3) is affected by the bug reported in [CVE-2011-1910](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1910). ??   Please guide   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=708301#c7)  Vincent Danen    2011-06-14 19:18:05 UTC  ``` You will need to look at the upstream advisory to find that information out.  We do not ship BIND 9.4.3 in any products, so we have not done any investigation as to whether or not it is vulnerable (it does look like some versions of 9.4 may be vulnerable, judging from the upstream advisory page).   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=708301#c8)  Usman Ahmad    2011-06-28 09:32:08 UTC  ``` Is there any command or stress tool by which i can check that my DNS service is vulnerable or not?   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=708301#c9)  Adam Tkac    2011-06-28 09:54:56 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #8](show_bug.cgi?id=708301#c8)) > Is there any command or stress tool by which i can check that my DNS service is > vulnerable or not?  There is no tool for such checks. However I checked 9.4.3-P3 source and this version is NOT vulnerable.   ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
