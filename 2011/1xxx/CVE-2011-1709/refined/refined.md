Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2011-1709:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a change in how glib (version 2.28 and later) handles URI scheme registrations. Previously, URI handlers were managed through gconf settings. With the change, they are controlled via mime types (specifically `x-scheme-handler/<scheme>`, like `x-scheme-handler/http`). This change allowed an attacker to exploit how GDM (GNOME Display Manager) launches applications.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Uncontrolled URI Handling:** The new mechanism allowed GDM to launch an arbitrary application (typically the default web browser) when a URI scheme is triggered. This was happening under the privileges of the `gdm` user.
*   **Lack of Default URI handler for gdm:** The `gdm` user did not have a custom MIME configuration, so the default system URI handlers would apply.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local File Access:** An attacker, either local or with some local access, could exploit this to gain access to files with the privileges of the `gdm` user.
*   **Potential for Further Exploitation:**  Access as the `gdm` user could potentially be leveraged to escalate privileges or gain access to other resources on the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** A local attacker who could trigger a URI handling mechanism within GDM.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have the ability to trigger URI scheme handling within a GDM session.
*   The attacker needs local access to the machine.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Henne Vogelsang.
*   The fix involves providing a custom MIME configuration for the `gdm` user to prevent the usage of default URI scheme handlers.
*   Red Hat stated that this issue did not affect Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5, or 6.
*   Ubuntu fixed the issue by updating the `gdm` package in Ubuntu 11.04 (Natty) and other affected versions.
*   The issue affected Fedora 15, where it was fixed with a patch.
*   The vulnerability is present in gdm versions using glib 2.28 or later if the system does not configure a custom MIME configuration for the gdm user.
*   The patch was made available on [http://git.gnome.org/browse/gdm/commit/?id=d13dd72531599ab7e4c747db3b58a8c17753e08d](http://git.gnome.org/browse/gdm/commit/?id=d13dd72531599ab7e4c747db3b58a8c17753e08d)
