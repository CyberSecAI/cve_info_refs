| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=729465#c0)  Vincent Danen    2011-08-09 20:15:24 UTC  ``` A number of flaws were reported [1] in eCryptfs that could allow a user to mount or unmount arbitrary locations, and possibly disclose confidential information:  Vasiliy Kulikov of Openwall and Dan Rosenberg discovered that eCryptfs incorrectly validated permissions on the requested mountpoint. A local attacker could use this flaw to mount to arbitrary locations, leading to privilege escalation. ([CVE-2011-1831](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1831))  Vasiliy Kulikov of Openwall and Dan Rosenberg discovered that eCryptfs incorrectly validated permissions on the requested mountpoint. A local attacker could use this flaw to unmount to arbitrary locations, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-1832](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1832))  Vasiliy Kulikov of Openwall and Dan Rosenberg discovered that eCryptfs incorrectly validated permissions on the requested source directory. A local attacker could use this flaw to mount an arbitrary directory, possibly leading to information disclosure. Note that this flaw also requires a fix in the kernel to be complete. ([CVE-2011-1833](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1833))  Dan Rosenberg and Marc Deslauriers discovered that eCryptfs incorrectly handled modifications to the mtab file when an error occurs. A local attacker could use this flaw to corrupt the mtab file, and possibly unmount arbitrary locations, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-1834](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1834))  Marc Deslauriers discovered that eCryptfs incorrectly handled keys when setting up an encrypted private directory. A local attacker could use this flaw to manipulate keys during creation of a new user. ([CVE-2011-1835](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1835))  Marc Deslauriers discovered that eCryptfs incorrectly handled permissions during recovery. A local attacker could use this flaw to possibly access another user's data during the recovery process. ([CVE-2011-1836](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1836))  Vasiliy Kulikov of Openwall discovered that eCryptfs incorrectly handled lock counters. A local attacker could use this flaw to possibly overwrite arbitrary files.

Release information
**Release notes:**

[ Tyler Hicks ]

  \* Remove unnecessary dependencies in the Debian packaging (LP: [#1548975](/bugs/1548975))

    - debian/control: Remove opencryptoki from ecryptfs-utils

      Suggests and libopencryptoki-dev from libecryptfs-dev Depends as

      openCryptoki is not a dependency of eCryptfs.

    - debian/rules: Remove openCryptoki related logic since it was not being

      used and is no longer needed

    - debian/control: Remove libtspi-dev from libecryptfs-dev Depends since

      --disable-tspi is passed to the configure script

    - debian/control: Remove libpkcs11-helper1-dev from libecryptfs-dev

      Depends since --disable-pkcs11-helper is passed to the configure script

    issues on musl libc (LP: [#1514625](/bugs/1514625))

[ Colin Ian King ]

  \* src/daemon/main.c:

    - Static analysis with Clang's scan-build shows that we can potentially

      overflow the input buffer if the input is equal or more than the buffer

      size. Need to guard against this by:

      1. Only reading in input\_size - 1 chars

      2. Checking earlier on to see if input\_size is value to insure that we

         read in at least 1 char

[ Tyler Hicks ]

    - Refuse to mount over non-standard filesystems. Mounting ...

Release information
**Release notes:**

[ Martin Pitt ]

  \* src/utils/ecryptfs-setup-swap:

    - Add setup-swap-check-links.patch: When commenting out existing swap, also

      consider device symlinks like /dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-swap\_1 or

      /dev/disks/by-uuid/ into account. Fixes broken cryptswap under LVM and

      manual setups. (LP: [#1453738](/bugs/1453738))

  \* src/utils/ecryptfs-setup-swap, debian/ecryptfs-utils.postinst:

      unencrypted swap partitions that are referred to by a device link when

      crypttab and fstab have a "cryptswap\*" device referring to them.

  \* debian/control, debian/libecryptfs0.install,

    debian/libecryptfs0.links, debian/libecryptfs0.shlibs:

Release information
**Release notes:**

ecryptfs-utils (106) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

[ Dustin Kirkland and Martin Pitt ]

  \* debian/ecryptfs-utils.postinst: LP: [#953875](/bugs/953875)

    - detect and clean up after nonexisting cryptswap devices

[ Tyler Hicks ]

  \* tests/userspace/Makefile.am: Fix the 'make check' failure present in the

    ecryptfs-utils-105 release tarball. The failure was due to the automake

    file not specifying that some data files should be distributed as part

    of the v1-to-v2-wrapped-passphrase test, causing the test to fail due to

    the missing files.

[ Dustin Kirkland ]

  \* scripts/release.sh:

    - ensure that we try a binary build as part of the release process

    - make sure we're in the original working directory when we release

    - remove the -x option, too noisy

eCryptfs could be tricked into mounting and unmounting arbitrary locations,
and possibly disclose confidential information.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 11.04](/security/notices?release=natty)
* [Ubuntu 10.10](/security/notices?release=maverick)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [ecryptfs-utils](/security/cves?package=ecryptfs-utils) - ecryptfs cryptographic filesystem (utilities)

## Details

Vasiliy Kulikov and Dan Rosenberg discovered that eCryptfs incorrectly

validated permissions on the requested mountpoint. A local attacker could

use this flaw to mount to arbitrary locations, leading to privilege

escalation. ([CVE-2011-1831](/security/CVE-2011-1831))

Vasiliy Kulikov and Dan Rosenberg discovered that eCryptfs incorrectly

validated permissions on the requested mountpoint. A local attacker could

use this flaw to unmount to arbitrary locations, leading to a denial of

service. ([CVE-2011-1832](/security/CVE-2011-1832))

Vasiliy Kulikov and Dan Rosenberg discovered that eCryptfs incorrectly

validated permissions on the requested source directory. A local attacker

could use this flaw to mount an arbitrary directory, possibly leading to

information disclosure. A pending kernel update will provide the other

half of the fix for this issue. ([CVE-2011-1833](/security/CVE-2011-1833))

Dan Rosenberg and Marc Deslauriers discovered that eCryptfs incorrectly

handled modifications to the mtab file when an error occurs. A local

attacker could use this flaw to corrupt the mtab file, and possibly unmount

arbitrary locations, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-1834](/security/CVE-2011-1834))

Marc Deslauriers discovered that eCryptfs incorrectly handled keys when

setting up an encrypted private directory. A local attacker could use this

flaw to manipulate keys during creation of a new user. ([CVE-2011-1835](/security/CVE-2011-1835))

Marc Deslauriers discovered that eCryptfs incorrectly handled permissions

during recovery. A local attacker could use this flaw to possibly access

another user's data during the recovery process. This issue only applied to

Ubuntu 11.04. ([CVE-2011-1836](/security/CVE-2011-1836))

Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that eCryptfs incorrectly handled lock counters.

A local attacker could use this flaw to possibly overwrite arbitrary files.

The default symlink restrictions in Ubuntu 10.10 and 11.04 should protect

against this issue. ([CVE-2011-1837](/security/CVE-2011-1837))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 11.04

* [ecryptfs-utils](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/ecryptfs-utils)
  -
  [87-0ubuntu1.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/ecryptfs-utils/87-0ubuntu1.1)

##### Ubuntu 10.10

* [ecryptfs-utils](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/ecryptfs-utils)
  -
  [83-0ubuntu3.2.10.10.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/ecryptfs-utils/83-0ubuntu3.2.10.10.1)

##### Ubuntu 10.04

* [ecryptfs-utils](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/ecryptfs-utils)
  -
  [83-0ubuntu3.2.10.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/ecryptfs-utils/83-0ubuntu3.2.10.04.1)

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.
