Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2011-1836:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from incorrect permission handling in eCryptfs during the recovery process, specifically within the `ecryptfs-recover-private` utility.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Permissions:** The `ecryptfs-recover-private` utility does not properly manage permissions when creating a temporary mount point during the recovery of encrypted private directories.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Potential Unauthorized Data Access:** A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability to potentially gain access to another user's encrypted data during the recovery process. This occurs due to the insecure permissions on the temporary mount point created by `ecryptfs-recover-private`.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker needs to have a user account on the affected system.
*   **Recovery Process:** The attacker must be able to initiate or manipulate the `ecryptfs-recover-private` utility to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Account:** The attacker needs a valid local user account on the system.
*   **Ability to Initiate Recovery:** The attacker must be able to start or influence the execution of the `ecryptfs-recover-private` utility. This could involve scenarios where a user is recovering their own encrypted data or some other circumstance where the tool is invoked.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The Red Hat Bugzilla entry indicates that CVE-2011-1836 primarily affects Fedora systems, as the `ecryptfs-recover-private` tool wasn't present in older versions of `ecryptfs-utils` shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.
*   Ubuntu's security notice confirms that this vulnerability is specific to the recovery process, and was applicable to Ubuntu 11.04.
*   Patches were provided for various distributions, including Ubuntu and Red Hat, to address this flaw.

In summary, CVE-2011-1836 describes a vulnerability where a local attacker could potentially access other users' data by exploiting insecure permissions during the ecryptfs private directory recovery process. This involves manipulating `ecryptfs-recover-private` to expose another user's data during recovery.
