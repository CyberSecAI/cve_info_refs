Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2011-1015:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the `CGIHTTPServer` module of Python. It arises from improper input validation of HTTP GET requests, specifically when relative paths are used in the URI. The module does not correctly normalize the path before checking if it corresponds to a CGI script.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the disclosure of CGI script source code. Instead of executing the CGI script, the server returns the raw content of the script when a request with a relative path is made.
*   **Improper Input Validation:**  The `is_cgi` function in `CGIHTTPServer` fails to correctly handle relative paths, leading to the disclosure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Information Exposure:** Attackers can access sensitive information within CGI scripts, including potentially passwords, API keys, or other secrets. This can lead to further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending specially crafted HTTP GET requests to a Python server using the `CGIHTTPServer` module.
*   **Relative Paths in URI:** The attack vector involves including relative path components (like `..`, `.`, or missing leading `/`) in the URI of the HTTP GET request targeting a CGI script. For example, instead of requesting `/cgi-bin/script.py`, an attacker could request `cgi-bin/script.py` or `./cgi-bin/script.py` to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server running the vulnerable Python application.
*   **HTTP Request Skills:** The attacker must be able to construct and send HTTP GET requests with specific relative paths.
*   **Knowledge of CGI Script Location:** The attacker must have some knowledge of the path to CGI scripts configured on the target server

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   The vulnerability affects multiple versions of Python, including 2.4, 2.5 and 2.6.
*   The fix involves proper collapsing of the URL path before looking in `cgi_directories`.
*   A new function `_url_collapse_path_split` was introduced to correctly normalize the URL path for checking against the `cgi_directories` list.
*   The fix also includes a new unit test to prevent regression.

This vulnerability is categorized as low severity because it's information disclosure, not code execution. However, the sensitive information disclosed could potentially allow for higher impact attacks.
