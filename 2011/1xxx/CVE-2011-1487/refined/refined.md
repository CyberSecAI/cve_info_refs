  "CVE-2011-1487": {
    "description": "A security flaw was found in the way Perl performed laundering of tainted data. A remote attacker could use this flaw to bypass Perl TAINT mode protection mechanism (leading to commands execution on dirty arguments or file system access via contaminated variables) via specially-crafted input provided to the web application / CGI script.",
    "root_cause": "The `lc()` and `uc()` functions in Perl incorrectly clear the tainted flag on values returned by case conversion, despite documentation stating that regular expressions are the only method for untainting data.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Incorrect tainted flag propagation",
      "Bypass of Perl's TAINT mode protection"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can bypass Perl's TAINT mode, potentially leading to command execution on tainted arguments or unauthorized file system access via contaminated variables.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Specially crafted input to a web application or CGI script using Perl.",
        "Input that is processed by `lc()` or `uc()` functions"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "Remote attacker can provide input to the application.  Requires knowledge of the vulnerability to construct the malicious input to exploit it.",
      "additional_details": "This issue was introduced after Perl 5.10.1. The vulnerability is triggered when tainted data is passed through `lc()` or `uc()`, causing the taint to be incorrectly removed. This affects applications relying on the taint mechanism for security. A public Proof-of-Concept (PoC) is available demonstrating the issue."
