Based on the provided documents, here's the breakdown of CVE-2011-1255:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by the way Internet Explorer handles objects in memory when accessing an object that has not been correctly initialized or has been deleted. This leads to memory corruption, which could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code. Specifically related to how IE handles the Time element.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory corruption vulnerability due to improper object handling.
- Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows the attacker to gain the same user rights as the logged-on user.
- If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker can gain complete control of the system.
- Attackers can then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack vectors:**
- A web-based attack scenario is the most likely vector. The attacker can host a specially crafted website designed to trigger the vulnerability when viewed in Internet Explorer.
- The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept user-provided content.
- Embedding a malicious ActiveX control in an application or Microsoft Office document that hosts the IE rendering engine is also a possible attack vector.
- In all cases, the attacker needs to convince a user to visit the malicious web page or open a malicious document.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to host a malicious website, application or document.
- Requires that a user is logged on and is using an affected version of Internet Explorer to browse the attacker-controlled content.
- No special privileges on the victim's machine are required prior to exploitation.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability specifically affects how Internet Explorer handles objects related to the Time element.
- The vulnerability is rated as "Critical" on client systems and "Moderate" on server systems.
- Internet Explorer 9 is not affected by this vulnerability
- Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration on Windows Servers is a mitigating factor for web based attack vectors, but doesn't fully eliminate the threat if the user has added the malicious site to the trusted zone.
