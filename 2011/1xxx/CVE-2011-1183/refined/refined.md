**CVE ID:** CVE-2011-1183

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
A regression introduced in the fix for CVE-2011-1088 caused security constraints to be ignored under specific conditions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Security constraints defined in the web.xml were not being applied when no login configuration was present and the web application was marked as meta-data complete.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Security constraints that should have been enforced were ignored, potentially allowing unauthorized access to protected resources.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker could exploit this by accessing resources that should have been protected by security constraints.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to send requests to a web application running on a vulnerable version of Tomcat, specifically targeting resources that should be protected by security constraints.
- The web application must not have a login configuration present in the `web.xml` and be marked as meta-data complete.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability was a regression from a previous security fix.
- The vulnerability was specific to Tomcat version 7.0.11.
- The fix was included in Tomcat 7.0.12 and later versions.
- A mitigation was to define a login configuration in web.xml.
