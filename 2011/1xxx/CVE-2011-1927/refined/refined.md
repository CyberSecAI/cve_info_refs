Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-1927:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability arises from a bug in the Linux kernel's IP defragmentation handling, specifically within the `ip_expire()` function, which is called when a fragment reassembly timeout occurs.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

-   **Stale dst pointers:** When a timeout occurs, the function uses the first queued fragment to build an ICMP TIME EXCEEDED message. The queued fragments have weak/stale `dst` pointers because they are outside of the RCU (Read-Copy-Update) critical section, meaning the memory pointed to by dst may have been freed and reused.
-   **Potential NULL pointer dereference:** The `icmp_send()` function might dereference this stale `dst` pointer leading to a crash.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- A remote attacker can trigger a kernel crash due to the null pointer dereference, causing a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**

- Sending fragmented IP packets to a vulnerable Linux system
- Triggering an IP defragmentation timeout.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to send IP packets to the vulnerable host.
- No special privileges are needed beyond network access.

**Technical Details:**

- The fix involves revalidating the route in `ip_expire()` by dropping the stale `dst` and performing route lookup again using `skb_dst_drop()` and `ip_route_input_noref()`.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was introduced by commit `4a94445` and fixed by commit `64f3b9e` in the Linux kernel.
- The vulnerability affects Linux kernel version 2.6.38.
