- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A timing window allows for a double delete of an `ORB_Request` object, leading to heap corruption.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Double free vulnerability in the handling of `ORB_Request` objects during outbound IIOP requests under high load.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Storage corruption, leading to an ABEND0C4 error and termination of the WebSphere Application Server for z/OS controller.
- **Attack vectors**: High volume of outbound IIOP requests, particularly when the backend server goes down, exposing the timing window.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to generate a high volume of IIOP requests to a backend server that might go down. This would typically involve an application or client that interacts with the vulnerable server.
