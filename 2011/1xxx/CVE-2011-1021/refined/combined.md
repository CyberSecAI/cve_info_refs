ACPI: Split out custom\_method functionality into an own driver

```
With /sys/kernel/debug/acpi/custom_method root can write
to arbitrary memory and increase his priveleges, even if
these are restricted.

-> Make this an own debug .config option and warn about the
security issue in the config description.

-> Still keep acpi/debugfs.c which now only creates an empty
   /sys/kernel/debug/acpi directory. There might be other
   users of it later.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=680841#c0)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2011-02-28 06:26:29 UTC  ``` Since /sys/kernel/debug/acpi/custom_method can be used to write arbitrary kernel memory (<http://jon.oberheide.org/files/american-sign-language.c>), it should be able to be left out of the kernel for system owners that want to be as defensive as possible to potential attacks, even from the root user. See as examples: CONFIG_DEVKMEM, CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM, and /proc/sys/kernel/modules_disabled.  <https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/2/22/369>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=680841#c5)  John Kacur    2011-04-18 22:02:35 UTC  ``` I believe this is the upstream solution ed3aada1bf34c5a9e98af167f125f8a740fc726a   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=680841#c9)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2011-06-06 02:58:48 UTC  ``` Statement:  The version of Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5, and 6 as they did not include upstream commit a1a541d8 and a25ee920 that introduced the problem. This has been addressed in Red Hat Enterprise MRG via <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-1253.html>.  Notes:  This requires debugfs to be mounted on a local system in order to have access to the custom_method file. Debugfs is not mounted by default. You need to run "mount -t debugfs nodev /sys/kernel/debug" as root first.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=680841#c10)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2011-06-08 02:43:20 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=680841#c5)) > I believe this is the upstream solution > ed3aada1bf34c5a9e98af167f125f8a740fc726a  No this is not the upstream solution. This patch is for [CVE-2010-4347](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-4347). For [CVE-2011-1021](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1021), please refer to <https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/2/22/369>.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=680841#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-09-12 19:46:21 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    MRG for RHEL-6 v.2  Via RHSA-2011:1253 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-1253.html>   ``` |  |

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.
