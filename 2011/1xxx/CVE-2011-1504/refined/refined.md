**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to improper handling of user-supplied input, specifically within the Liferay application. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the application's web pages.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary weakness is a lack of proper input sanitization or output encoding of user-supplied data before it is rendered within the Liferay application.
*  **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to various impacts including:
    *   **Cross-site scripting (XSS):** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into a page viewed by other users.
    *   **Session Hijacking:** An attacker may gain access to the user's session information, potentially leading to unauthorized actions on behalf of the victim.
    *   **Data theft or manipulation:** An attacker may be able to access sensitive data or manipulate the displayed content.
    *   **Malware distribution:** An attacker may be able to redirect a victim to a malicious website or inject a malicious download.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the Liferay application itself. Attackers could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious JavaScript into user-supplied data, which is then rendered by the Liferay server to other users. This input is not sanitized and results in script execution.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need the ability to inject script into a user-controlled field or parameter of the Liferay application. The attacker could be a regular authenticated user.
