| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=696927#c0)  Petr Matousek    2011-04-15 10:37:25 UTC  ``` [CVE-2011-1583](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1583) It has been found that xc_try_bzip2_decode() and xc_try_lzma_decode() decode routines did not properly check for possible buffer size overflow in the decoding loop. Specially crafted kernel image file could be created that would trigger allocation of a small buffer resulting in buffer overflow with user supplied data.  [CVE-2011-3262](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-3262) Additionally, several integer overflows and lack of error/range checking that could result in the loader reading its own address space or could lead to an infinite loop have been found.  A privileged DomU user could use these flaws to cause denial of service or, possibly, execute arbitrary code in Dom0.   Only management domains with 32-bit userland are vulnerable.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=696927#c11)  Laszlo Ersek    2011-04-22 08:44:55 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 494129](attachment.cgi?id=494129&action=diff) [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=494129&action=edit) 5.7 backport of Xen Unstable upstream patch   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=696927#c19)  Petr Matousek    2011-05-09 10:56:45 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect the versions of the Xen package as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 6. This has been addressed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 via <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0496.html>.   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=696927#c20)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-05-09 15:50:56 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2011:0496 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0496.html>   ``` |  |

Vendors and users are urged to apply the attached patch.  Some defensive workarounds are available.  ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================   1. Problems  -----------  The functions which interpret the kernel image supplied for a paravirtualised guest, and decompress it into memory when booting the domain, are incautious.  Specifically:   (i) Integer overflow in the decompression loop memory allocator might      result in overrunning the buffer used for the decompressed image;  (ii) Integer overflows and lack of checking of certain length fields      can result in the loader reading its own address space beyond the      size of the supplied kernel image file.  (iii) Lack of error checking in the decompression loop can lead to an      infinite loop.   2. Impact  ---------  An attacker who can supply a kernel image to be booted as a paravirtualised guest might be able to:   (i) Escalate privilege, taking control of the management domain and     hence the entire machine.   (ii) Gain knowledge the contents of memory in the management tools.    Depending on the toolstack in use this might contain sensitive    information such as domain management or VNC passwords.   (iii) Cause an infinite loop in the management software, resulting in    denial of service (and excessive resource consumption by the    management domain).   3. Who is affected, and workarounds  -----------------------------------  Systems where the guest kernel is provided by untrusted guest administrators ARE vulnerable; this is the case whether the guest kernel is provided by ad-hoc or out-of-band means, or via the "pygrub" tool which automatically finds the kernel in the guest filesystem.  Systems which permit only blessed or approved paravirtualised kernel images to be used are NOT vulnerable; preventing attackers from providing hostile kernel images will completely prevent the attacks.  Systems which only run fully virtualised ("HVM") guests are NOT vulnerable.  With respect to each of the three specific issues:   (i) Only management domains with 32-bit userland are vulnerable.     The attack can be defeated by running the management tools with a     virtual address space ulimit of less than 2Gby, for example by     putting  "ulimit -v 1000000"  in an appropriate point in the     system startup files.   (ii) In the xen.org "xend" management toolstack this exposure is    indeed limited to VNC passwords (and general information about the    number of running domains); in such systems this attack will be    complicated to carry out and not likely to be rewarding.     In the systems using the xen.org "xl" management tool this exposure    is limited to information about the specific guest in question and    is therefore very low impact.   (iii) This attack is very easy to carry out but the impact is low.    Running VMs are not adversely affected.  There is no known    workaround.  In theory it might be possible to pre-validate kernel images.  Images which are accepted and booted by a fixed version of xen are safe to pass to unfixed versions.    4. Patch information  --------------------  The proposed patch is attached.  There are three separate versions:     cve-2011-1583-4.1.patch        for Xen 4.1    cve-2011-1583-4.0.patch        for Xen 3.4 and 4.0    cve-2011-1583-unstable.patch   for the xen-unstable development tree  $ sha256sum cve-2011-1583-*.patch  f51b774eec945c48a0e91ed17df3cee07027d64c7e7c5783f7446507dbcc201b   cve-2011-1583-4.0.patch 2a54dbb1984a966e8d90da9f4fb10c30ff197d13603943c38488122044bb977d   cve-2011-1583-4.1.patch 0299618a56c9ad86d41a1d9879cb373bdef5105592f9a1f2390af3bf94c404be   cve-2011-1583-unstable.patch $ sha1sum cve-2011-1583-*.patch  41e2a653313d13a036e30c1c160e402e380bc377  cve-2011-1583-4.0.patch d2bad52b255d7475709b49420db4ce41b2a108f3  cve-2011-1583-4.1.patch 0b25612d708c71143498d52af276721a4bf1c3fa  cve-2011-1583-unstable.patch $  These have been applied and pushed to xen-unstable.hg (23322:d9982136d8fa), xen-4.1-testing (23042:e2e575f8b5d9) and xen-4.0-testing (21482:c2adc059e931).

## Synopsis

Important: xen security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2011%3A0496)

## Topic

Updated xen packages that fix several security issues are now available for
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
CVE link in the References section.

## Description

The xen packages contain administration tools and the xend service for
managing the kernel-xen kernel for virtualization on Red Hat Enterprise
Linux.

It was found that the xc\_try\_bzip2\_decode() and xc\_try\_lzma\_decode() decode
routines did not correctly check for a possible buffer size overflow in the
decoding loop. As well, several integer overflow flaws and missing
error/range checking were found that could lead to an infinite loop. A
privileged guest user could use these flaws to crash the guest or,
possibly, execute arbitrary code in the privileged management domain
(Dom0). (CVE-2011-1583)

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.
