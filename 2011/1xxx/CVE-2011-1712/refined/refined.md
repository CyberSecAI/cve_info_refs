Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies within the `generate-id()` function of the XSLT processor in multiple browsers (Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Safari). This function was designed to generate a unique identifier for each node in an XML document. However, instead of creating a truly unique, abstract identifier, the implementation exposed underlying memory addresses.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap Address Leak:** The `generate-id()` function, when called, returns a string that directly or indirectly reveals the memory address of an object on the heap.
    *   **Firefox:** Directly outputs the heap address in hexadecimal.
    *   **Internet Explorer:** Outputs a base32 encoded string that translates to a heap address
    *   **Safari:** Outputs a value derived from a heap address.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Leak:** The primary impact is an information leak, specifically the disclosure of heap memory addresses.
*   **ASLR Bypass Potential:** This leak is not a vulnerability in itself, but it could be combined with other vulnerabilities. An attacker could use the leaked heap addresses to bypass Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), a security mechanism that randomizes memory locations to make exploitation harder. If an attacker gains knowledge of a heap address, they can predict locations of other objects in memory, which can be used to facilitate more complex attacks such as code injection.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **XSLT Processing:** The attack vector is through the processing of XSLT stylesheets that use the `generate-id()` function. When a vulnerable browser renders a webpage that uses an XSLT transform with the generate-id() function, it exposes the memory address.
*   **Web-based:** An attacker can create a malicious web page with an XSLT transform that calls the `generate-id()` function, and when a user opens the page in a vulnerable browser, the memory address is exposed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Serve Malicious Content:** An attacker needs to be able to serve a web page or XML document that contains an XSLT stylesheet using the vulnerable function to a user with a vulnerable browser.
*   **No Direct Memory Corruption:** The attacker cannot directly corrupt memory using this vulnerability, but it allows an attacker to gain knowledge of memory layout. This information may be used to exploit memory corruption vulnerabilities.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   The issue was reported by Chris Evans of the Chrome Security Team.
*   The vulnerability affects Firefox, Internet Explorer and Safari
*   Opera was noted as potentially affected but inconclusive.
*   Chrome was already patched when the vulnerability was discovered
*   The provided blog also includes details on how the heap address is encoded/derived in each of the vulnerable browsers.
*   The bug report in Bugzilla mentions the fix involved calculating a difference of memory addresses rather than exposing the addresses themselves
*   The vulnerability was assigned CVE-2011-1202.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in Firefox versions 3.5.19, 3.6.17, 4.0.1, and SeaMonkey 2.0.14.
*  A patch was created to fix the issue
