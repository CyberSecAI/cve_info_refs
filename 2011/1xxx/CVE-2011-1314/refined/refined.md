{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Incorrect serialization of close operations in WebSphere Application Server's messaging engine, causing threads to wait for the completion of active work items before processing the close operation.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper serialization of close operations",
      "In-line processing of close operations on network receive threads instead of dispatching to worker threads"
    ],
    "impact": "The system appears hung as messages are not consumed from queues once the system enters a state where multiple threads are blocked waiting for a lock. The messaging engine becomes serial in its operation, blocking network receive threads and preventing new work from being processed until close operations are handled, which occurs serially.",
    "attack_vectors": "Network connections to the queue manager, triggering concurrent close operations from applications.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to establish network connections to the queue manager and trigger a high number of close operations concurrently."
  },
  "additional_details": "The problem occurs when applications connect over a network to the queue manager, and a large number of close operations occur concurrently. The fix introduces a new sib.properties tuning parameter com.ibm.ws.sib.jfapchannel.ALWAYS_DISPATCH_CLOSE. When set to true, all close operations are dispatched to the messaging engine's worker threads, rather than sometimes being processed serially on the network receive threads."
