Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2011-1266:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a memory corruption issue within the Microsoft implementation of Vector Markup Language (VML) in Internet Explorer. Specifically, the vulnerability occurs when Internet Explorer tries to access a VML object that has not been correctly initialized or has been deleted from memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-   **Memory Corruption:** Improper handling of VML objects in memory, leading to memory corruption.
-   **Use-After-Free:**  The vulnerability arises from an attempt to access memory that has already been freed or was never properly initialized.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.
-   **Privilege Escalation:**  The attacker gains the same level of user rights as the currently logged-in user. If the user has administrative rights, the attacker can take full control of the system.
-   **System Compromise:** An attacker can then install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **Web-based Attacks:** Attackers can create specially crafted web pages containing malicious VML code to exploit the vulnerability.
-   **Compromised Websites:** Attackers can compromise websites or use websites that accept user-provided content/advertisements to deliver the malicious VML content.
-  **Email/Instant Messenger:** An attacker can convince the user to click on a malicious link through email or instant messages leading to an attacker controlled webpage.
- **Office Documents:** By embedding an ActiveX control marked "safe for initialization" in an application or Microsoft Office document.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Ability to create malicious VML:** Attackers need to be able to create a malicious VML webpage.
-   **User Interaction:** Attackers need to entice victims into viewing the crafted content using a web browser such as Internet Explorer.

**Additional Technical Details (from MS Security Bulletin):**
-   The update modifies how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory to prevent memory corruption.
-   Exploitation is more likely when a user has administrative privileges.
-   Internet Explorer 9 is not affected by the vulnerability.
-  Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003, 2008, and 2008 R2 have Enhanced Security Configuration (ESC) enabled by default, which serves as a mitigating factor.
-   Microsoft had not received reports of exploitation in the wild when the bulletin was released.

**Workarounds:**
-   Read e-mails in plain text format.
-   Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to "High" to block ActiveX controls and Active Scripting.
-   Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone.

**Severity:**
-   Rated as **Critical** for Internet Explorer 6, 7 and 8 on Windows client systems.
-  Rated as **Moderate** for Internet Explorer 6, 7 and 8 on Windows Server systems

**Microsoft Exploitability Index:**
- The Microsoft Exploitability Index for this vulnerability was set to "1" meaning that  "Exploitation more likely".

**Detection and Deployment Tools:**
- Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA)
- Windows Server Update Services (WSUS)
- Systems Management Server (SMS)
