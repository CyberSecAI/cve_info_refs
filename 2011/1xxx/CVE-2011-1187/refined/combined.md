Release updates from the Chrome team

## [Chrome Stable Release](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2011/03/chrome-stable-release.html "Chrome Stable Release")

Tuesday, March 8, 2011

The Google Chrome team is excited to announce the arrival of Chrome 10.0.648.127 to the Stable Channel for Windows, Mac, Linux, and Chrome Frame.  Chrome 10 contains some really great improvements including:

* New version of V8 - Crankshaft - which greatly improves javascript performance
* New settings pages that open in a tab, rather than a dialog box
* Improved security with malware reporting and disabling outdated plugins by default
* Sandboxed Adobe Flash on Windows
* Password sync as part of Chrome Sync now enabled by default
* GPU Accelerated Video
* Background WebApps
* webNavigation extension API (experimental but ready for testing)

Security fixes and rewards:Please see [the Chromium security page](http://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security) for more detail. Note that the referenced bugs may be kept private until a majority of our users are up to date with the fix.

As can be seen, a few lower-severity issues were rewarded on account of being particularly interesting or clever. And some rewards were issued at the $1500 and $2000 level, reflecting bug reports where the reporter also worked with Chromium developers to provide an accepted patch.

We would also like to thank Ben Hawkes of the Google Security Team, Sergey Glazunov, Martin Barbella and “temp01irc” for working with us during the development cycle and helping prevent bugs from ever reaching the stable channel.

Last, but not least, we’d like to offer special thanks (plus additional rewards to those listed above) to Christian Holler. This is for working with us on his grammar-based fuzzing project, resulting in a more stable and secure “Crankshaft” engine for v8.

More on what's new at the [Official Chrome Blog](http://chrome.blogspot.com/).  You can find full details about the changes that are in Chrome 10 in the [SVN revision log](http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/perf/dashboard/ui/changelog.html?url=/trunk/src&range=72316:67679&mode=html). If you find new issues, please let us know by [filing a bug](http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/entry). Want to change to another Chrome release channel?

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Johnny, you might know our error handling code well enough to know what's going on here?

| --- | --- | --- |
| [Comment 6](/show_bug.cgi?id=624621#c6)• 14 years ago |
|  | |

What's going on is that nsScriptLoader::EvaluateScript passes aRequest->mFinalURI as the script filename when evaluating the script. And JS exceptions include the filename of the script in the data they expose. So that means that as long as you can get hold of exceptions from the script you know what URI the script was loaded from. We've closed this hole for window.onerror by sanitizing the information the onerror handler gets when the exception is thrown from an off-site script. But the code in [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=624621#c0 "VERIFIED FIXED - HTTP Redirections and remote content can be read by javascript errors.") or [comment 1](/show_bug.cgi?id=624621#c1 "VERIFIED FIXED - HTTP Redirections and remote content can be read by javascript errors.") gets hold of exceptions by overriding the "name" getter on the exception's prototype object.
Note that we're using mFinalURI here due to the fix for [bug 461735](/show_bug.cgi?id=461735 "RESOLVED FIXED - [FIX]Security: theft of strings cross-domain with redirect, <script src> and window.onerror"). The fundamental issue in that bug is that we need to know that the script was cross-origin to avoid giving too much information to the onerror handler.
Fundamentally, as long as we expose the script filename to the web site at all, and only have the single field to work with for both the "filename" and the concept of "where did this script come from", this is a no-win situation. If I had my way, then in the redirect case, we should be using the pre-redirect URI as the filename for reporting purposes, and the post-redirect URI for any security checks... but JSScript just doesn't let us store both pieces of information.
As far as why the code in [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=624621#c0 "VERIFIED FIXED - HTTP Redirections and remote content can be read by javascript errors.") and [comment 1](/show_bug.cgi?id=624621#c1 "VERIFIED FIXED - HTTP Redirections and remote content can be read by javascript errors.") works at all, the reason the 'name' getter is called is that js\_ReportUncaughtException calls js\_ValueToString on the exception, which lands us in exn\_toString, which gets the "name" and "message" properties off the object in a way that lands us in the getter defined by the page JS above. We could try to fix this, which would at least help pages that don't examine the exceptions themselves... but I think that would still be a band-aid; the real fix is to store both "filenames" in the script and use the right one for the right purpose.Status: UNCONFIRMED → NEWEver confirmed: true

mrbkap, this is exactly what I was worried about when we allowed the error message of exceptions to cross different origin compartments. I still think we should just clamp those to a generic error.

yes that's accurate, and not only the first bareword, since in some cases not only that (eg. if it starts with a 0, or contains a - etc..) will fails with a syntax error.
This, however was enough to create a security vulnerability in Google.. (that here, Daniel reported to us).
So yes, sorry, it's not arbitrary data, it's.. some what limited data.

Hi all!
Sorry if this is the wrong place to have this discussion.
After reading the comments of this bug, I was hoping I could get the security team's point of view regarding if redirects shouldn't be used to pass security sensitive tokens anymore?
Because plugins and browsers have vulnerabilities that leak redirects more frequent that other vulnerabilities, such as uxss, or at least that's my impression, also it's worth noting that in Mozilla it seems like reading http redirects is considered medium risk, vs. uxss that is considered high risk, while in some web apps, reading redirects almost represents the same risk.
I can't give a lot of details, but several popular and sensitive websites (as well as some open authentication and identification protocols) are affected by this type of bugs in a way that it creates very high risk vulnerabilities, and we feel bad for not being able to fix them ourselves (though, I've been studying Spidermonkey/Gecko2 code, so hopefully one of this days I'll be able to contribute with something more than just bugs).
Anyways, just some thoughts :) since I am considering to start filing bugs internally in Google for features that set sensitive tokens in URL redirects because I just feel like they are vulnerable.

I talked to Boris and his non-bandaid solution in [comment 6](/show_bug.cgi?id=624621#c6 "VERIFIED FIXED - HTTP Redirections and remote content can be read by javascript errors.") makes sense to me. From the JS side, we'd just add an extra "origin principals" field to scripts that DOM sets to mFinalURI. This would let the DOM set script->filename to the pre-redirect URI (fixing the hole) and use the "origin principals" for making onerror security judgments.
We also discussed how this might work with zero JS engine additions (keeping an external hash table) but this is gross in two ways: dealing with script lifetimes and transitively setting the origin principals for nested scripts.

This adds an API to attach originPrincipals to a script. See comment in jsapi.h. Note: scripts created via Function/eval will get the calling script's originPrincipals (for both direct and indirect eval). Does that sound right?

add JS engine API for originPrincipals
It's not clear to me what enforces the equality js\_XDRScript asserts.
jsscript.h should document the "principals implies originprincipals" invariant.
Other than that, this looks good, I think. I didn't review the nitty-gritty details, obviously.

The informal reasoning I passed by mrbkap was: we don't XDR content which should be the only place we have differing originPrincipals. My worry was 2x calls to the principal transcoder would be bad for startup XDR time.

There's nothing preventing extensions from loading scripts over https://, in which case the origin principal will be https:// while the principal is system.
Can we instead make XDR smart about the (common) case where the two principals are pointer-equal and only serialize once in that case? That seems like a better approach.

err, I meant to say "XDR'ing scripts where script->principals != script->originPrincipals".

Hm, why not just add a hook that allows to sanitize the information that goes into error instances that the compiler creates? Also why cannot we make JSScript::filename different from the URL stored in JSScript::principals so JSScript::filename would point to the name as used in the script tag?

See [comment 6](/show_bug.cgi?id=624621#c6 "VERIFIED FIXED - HTTP Redirections and remote content can be read by javascript errors."), which discusses the reason at length, with links to the relevant bugs.

Hmm. So there's still a jsapi bit missing here from my point of view. What I have to work with is a JSErrorReport (well, and JSContext and a const char\* message), not a JSScript.
Can we propagate the origin principal to the JSErrorReport?

Yes, this can be done; PopulateReportBlame seems like the only place that initializes JSErrorReport::filename, so it can just fill in the origin principals as well.
The scary part, of course is ref-counting the principals correctly. JSErrorReport has no destructor so I'll need to track down all the places we free it and make them call a destructor that can drop the ref. Blech.

This makes everything after that point private in 32-bit builds, which doesn't so much compile. Why is that even needed?

Oops, I accidentally added the missing 'public:' in a down patch. The padding is needed b/c JSScript is a GC-thing and its size must be a multiple of sizeof(Value).

True, but \*report may be copied into a new malloc()'d JSErrorReport which is stored in an exception object. But you're right that the comment is overly general; perhaps it should just say "Callers only pass stack-local JSErrorReport objects.".

There was, in particular, one jsreftest failure:

Looks to me like the test assertion is just assuming this bug and needs fixing. I'll do that and push this again.

bc, what's a reasonable test assertion here that would actually work on the remote browser setup?

[Bug 664857](/show_bug.cgi?id=664857 "RESOLVED FIXED - Create a 'reftest' alias for 'reftest-1' and 'reftest-2' linux-android unittest suites") invites you to actually enjoy and be entirely satisfied with the fact that "-u jsreftest" is broken, and that you must always say "-u jsreftest,jsreftest-1,jsreftest-2,jsreftest-3" until you know which hunk of Android you need, and the same with crashtests and reftests.

The current version is:
expect = /(Script error.|Permission denied for <file:\/\/> to get property XPCComponents.classes)/;
but [bug 570807 comment 2](/show_bug.cgi?id=570807#c2 "RESOLVED INVALID - Intermittent failure in jsreftest.html?test=js1_5/Regress/regress-328897.js") failed trying to match:
Permission denied for <<http://10.250.48.217:30139>> to get property XPCComponents.classes
I think this would work in both the file based reftests and the web based android tests:
expect = /(Script error.|Permission denied for <[^>]+> to get property XPCComponents.classes)/;
jmaher: you agree?

changing this to be a more general regex sounds like a good idea. For all android automation we do http instead of file.

We should move forward with a new fix." So if you don't think this bug should be fixed on ESR, I think you need to make the case for an exception.

When I evaluate the following in the error console:
document.location="data:text/html,<script>window.SyntaxError.prototype.\_\_defineGetter\_\_('name',function(){var
e=this;for(var j in
e){if(j!='name')console.log(j,e[j])}});</script><script
src='<http://google.com/>'></script>"
I get "Source File: <http://www.google.com>" in the error for both 11 and nightly. The error is "Error: SyntaxError: syntax error" in nightly and just "Error: Syntax Error" in 11.
Did we really fix this? If so, how do I verify the fix correctly? I spoke to Dan Veditz about this and he didn't get any further than me.

Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information. This wiki page is dedicated to collect a comprehensive list of whiteboard tags used in the Mozilla project.

## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)
