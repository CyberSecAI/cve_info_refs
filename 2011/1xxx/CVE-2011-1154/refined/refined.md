  "cveId": "CVE-2011-1154",
  "description": "A shell command injection flaw was found in the way the logrotate utility handled shred configuration directive (intended to ensure the log files are not readable after their scheduled deletion). A local attacker could use this flaw to execute arbitrary system commands (if the logrotate was run under privileged system user account, root) when the logrotate utility was run on a log file, within attacker controllable directory.",
  "vulnerability": {
    "rootCause": "The logrotate utility does not properly sanitize input when using the shred configuration directive, leading to shell command injection.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input sanitization",
      "Shell command injection"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary command execution with the privileges of the user running logrotate (typically root).",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Local exploitation",
       "Manipulating log files or directories to inject malicious commands into logrotate's shred command."
    ],
     "requiredCapabilities": "Local user access with the ability to modify log files or directories processed by logrotate."
  }
