Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2011-1524:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The Symantec LiveUpdate Administrator (LUA) web frontend does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the username field during login.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is an XSS flaw. Malicious HTML or script code injected into the username field during login gets stored in the event log. When an administrator views the log, the injected script executes within the administrator's browser session in the context of the Web Administrator frontend.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary HTML/Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to run arbitrary HTML and JavaScript within the administrator's browser session.
- **CSRF Attacks:** An attacker can use injected code to perform Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks, potentially allowing the attacker to modify settings, create administrative accounts, and more within the LUA system.
- **Cookie Stealing:** The injected script could potentially be used to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, potentially leading to further unauthorized access.
- **Site Manipulation:** An attacker could manipulate how the site is rendered to the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable.
- **Login Page:** The attack is initiated by submitting malicious input into the username field on the LUA login page.
- **Event Log:** The injected code is executed when an administrator views the event log, where the malicious username value is displayed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the LUA application.
- **No Authentication Required for initial injection:** The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated to inject the malicious code in the username field. However, they will need a user to view the logs to trigger the XSS.
- **Social Engineering:**  The attacker needs to rely on the admin logging into the LUA and viewing the event log.

**Additional Information:**
- **Affected versions:**  Symantec LiveUpdate Administrator (LUA) before 2.3 is vulnerable. Specifically, versions <= 2.2.2.9 are mentioned as vulnerable in one of the advisories.
- **Exploit examples:** The provided exploit code includes payloads for displaying an alert box and adding an administrative user. The exploit requires the attacker to setup an HTTP server to serve an HTML page that is referenced by the injected code.
- **Mitigation:** Symantec released version 2.3 to address the vulnerability.
- **CVSS Score:** CVSS Base Score: 4.3/10 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)
