Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-1292 CVE-2011-1293 CVE-2011-1440 CVE-2011-1444
                 CVE-2011-1797 CVE-2011-1799

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in the Chromium browser.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:

CVE-2011-1292

  Use-after-free vulnerability in the frame-loader implementation in Google
  Chrome allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly
  have unspecified other impact via unknown vectors.

CVE-2011-1293

  Use-after-free vulnerability in the HTMLCollection implementation in Google
  Chrome allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have
  unspecified other impact via unknown vectors.

CVE-2011-1440

  Use-after-free vulnerability in Google Chrome allows remote attackers to cause
  a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via vectors
  related to the ruby element and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) token sequences.

CVE-2011-1444

  Race condition in the sandbox launcher implementation in Google Chrome on
  Linux allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have
  unspecified other impact via unknown vectors.

CVE-2011-1797

  Google Chrome does not properly render tables, which allows remote attackers
  to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via
  unknown vectors that lead to a "stale pointer."

CVE-2011-1799

  Google Chrome does not properly perform casts of variables during interaction
  with the WebKit engine, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
  service or possibly have unspecified other impact via unknown vectors.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 6.0.472.63~r59945-5+squeeze5.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems will be fixed soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 11.0.696.68~r84545-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your chromium-browser packages.
