Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-1797:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is related to how WebKit renders tables, specifically involving a "stale pointer." The issue stems from premature removal of a table caption child element. The `removeChild` function was being called on a table caption which was already handled during the destroy call leading to a double free condition and a stale pointer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Stale pointer
- Use-after-free

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of service (application termination).
- Potential for arbitrary code execution, though not explicitly stated in all sources.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  The vulnerability can be triggered by visiting a maliciously crafted website that exploits the table rendering flaw in WebKit.
-  Specific vectors leading to the stale pointer are not described.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to induce the vulnerable application (Safari/iTunes) to render a specially crafted HTML table.
- This can likely be achieved through a malicious web page or similar means.
- No special position needed other than ability to get user to render HTML content.

**Additional Notes:**
- This issue is present in multiple products that rely on WebKit, including Safari, iTunes, and Chromium.
- The fix involves a code change in `WebCore::RenderTable::recalcCaption` where the unnecessary call to `removeChild` is removed.

**Summary of relevant information:**

- **Apple iTunes 10.5:**  WebKit vulnerability related to table rendering and a stale pointer, potentially leading to termination or arbitrary code execution (Windows).
- **Apple Safari 5.1 and 5.0.6:** WebKit vulnerability with similar impact to the iTunes vulnerability, mentioned as a memory corruption issue.
- **Apple iOS 5:** WebKit vulnerability related to a "stale pointer in table captioning".
- **Chromium:** The issue was reported as a vulnerability in the Chromium browser where "Google Chrome does not properly render tables, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via unknown vectors that lead to a "stale pointer.".
- **WebKit:** A code fix was implemented to address the stale pointer when removing a child of a table caption and destroying it.
