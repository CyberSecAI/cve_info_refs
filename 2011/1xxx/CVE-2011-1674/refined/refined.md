CVE-2011-1674:

The provided content describes vulnerabilities in NetGear WNAP210 ProSafe Wireless-N Access Point.

Vulnerability 1: Remote Administrator Password Disclosure

*   **Root Cause:** The device's configuration file, which contains the administrator password in plaintext, can be downloaded without authentication.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of authentication for accessing the configuration backup file.
*   **Attack Vector:** An unauthenticated attacker with network access to the device can navigate to `http://NetGearDeviceIP/BackupConfig.php` to download the configuration file.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of the administrator password, potentially leading to complete device compromise.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Network access to the device.

Vulnerability 2: Administrative Web Page Login Bypass

*   **Root Cause:** The `recreate.php` page allows bypassing the login page.
*   **Weakness:** Insecure page (`recreate.php`) allows bypassing the login.
*   **Attack Vector:** An unauthenticated attacker with network access to the device can navigate to `http://NetGearDeviceIP/recreate.php`, which displays "recreateok". Then, navigating to `http://NetGearDeviceIP/index.php` grants direct access to the device's configuration web page without authentication.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the device's configuration, potentially leading to complete device compromise.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Network access to the device.
