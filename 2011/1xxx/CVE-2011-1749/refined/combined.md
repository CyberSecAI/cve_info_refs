| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=697975#c0)  Vincent Danen    2011-04-19 19:45:20 UTC  ``` It was found that mount.nfs suffers from the same flaw as other mount helpers (see [CVE-2011-1089](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1089)).  Instead of using addmntent(), nfs-utils implements its own similar function (nfs_addmntent()) which also fails to anticipate whether resource limits would interfere with correctly writing to /etc/mtab.  A local user could use this to trigger corruption of the /etc/mtab file via a process with a small RLIMIT_FSIZE value.  In nfs-utils-1.2.3/support/nfs/nfs_mntent.c:  126 int 127 nfs_addmntent (mntFILE *mfp, struct mntent *mnt) { 128     char *m1, *m2, *m3, *m4; 129     int res; 130  131     if (fseek (mfp->mntent_fp, 0, SEEK_END)) 132         return 1;           /* failure */ 133  134     m1 = mangle(mnt->mnt_fsname); 135     m2 = mangle(mnt->mnt_dir); 136     m3 = mangle(mnt->mnt_type); 137     m4 = mangle(mnt->mnt_opts); 138  139     res = fprintf (mfp->mntent_fp, "%s %s %s %s %d %d\n", 140                m1, m2, m3, m4, mnt->mnt_freq, mnt->mnt_passno); 141  142     free(m1); 143     free(m2); 144     free(m3); 145     free(m4); 146     return (res < 0) ? 1 : 0; 147 }  The above function should use fflush() and return failure based on the success of the fflush() call, to ensure it is fully written prior to updating /etc/mtab.  Perhaps something like:  146     return (res < 0) ? 1 : ((fflush(mfp->mntent_fp) == 0) ? 0 : 1);   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=697975#c2)  Vincent Danen    2011-04-19 19:51:29 UTC  ``` Created nfs-utils tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 697982](show_bug.cgi?id=697982 "CLOSED RAWHIDE - nfs-utils: mount.nfs fails to anticipate RLIMIT_FSIZE [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=697975#c3)  Jeff Layton    2011-04-19 20:02:57 UTC  ```  > 146     return (res < 0) ? 1 : ((fflush(mfp->mntent_fp) == 0) ? 0 : 1);  Dear god, no. There's no reason to do all of that one one line.  If I'm reading it right though, the logic looks correct, but let's do something that's a little easier to read (and debug...)   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=697975#c5)  Vincent Danen    2011-04-19 21:32:18 UTC  ``` Looks like this does not affect the version in RHEL4 as I can't see any mention of addmntent() or nfs_addmntent() anywhere (the only reference to mtab seems to be in nfs-utils-1.0.6/utils/rquotad/mntent.h).  Jeff, can you confirm whether or not this is an issue for RHEL4?  Thanks.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=697975#c6)  Vincent Danen    2011-04-26 15:27:57 UTC  ``` This was assigned [CVE-2011-1749](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1749).   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=697975#c11)  Vincent Danen    2011-04-27 16:31:32 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect the versions of nfs-utils as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 as it did not include include mount.nfs. It was addressed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 via RHSA-2012:0310 and RHSA-2011:1534 respectively.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=697975#c14)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-12-06 18:53:38 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2011:1534 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-1534.html>   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=697975#c19)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-02-21 03:23:34 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2012:0310 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0310.html>   ``` |  |

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=702273#c0)  Ian Kent    2011-05-05 08:56:58 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  If the directory of an NFS export contains spaces and is mounted on a client it is not possible to umount the mount.  For an entry on a server named zeus like : "/export/dir with spaces" *(rw)  Then mounting the export: [root@perseus ~]# mkdir /mnt/dir\ with\ spaces [root@perseus ~]# mount zeus:/export/dir\ with\ spaces /mnt/dir\ with\ spaces  /proc/mounts shows it as: zeus:/export/dir\040with\040spaces /mnt/dir\040with\040spaces nfs4 rw,relatime,vers=4,rsize=524288,wsize=524288,namlen=255,hard,proto=tcp,timeo=600,retrans=2,sec=sys,clientaddr=10.49.97.31,minorversion=0,addr=10.49.97.32 0 0  and all attempts to umount it fail like: [root@perseus ~]# umount /mnt/dir\ with\ spaces /mnt/dir with spaces was not found in /proc/mounts /mnt/dir with spaces was not found in /proc/mounts  The same thing happens on Fedora 14.  It doesn't happen on RHEL-5.4 or RHEL-6.0 although the entry seen in /proc/mounts is the same.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=702273#c4)  Ian Kent    2011-05-06 07:19:58 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 497297](attachment.cgi?id=497297&action=diff "Patch - fix nfs4 check") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=497297&action=edit "Patch - fix nfs4 check") Patch - fix nfs4 check  Further investigation shows that this patch resolves the problem for me and allows autofs to expire these mounts again.

Granted, his patch also fixes a legitimate bug, so I think we need something like Ian's patch ultimately, but dropping Chuck's patch from the code might be the safest route for now.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=702273#c9)  Ian Kent    2011-05-06 13:04:17 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 497339](attachment.cgi?id=497339&action=diff "Patch - revert distinguish between nfs4 and nfs mounts") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=497339&action=edit "Patch - revert distinguish between nfs4 and nfs mounts") Patch - revert distinguish between nfs4 and nfs mounts  This does appear to achieve the same outcome, although I expect there are cases that the original patch catches that won't be caught if we do this.

The patch looks good to me. It seems like we ought to be using the routines that encapsulate this logic (as your patch does).  One very minor style nit in read_procmounts:  +        mfp = nfs_setmntent (fnam, "r");  There should be no space between nfs_setmntent and the '('.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=702273#c12)  Chuck Lever    2011-05-06 20:05:31 UTC  ``` The ultimate fix looks reasonable.  Probably this should be applied to nfsstat as well, which is where that code came from, according to the original patch description.  Reverting the original patch simply means that the RHEL 6 client will send a UMNT request for NFSv4 mounts.  I think that should be relatively harmless, but may result in a short hang in some corner cases.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=702273#c13)  Ian Kent    2011-05-09 02:06:51 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #11](show_bug.cgi?id=702273#c11)) >  > One very minor style nit in read_procmounts: >  > +        mfp = nfs_setmntent (fnam, "r"); >  > There should be no space between nfs_setmntent and the '('.  Yeah, me too, that's a cut, paste and modify from other code in utils/mount/fstab.c, so I left it to be consistent with the existing coding style. Looking again I see it isn't quite consistent their either, I'll change it.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=702273#c14)  Ian Kent    2011-05-09 02:26:36 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #12](show_bug.cgi?id=702273#c12)) > The ultimate fix looks reasonable.

Unfortunately, those corner cases seem to come up all too often at sites.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=702273#c15)  Ian Kent    2011-05-09 02:33:22 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 497698](attachment.cgi?id=497698&action=diff "Patch - fix nfs4 check (updated)") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=497698&action=edit "Patch - fix nfs4 check (updated)") Patch - fix nfs4 check (updated)  - style, remove space between function call and bracket. - correct nfs-utils version in description text.   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=702273#c16)  Ian Kent    2011-05-09 02:35:22 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 497699](attachment.cgi?id=497699&action=diff "Patch - fix nfs4 check (updated)") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=497699&action=edit "Patch - fix nfs4 check (updated)") Patch - fix nfs4 check (updated)  Try again, update nfs-utils version.   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=702273#c17)  Ian Kent    2011-05-09 02:48:22 UTC  ``` I have to wonder about the wisdom of escaping characters in the mount table like this (although I don't know what else to do, how does util-linux habdle this?).  With the move to eliminate the use of the straight text based /etc/mtab, which doesn't appear to use these escapes, any shell script and anything else that doesn't use the glibc functions setmntent()/getmntent()/endmntent() will probably break.   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=702273#c18)  Karel Zak    2011-05-09 10:15:18 UTC  ``` All code in util-linux that read or write *tab files always use mangle() and unmangle() functions.  Note that nfs-utils upstream is already possible to link against libmount (this feature is enabled in rawhide/Fedora-16) -- see mount_libmount.c. All such low-level problems should be hidden in the library.  We have findmnt(8) for work with the fstab/mtab/mountinfo files in the shell scripts. It's definitely better than "grep /proc/mounts".   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=702273#c19)  Chuck Lever    2011-05-09 13:47:45 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #18](show_bug.cgi?id=702273#c18)) > We have findmnt(8) for work with the fstab/mtab/mountinfo files in the shell > scripts. It's definitely better than "grep /proc/mounts".  The reason the original patch looks in /proc/mounts is because /proc/mounts is authoritative with regard to mount option settings.  The exact effective mount option settings are in /proc/mounts.  They are not reflected in user space log files.  User space can know and remember exactly what the user requested, and /proc/mounts shows exactly what the kernel is providing.  Two different views of the same elephant.  For example, the user may not have specified rsize or wsize options; looking in /proc/mounts, we can see exactly what the server and the client kernel have negotiated.  R/wsize is negotiated by the NFS client in the kernel, thus those settings cannot be recorded by user space at mount time.  Thus, IMO, both user space files and /proc/mounts are important for complete visibility.  Should we instead/also fix the kernel to use mangling and escaping for showing pathnames in /proc/mounts?   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=702273#c20)  Chuck Lever    2011-05-09 13:50:01 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #14](show_bug.cgi?id=702273#c14)) > (In reply to [comment #12](show_bug.cgi?id=702273#c12)) > > The ultimate fix looks reasonable.

But the new API in fstab.c is cleaner than open coding.  nfsstat can at least re-use this API.   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=702273#c21)  Ian Kent    2011-05-11 12:18:17 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 498279](attachment.cgi?id=498279&action=diff "Patch - fix nfs4 check (update 2)") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=498279&action=edit "Patch - fix nfs4 check (update 2)") Patch - fix nfs4 check (update 2)  There's an additional problem with the mount table handling.  If there is a trailing '/' on the mount location and /etc/mtab is being maintained independently, then since the mtab entry won't have the trailing '/' the match in nfs_umount_is_vers4() will fail. This didn't fail before because the check succeeded if either the mount location or mount directory matched. I dropped the mount directory check because in order to get a passed in mntentchn pointer that has to match (an entry in /etc/mtab) in the first place.  But this also raises the question of what happens when attempting to umount nfs internally mounted mounts (that appear only in  /proc/mounts). I think umount will fail because there is no entry in /etc/mtab. Is that what we want? Do we need to check this for CIFS?  There may be more yet, there is now a different unexplained regression test failure.   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=702273#c22)  Karel Zak    2011-05-11 16:05:36 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #21](show_bug.cgi?id=702273#c21)) > But this also raises the question of what happens when attempting > to umount nfs internally mounted mounts (that appear only in  > /proc/mounts).

Already reported, see [bug #702664](show_bug.cgi?id=702664 "CLOSED ERRATA - Umount not possible"). The trailing '/' is a problem.   The mount.<type> helpers should be fixed, it's really bad idea to have "/foo" in fstab and "/foo/" in mtab (or /proc/mounts). I don't see reason why the trailing '/' should be required, mount(2) and umount(2) syscalls work as expected without the extra char.   ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=702273#c23)  Ian Kent    2011-05-12 02:17:19 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #22](show_bug.cgi?id=702273#c22)) > (In reply to [comment #21](show_bug.cgi?id=702273#c21)) > > But this also raises the question of what happens when attempting > > to umount nfs internally mounted mounts (that appear only in  > > /proc/mounts).

I don't see reason why the > trailing '/' should be required, mount(2) and umount(2) syscalls work as > expected without the extra char  Using a trailing slash can be a useful convenience but, as you say, shouldn't be required and should be handled by utilities.  For example, consider the autofs multi-mount map entry in a direct mount map:  /test/foo / s1:/p1 \           /m1 s2:/p2           /m2 s3:/p3  it's convenient to use /test/foo (fstype autofs) for the direct mount trigger and /test/foo/ (fstype something else, eg. nfs) for the root of the multi-mount. This gives a visual queue when looking at largish mount tables trying to work out what's going on.

New Contents: Previously, the function responsible for parsing the /proc/mounts file was not able to handle single quote characters in the path name of a mount points entries. As a consequence, an NFS exported file system could not be unmounted if its mount point contained space characters. To fix this problem, the parsing routine has been rewritten so that it now parses entries in the /proc/mounts file properly. All NFS file systems now can be unmounted as expected.   ```  [Comment 37](show_bug.cgi?id=702273#c37)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-12-06 18:53:42 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=692702#c0)  Andrew Schultz    2011-03-31 21:17:13 UTC  ``` Description of problem: the rpcidmapd script sometimes fails to start rpc.idmapd because /var/lib/nfs/rpc_pipefs is not mounted, even though it explicitly loads sunrpc.  The reason is that sunrpc is not finished loading even though modprobe returns control to the script.  I just added additional bits to sleep and recheck for rpc_pipefs when it can't find rpc_pipefs the first time.  This allows the script to successfully load rpc.idmapd.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): nfs-utils-1.2.2-7.el6  Steps to Reproduce: 1. configure a box as an NFS client (and not a server) 2. boot    Actual results: 1. see messages in boot.log about missing RPC MTAB 2. all NFS files owned by user 2<<32  Expected results: 1. rpc.idmapd starts happily 2. NFS files owned by normal users   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=692702#c2)  Steve Dickson    2011-04-01 14:05:26 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=692702#c0)) > Description of problem: > the rpcidmapd script sometimes fails to start rpc.idmapd because > /var/lib/nfs/rpc_pipefs is not mounted, even though it explicitly loads sunrpc. >  The reason is that sunrpc is not finished loading even though modprobe returns > control to the script.

FATAL: Error running install command for sunrpc Error: RPC MTAB does not exist.  the more explicit complaints about sunrpc sound worse, but don't cause real problems.  Further investigation reveals that something earlier during bootup triggers loading sunrpc (actually... sunrpc is in initramfs).  It apparently just takes its time finishing the loading process, especially on the first bootup.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=692702#c4)  Steve Dickson    2011-04-01 20:41:56 UTC  ``` Hey,  (In reply to [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=692702#c3)) > boot.log would contain: >  > Starting RPC idmapd: FATAL: Module sunrpc already in kernel. > FATAL: Error running install command for sunrpc > Error: RPC MTAB does not exist.   The fact the script does not find /var/lib/nfs/rpc_pipefs in  /proc/mounts and then the 'modprobe sunrpc' fails because  the module already exists basically means whomever is loading sunrpc is not doing it correctly.   Does 'grep sunrpc /etc/modprobe.d/dist.conf' show two  rules on sunrpc?   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=692702#c5)  Andrew Schultz    2011-04-01 21:26:51 UTC  ``` andrew@george#grep sunrpc dist.conf  install sunrpc /sbin/modprobe --first-time --ignore-install sunrpc && { /bin/mount -t rpc_pipefs sunrpc /var/lib/nfs/rpc_pipefs > /dev/null 2>&1 || :; } remove sunrpc { /bin/umount /var/lib/nfs/rpc_pipefs > /dev/null 2>&1 || :; } ; /sbin/modprobe -r --ignore-remove sunrpc alias rpc_pipefs sunrpc alias rpc_svc_gss_pipefs sunrpc   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=692702#c6)  RHEL Program Management    2011-04-04 02:08:00 UTC  ``` Since RHEL 6.1 External Beta has begun, and this bug remains unresolved, it has been rejected as it is not proposed as exception or blocker.  Red Hat invites you to ask your support representative to propose this request, if appropriate and relevant, in the next release of Red Hat Enterprise Linux.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=692702#c7)  Steve Dickson    2011-04-05 19:10:57 UTC  ``` I'm unable to reproduce this locally... so when this happens can you verify that     1) sunrpc is loaded (lsmod | grep sunrpc)    2) /var/lib/nfs/rpc_pipefs is not mounted (grep sunrpc /proc/mounts)  I would add those to commands to the nfs initscript.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=692702#c8)  Andrew Schultz    2011-04-06 13:49:49 UTC  ``` It's only a problem for a moment (which is why "sleep 1" fixes it).  The various conditions for this to happen really only happen during first (or second) bootup, but I can induce them synthetically.  1. sunrpc will be loaded on its own during bootup (before rpcidmapd).  At the top of the NetworkManager startup script, I added a script that checks for sunrpc and "sleep 1" until it is loaded.  It only needs to sleep once.  2. There is a finite amount of time after sunrpc starts to load before it shows up in lsmod.  trying to "modprobe sunrpc" during this time results in the first two error messages in [comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=692702#c3).  3. There is a finite amount of time after sunrpc shows up in lsmod that rpc_pipefs will show up in /proc/mounts.  This is what causes rpcidmapd to fail.  The amounts of time for #2 and #3 are longer when the system doing more disk access (apparently during first boot).  I'll attach a script that I used to test this.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=692702#c9)  Andrew Schultz    2011-04-06 13:58:06 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 490288](attachment.cgi?id=490288 "script to demonstrate conditions #2 and #3") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=490288&action=edit "script to demonstrate conditions #2 and #3") script to demonstrate conditions #2 and #3  I ran this after booting into single user mode and starting a few of the services that would be loaded before rpcidmapd (network, portreserve, rpcbind).  The output would look like:  RPC: Registered udp transport module. RPC: Registered tcp transport module. RPC: Registered tcp NFSv4.1 backchannel transport module. 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 [messages about unregistering]  "0" indicates sunrpc doesn't show up in lsmod and "1" indicates that it does, but that rpc_pipefs doesn't show up in /proc/mounts.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=692702#c10)  Steve Dickson    2011-04-07 17:56:20 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #8](show_bug.cgi?id=692702#c8)) > It's only a problem for a moment (which is why "sleep 1" fixes it).

Who and where is it getting loaded? Because when its loaded the rpc_pipefs should also happen... immediately after the insmod.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=692702#c11)  Andrew Schultz    2011-04-10 18:54:02 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #10](show_bug.cgi?id=692702#c10)) > > 1. sunrpc will be loaded on its own during bootup (before rpcidmapd).  > Who and where is it getting loaded?

It gets loaded during the NetworkManager script.  I sprinkled checks within the script and the daemon itself (/usr/sbin/NetworkManager) seems to be what triggers sunrpc.  How/why/when/where that happens... I don't know.  I'm not going to trace through the NetworkManager source code to track it down.  Seems like a bit of a silly exercise anyway.  What's important here is that the rpcidmapd makes invalid assumptions behavior about module loading.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=692702#c12)  Steve Dickson    2011-04-11 14:25:37 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #11](show_bug.cgi?id=692702#c11)) > (In reply to [comment #10](show_bug.cgi?id=692702#c10)) > > > 1. sunrpc will be loaded on its own during bootup (before rpcidmapd).  > > Who and where is it getting loaded?

Its just I'm not seeing this problem in my world so  I'm just trying to figure what is going on...   >  > What's important here is that the rpcidmapd makes invalid assumptions behavior > about module loading. Not really since the /var/lib/nfs/rpc_pipefs is user to kernel interface the daemons, like rpc.idmapd, use. So it wrong to load the sunrpc module without enabling its interface (i.e. mounting /var/lib/nfs/rpc_pipefs)  BTW, what version of NetworkManager are you running?  Again, thank you for your time...   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=692702#c13)  Andrew Schultz    2011-04-11 15:53:53 UTC  ``` > So it wrong to load the sunrpc module without enabling its interface (i.e. > mounting /var/lib/nfs/rpc_pipefs)  /var/lib/nfs/rpc_pipefs is mounted even when sunrpc loading is triggered by NetworkManager.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=747400#c0)  Andy Adamson    2011-10-19 17:34:10 UTC  ``` Description of problem: Customers and developers using rpcdebug cannot turn on pnfs debugging.    Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): RHEL 6.2 beta 2.6.32.209.el6   How reproducible: 100%   Steps to Reproduce: 1.run rpcdebug -vh 2. 3.    Actual results:  for the nfs module, no flag for pnfs  Expected results:  Expect a pnfs flag option   Additional info:  NFSDBG_PNFS and NFSDBG_PNFS_LD should be activated with an rpcdebug nfs  module pnfs flag.  This will allow more pin-point debugging of pNFS related client problems.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=747400#c2)  yanfu,wang    2011-10-20 02:29:02 UTC  ``` hi Steve, Since I don't have pNFS environment, can I use modinfo or any else command to check the result?   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=747400#c3)  Steve Dickson    2011-10-20 13:38:32 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=747400#c2)) > hi Steve, > Since I don't have pNFS environment, can I use modinfo or any else command to > check the result? Hello,  Well pNFS is a tech preview RHEL6.2 which means it not officially  supported because tech previews don't go through our normal  QE process... but I have outlined how to set up pNFS env  in  [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=746839#c2](show_bug.cgi?id=746839#c2 "CLOSED ERRATA - NFS v4.1 Traffic not shown")  Now how I tested this was to do a 'rpcdebug -m nfs -s pnfs' then cat /proc/sys/sunrpc/nfs_debug to make sure it had the appropriate value. In this case the value would be 4096.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=747400#c6)  yanfu,wang    2011-10-25 05:14:13 UTC  ``` reproduced on nfs-utils-1.2.3-13.el6: [root@hp-magnycours-01 ~]# rpm -qa|grep nfs-utils nfs-utils-lib-1.1.5-4.el6.x86_64 nfs-utils-1.2.3-13.el6.x86_64 [root@hp-magnycours-01 ~]# rpcdebug -m nfs -s pnfs rpcdebug: unknown module or flag nfs/pnfs [root@hp-magnycours-01 ~]# cat /proc/sys/sunrpc/nfs_debug 0  verified on nfs-utils-1.2.3-15.el6: [root@hp-magnycours-01 ~]# rpcdebug -m nfs -s pnfs nfs        pnfs [root@hp-magnycours-01 ~]# cat /proc/sys/sunrpc/nfs_debug 4096   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=747400#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-12-06 18:54:20 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.  For information on the advisory, and where to find the updated files, follow the link below.  If the solution does not work for you, open a new bug report.  <http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-1534.html>   ``` |  |

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

## Synopsis

Low: nfs-utils security, bug fix, and enhancement update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Low

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2011%3A1534)

## Topic

Updated nfs-utils packages that fix two security issues, various bugs, and
add one enhancement are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The nfs-utils packages provide a daemon for the kernel Network File System
(NFS) server, and related tools such as the mount.nfs, umount.nfs, and
showmount programs.

A flaw was found in the way nfs-utils performed IP based authentication of
mount requests. In configurations where a directory was exported to a group
of systems using a DNS wildcard or NIS (Network Information Service)
netgroup, an attacker could possibly gain access to other directories
exported to a specific host or subnet, bypassing intended access
restrictions. (CVE-2011-2500)

It was found that the mount.nfs tool did not handle certain errors
correctly when updating the mtab (mounted file systems table) file. A local
attacker could use this flaw to corrupt the mtab file. (CVE-2011-1749)

This update also fixes several bugs and adds an enhancement. Documentation
for these bug fixes and the enhancement will be available shortly from the
Technical Notes document, linked to in the References section.

Users of nfs-utils are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to resolve these issues and add this
enhancement. After installing this update, the nfs service will be
restarted automatically.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/kb/docs/DOC-11259>

## Topic

An updated nfs-utils package that fixes one security issue, various bugs,
and adds one enhancement is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

## Description

The nfs-utils package provides a daemon for the kernel Network File System
(NFS) server, and related tools such as the mount.nfs, umount.nfs, and
showmount programs.

It was found that the mount.nfs tool did not handle certain errors
correctly when updating the mtab (mounted file systems table) file. A
local attacker could use this flaw to corrupt the mtab file.
(CVE-2011-1749)

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* The nfs service failed to start if the NFSv1, NFSv2, and NFSv4 support

was disabled (the MOUNTD\_NFS\_V1="no", MOUNTD\_NFS\_V2="no" MOUNTD\_NFS\_V3="no"
lines in /etc/sysconfig/nfs were uncommented) because the mountd daemon
failed to handle the settings correctly. With this update, the underlying
code has been modified and the nfs service starts successfully in the
described scenario. (BZ#529588)

* When a user's Kerberos ticket expired, the "sh rpc.gssd" messages flooded

the /var/log/messages file. With this update, the excessive logging has
been suppressed. (BZ#593097)

* The crash simulation (SM\_SIMU\_CRASH) of the rpc.statd service had a

vulnerability that could be detected by ISS (Internet Security Scanner). As
a result, the rpc.statd service terminated unexpectedly with the following
error after an ISS scan:

rpc.statd[xxxx]: recv\_rply: can't decode RPC message!
 rpc.statd[xxxx]: \*\*\* SIMULATING CRASH! \*\*\*
 rpc.statd[xxxx]: unable to register (statd, 1, udp).

However, the rpc.statd service ignored SM\_SIMU\_CRASH. This update removes
the simulation crash support from the service and the problem no longer
occurs. (BZ#600497)

* The nfs-utils init scripts returned incorrect status codes in the

following cases: if the rpcgssd and rpcsvcgssd daemon were not configured,
were provided an unknown argument, their function call failed, if a program
was no longer running and a /var/lock/subsys/$SERVICE file existed, if
starting a service under an unprivileged user, if a program was no longer
running and its pid file still existed in the /var/run/ directory. With
this update, the correct codes are returned in these scenarios. (BZ#710020)

* The "nfsstat -m" command did not display NFSv4 mounts. With this update,

the underlying code has been modified and the command returns the list of
all mounts, including any NFSv4 mounts, as expected. (BZ#712438)

* Previously, the nfs manual pages described the fsc mount option; however,

this option is not supported. This update removes the option description
from the manual pages. (BZ#715523)

* The nfs-utils preinstall scriptlet failed to change the default group ID

for the nfsnobody user to 65534. This update modifies the preinstall
scriptlet and the default group ID is changed to 65534 after nfs-utils
upgrade as expected. (BZ#729603)

* The mount.nfs command with the "-o retry" option did not try to mount for

the time specified in the "retry=X" configuration option. This occurred due
to incorrect error handling by the command. With this update, the
underlying code has been fixed and the "-o retry" option works as expected.
(BZ#736677)

In addition, this update adds the following enhancement:

* The noresvport option, which allows NFS clients to use insecure ports

(ports above 1023), has been added to the NFS server configuration options.
(BZ#513094)

All nfs-utils users are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which
resolves these issues and adds this enhancement. After installing this
update, the nfs service will be restarted automatically.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=697975#c0)  Vincent Danen    2011-04-19 19:45:20 UTC  ``` It was found that mount.nfs suffers from the same flaw as other mount helpers (see [CVE-2011-1089](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1089)).  Instead of using addmntent(), nfs-utils implements its own similar function (nfs_addmntent()) which also fails to anticipate whether resource limits would interfere with correctly writing to /etc/mtab.  A local user could use this to trigger corruption of the /etc/mtab file via a process with a small RLIMIT_FSIZE value.  In nfs-utils-1.2.3/support/nfs/nfs_mntent.c:  126 int 127 nfs_addmntent (mntFILE *mfp, struct mntent *mnt) { 128     char *m1, *m2, *m3, *m4; 129     int res; 130  131     if (fseek (mfp->mntent_fp, 0, SEEK_END)) 132         return 1;           /* failure */ 133  134     m1 = mangle(mnt->mnt_fsname); 135     m2 = mangle(mnt->mnt_dir); 136     m3 = mangle(mnt->mnt_type); 137     m4 = mangle(mnt->mnt_opts); 138  139     res = fprintf (mfp->mntent_fp, "%s %s %s %s %d %d\n", 140                m1, m2, m3, m4, mnt->mnt_freq, mnt->mnt_passno); 141  142     free(m1); 143     free(m2); 144     free(m3); 145     free(m4); 146     return (res < 0) ? 1 : 0; 147 }  The above function should use fflush() and return failure based on the success of the fflush() call, to ensure it is fully written prior to updating /etc/mtab.  Perhaps something like:  146     return (res < 0) ? 1 : ((fflush(mfp->mntent_fp) == 0) ? 0 : 1);   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=697975#c2)  Vincent Danen    2011-04-19 19:51:29 UTC  ``` Created nfs-utils tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 697982](show_bug.cgi?id=697982 "CLOSED RAWHIDE - nfs-utils: mount.nfs fails to anticipate RLIMIT_FSIZE [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=697975#c3)  Jeff Layton    2011-04-19 20:02:57 UTC  ```  > 146     return (res < 0) ? 1 : ((fflush(mfp->mntent_fp) == 0) ? 0 : 1);  Dear god, no. There's no reason to do all of that one one line.  If I'm reading it right though, the logic looks correct, but let's do something that's a little easier to read (and debug...)   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=697975#c5)  Vincent Danen    2011-04-19 21:32:18 UTC  ``` Looks like this does not affect the version in RHEL4 as I can't see any mention of addmntent() or nfs_addmntent() anywhere (the only reference to mtab seems to be in nfs-utils-1.0.6/utils/rquotad/mntent.h).  Jeff, can you confirm whether or not this is an issue for RHEL4?  Thanks.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=697975#c6)  Vincent Danen    2011-04-26 15:27:57 UTC  ``` This was assigned [CVE-2011-1749](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1749).   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=697975#c11)  Vincent Danen    2011-04-27 16:31:32 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect the versions of nfs-utils as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 as it did not include include mount.nfs.
