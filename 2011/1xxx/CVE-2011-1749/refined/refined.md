  "CVE-2011-1749": {
    "description": "The mount.nfs tool in nfs-utils does not handle certain errors correctly when updating the mtab (mounted file systems table) file. A local attacker could use this flaw to corrupt the mtab file. This is due to the fact that nfs-utils implements its own addmntent() like function (nfs_addmntent()) which fails to anticipate whether resource limits would interfere with correctly writing to /etc/mtab.",
    "affected_components": [
      "nfs-utils"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The `nfs_addmntent()` function in `nfs-utils` does not properly check for resource limits (`RLIMIT_FSIZE`) when writing to `/etc/mtab`, and doesn't use `fflush()` to ensure data is fully written before updating /etc/mtab. This function is used instead of the system's `addmntent()`. This leads to potential corruption of `/etc/mtab` if a process has a small `RLIMIT_FSIZE` value.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Improper handling of resource limits",
      "Inadequate error checking when writing to a file",
       "Failure to use fflush to fully write changes"
    ],
    "impact": "A local user can trigger corruption of the `/etc/mtab` file by running a process with a small `RLIMIT_FSIZE` value when using `mount.nfs`. This can lead to issues with mount/umount operations. Although, the vulnerability can be exploited by any local user, it has a low severity.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a local user on the system with the ability to execute programs that trigger mount.nfs.",
     "additional_details": "The vulnerable code is located in `nfs-utils-1.2.3/support/nfs/nfs_mntent.c`, specifically in the `nfs_addmntent()` function. The fix involves ensuring that the write to /etc/mtab is fully written via `fflush` and that proper error checking of `fflush` is included to ensure the entry is fully written prior to updating the /etc/mtab file."
