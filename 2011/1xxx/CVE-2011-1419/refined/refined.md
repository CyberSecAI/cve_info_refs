Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-1419:

**Verification:**

The content from `securityreason.com`, `marc.info`, `tomcat.apache.org` and `svn.apache.org` clearly relate to CVE-2011-1419. The issue is described as Tomcat 7 ignoring `@ServletSecurity` annotations, which could lead to authentication bypass and information disclosure. The identified vulnerable versions are within Tomcat 7.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** A coding error in Apache Tomcat 7 caused `@ServletSecurity` annotations to be ignored when no security constraints were defined in the `web.xml` file, a typical use case. Specifically, the optimization to not configure an authenticator when there were no security constraints caused `@ServletSecurity` annotations to be ignored because they were only processed when an authenticator was configured.

*   **Weakness:** The primary weakness is the improper handling of `@ServletSecurity` annotations. These annotations should enforce security constraints on servlets, but the bug causes them to be disregarded under certain circumstances. This is a flaw in the design and implementation of security constraint processing within Tomcat.

*   **Impact:** The primary impact of this vulnerability is a **security constraint bypass**. This can lead to:
    *   **Authentication Bypass:** Areas of the web application that were intended to be protected by authentication may become accessible without authentication, bypassing the expected security measures.
    *  **Information Disclosure:** Resources intended to be protected could become accessible to unauthorized users, leading to the exposure of sensitive information.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector is remote. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to a vulnerable Tomcat server.
    *   No special attacker capabilities are needed beyond basic HTTP interaction with a web server.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Tomcat server.
    *   The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated to exploit the issue (it's a bypass).

**Technical Details (from svn.apache.org):**

*   The fix involves modifying `ContextConfig.java` to ensure `@ServletSecurity` annotations are processed even when no security constraints are explicitly defined in `web.xml`.
*   A new unit test was added (`TestStandardWrapper.java`) along with a new test web application (`webapp-3.0-servletsecurity`) to specifically verify that `@ServletSecurity` annotations are handled correctly when no constraints are defined in `web.xml`.
*   `changelog.xml` was also updated to reflect this fix.

**Versions Affected:**
*   Tomcat 7.0.0 to 7.0.10 (partially fixed in 7.0.10, fully fixed in 7.0.11). The content from `marc.info` specifies that `Tomcat 7.0.10 was incomplete` and that 7.0.11 was released to fully resolve the issue

**Additional Notes**

*   The issue was first reported on the Tomcat users mailing list.
*   The fix was initially incomplete in Tomcat 7.0.10 and was fully addressed in 7.0.11.
*   A workaround was identified: specifying at least one security constraint in `web.xml` would trigger the scanning of `@SecurityAnnotations`.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 5.8/10 with medium risk

**Summary**

CVE-2011-1419 is a security vulnerability in Apache Tomcat 7 related to the processing of `@ServletSecurity` annotations. The flaw allows for a security constraint bypass which could lead to authentication bypass and information disclosure. The vulnerability is addressed in Tomcat 7.0.11, and a workaround is available by defining security constraints in web.xml.

**Response:**
```
Root cause of vulnerability:  A coding error in Apache Tomcat 7 caused @ServletSecurity annotations to be ignored when no security constraints were defined in the web.xml file. Specifically, the optimization to not configure an authenticator when there were no security constraints caused @ServletSecurity annotations to be ignored because they were only processed when an authenticator was configured.
Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Improper handling of @ServletSecurity annotations, resulting in a security constraint bypass. This could lead to authentication bypass and information disclosure.
Impact of exploitation: Authentication bypass and unauthorized access to protected resources, leading to potential information disclosure.
Attack vectors:  Remote exploitation via HTTP requests.
Required attacker capabilities/position: Network access to the vulnerable Tomcat server, no authentication required.
