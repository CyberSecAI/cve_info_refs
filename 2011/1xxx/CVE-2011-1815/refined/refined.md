Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-1815:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is related to an issue where an extension script could be injected into the new tab page within Google Chrome.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  **Extension Script Injection:**  The core weakness is the ability to inject an extension's script into the new tab page, which is not the intended behavior. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the new tab page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By injecting scripts into the new tab page, an attacker can execute code with the privileges of that page which could lead to data exfiltration, session hijacking, or other malicious activities. This impact is typically limited to the scope of the new tab page, which does not have the same level of access to resources as regular web pages.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Extension:** The primary attack vector would be a malicious Chrome extension. If the user installs this extension, the malicious script can be injected into the new tab page.
- **Browser Exploitation:** While not stated directly, this could also potentially occur if a vulnerability existed within how the extension framework interacts with the new tab page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Malicious Extension Development:** An attacker would need the ability to develop and distribute a malicious Chrome extension.
- **User Interaction:** The victim needs to install the malicious extension for the attack to be successful.
