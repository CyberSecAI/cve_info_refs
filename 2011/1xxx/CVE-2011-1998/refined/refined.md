      "root_cause": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Internet Explorer accesses an object that has not been correctly initialized.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Improper handling of objects in memory",
        "Incorrect memory initialization"

      "impact": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the logged-on user. This could lead to complete control of the affected system if the user has administrative privileges, allowing the attacker to install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts.",

        "Hosting a specially crafted website to exploit the vulnerability when viewed through Internet Explorer.",
        "Embedding an ActiveX control marked \"safe for initialization\" in an application or Microsoft Office document that hosts the IE rendering engine.",

      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to convince a user to visit a malicious website or open a malicious document. The attacker cannot force a user to do this, therefore social engineering would be involved."
