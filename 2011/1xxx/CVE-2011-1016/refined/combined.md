| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=680000#c0)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2011-02-24 03:39:07 UTC  ``` Check values passed in to AARESOLVE_OFFSET on r300. It can be used to write arbitrary data to VRAM, GTT, etc. This is specific to a range of GPUs only.  drm/radeon/kms: check AA resolve registers on r300 <http://git.kernel.org/linus/fff1ce4dc6113b6fdc4e3a815ca5fd229408f8ef>  [PATCH] drm/radeon: fix regression with AA resolve checking <https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/576101/> -> <http://git.kernel.org/linus/45e4039c3aea597ede44a264cea322908cdedfe9>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=680000#c3)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2011-02-25 01:15:58 UTC  ``` Both patches have been committed to the upstream kernel.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=680000#c4)  Vincent Danen    2011-02-28 17:56:15 UTC  ``` This was assigned CVE-2011-1016:  The Radeon GPU drivers in the Linux kernel before 2.6.38-rc5 do not properly validate data related to the AA resolve registers, which allows local users to write to arbitrary memory locations associated with (1) Video RAM (aka VRAM) or (2) the Graphics Translation Table (GTT) via crafted values.  <http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/testing/ChangeLog-2.6.38-rc5>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=680000#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-05-10 18:10:45 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2011:0498 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0498.html>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=680000#c6)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2011-07-19 05:48:13 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect the versions of Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5, and Red Hat Enterprise MRG as they did not backport the upstream commits fff1ce4d and 45e4039c that introduced this issue. This has been addressed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0498.html>.   ``` |  |
