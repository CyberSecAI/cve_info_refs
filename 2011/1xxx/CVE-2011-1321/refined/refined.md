{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The group membership information for a RACF user is stored inside the RACO (RACF Object). The zWAS native security code holds a cache of RACOs until the user is purged from the PlatformCredential cache in java. The PlatformCredential cache in java is not linked to the AuthCache, so purging a user from the auth cache has no effect on the PlatformCredential cache. Therefore, the old RACO is still being used for authorization decisions.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Inconsistent caching mechanisms between the AuthCache and PlatformCredential cache in WebSphere Application Server.",
	  "Lack of synchronization between the auth cache and the platform credential cache."
    ],
    "impact": "After adding a user to a group in RACF that is authorized to a certain role, the user is not immediately authorized. A server restart is required for the changes to take effect immediately.",
    "attack_vectors": "An administrator changes a user's group membership in RACF and expects the authorization changes to be reflected immediately within WebSphere Application Server but they are not.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker/administrator needs to have the ability to change a user's group membership in RACF."
