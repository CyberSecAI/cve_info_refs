Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2011-1879:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from improper management of kernel-mode driver objects within Windows kernel-mode drivers. Specifically a use-after-free vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Use-After-Free:** The vulnerability is a use-after-free type, meaning the code attempts to access memory that has already been freed. This can lead to unpredictable behavior and potential exploitation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Elevation of Privilege:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in kernel mode.
*   **Full System Control:** This kernel-level access grants the attacker complete control over the affected system.
*   **Malicious Activities:** The attacker can then install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new accounts with full administrative privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access Required:** The attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to the system.
*   **Specially Crafted Application:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability by running a specially crafted application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Valid Logon Credentials:** The attacker needs valid credentials to log on to the targeted system.
*   **Local Access:** Physical or remote (via RDP/Terminal Services) access that allows the attacker to execute code.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The affected component is `win32k.sys`, a kernel-mode driver responsible for window management, screen output, and handling user input.
*   The vulnerability was not publicly disclosed before the release of the security bulletin.
*   Microsoft had not received any reports of this vulnerability being exploited before the security bulletin was released.
*   The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the way that kernel-mode drivers manage kernel-mode driver objects.
* Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk, though servers could be at risk if users are allowed to log on and run programs.
