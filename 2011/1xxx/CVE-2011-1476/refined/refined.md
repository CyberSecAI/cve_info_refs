The provided documents describe the following vulnerabilities:

**CVE-2011-1090**

*   **Root cause:** Improper memory management in the `__nfs4_proc_set_acl` function of the Linux kernel. Memory allocated with `kmalloc` for NFSv4 ACL data is not properly freed.
*   **Weakness:** Memory leak due to unfreed allocated memory.
*   **Impact:** Local users can cause a denial of service (kernel panic).
*   **Attack vector:** Crafted attempts by local users to set an ACL via the NFSv4 protocol.
*   **Required capabilities:** Local user access.

**CVE-2011-1163**

*   **Root cause:** The `osf_partition` function in the Linux kernel does not properly handle an invalid number of partitions during partition table parsing.
*   **Weakness:** Information disclosure vulnerability by reading uninitialized heap memory.
*   **Impact:** Local users can obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel heap memory.
*   **Attack vector:** Malformed partition tables.
*   **Required capabilities:** Local user access.

**CVE-2011-1476**

*   **Root cause:** Integer underflow in the Open Sound System (OSS) subsystem in the Linux kernel when calculating the size for a `copy_from_user` operation. This vulnerability exists on non-x86 platforms.
*   **Weakness:** Integer underflow leading to memory corruption.
*  **Impact:** Local users can cause a denial of service (memory corruption).
*   **Attack vector:**  Malicious write access to `/dev/sequencer` to trigger the underflow.
*   **Required capabilities:** Local user access and write access to `/dev/sequencer`.

**CVE-2011-1477**

*   **Root cause:** Multiple array index errors in the sound/oss/opl3.c file, which is the driver for Yamaha YM3812 and OPL-3 chips, due to failure to validate user-supplied indexes.
*   **Weakness:** Array index errors leading to out-of-bounds memory access.
*   **Impact:** Local users can cause a denial of service (heap memory corruption) or possibly gain privileges.
*   **Attack vector:**  Crafted ioctl requests to `/dev/sequencer` that trigger out-of-bounds memory access.
*   **Required capabilities:** Local user access and write access to `/dev/sequencer`.

**CVE-2011-1493**

*   **Root cause:** Array index error in the `rose_parse_national` function of the Linux kernel when handling ROSE protocol data.
*   **Weakness:** Improper bounds checking in the ROSE protocol parsing.
*   **Impact:** Remote attackers can cause a denial of service (heap memory corruption) or possibly have other unspecified impact.
*   **Attack vector:** Sending a crafted ROSE packet with a large number of digipeaters over a network.
*   **Required capabilities:** Remote network access.

**CVE-2011-1494**

*   **Root cause:** Integer overflow in the `_ctl_do_mpt_command` function of the Linux kernel which leads to a heap-based buffer overflow.
*   **Weakness:** Integer overflow leading to heap memory corruption.
*   **Impact:** Local users can cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or potentially gain privileges.
*   **Attack vector:** Sending a crafted ioctl to trigger a heap-based buffer overflow.
*   **Required capabilities:** Local user access.
