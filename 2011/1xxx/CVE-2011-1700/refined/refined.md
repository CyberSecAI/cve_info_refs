Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2011-1700:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a buffer overflow in the `nipplib.dll` component of the Novell iPrint client.
- Specifically, when handling the `profile-time` parameter from a user-specified printer URL, the code blindly copies user-supplied data into a fixed-length buffer on the heap without proper bounds checking.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The primary weakness is the lack of input validation and boundary checks when copying the `profile-time` parameter into a fixed-size buffer. This allows an attacker to provide data larger than the buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.
- **Unsafe Data Handling:** The code trusts user-supplied data without sanitizing or validating its size, which is a common vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system.
- **Context:** The code execution occurs within the context of the browser process, meaning the attacker gains the same privileges as the user running the browser.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Web Page:** An attacker can host a malicious web page that, when visited by a user, triggers the vulnerability through the iPrint browser plugin (ActiveX or Netscape compatible).
- **Malicious File:** An attacker could also embed a malicious URL into a file (e.g., a document), which when opened by a victim triggers the vulnerability

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to host or deliver a malicious URL to the victim
- **User Interaction:** The user needs to either visit a malicious web page or open a malicious file that contains the specially crafted URL to trigger the exploit.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in the `nipplib.dll` component, which is used by both the ActiveX and Netscape browser plugins.
- The vulnerability is triggered when the client processes a user-specified printer URL containing a crafted `profile-time` parameter.
- The vulnerability is present in older versions of the Novell iPrint Client for Windows
- A patch "iPrint Client for Windows XP/Vista/Win 7 5.64" and later versions addresses this security issue.
- Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID ['11200'].
