{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `addmntent()` function in glibc does not report an error when a write to the `/etc/mtab` file is truncated due to a low `RLIMIT_FSIZE` setting.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Suid mount helpers using `addmntent()` or invoking `util-linux mount` (which calls `addmntent()`) fail to anticipate a low `RLIMIT_FSIZE`.",
      "`addmntent()` returns success even if the write is truncated.",
      "Many suid mount helpers block or ignore `SIGXFSZ`, which is sent when the resource limit is exceeded, preventing proper error handling.",
      "Some mount helpers edit `/etc/mtab` directly instead of using a temporary file.",
      "Some mount helpers using a temporary file don't have proper error handling and cleanup."
    ],
    "impact": "Unprivileged users can corrupt `/etc/mtab` and possibly manipulate mountpoint options or perform unauthorized unmounting.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "An unprivileged user sets a small `RLIMIT_FSIZE`.",
      "The user invokes a suid mount helper that uses `addmntent()` to modify `/etc/mtab`.",
      "The write to `/etc/mtab` is truncated due to the resource limit.",
     "Multiple invocations allow arbitrary appending/corruption of /etc/mtab due to the lack of newlines and incomplete writes."
    ],
     "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be a local unprivileged user with the ability to execute suid mount helpers.",
    "additional_information": [
     "Affected software includes at least: `mount.cifs` (samba), `fusermount` (FUSE), `mount` (util-linux), `ncpmount` (ncpfs), and `vmware-hgfsmounter` (open-vm-tools), and their unmount equivalents",
      "The vulnerability can be exploited by checking the current size of `/etc/mtab`, setting an `RLIMIT_FSIZE` slightly larger, and invoking a suid mount helper.",
      "The edits to `/etc/mtab` will be truncated, and no newline will be appended, allowing near-arbitrary appending through multiple invocations.",
      "The `addmntent()` function octal-encodes special characters, making exploitation beyond simple corruption more complex but still possible."
