## Issue [5255012](/5255012/): flimflam: fix use-after-free of hidden network (Closed)

| **Created:** 10 years ago by [Sam Leffler](/user/Sam%20Leffler)  **Modified:** 9 years, 7 months ago  **Reviewers:** [Paul Stewart](/user/Paul%20Stewart)  **CC:** chromium-os-reviews\_chromium.org, sleffler+cc\_chromium.org, Nathan Williams, Eric Shienbrood, Jason Glasgow, rochberg, Paul Stewart  **Base URL:** [ssh://git@gitrw.chromium.org:9222/flimflam.git@master](http://gitrw.chromium.org/gitweb/?p=flimflam.git;a=tree;h=refs/heads/master;hb=master)  **Visibility:** Public. | Descriptionflimflam: fix use-after-free of hidden network When a hidden network fails to connect the cleanup work reclaims the network block prematurely causing multiple references after memory is free'd. Fix this by holding a reference over the code that might free the state and also do not do a deferred update of the device state if the network is unregistered as this is guaranteed to fail and unneeded because device state cleanup is already handled at a higher level. This case can easily be reproduced by connecting to non-existent network; on timeout badness happens as described above.
