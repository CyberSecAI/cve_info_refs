Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-1536:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
A vulnerability exists in HP Performance Insight, which could be exploited to remotely access sensitive information. The specific nature of the vulnerability is not detailed, but it allows unauthorized access to sensitive data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The core weakness is an unspecified vulnerability within HP Performance Insight that allows for remote access to sensitive information. This could involve insecure data handling, lack of proper access controls, or other security flaws. The vulnerability is exploitable across multiple platforms including HP-UX, Linux, Solaris, and Windows.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
The primary impact of successful exploitation is unauthorized access to sensitive information. The CVSS score indicates partial confidentiality impact, meaning that some sensitive data can be accessed, but it does not mention integrity or availability impact. This suggests that the vulnerability is mainly a data breach issue and does not allow for system manipulation or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), meaning that the vulnerability can be exploited remotely through network connections. The attack complexity is low (AC:L), indicating it does not require sophisticated methods to exploit. It does not require authentication (Au:N), which makes it easier to exploit since an attacker does not need to have valid credentials to access the vulnerable system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker needs to be able to connect to the network where the vulnerable HP Performance Insight is running. The attacker does not need to be authenticated. The information does not specify what specific actions the attacker can take other than accessing sensitive data, but it could potentially lead to further attacks once the sensitive data is accessed.

**Summary of information:**
- **Vulnerability:** Remote unauthorized access to sensitive information.
- **Affected Software:** HP Performance Insight v5.0, v5.1x, v5.2x, v5.3x, v5.4, v5.41, v5.41.002 running on HP-UX, Linux, Solaris, and Windows.
- **CVSS Score:** 5.0 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)
- **Resolution:** Upgrade to HP Performance Insight v5.41.002 and apply the HF04 / QCCR1B88272 hotfix. Patches are available for different OS.
