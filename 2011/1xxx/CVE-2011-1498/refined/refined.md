Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2011-1498:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a bug in the Apache HttpClient library. When making requests through an authenticating proxy server using tunneling, the `Proxy-Authorization` header intended for the proxy was incorrectly forwarded to the target host.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Information Disclosure:** The primary weakness is the unintended leakage of the `Proxy-Authorization` header, which may contain sensitive credentials (e.g., usernames and passwords) encoded using Basic authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Exposure of Credentials:** An attacker controlling the target host could potentially capture and use the leaked proxy authentication credentials. This could lead to unauthorized access to other systems or resources that use the same proxy credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) on Target Host:**  An attacker with a presence or control of the target host (or any machine that the request is sent to) could intercept the leaked `Proxy-Authorization` header.
- **Compromised Target Host:** If a target host is already compromised, an attacker would have access to these headers if an affected client application makes a proxied request.
- **Malicious Target Host:** If the target host is controlled by a malicious party, they could easily capture these headers and use them.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Control of Target Host:** The attacker needs to have some control or access to the target host to intercept the leaked `Proxy-Authorization` header. This could be via a compromised server, a malicious application, or MitM techniques.
- **Client Application using HTTP Proxy:** The vulnerable application on the client side must be using the HTTPClient library to make requests through an authenticated proxy server.

**Additional Notes:**

- The issue was present in Apache HttpClient versions 4.0.x and 4.1, and was fixed in version 4.1.1.
- Red Hat Bugzilla entry for this CVE indicates that the fix was backported to affected Red Hat products.
- The vulnerability is considered "critical" and users of vulnerable versions are urged to upgrade.
