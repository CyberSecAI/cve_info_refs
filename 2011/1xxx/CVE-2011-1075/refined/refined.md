  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "FreeBSD's crontab uses MD5File() function on a temporary file to calculate the MD5 sum of the previous and new cronjob to determine if any changes have been made. This function is called with euid 0 which results in a race condition.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Race Condition",
      "Information Disclosure"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can determine if two files have the same MD5 hash, regardless of read permissions on those files. This can lead to disclosure of sensitive information.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker can create a hard link to the temporary file created by crontab. After the stat() call but before the MD5File() call, remove the temporary file and replace it with a symlink to the first target file. While the editor is open, the attacker can remove the symlink and replace it with the original file, re-created by making a hard link to the previously created hard link. After the second stat() call but before the second MD5File() call, the attacker can remove the temp file and replace it with a symlink to the second target file. This results in MD5 comparison of two files even if not readable.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have the ability to create and remove files and symlinks in /tmp and the ability to execute `crontab`."
