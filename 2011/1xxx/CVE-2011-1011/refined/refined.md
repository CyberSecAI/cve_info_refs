{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `seunshare` utility, part of the `policycoreutils` package, was shipped setuid root, which allows unprivileged users to mount a new temporary directory on `/home` and `/tmp`. This capability bypasses the usual sticky bit protection on `/tmp`, where applications commonly create temporary files, allowing users to modify and potentially replace files within the mounted directory.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure temporary directory handling.",
      "Lack of proper permission enforcement on alternate temporary directories.",
      "TOCTOU (Time-of-check Time-of-use) race condition between directory verification and mounting.",
      "Unrestricted ability for unprivileged users to alter the `/tmp` directory seen by setuid applications."
    ],
    "impact": "Privilege escalation is possible because the vulnerability enables users to interfere with the temporary file creation process of setuid applications. By replacing temporary files with malicious symlinks or other files, they can cause setuid programs to misbehave or corrupt system files, including `/etc/passwd`, potentially leading to a denial of service or system compromise.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access",
       "Execution of a setuid root application after modifying `/tmp` via `seunshare`."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An unprivileged user with the ability to execute `seunshare`."
