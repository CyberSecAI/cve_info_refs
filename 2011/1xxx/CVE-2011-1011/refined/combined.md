How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=633544#c0)  Vincent Danen    2010-09-13 22:13:11 UTC  ``` Tavis Ormandy reported that seunshare, part of policycoreutils, was shipped setuid root and failed to enforce proper permissions on an alternate temporary directory mounted as /tmp.  This could potentially lead to privilege escalation in certain privileged applications that assume /tmp to be sticky and root-owned.  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Tavis Ormandy for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=633544#c9)  Tomas Hoger    2010-10-13 13:19:57 UTC  ``` Just to summarize the situation as I see it here.  This is believed to be fixed now in the recent policycoreutils versions, such as policycoreutils-2.0.83-28.fc13, via this patch:  <http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/gitweb/?p=policycoreutils.git;a=blob;f=policycoreutils-rhat.patch;h=d4db5bc06027de23d12a4b3f18fa6f9b1517df27;hb=HEAD#l2197>  It extends seunshare_mount() to mount with nosuid/nodev/noexec (this does not seem to make a difference for the problem reported by Tavis) and forces sticky bit on the /tmp directory upon mount.  However, there does not seem to be any change to prevent user from removing sticky bit right after it's added, and the sticky bit does not prevent non-privileged user from removing file from a directory he or she owns.  AFAIK, Tavis proposed two possible fixes: - restrict seunshare to a dedicated group - create temporary directory in some safe location and with safe ownership and permissions (which include sticky bit)  Note: Allowing user to specify arbitrary directory to bind-mount can also allow bypassing certain filesystem permissions restrictions (getting access to the directory that is not normally accessible to the user), but verify_mount() check makes this bypass fairly restricted and uninteresting.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=633544#c10)  Daniel Walsh    2010-10-13 14:23:26 UTC  ``` I guess the only solution to this would be to force the tmp directory to be either a tmpfs directory or on /tmp it self.  Would that satisfy the problem?   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=633544#c11)  Tomas Hoger    2010-10-29 12:56:03 UTC  ``` Wouldn't the use of /tmp itself beat the purpose of seunshare-ing /tmp?  It also can not be done with current seunshare due to the verify_mount() ownership check:  $ seunshare -t /tmp -h $HOME /bin/bash Invalid mount point, reporting to administrator: Operation not permitted  tmpfs should provide an easy way to have a run-specific directory that can be trashed as the end of the session easily, at the cost of memory use.  What is more important for intended sandbox use - have concurrently running instances not share the same directory as /tmp, or have /tmp content persist across sandbox runs?   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=633544#c12)  Daniel Walsh    2010-10-29 13:49:20 UTC  ``` No I was talking about seunshare enforcing that the user say  seunshare -t /tmp/mytmp -h $HOME/bin/bash  Meaning the user has to create the directory within /tmp to mount over /tmp.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=633544#c13)  Daniel Walsh    2010-10-29 13:50:43 UTC  ``` I think we should add tmpfs support, but I can see a use case for users having persistance.  (Of course this could be argued against.)   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=633544#c14)  Tomas Hoger    2010-10-29 16:08:02 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #12](show_bug.cgi?id=633544#c12)) > No I was talking about seunshare enforcing that the user say >  > seunshare -t /tmp/mytmp -h $HOME/bin/bash >  > Meaning the user has to create the directory within /tmp to mount over /tmp.  You do not want mytmp to be user-owned, otherwise your new /tmp will be user-owned.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=633544#c15)  Daniel Walsh    2010-11-01 17:28:28 UTC  ``` So Tomas you think the only valid/safe thing to do is to use tmpfs?   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=633544#c16)  Tomas Hoger    2010-11-02 15:22:32 UTC  ``` Not really.  The approach Tavis proposed - to make seunshare create root-owned directory with safe permissions - should work as well.  Just a quick summary of the options, with some pros and cons listed:  - /var/sandbox/tmp-$USER, root:$USER, 1770   - pro: directory to store per-user tmp directories is not world-writeable,     hence it's easier to create per-user directories safely   - pro: persistence   - con: same directory shared between concurrent sandbox runs   - con: another user-writeable directory (in addition to expected things as     /home, /tmp, /var/tmp)  - the above can be changed to use existing temporary directory instead of /var/sandbox, which avoids unexpected user-writeable directory, but needs more sanity checks, other pros/cons are similar to the above; this can be "DoS"-ed (one unprivileged user pre-created tmp-$USER for some other user (when using /tmp/sandbox-tmp-$USER) or all users (when using /tmp/sandbox/tmp-$USER))  - per-run temporary directory similar to current /tmp/.sandboxXXXXXXXX,   root:$USER, 1770 permissions   - pro: new per-run temporary directory   - pro: possible "keep after run" persistence   - con: more work to remove it safely after run  - tmpfs use should be the variant of the previous, without "keep after run" persistence, but with easier clean-up  Neither of these preserves the flexibility of the current version, so we should pick the approach that is the most aligned with sandbox's intended use case.   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=633544#c17)  Tomas Hoger    2010-11-16 17:19:49 UTC  ``` Dan, does any of the above option looks preferred wrt existing seunshare uses?   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=633544#c18)  Daniel Walsh    2010-11-16 18:26:58 UTC  ``` I looked into using tmpfs rather then a directory the user controls, but that would break one of the use cases.   I have firefox setup to execute sandbox everytime it downloads a pdf or .doc file, but if it is setup to download to /tmp, this would break using tmpfs.  sandbox creates NEWHOME and NEWTMP and then copies all files in the command path to those directories.  sandbox -X evince /tmp/mydoc.pdf   Copies /tmp/mydoc.pdf to NEWTMP and then mounts NEWTMP over /tmp  What about if we chown root:root NEWTMP and then mount.    chown UID:UID NEWTMP   when done.   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=633544#c19)  Tomas Hoger    2010-11-19 12:56:50 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #18](show_bug.cgi?id=633544#c18)) > What about if we chown root:root NEWTMP and then mount.   >  > chown UID:UID NEWTMP  >  > when done.  Does "when done" refer to the end of seunshare run?  That may only work if there's a reliable way to delay that ownership restore (hence seunshare exit) until after all processes that may have been started from the process executed by seunshare exited.  seunshare currently does not ensure that, it exits once its child process terminates.  So the plain chmod back after waitpid won't help.  I see there's no clean up code in the current seunshare version at all.  Is it not needed to clean up the private mounts?  Does kernel do that automatically once no process that can see them exists?   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=633544#c20)  Daniel Walsh    2010-11-19 13:25:33 UTC  ``` Yes.  Umount and destruction of the share happens automatically.  Not sure if there is a way for seunshare to know if all of the processes are exited.   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=633544#c21)  Tomas Hoger    2010-11-24 14:09:09 UTC  ``` One observation is that you can cd to /proc/<seunshare child pid>/root and check ./tmp there to see if it still has NEWTMP mounted.  Running on two terminals (noted as [1] and [2] below):  [1] ~ $ ls -lid /tmp /tmp/test-sandbox 65025 drwxrwxrwt. 32 root root 12288 Nov 24 14:41 /tmp 97564 drwxr-xr-x.  2 test test  4096 Nov 24 14:41 /tmp/test-sandbox  [1] ~ $ seunshare -v -t /tmp/test-sandbox -h $HOME /bin/bash Mount /home/test on /home/test Mount /tmp/test-sandbox on /tmp  [1-seunshare] ~ $ echo $$ 5940  [2] ~ $ cd /proc/5940/root/  [2] /proc/5940/root $ ls -lid ./tmp/ 97564 drwxr-xr-t. 2 test test 4096 Nov 24 14:41 ./tmp/  [1-seunshare] ~ $ cat blah.sh  #!/bin/sh echo "Sleeping for $1 sec" sleep $1 echo "Done with $1 sec sleep"  [1-seunshare] ~ $ ./blah.sh 60 & ./blah.sh 90 & ./blah.sh 120 & [1] 6000 [2] 6001 [3] 6002  [1-seunshare] ~ $ exit                 [1] ~ $ ls -lid /proc/5940/root/tmp ls: cannot access /proc/5940/root/tmp: No such file or directory  while [2] still sees it's root:  [2] /proc/5940/root $ ls -lid ./tmp/ 97564 drwxr-xr-t. 2 test test 4096 Nov 24 14:41 ./tmp/  Once all processes are done:  [2] /proc/5940/root $ ls -lid ./tmp/ 65025 drwxrwxrwt. 32 root root 12288 Nov 24 14:52 ./tmp/   Still chowning arbitrary user directory to root may prove problematic.   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=633544#c22)  Daniel Walsh    2010-11-24 14:40:59 UTC  ``` Interesting, not sure if this is a problem or not.  Sandbox sends a signal to all of its subprocess to try to get them to exit.  The major sticking point then is trying to figure a way to update the contents of /tmp with files if it was a temporary file system.  One potential solution would be to create the tmp directory within the $HOME and then cp the contents over the tmpfs once it is created.   ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=633544#c23)  Tomas Hoger    2010-11-24 14:57:11 UTC  ``` Or only allow certain path to be used as NEWTMP, such as /var/tmp/<something>?   ```  [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=633544#c24)  Daniel Walsh    2010-11-24 15:51:53 UTC  ``` How does that help?   ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=633544#c25)  Tomas Hoger    2010-11-24 16:43:05 UTC  ``` If using the chowning approach (chown to root:user at the beginning of the seunshare run and chown back once all child processes exited), this will limit which directories can get their ownership changed.  Also limiting where stale / left-over directories can be if seunshare is terminated before it can chown directory back.   ```  [Comment 26](show_bug.cgi?id=633544#c26)  Tavis Ormandy    2011-02-18 22:26:01 UTC  ``` is there any update on this issue, did you make a decision? (the solution I prefer is forcing the /tmp directory to be /var/sandbox/tmp-$USER root:root and 1777, and making /var/sandbox 700 root:root, I think this will work?)  I would consider this bug fairly urgent, I admit I dont have a working exploit to turn this into a root shell, but a quick search of suid binaries available shows that at least ksu assumes /tmp is sticky.  Right now an unprivileged user can destroy a system like this:  $ seunshare -v -t /tmp/seunshare/ -h /tmp/seunshare/ -- `which ksu` root Mount /tmp/seunshare/ on /home/taviso Mount /tmp/seunshare/ on /tmp WARNING: Your password may be exposed if you enter it here and are logged           in remotely using an unsecure (non-encrypted) channel.

Do you mind if I publish it so that administrators can remove seunshare if they're concerned about privilege escalation?  If I don't receive a response by Monday, I'll assume you don't mind.   ```  [Comment 27](show_bug.cgi?id=633544#c27)  Tomas Hoger    2011-02-21 10:05:41 UTC  ``` Dan, which of the current use cases are broken or negatively impacted by the proposed single NEWTMP for all seunchare runs approach?  Some pros/cons mentioned above.  I should probably add some issues with the first run, when user-specific sandbox-tmp directory has not been created yet.   ```  [Comment 28](show_bug.cgi?id=633544#c28)  Daniel Walsh    2011-02-21 19:48:18 UTC  ``` Tavis, how about we just go with removing -t PATH and just using -t, which will mount /dev/shm as 1777 root:root.   ```  [Comment 29](show_bug.cgi?id=633544#c29)  Daniel Walsh    2011-02-21 20:04:24 UTC  ``` sandbox -X evince /tmp/download.pdf  Needs to work.  So the way this works now is, sandbox command creates the tmpdir, and then copies the content into it, then seunshare mounts the tmpdir over /tmp/  This will not work on tmpfs since the tmpdir will not exist until after seunshare executes.    I could change the code to specify a tmpdir and have seunshare create its own tmpdir or tmpfs and copy the files from the local tmpdir into the tmpfs.  Would this satisfy the needs.   ```  [Comment 30](show_bug.cgi?id=633544#c30)  Tavis Ormandy    2011-02-22 04:06:05 UTC  ``` Yes, that sounds okay to me so long as seunshare creates it.   ```  [Comment 31](show_bug.cgi?id=633544#c31)  Daniel Walsh    2011-02-22 15:03:08 UTC  ``` Tavis, it is a little more difficult, but I have tried to recreate the vulnerabilty and have failed.  Are you saying you ksu without the root password and desctroyed the /etc/passwd file or are you saying your ksu was successful and destroyed the file?   ```  [Comment 32](show_bug.cgi?id=633544#c32)  Tavis Ormandy    2011-02-22 15:25:02 UTC  ``` Yes, ksu without the password destroys the file.   ```  [Comment 33](show_bug.cgi?id=633544#c33)  Tomas Hoger    2011-02-22 15:31:57 UTC  ``` I confirm that ksu steps above work on EL6 with default krb5 config.   ```  [Comment 34](show_bug.cgi?id=633544#c34)  Tavis Ormandy    2011-02-22 17:20:15 UTC  ``` Tomas, I'd like to publish a warning about this, would you prefer I wait? (I don't mind waiting if you guys are planning to work on this quickly). However if not much progress has been made since September, I think it's fairer to administrators to publish a warning asap.  Even if the worst (that I can demonstrate) is destroying a system, I think it's a reasonable assumption that there is a configuration/package/customer software that relies on the stickyness of /tmp (perfectly reasonably) to prevent arbitrary code execution.

You might need to hand copy all files using the openat, mkdirat, fchmodat, fchownat syscalls.  Unless I am missing something, the current patch might allow concurrent use in which case the user will be consuming system memory with the tmpfs.

In the future I could think of people > running sandboxes on different firefox instances.  sandbox randomizes categories range when generating contexts for the process to be run inside the sandbox.  If you currently run two concurrent sandbox instances with the same tmpdir, the last one's context is set on /tmp, making it unavailable to other instances.  Any suggestion on how to avoid memory hogging via seunshare?  tmpfs default size is 50% of RAM, hence 6 instances should allow user to hog all memory on systems that follow old SWAP = 2 * RAM recommendation.  That still doesn't sound good for something that's installed by default and hard to remove.   ```  [Comment 53](show_bug.cgi?id=633544#c53)  Daniel Walsh    2011-02-25 15:24:31 UTC  ``` I think we still need to make sure the user does not specify /tmp for the homedir, because /tmp will be mounted over.

With the robust session tracking in use, is tmpfs still attractive compared to chmoding/chowning directory at the beginning and at the end?   That setfilecon still fails for me, as it's reached after setfsuid call, and uncovers this use-after-free bug:          rc =setfilecon("/tmp", filecon);         freecon(filecon);         if (rc < 0) {             fprintf(stderr, _("Failed to set context %s on /tmp: %s\n"), filecon, strerror(errno));   ```  [Comment 55](show_bug.cgi?id=633544#c55)  Daniel Walsh    2011-02-25 20:32:39 UTC  ``` seunshare -h /tmp/home -t /tmp/home/tmp command seunshare -h /tmp/tmp/home -t /tmp/tmp command   Is allowed in the release version with some hacky checks for overlaps.  Ok, yes I have fixed the code.  Sorry about that.  How about we dump tmpfs and go with making a tmpdir in /tmp and mount bind over /tmp.  Then I don't need to worry about memory use.    Not sure why setfilecon works for me and not for you.  Might have something to do with the file system used for /tmp?  I could attempt to do the setfilecon before the setfsuid, but on a rootsquash file system it will not be able to get the file context of the user directory.   ```  [Comment 56](show_bug.cgi?id=633544#c56)  Tomas Hoger    2011-02-26 22:27:07 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #55](show_bug.cgi?id=633544#c55)) > How about we dump tmpfs and go with making a tmpdir in /tmp and mount bind over > /tmp.  Then I don't need to worry about memory use.    What's the tmpdir above?  A directory passed to seunshare as -t argument?  This should work too, if the directory is chowned/chmoded at the beginning properly.  It can't be chowned back seunshare exit though, so sandbox won't have privileges to remove it.  It can remove most of its content though (in most cases, only root:$USER owned directory is expected to be left around), and tmpwatch should take care of the rest over the time.  This can be combined with some of the ideas from the version using tmpfs.  seunshare can accept arbitrary tmpdir as its argument.  It will create new temporary directory with proper permissions in /tmp, copy/move files to that new temporary directory and bind mount it.  At the end of run, move temporary files back to the original tmpdir (to provide persistence) and remove directory that was bind mounted.  Moving should be done with user privileges, delete with root privs, possibly reusing some of the tmpwatch code to do it safely.  Removing usable /tmp from the sandboxed processes that are running after seunshare's termination is not a concern, I believe.   ```  [Comment 57](show_bug.cgi?id=633544#c57)  Daniel Walsh    2011-03-03 17:21:05 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 482122](attachment.cgi?id=482122 "Ok this version allocates a directory in /tmp an labels it correctly") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=482122&action=edit "Ok this version allocates a directory in /tmp an labels it correctly") Ok this version allocates a directory in /tmp an labels it correctly  It then rsyncs the homedir/.sandboxtmp direcory to /tmp and when it is done rsync's it back   The reason it has to be a subdir of homedir, is we want to drop capabilities before doing any of the "rsyncing".  Since it mounts the tmpdir and the homedir, then drops capabilities, if the /tmp contents are not a subdir of homedir, I can no longer get to the contents.   This seems to work.  Since the /tmp is a subdir of the real /tmp, we end up using the same file system, and quota should work fine.  The only problem I see is around leaving the tmpdirectory in /tmp.  We can not delete it since we have dropped capabilities,  I attempt to remove all files from the directory.

What Tavis points out is that you can stop seunshare right after mkdtemp, leave it stopped for a couple of days so the temporary directory gets old enough to be removed by tmpwatch, create symlink with the same name and continue seunshare.  If you stop before chmod, seunshare will change permission of the wrong directory.  If you stop before mount, you can mount a directory that is not accessible to the user, or a directory that is user owned and non-sticky.  > Why do you think /var/sandbox/tmp-xxxx is better  Not tmpwatch clean-up by default, even if tmpwatch is configured to look there too, user won't be able to create symlink with the name matching directory that was previously removed.   ```  [Comment 65](show_bug.cgi?id=633544#c65)  Tomas Hoger    2011-03-07 14:25:29 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 482691](attachment.cgi?id=482691 "seunshare with post-mount checks") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=482691&action=edit "seunshare with post-mount checks") seunshare with post-mount checks  I've added pre-chmod and post-mount check to avoid using unintended directory.  I've also changed the code to fork + drop privs + execute command when needed, i.e. it copies files to a temporary directory before mounting it, so that removes restriction on where the user temporary directory can be located.  The way rsync is used is not ideal, as it won't preserve permissions and contexts.

Files form the user-specified directory are copied to the runtime directory and the changes synced back (using rsync) at the end of the seunshare run.  seunshare was also moved from the policycoreutils subpackage (installed by default on all systems) to policycoreutils-sandbox subpackage.  This subpackage can be easily removed where sandbox functionality is not required, providing a cleaner mitigation for the case of possible future seunshare issues.   ```  [Comment 68](show_bug.cgi?id=633544#c68)  Daniel Walsh    2011-04-04 19:44:47 UTC  ``` Correct   ```  [Comment 69](show_bug.cgi?id=633544#c69)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-04-04 21:13:01 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2011:0414 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0414.html>   ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Can we get a CVE # for this please and thank you.

From: 	Tavis Ormandy   	2/22/11 6:01 PM
To: 	full-disclosure@...ts.grok.org.uk
Subject: 	[Full-disclosure] Developers should not rely on the
stickiness of/tmp on Red Hat Linux
Developers should not rely on the stickiness of /tmp on Red Hat Linux
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Recent versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Fedora provide seunshare, a
setuid root utility from policycore-utils intended to make new filesystem
namespaces available to unprivileged processes for the purpose of sandboxing.

The intention is to permit unprivileged users to mount a new temporary
directory on /home and /tmp for sandboxed processes, thus preventing
access to the contents of the original directories in the event of a
compromise.

One unintended side effect of making these features available to unprivileged
processes is that users can now change how setuid applications perceive /tmp
and /home.

The purpose of this advisory is to inform developers and system administrators
of affected systems that unprivileged users can effectively remove the
sticky-bit from the system /tmp directory, and thus relying on the stickiness
of /tmp on redhat systems is no longer safe.

This advisory is intended for system administrators and developers of
Red Hat Linux systems; journalists, end users and other non-technical
readers do not need to be concerned.

--------------------
Affected Software
------------------------

All known versions of policycore-utils are affected.

I discussed the potentially dangerous implications of introducing this change
with Red Hat Security in September 2010, but FC14 and RHEL6 still exhibit this
behaviour post-launch.

--------------------
Consequences
-----------------------

A simple example of a common application that is now unsafe is ksu, from the
krb5 distribution. ksu creates a temporary file in /tmp, then clears it on
authentication failure.

This is normally a safe operation, as /tmp is protected by the sticky bit.

However, we can use seunshare to interfere with this process.

# create a new directory that we control
$ mkdir /tmp/seunshare

# use seunshare to mount it on /tmp and /home and run our setuid root binary

And /etc/passwd was damaged, thus breaking the system.

Notes
-----------------------

Although only an example of damaging a system has been provided, it's
reasonable to assume that various applications rely on the stickiness of
/tmp to prevent code execution.

Administrators are advised to remove the setuid bit from seunshare, or
restrict access to it.
