The provided content is a release note for Google Chrome version 11.0.696.57, which includes multiple security fixes. One of the listed fixes is for **CVE-2011-1443**, described as "Stale pointers in layering code". This vulnerability was credited to Martin Barbella.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Stale pointers in the layering code of Google Chrome.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is related to the presence of stale pointers in the layering code. This implies that pointers may be pointing to memory that has been freed or is no longer valid, potentially leading to a use-after-free condition or other memory corruption issues.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  Exploitation could lead to a crash or potentially arbitrary code execution. The security impact is rated as "High" in the release notes.
- **Attack vectors**: The specific attack vector is not detailed, however, it can be assumed to be related to processing web content that triggers the vulnerability in the layering code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need to craft specific web content that can trigger the stale pointer condition in the layering code.
