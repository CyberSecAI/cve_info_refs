Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-1391:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the Blueberry FlashBack ActiveX control ("BB FlashBack Recorder.dll") used by IBM Rational Rhapsody for Windows. This third-party control is vulnerable to remote code execution.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The ActiveX control has multiple vulnerabilities that can be exploited through methods like `Start()`, `PauseAndSave()`, `InsertMarker()`, `InsertSoundToFBRAtMarker()`, and `TestCompatibilityRecordMode()`.
- The control is susceptible to remote code execution, allowing an attacker to potentially run arbitrary code on the target system.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to:
- Remote code execution, allowing an attacker to gain control of the affected system.
- Compromise of the security of the user's system.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by creating malicious code and embedding it in an email attachment or on a webpage.
- The malicious code instantiates the vulnerable ActiveX control in Microsoft Internet Explorer, triggering the vulnerability.
- The user must be persuaded to open the malicious attachment or visit the compromised webpage with Internet Explorer.
- For Internet Zone scenarios, the user must authorize an ActiveX pop-up dialogue box before it could be exploited.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create malicious code capable of exploiting the vulnerable ActiveX control.
- The attacker needs to distribute this malicious code via email attachments or malicious web pages.
- The attacker needs to convince the user to either open the email attachment or follow the link to the malicious web page using Internet Explorer.
- The attacker does not require continuous use of Rational Rhapsody on the victim's machine, the vulnerability exists as long as the ActiveX control is installed, which occurs with the installation of the software.

**Additional details:**
- The advisory highlights that FlashBack is a third-party control that might be used by other applications. Thus, other vendors might also be affected by the same vulnerabilities
- IBM has not received any reports of customer issues related to this vulnerability as of December 21, 2011
- A workaround is provided by disabling the ActiveX control or by properly securing the web browser to limit usage of such controls.
- A fix is provided by upgrading to Rational Rhapsody 7.6.1 or later
