Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-1537:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is not explicitly mentioned, but it's a vulnerability in the HP Proliant Support Pack (PSP) software. It appears that the software does not properly handle input, leading to XSS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This means that the software is vulnerable to injection of malicious scripts into the client side.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts into the web interface of the HP Proliant Support Pack. This could lead to various impacts such as:
    - Stealing user session cookies.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Defacing the web interface.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.
- The severity is rated with a CVSS base score of 4.3 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N), indicating a moderate severity.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is remote (AV:N), meaning the attacker can exploit the vulnerability over a network.
- The attack complexity is medium (AC:M), likely because the attacker would need to trick a user into clicking a malicious link or interact with an injected payload to trigger the XSS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable HP Proliant Support Pack.
- No authentication is required (Au:N).
- The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious script within the application

**Additional Notes:**
- This CVE is related to the HP Proliant Support Pack (PSP).
- The vulnerability affects versions 8.6 and earlier.
- HP has released version 8.7 to address this vulnerability.
