Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2011-1503:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the processing of XSLT content in Liferay Portal 6.0.6. Specifically, it involves the ability to disclose XSL/XML files through the `file://` URI scheme.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to potentially access arbitrary files on the server by exploiting how Liferay processes XML and XSLT content.
- **File Disclosure:** By using the `file://` URI within XML/XSLT, an attacker can cause the server to read and potentially expose local files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to sensitive files stored on the Liferay server. This could include configuration files, source code, or other confidential data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves manipulating XSLT content that is processed by the Liferay application.
- Specifically, this manipulation involves including the `file://` URI scheme in the XML/XSLT content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to submit or manipulate XML/XSLT content that is processed by the Liferay application.
- This likely requires some level of access or interaction with the Liferay portal, potentially as an authenticated user or through exploiting an unauthenticated endpoint that accepts XSLT input.
