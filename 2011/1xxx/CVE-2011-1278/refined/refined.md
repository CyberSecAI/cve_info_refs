  "CVE-2011-1278": {
    "Root cause": "A memory handling error occurs when Microsoft Excel validates record information upon opening a specially crafted Excel file, leading to memory corruption that could allow arbitrary code execution.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Memory corruption due to insufficient validation of record information in specially crafted Excel files.",
      "Improper memory handling during file parsing."
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code as the logged-on user. This can lead to complete control of the affected system, including the ability to install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Email: An attacker sends a specially crafted Excel file to a user, convincing them to open it.",
       "Web: An attacker hosts a website containing a malicious Excel file, or injects such content into compromised or user-content-hosting websites, convincing users to open the file."
     ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a specially crafted Excel file that triggers the vulnerability. The attacker also needs to convince a user to open this file, either via email or by tricking them into visiting a malicious web page."
