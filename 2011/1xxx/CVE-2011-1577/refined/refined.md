Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-1577:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a missing validation of the header size within the Linux kernel's EFI GUID Partition Table (GPT) implementation, specifically in the `fs/partitions/efi.c` file. The `efi_crc32` function calculates a CRC32 checksum based on the `header_size` field of the GUID partition table, without verifying the size first.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap Overflow:** A corrupted partition table can have a large value for the `header_size`. When `efi_crc32` is called, it attempts to read beyond the allocated buffer for the partition table header, leading to a heap overflow, potentially overwriting kernel memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation can cause a kernel panic (oops) or crash. A local attacker can create a specially crafted disk or other storage device with a corrupted GPT, which, when mounted, would cause the system to crash.
- While the provided advisory from Avaya also mentions potential for an information leak, the primary impact documented in the other sources is a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** An attacker needs local access to the system and the ability to mount a storage device that contains a specially crafted partition table. This could involve inserting a USB drive, mounting a hard drive or virtual disk.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have the ability to mount storage devices with arbitrary content on the target system.
- An unprivileged local user can trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was present in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 4, 5, 6, and Red Hat Enterprise MRG, but was only fixed in the latter versions due to the RHEL 4 lifecycle.
- The vulnerability was reported by Timo Warns.
- Red Hat assigned the CVE id CVE-2011-1577 to this vulnerability and released patches.
- The vulnerability was addressed in Red Hat via RHSA-2011:0833, RHSA-2011:1253, and RHSA-2011:1465.
