Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2011-1007:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause is the improper handling of form data after a user logs out of the RT (Request Tracker) system. Specifically, the system doesn't properly redirect users after logout. This allows the browser to potentially resubmit the login form using the back button.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of proper redirect after logout:** The RT application does not redirect the user to a safe page (like the login page) after logging out.
*   **Form data resubmission vulnerability:** The browser's back button can be used to resubmit the previous login form data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Account compromise:** A physically proximate attacker could gain access to a user's account without needing the password, by resubmitting the login form. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data and actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Physical access:** The attacker needs physical access to an unattended workstation where the victim was recently logged in to RT.
*   **Browser back button:** The attacker uses the browser's back button to access and resubmit the login form.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Physically proximate:** The attacker must be physically close to the vulnerable system.
*   **Unattended session:** The attack relies on a recently logged-out RT session being left open in a browser on a workstation that the attacker can access.
*   **Basic knowledge of browser functionality:** The attacker needs to know how to use the browser's back button.

**Additional Notes**
* The fix involves redirecting the user to the desired page after login.
* The vulnerability is fixed in RT version 3.8.9.
* There was discussion about the fix potentially breaking a popular extension (RT-Authen-ExternalAuth).

The information available suggests that this vulnerability is related to a lack of proper session management and post-logout redirects, allowing an attacker with physical access to potentially bypass authentication using the browser's back button.
