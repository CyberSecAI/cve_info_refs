- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `node_quick_find_autocomplete` function in the `node_quick_find` module was directly using user-supplied input (`$string`) in a database query without proper sanitization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection vulnerability. The `LIKE` clause in the SQL query used the input string directly, allowing an attacker to inject SQL code through the `$string` parameter.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database, potentially leading to data breach, modification, or complete compromise of the application.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker would need to provide a crafted input string to the autocomplete functionality, which is likely accessible through the web interface of the application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the autocomplete feature of the node_quick_find module and be able to send arbitrary strings as input to this feature.
