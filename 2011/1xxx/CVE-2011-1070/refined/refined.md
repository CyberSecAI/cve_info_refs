{
  "cveId": "CVE-2011-1070",
  "description": "v86d before 0.1.10 do not verify if received netlink messages are sent by the kernel. This could allow unprivileged users to manipulate the video mode and potentially other consequences.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": [
    {
      "rootCause": "The v86d userspace helper did not validate that netlink messages were sent by the kernel.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insufficient validation of message origin"
      ],
      "impact": "Unprivileged users can manipulate the video mode, potentially leading to display corruption. It also allows executing video BIOS services (int 0x10), although the possibility of privilege escalation is unclear.",
      "attackVectors": [
        "Local, unprivileged user sending manipulated netlink messages"
      ],
      "attackerCapabilities": "The attacker needs to be a local, unprivileged user capable of sending netlink messages.",
        "additionalDetails": "v86d executes video BIOS code with access to `/dev/mem` in response to netlink messages, using either vm86 mode or an x86 emulator."
