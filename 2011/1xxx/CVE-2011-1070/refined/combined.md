Thanks.

----- Original Message -----

```
> ```
> Versions of the v86d userspace helper for the Linux uvesafb driver
> before 0.1.10 did not verify that received netlink messages were sent
> by the kernel, allowing unprivileged users to manipulate the video
> mode and potentially other consequences.
>
> v86d executes video BIOS code with access to /dev/mem in response to
> netlink messages, using either vm86 mode or an x86 emulator, depending
> on configuration. I an unclear on whether it is possible to e.g. crash
> the machine or escalate privileges by spoofing requests, or only to
> mess with the video card.

### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

v86d has an open security issue in oldstable, stable, testing and
unstable ([CVE-2011-1070](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1070) / Bug#619404).

For testing/unstable, the fix is just to upload the new upstream release.

For stable I could add the patch [1] and ask you to approve that package
into 6.0.2. However we also could push 0.1.10 in there, because the
current 0.1.9-1 in Squeeze already has two patches from upstream Git and
going to 0.1.10 would only add two more minor ones ([2] and [3]) with
[3] being even unused in the final binary.
Do you have an opinion on this? Having 0.1.10 in there would mean less
patch updates in the future if they would be needed.

For oldstable cherry-pinking [1] should be fine.

Regards
Evgeni

So far as I can see, that didn't happen yet?  Having the issue fixed in
unstable at least is generally a prerequisite for fixing it in stable.

This may be an option, but I'd like to see a final debdiff between the
0.1.10 package that gets uploaded to unstable and the current squeeze
package before we make a final decision.

Adam

This now happened, and the package has been in testing for a while.

Any chance of debdiffs for stable and oldstable so we can look at
possibly getting this resolved in the next point release?  (For which
the NEW queue will be frozen during the weekend of October 1st).

For stable it would be
 [http://pinky.die-welt.net/~evgeni/v86d_0.1.9→10-1.diff](http://pinky.die-welt.net/~evgeni/v86d_0.1.9%E2%86%9210-1.diff)
(with changing the version to 0.1.10-0squeeze1?)

For oldstable I did not produce any debdiff, as I dont think anyone is
using v86d there, but I could apply the only-CVE patch on the package.

regards
Evgeni

Thanks.  As mentioned on IRC, I'd prefer a diff that didn't involve
moving the "now upstream" patches in to the source, and dropping the
patches; it makes the diff noisier and less "obvious" than would be
ideal for stable.

In terms of the other fixes, #525415 might be okay.  What's the intent
of

   * Add manual_add_modules uvesafb to the initramfs-hook (thanks
Ubuntu!)

?

That would be good; thanks.

Working on it as we write.

Ok, including.

v86d needs the uvesafb module in the initrd if started there. The user
would have to fiddle around himself with the initrd after installing
v86d, now he hasn't as the file is added automatically.

Droped that, as it changes expected(?) behaviour in stable :)

Thanks; please feel free to upload that.

How confident are you that it wouldn't cause regressions on oldstable?
Assuming we run to schedule (which hasn't happened for a while now,
sadly), oldstable point releases only occur once every four months.

Adam

Just uploaded 0.1.9-1+squeeze1 (only added the + to the version-number
for nice-looking/reading ;))

Assuming it was always built in a clean chroot it was never built with
any kernel-headers as those were not installed in the path the Makefile
was looking in. Just build-tested it in cowbuilder and seems fine.
Diff is here:
 [http://pinky.die-welt.net/~evgeni/tmp/v86d-CVE-2011-1070-oldstable%2bkernel.diff](http://pinky.die-welt.net/~evgeni/tmp/v86d-CVE-2011-1070-oldstable%2Bkernel.diff)

said that, i'm pretty confident that there are about zero v86d users in
oldstable (it's designed for desktops where you usually do not run
oldish releases, esp with outdated binary drivers)

| [Description](#c0)  Paweł Hajdan, Jr. (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2011-02-26 09:18:14 UTC  ``` Versions of the v86d userspace helper for the Linux uvesafb driver before 0.1.10 did not verify that received netlink messages were sent by the kernel, allowing unprivileged users to manipulate the video mode and potentially other consequences.  v86d executes video BIOS code with access to /dev/mem in response to netlink messages, using either vm86 mode or an x86 emulator, depending on configuration. I an unclear on whether it is possible to e.g. crash the machine or escalate privileges by spoofing requests, or only to mess with the video card.  References: <http://repo.or.cz/w/v86d.git/commit/f9abfd412639286c3143e93e8ba2c9598dfba640>  Is it OK to stabilize =sys-apps/v86d-0.1.10? ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Paweł Hajdan, Jr. (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2011-02-26 09:21:09 UTC  ``` Michał, could you also provide more info about possible impact? For now I'm rating it B1, because we can't rule out local privilege escalation. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Michal Januszewski (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2011-02-26 13:28:16 UTC  ``` It should be OK to stabilize the new version in an expedited manner.  The only difference between 0.1.10 and 0.1.9 is the sender verification. 0.1.10 also includes a patch, which has however been also included in 0.1.9 in Gentoo.  The primary impact is that any user is able to change the video mode, which would lead to display corruption, as neither the kernel nor X would be informed about the video mode being changed.  Other than that, it also makes it possible for any user to execute int 0x10 (video BIOS services).  I'm not sure if there is any way to exploit this for privilege escalation. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Paweł Hajdan, Jr. (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2011-02-26 14:53:20 UTC  ``` Thank you. Arches, please stabilize =sys-apps/v86d-0.1.10 ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Agostino Sarubbo   gentoo-dev  2011-02-27 13:34:40 UTC  ``` amd64 ok  few problem with depend, posted on [bug 356689](show_bug.cgi?id=356689 "RESOLVED INVALID - =dev-libs/klibc-1.5.12-r1 chmod: cannot operate on dangling symlink")  ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Markos Chandras (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2011-02-27 13:54:36 UTC  ``` amd64 done.
