# RHSA-2011:0927 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Important: kernel security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2011%3A0927)

## Topic

Updated kernel packages that fix multiple security issues and several bugs
are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

This update fixes the following security issues:

* An integer overflow flaw in ib\_uverbs\_poll\_cq() could allow a local,

unprivileged user to cause a denial of service or escalate their
privileges. (CVE-2010-4649, Important)

* A race condition in the way new InfiniBand connections were set up could

allow a remote user to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2011-0695,
Important)

* A flaw in the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) implementation

could allow a remote attacker to cause a denial of service if the sysctl
"net.sctp.addip\_enable" variable was turned on (it is off by default).
(CVE-2011-1573, Important)

* Flaws in the AGPGART driver implementation when handling certain IOCTL

commands could allow a local, unprivileged user to cause a denial of
service or escalate their privileges. (CVE-2011-1745, CVE-2011-2022,
Important)

* An integer overflow flaw in agp\_allocate\_memory() could allow a local,

unprivileged user to cause a denial of service or escalate their
privileges. (CVE-2011-1746, Important)

* A flaw allowed napi\_reuse\_skb() to be called on VLAN (virtual LAN)

packets. An attacker on the local network could trigger this flaw by
sending specially-crafted packets to a target system, possibly causing a
denial of service. (CVE-2011-1576, Moderate)

* An integer signedness error in next\_pidmap() could allow a local,

unprivileged user to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2011-1593, Moderate)

* A flaw in the way the Xen hypervisor implementation handled CPUID

instruction emulation during virtual machine exits could allow an
unprivileged guest user to crash a guest. This only affects systems that
have an Intel x86 processor with the Intel VT-x extension enabled.
(CVE-2011-1936, Moderate)

* A flaw in inet\_diag\_bc\_audit() could allow a local, unprivileged user to

cause a denial of service (infinite loop). (CVE-2011-2213, Moderate)

* A missing initialization flaw in the XFS file system implementation

could lead to an information leak. (CVE-2011-0711, Low)

* A flaw in ib\_uverbs\_poll\_cq() could allow a local, unprivileged user to

cause an information leak. (CVE-2011-1044, Low)

* A missing validation check was found in the signals implementation. A

local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to send signals via the
sigqueueinfo system call, with the si\_code set to SI\_TKILL and with spoofed
process and user IDs, to other processes. Note: This flaw does not allow
existing permission checks to be bypassed; signals can only be sent if your
privileges allow you to already do so. (CVE-2011-1182, Low)

* A heap overflow flaw in the EFI GUID Partition Table (GPT) implementation

could allow a local attacker to cause a denial of service by mounting a
disk containing specially-crafted partition tables. (CVE-2011-1776, Low)

* Structure padding in two structures in the Bluetooth implementation

was not initialized properly before being copied to user-space, possibly
allowing local, unprivileged users to leak kernel stack memory to
user-space. (CVE-2011-2492, Low)

Red Hat would like to thank Jens Kuehnel for reporting CVE-2011-0695;
Vasiliy Kulikov for reporting CVE-2011-1745, CVE-2011-2022, and
CVE-2011-1746; Ryan Sweat for reporting CVE-2011-1576; Robert Swiecki for
reporting CVE-2011-1593; Dan Rosenberg for reporting CVE-2011-2213 and
CVE-2011-0711; Julien Tinnes of the Google Security Team for reporting
CVE-2011-1182; Timo Warns for reporting CVE-2011-1776; and Marek Kroemeke
and Filip Palian for reporting CVE-2011-2492.

Bug fix documentation will be available shortly from the Technical Notes
document linked to in the References.

Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported
patches to correct these issues, and fix the bugs noted in the Technical
Notes. The system must be rebooted for this update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/kb/docs/DOC-11259>

To install kernel packages manually, use "rpm -ivh [package]". Do not
use "rpm -Uvh" as that will remove the running kernel binaries from
your system. You may use "rpm -e" to remove old kernels after
determining that the new kernel functions properly on your system.

Subject: Re: CVE request: kernel: validate size of EFI GUID
 partition entries

Hi,

from my point of view, these are different bugs:

CVE-2011-1577 addresses the overall header size used for a CRC32
computation.

CVE-2011-1776 addresses the size of partition entries used for
allocating a data structure.

Of course, one could argue that this is only one issue "missing input
validation on GUID partition tables".

Cheers, Timo

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=703026#c0)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2011-05-09 03:09:02 UTC  ``` The kernel automatically evaluates partition tables of storage devices. The code for evaluating GUID partitions (in fs/partitions/efi.c) contains a bug that can cause a kernel heap overflow on certain corrupted GUID partition tables.  Upstream commit: <http://git.kernel.org/linus/fa039d5f6b126fbd65eefa05db2f67e44df8f121>  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Timo Warns for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=703026#c3)  Petr Matousek    2011-05-09 20:45:25 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue affects the versions of Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise 4, 5, 6, and Red Hat Enterprise MRG. This has been addressed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and Red Hat Enterprise MRG via <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0927.html> and <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-1189.html>, and <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-1253.html>. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 is now in Production 3 of the maintenance life-cycle, <https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/>, therefore the fix for this issue is not currently planned to be included in the future updates.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=703026#c4)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2011-05-11 01:43:48 UTC  ``` [CVE-2011-1776](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1776) addresses the size of partition entries used for allocating a data structure.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=703026#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-07-15 06:09:13 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2011:0927 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0927.html>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=703026#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-08-23 14:42:38 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2011:1189 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-1189.html>   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=703026#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-09-12 19:46:07 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    MRG for RHEL-6 v.2  Via RHSA-2011:1253 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-1253.html>   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=703026#c0)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2011-05-09 03:09:02 UTC  ``` The kernel automatically evaluates partition tables of storage devices. The code for evaluating GUID partitions (in fs/partitions/efi.c) contains a bug that can cause a kernel heap overflow on certain corrupted GUID partition tables.  Upstream commit: <http://git.kernel.org/linus/fa039d5f6b126fbd65eefa05db2f67e44df8f121>  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Timo Warns for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=703026#c3)  Petr Matousek    2011-05-09 20:45:25 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue affects the versions of Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise 4, 5, 6, and Red Hat Enterprise MRG. This has been addressed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and Red Hat Enterprise MRG via <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0927.html> and <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-1189.html>, and <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-1253.html>. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 is now in Production 3 of the maintenance life-cycle, <https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/>, therefore the fix for this issue is not currently planned to be included in the future updates.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=703026#c4)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2011-05-11 01:43:48 UTC  ``` [CVE-2011-1776](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1776) addresses the size of partition entries used for allocating a data structure.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=703026#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-07-15 06:09:13 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2011:0927 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0927.html>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=703026#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-08-23 14:42:38 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2011:1189 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-1189.html>   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=703026#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-09-12 19:46:07 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    MRG for RHEL-6 v.2  Via RHSA-2011:1253 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-1253.html>   ``` |  |

\* CVE Identifier: CVE-2011-1776
Summary
- -------
The Linux kernel contains a vulnerability that may lead to
an information disclosure or a denial-of-service due to corrupted
partition tables on storage devices.
The kernel automatically evaluates partition tables of storage devices.
The code for evaluating EFI GUID partition tables contains a buffer
overflow bug that allows to leak data from the kernel heap to userspace
or that may allow to cause a kernel oops resulting in a denial of
service.
Workaround
- ----------
Compile and use a kernel that does not evaluate EFI GUID partition
tables. The corresponding configuration key is CONFIG\_EFI\_PARTITION.
Solution
- --------
The bug has been fixed in Linux Kernel 2.6.39.
A patch is available at
http://git.kernel.org/linus/fa039d5f6b126fbd65eefa05db2f67e44df8f121
