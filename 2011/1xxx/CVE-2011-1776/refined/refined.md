Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-1776:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the Linux kernel's code for evaluating EFI GUID partition tables (GPT), specifically within the `fs/partitions/efi.c` file.
- The code does not properly validate the size of partition entries, leading to a heap overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Heap overflow: A buffer overflow occurs on the kernel heap due to a missing validation of partition entry sizes.
- Lack of input validation on the size of partition entries in the EFI GUID partition table.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS):  A local attacker can mount a disk containing a specially crafted partition table, triggering the heap overflow which can lead to a kernel crash, resulting in a DoS.
- Information Leak: The overflow can also potentially leak data from the kernel heap to user space.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local attacker: Requires the ability to mount a storage device with a maliciously crafted GPT.
- Mounting a disk with a corrupted GPT: This is the primary means to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Local access to the system.
- Ability to mount a storage device.
- Ability to create a storage device with a specially crafted GPT.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability was reported by Timo Warns.
- The vulnerability was fixed in Linux Kernel 2.6.39.
- Red Hat has addressed this vulnerability in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG via specific security advisories(RHSA-2011:0927, RHSA-2011:1189 and RHSA-2011:1253).
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 is not planned to be fixed because it's in Production 3 of the maintenance life-cycle.
-  The vulnerability exists because of missing input validation on GUID partition tables and is specifically related to the partition entries size, where it is used for allocating a data structure, and not in the overall header size used for a CRC32 computation (addressed by CVE-2011-1577).
