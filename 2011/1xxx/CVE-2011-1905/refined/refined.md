Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities found in Proofpoint Protection Server, as described in the CERT vulnerability note VU#790980:

**Root Cause of Vulnerabilities:**
The root cause is a combination of insecure coding practices and insufficient security measures within the Proofpoint Protection Server web interface. This includes flaws in authentication, authorization, and input validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** User-level access to the web interface can be obtained without providing login credentials.
- **Insufficient Authorization Checks (Forced Browsing):** Some administrative modules are accessible without proper authentication.
- **Path Traversal:** Arbitrary files on the Proofpoint appliance can be accessed by manipulating the web interface.
- **SQL Injection:** A publicly accessible function is vulnerable to SQL injection.
- **Command Injection:** A function in the web interface can be manipulated to execute arbitrary commands on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities allows an attacker to:
- Bypass authentication to the web interface
- Execute arbitrary system commands
- Download arbitrary files from the system
- Potentially gain complete control of the affected Proofpoint server.

**Attack Vectors:**
The vulnerabilities are all remotely exploitable through the web interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to have network access to the Proofpoint Protection Server web interface. No prior authentication would be required for certain attacks due to the authentication bypass issue.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerabilities were reported by Scott Miles of Clear Skies Security.
- Patches are available for specific versions of Proofpoint Protection Server (5.5.3, 5.5.4, 5.5.5, 6.0.2, 6.1.1, and 6.2.0).
- It is advised to restrict access to the server using firewalls in addition to patching.
- The vulnerability note was originally released on 2011-05-02.
