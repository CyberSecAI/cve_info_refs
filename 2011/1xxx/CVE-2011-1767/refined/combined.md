gre: fix netns vs proto registration ordering

```
GRE protocol receive hook can be called right after protocol addition is done.
If netns stuff is not yet initialized, we're going to oops in
net_generic().

This is remotely oopsable if ip_gre is compiled as module and packet
comes at unfortunate moment of module loading.
