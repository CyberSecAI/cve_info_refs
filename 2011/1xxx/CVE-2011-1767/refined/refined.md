Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2011-1767:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The GRE (Generic Routing Encapsulation) protocol receive hook could be called immediately after the protocol was added but before the network namespace (netns) setup was complete. This premature invocation led to an attempt to use `net_generic()` without proper initialization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- Race condition: A race condition exists during the module loading of `ip_gre`, where a packet arrives before the network namespace is fully initialized.
- Improper initialization: The `net_generic()` function was being called before the necessary network namespace initialization, which leads to a crash.
- Incorrect ordering of operations: The protocol registration was done before the netns initialization.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- Kernel panic/oops: Exploitation leads to a kernel panic, or "oops" (kernel error), causing a denial-of-service.
- Remote crash: The vulnerability is remotely exploitable.

**Attack vectors:**

- Network traffic: The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a GRE packet to the affected system when the `ip_gre` module is being loaded.
- Module loading: The vulnerable code path is exposed during the loading of the `ip_gre` kernel module.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- Ability to send network packets: An attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the target system.
- Timing: The attack requires a precise timing to send the packet while the module is loading.
- The `ip_gre` module must be compiled and loaded on the target system for the exploit to work.
