    "CVE-2011-1162": {
      "related_files": [
        "drivers/char/tpm/tpm.c"
      ],
      "root_cause": "The TPM driver's `tpm_read` function did not clear the buffer after copying it to userspace, potentially exposing sensitive data from previous operations.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Information exposure"
      ],
      "impact": "A user-space application could potentially read data from the kernel memory that was previously used by the TPM driver, leading to an information leak.",
      "attack_vectors": "A malicious or compromised user-space application could exploit this vulnerability by reading the TPM driver's data buffer.",
       "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have the ability to read from the TPM device via the tpm_read function."
