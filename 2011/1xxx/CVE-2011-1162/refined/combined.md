TPM: Call tpm\_transmit with correct size

[Browse files](/torvalds/linux/tree/6b07d30aca7e52f2881b8c8c20c8a2cd28e8b3d3)

```
This patch changes the call of tpm_transmit by supplying the size of the
userspace buffer instead of TPM_BUFSIZE.

This got assigned CVE-2011-1161.

[The first hunk didn't make sense given one could expect
 way less data than TPM_BUFSIZE, so added tpm_transmit boundary
 check over bufsiz instead
 The last parameter of tpm_transmit() reflects the amount
 of data expected from the device, and not the buffer size
 being supplied to it. It isn't ideal to parse it directly,
 so we just set it to the maximum the input buffer can handle
 and let the userspace API to do such job.]

TPM: Zero buffer after copying to userspace

Since the buffer might contain security related data it might be a good idea to
zero the buffer after we have copied it to userspace.

This got assigned [CVE-2011-1162](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2pmv-xcrh-rqw5 "CVE-2011-1162").

However, the new version has no effect - all callers of tpm_transmit either pass a constant buffer size (way lower than TPM_BUFSIZE), or limit the buffer size to TPM_BUFSIZE themselves. As tpm_transmit is static, there are no unknown external callers.  Thus, the first patch is not needed. There is also no security issue as far as I can see.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=732629#c13)  Petr Matousek    2011-10-11 19:13:53 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #9](show_bug.cgi?id=732629#c9)) > As correctly pointed out, the first patch as originally submitted is incorrect > (see the description in the corrected patch: "The last parameter of > pm_transmit() reflects the amount of data expected from the device, and not the > buffer size being supplied to it").

This patch in its original form tried to limit TPM_PARAMSIZE to the userspace buffer size. While this is still an unsolved problem (because of the patch changes), with patches for [CVE-2011-1160](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1160) and [CVE-2011-1162](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1162) applied this is a security hardening not a security flaw.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=732629#c14)  Petr Matousek    2011-10-11 19:27:13 UTC  ``` [CVE-2011-1161](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1161) REJECT request <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/10/11/1>   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=732629#c15)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2011-10-25 04:08:45 UTC  ``` Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 748693](show_bug.cgi?id=748693 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2011-1162 kernel: tpm: infoleak [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=732629#c16)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-11-22 16:50:05 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2011:1465 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-1465.html>   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=732629#c17)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-11-29 14:36:07 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2011:1479 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-1479.html>   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=732629#c19)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-01-10 20:16:04 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    MRG for RHEL-6 v.2  Via RHSA-2012:0010 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0010.html>   ``` |  |

TPM: Zero buffer after copying to userspace

```
Since the buffer might contain security related data it might be a good idea to
zero the buffer after we have copied it to userspace.

This got assigned [CVE-2011-1162](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2pmv-xcrh-rqw5 "CVE-2011-1162").

## Accelerate performance

With GitHub Copilot embedded throughout the platform, you can simplify your toolchain, automate tasks, and improve the developer experience.

![](https://github.githubassets.com/assets/particles-de1dd20f3008.png)A Copilot chat window with extensions enabled. The user inputs the @ symbol to reveal a list of five Copilot Extensions. @Sentry is selected from the list, which shifts the window to a chat directly with that extension. There are three sample prompts at the bottom of the chat window, allowing the user to Get incident information, Edit status on incident, or List the latest issues. The last one is activated to send the prompt: @Sentry List the latest issues. The extension then lists several new issues and their metadata.
