Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-1062:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of this vulnerability lies in the insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input within TaskFreak! 0.6.4. The application fails to properly validate and encode data passed through various parameters, allowing an attacker to inject malicious HTML and JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

The primary weakness is **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**. Specifically, both reflected XSS via GET/POST requests and a header-based XSS vulnerability.
   -  Multiple parameters in the `index.php` script are vulnerable to XSS through POST requests, specifically: 'sContext', 'sort', 'dir', and 'show'.
   -  The `print_list.php` script is vulnerable through GET requests via the 'dir' and 'show' parameters.
   -  The `rss.php` script is vulnerable through the 'referer' header.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities allows attackers to execute arbitrary HTML and script code within a user's browser session. This can lead to:
   -  Session hijacking: Stealing user cookies to gain unauthorized access to accounts.
   -  Malware distribution: Redirecting users to malicious websites or injecting malware.
   -  Defacement: Modifying the appearance of the web page.
   -  Information theft: Stealing sensitive user data from the page.
   -  Phishing attacks: Displaying fake login forms to steal credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**

The attack vectors are:
   -  **GET requests:**  Crafted URLs with malicious JavaScript in the vulnerable parameters of `print_list.php`.
   -  **POST requests:**  Submitting forms with malicious JavaScript in the vulnerable parameters of `index.php`.
   -  **HTTP Referer Header:** Crafting requests with malicious javascript in the `Referer` header when accessing `rss.php`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

An attacker needs to be able to:
   -  Craft malicious URLs.
   -  Submit malicious POST requests.
   -  Send custom HTTP requests.
   -  Persuade a user to click the crafted URL or visit a page that would trigger the malicious request, or perform an MITM attack.

**Additional details:**
- The advisory from zeroscience.mk provides a detailed timeline of vendor communication attempts and confirms that the vulnerability was publicly released due to lack of response from the vendor.
- The exploit-db entry includes a specific Proof-of-Concept (PoC) code demonstrating how to trigger the XSS vulnerabilities, which includes:
  - A form that uses POST to exploit the vulnerable parameters in `index.php`.
  - Example URLs for exploiting the GET parameters in `print_list.php`.
  - Example raw HTTP request that triggers the vulnerability in `rss.php`.
