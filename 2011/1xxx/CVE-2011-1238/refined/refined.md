The provided content relates to CVE-2011-1238.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is improper management of kernel-mode driver objects, specifically use-after-free conditions and null pointer dereferences within the win32k.sys driver.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-after-free vulnerability in how Windows kernel-mode drivers manage kernel-mode driver objects.
- Null pointer dereference vulnerability in how Windows kernel-mode drivers manage pointers to kernel-mode driver objects.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to:
- Execute arbitrary code in kernel mode.
- Gain complete control of the affected system.
- Install programs.
- View, change, or delete data.
- Create new accounts with full administrative rights.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access is required to exploit the vulnerabilities.
- An attacker would need valid logon credentials to log on locally.
- The attacker would then need to run a specially crafted application to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Valid logon credentials.
- Ability to log on locally to the vulnerable system.
- Ability to execute a specially crafted application.
