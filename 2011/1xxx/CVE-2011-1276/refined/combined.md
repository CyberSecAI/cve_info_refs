## History

The CERT Division is the birthplace of cybersecurity. For nearly 30 years, the CERT Division of the SEI has partnered with government, industry, law enforcement, and academia to advance cybersecurity and improve the security and resilience of computer systems and networks.

Originally focused on incident response, we have expanded into cybersecurity areas such as network situational awareness, malicious code analysis, secure coding, resilience management, insider threats, digital investigations and intelligence, workforce development, DevOps, forensics, software assurance, vulnerability discovery and analysis, and risk management.

## Former Director Richard Pethia

[Richard Pethia](/about/leadership/display.cfm?customel_datapageid_2623=3545) was founding director of the SEI's CERT Division. Pethia, who served as director of CERT from 1988 to 2016, guided the organization through tremendous growth and change. Under Pethia's leadership, the unit expanded and evolved from the CERT Coordination Center—a small group focused on computer incident response—to a research organization of more than 200 professionals dedicated to solving problems with widespread cybersecurity implications.

## Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Excel Could Allow Remote Code Execution (2537146)

Published: June 14, 2011 | Updated: August 10, 2011

**Version:** 1.1

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves eight privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office. The vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted Excel file. An attacker who successfully exploited any of these vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights. Installing and configuring Office File Validation (OFV) to prevent the opening of suspicious files blocks the attack vectors for exploiting the vulnerabilities described in CVE-2011-1272, CVE-2011-1273, and CVE-2011-1279. See the section, **Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update**, for more information about how the Office File Validation feature can be configured to block the attack vectors. Microsoft Excel 2010 is only affected by CVE-2011-1273 described in this bulletin. The automated **Microsoft Fix it** solution, "Disable Edit in Protected View for Excel 2010," available in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2501584](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2501584), blocks the attack vectors for exploiting CVE-2011-1273.

This security update is rated Important for all supported editions of Microsoft Excel 2002, Microsoft Excel 2003, Microsoft Excel 2007, Microsoft Excel 2010, Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac, Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac, and Microsoft Office for Mac 2011; Open XML File Format Converter for Mac; and all supported versions of Microsoft Excel Viewer and Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying the way that Microsoft Excel validates record information when parsing specially crafted Excel files. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update

**Where are the file information details?**

Refer to the reference tables in the **Security Update Deployment** section for the location of the file information details.

**Why is this update only rated Important for all affected versions of Excel?**

Microsoft Excel 2002 and later versions have a built-in feature that prompts a user to Open, Save, or Cancel before opening a document. This mitigating factor reduces the vulnerability from Critical to Important because the vulnerability requires more than a single user action to complete the exploit.

**How could the Office File Validation feature help to mitigate the vulnerabilities?**

When the Office File Validation feature is enabled in Microsoft Excel 2003 and Microsoft Excel 2007, specially crafted files that could be used to exploit the vulnerabilities described in CVE-2011-1272, CVE-2011-1273, and CVE-2011-1279 are not opened automatically; instead, by default, the user is prompted to choose whether or not to open such a file. A user would have to click through the warning to open the file before the vulnerabilities could be exploited. For more information about Office File Validation in Microsoft Excel 2003 or Microsoft Excel 2007, see [Microsoft Security Advisory 2501584](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/2501584).

Office File Validation is enabled by default in Microsoft Excel 2010. Specially crafted files that could be used to exploit the vulnerabilities described in CVE-2011-1272, CVE-2011-1273, and CVE-2011-1279 fail validation and open in [Protected View](https://www.microsoft.com/security/pc-security/office2010.aspx); the user then must click through several warning messages before the file can be opened for editing and the vulnerabilities could be exploited.

**What is the benefit if I disable the opening of files that fail file validation in Excel 2003 and Excel 2007?**

By setting Office File Validation to not allow the opening of suspicious files in Excel 2003 and Excel 2007, the **Microsoft Fix it** solution, "Disable the opening of documents for Excel 2003 and 2007" available in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2501584](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2501584), blocks the attack vectors for exploiting the vulnerabilities described in CVE-2011-1272, CVE-2011-1273, and CVE-2011-1279.

Refer to [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2501584](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2501584) for instructions on applying the automated Fix it solution, "Disable the opening of documents for Excel 2003 and 2007," or refer to the Workaround sections for CVE-2011-1272, CVE-2011-1273, and CVE-2011-1279 in the Vulnerability Information section of this bulletin for instructions on applying the solution manually.

**What is the benefit if I disable the opening of files that fail file validation in Excel 2010?**

Microsoft Excel 2010 is only affected by CVE-2011-1273 described in this bulletin. The automated **Microsoft Fix it** solution, "Disable Edit in Protected View for Excel 2010," available in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2501584](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2501584), blocks the attack vectors for exploiting CVE-2011-1273. Customers may choose to apply the Fix it solution as a workaround if choosing not to install the security update for Excel 2010 until a later time.

Refer to [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2501584](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2501584) for instructions on applying the automated Fix it solution, "Disable Edit in Protected View for Excel 2010," or refer to the Workaround sections for CVE-2011-1273 in the Vulnerability Information section of this bulletin for instructions on applying the solution manually.

**Why does this update address several reported security vulnerabilities?**

This update contains support for several vulnerabilities because the modifications that are required to address these issues are located in related files. Instead of having to install several updates that are almost the same, customers need to install this update only.

**How is this security update related to MS11-036?**

The security update packages for Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac (KB2555786), Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac (KB2555785), and Open XML File Format Converter for Mac (KB2555784) offered in this bulletin also address the vulnerabilities described in the [MS11-036](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=217670) security bulletin.

**What components of the Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats are updated by this bulletin?**

The update included with this security bulletin applies only to the specific component within the Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats that is affected. For example, in an Excel bulletin, only the Excel compatibility pack component files are included in the update packages and not Word or PowerPoint compatibility pack component files. Word compatibility pack component files are updated in a Word bulletin and PowerPoint compatibility pack component files are updated in a PowerPoint bulletin.

**What is the Microsoft Excel Viewer?**

The Microsoft Excel Viewer is a replacement for all previous Excel Viewer versions, including Excel Viewer 97 and Excel Viewer 2003. With Excel Viewer, you can open, view, and print Excel workbooks, even if you don't have Excel installed. You can also copy data from Excel Viewer to another program. However, you cannot edit data, save a workbook, or create a new workbook.

**How are Microsoft Office standalone programs affected by the vulnerabilities?**

A Microsoft Office standalone program is affected with the same severity rating as the corresponding component in a Microsoft Office Suite. For example, a standalone installation of Microsoft Excel is affected with the same severity rating as an installation of Microsoft Excel that was delivered with a Microsoft Office Suite.

**The Microsoft Office component discussed in this article is part of the Microsoft Office Suite that I have installed on my system; however, I did not choose to install this specific component. Will I be offered this update?**

Yes, if the component discussed in this bulletin was delivered with the version of the Microsoft Office Suite installed on your system, the system will be offered updates for it whether the component is installed or not. The detection logic used to scan for affected systems is designed to check for updates for all components that were delivered with the particular Microsoft Office Suite and to offer the updates to a system. Users who choose not to apply an update for a component that is not installed, but is delivered with their version of the Microsoft Office Suite, will not increase the security risk of that system. On the other hand, users who do choose to install the update will not have a negative impact on the security or performance of a system.

**Does the offer to update a non-vulnerable version of Microsoft Office constitute an issue in the Microsoft update mechanism?**

No, the update mechanism is functioning correctly in that it detects a lower version of the files on the system than in the update package and thus, offers the update.

**I am using an older release of the software discussed in this security bulletin. What should I do?**

The affected software listed in this bulletin have been tested to determine which releases are affected. Other releases are past their support life cycle. For more information about the product lifecycle, visit the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742) Web site.

## Excel Insufficient Record Validation Vulnerability - CVE-2011-1272

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Microsoft Excel handles specially crafted Excel files. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2011-1272](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-1272).

#### Mitigating Factors for Excel Insufficient Record Validation Vulnerability - CVE-2011-1272

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful, a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains an Excel file that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attackerâs Web site, and then convince them to open the specially crafted Excel file.

#### Workarounds for Excel Insufficient Record Validation Vulnerability - CVE-2011-1272

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Set Office File Validation to disable the opening of files that fail validation in Excel 2003 and Excel 2007**

  **Note** Before applying this workaround, Office File Validation must be enabled for your version of Microsoft Office. For information on how to enable Office File Validation in Microsoft Office 2003 and Microsoft Office 2007, see the TechNet article, [Office File Validation for Office 2003 and Office 2007](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/gg985445%28office.12%29.aspx).

  The following registry scripts can be saved in registry entry (.reg) files and used to disable editing of files that fail file validation. For more information on how to use registry scripts, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 310516](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/310516).

  **Note** See [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2501584](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2501584) to use the automated **Microsoft Fix it** solution to enable or disable this workaround in the appropriate Office software.

  **Note** Modifying the Registry incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from incorrect modification of the Registry can be solved. Modify the Registry at your own risk.

| Microsoft Excel 2007 | Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00\ \ [HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\12.0\Excel\Security\FileValidation]\ \ "InvalidFileUIOptions"=dword:00000000 |

* **Use Microsoft Office File Block policy to block the opening of Office 2003 and earlier documents from unknown or untrusted sources and locations**

  Microsoft Office File Block policy can be used to block specific file format types from opening in Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and Microsoft PowerPoint.

  **For Microsoft Office 2003 and Microsoft Office 2007**

  The following registry scripts can be saved in registry entry (.reg) files and used to set the File Block policy. For more information on how to use registry scripts, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 310516](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/310516).

  **Note** In order to use 'FileOpenBlock' with Microsoft Office 2003, all of the latest security updates for Microsoft Office 2003 must be applied. In order to use 'FileOpenBlock' with Microsoft Office 2007, all of the latest security updates for Office 2007 must be applied.

| Microsoft Office Software | Registry Script |
| --- | --- |
| Microsoft Excel 2003 | Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00\ \ [HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\11.0\Excel\Security\FileOpenBlock]\ \ "BinaryFiles"=dword:00000001\ |
| Microsoft Excel 2007 | Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00\ \ [HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Office\12.0\Excel\Security\FileOpenBlock]\ \ "BinaryFiles"=dword:00000001\ |

```
**Impact of workaround.** For Microsoft Office 2003 and Microsoft Office 2007, users who have configured the File Block policy and have not configured a special exempt directory or have not moved files to a trusted location will be unable to open Office 2003 files or earlier versions. For more information about the impact of file block setting in Microsoft Office software, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 922850](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/922850).

**How to undo the workaround.**

For Microsoft Office 2003 and Microsoft Office 2007, use the following registry scripts to undo the settings used to set the File Block policy:

```

| Microsoft Office Software | Registry Script |
| --- | --- |
| Microsoft Excel 2003 | Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00\ \ [HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\11.0\PowerPoint\Security\FileOpenBlock]\ \ "BinaryFiles"=dword:00000000 |
| Microsoft Excel 2007 | Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00\ \ [HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Office\12.0\Excel\Security\FileOpenBlock]\ \ "BinaryFiles"=dword:00000000\ |

* **Use the Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment (MOICE) when opening files from unknown or untrusted sources**

  **Note** Modifying the Registry incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from incorrect modification of the Registry can be solved. Modify the Registry at your own risk.

  The Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment (MOICE) helps protect Office 2003 installations by more securely opening Word, Excel, and PowerPoint binary format files.

  To install MOICE, you must have Office 2003 or Office 2007 installed.

  To install MOICE, you must also have the Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats. The compatibility pack is available as a free download from the [Microsoft Download Center](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=941b3470-3ae9-4aee-8f43-c6bb74cd1466&displaylang=en).

  MOICE requires all updates that are recommended for all Office programs. Visit [Microsoft Update](https://update.microsoft.com/microsoftupdate/v6/default.aspx) to install all recommended updates.

  **Enable MOICE**

  **Note** See [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 935865](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/935865) to use the automated **Microsoft Fix it** solution to enable or disable this workaround.

  To manually enable MOICE, run the commands as specified in the following table. Running the commands will associate the Office application extensions with MOICE.

| Command to enable MOICE to be the registered handler |
| --- |
| For Word, run the following command from a command prompt:\ ASSOC .doc=oice.word.document |
| For Excel, run the following commands from a command prompt:\ ASSOC .XLS=oice.excel.sheet\ ASSOC .XLT=oice.excel.template\ ASSOC .XLA=oice.excel.addin |
| For PowerPoint, run the following commands from a command prompt:\ ASSOC .PPT=oice.powerpoint.show\ ASSOC .POT=oice.powerpoint.template\ ASSOC .PPS=oice.powerpoint.slideshow |

```
 **Note** On Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2, run the above commands from an elevated command prompt.

For more information on MOICE, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 935865](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/935865).

**Impact of workaround.** Office 2003 and earlier formatted documents that are converted to the Microsoft Office 2007 Open XML format by MOICE will not retain macro functionality. Additionally, documents with passwords or that are protected with Digital Rights Management cannot be converted.

**How to undo the workaround.** Run the commands to disable MOICE as specified in the table below.

```

| Command to disable MOICE as the registered handler |
