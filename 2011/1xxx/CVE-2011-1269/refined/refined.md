**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- A memory corruption vulnerability exists in Microsoft PowerPoint.
- The vulnerability can lead to remote code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain complete control of the affected system.
- An attacker can install programs, view, change, or delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.
- The attacker gains the same user rights as the logged-on user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-based attacks:** An attacker can host a website containing a malicious PowerPoint file or inject it into compromised sites. The user needs to be convinced to visit the site and open the file.
- **Email attacks:** The attacker sends the malicious file as an email attachment and convinces the user to open it.

- The vulnerability is rated as "Important".
- Microsoft acknowledges Will Dormann of CERT/CC for reporting the vulnerability.
- Mitigations include enabling Office File Validation and using Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment (MOICE).
- Workarounds are provided including disabling opening of files that fail file validation, using File Block policy, and MOICE
- The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the way that PowerPoint handles memory when parsing specially crafted files.
- The Microsoft Exploitability Index rated the likelihood of exploitation as "Exploitation more likely" (1) within 30 days of the bulletin release.
- This vulnerability is addressed by security update MS11-036.
