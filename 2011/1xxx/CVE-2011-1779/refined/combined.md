These three patches are way too far from the 2.8.4 release and don't apply; the internal structure of the particular source files have changed a lot and even if we somehow make the patches apply, I don't trust the resulting functionality.  We probably can't even rebase to latest snapshot as long as the API has changed in preparation to the 3.x series.  I suggest to close this bugreport or make someone to look deep in the sources and come up with working patches.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=705849#c5)  Vincent Danen    2011-09-02 03:46:20 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=705849#c4)) > (In reply to [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=705849#c0)) > > A buffer overflow at reading bit lengths of huffman code of LZX when reading a > > broken CAB file ([CVE-2010-4666](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-4666)) [1]. > Doesn't apply for libarchive-2.8.4, no CAB support yet  Ok, this works in our favour.   > > Buffer overflows in various functions related to reading archives (in > > archive_read_support_format_iso9660.c) ([CVE-2011-1777](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1777)) [2]. > >  > > Buffer overflow in reading tar archives ([CVE-2011-1778](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1778)) [3]. > >  > > Use-after-free bugs ([CVE-2011-1779](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1779)) [4]. >  > These three patches are way too far from the 2.8.4 release and don't apply; the > internal structure of the particular source files have changed a lot and even > if we somehow make the patches apply, I don't trust the resulting > functionality. >  > We probably can't even rebase to latest snapshot as long as the API has changed > in preparation to the 3.x series. >  > I suggest to close this bugreport or make someone to look deep in the sources > and come up with working patches.  I don't see closing this as an option.  You are effectively saying that, because it's difficult, we won't do it.  Maybe the impact is low enough that it won't matter if we don't fix it, but we need to look into it.  At a quick glance, there are a few important packages that link to libarchive: PackageKit, kdeutils, gvfs-archive, and anaconda (the last probably isn't very significant in this context).  If none of these packages use the vulnerable functionality, then I have no problem with closing this (once it is corrected in Fedora).  If they do, however, then we will need to come up with our own fix and backport what is applicable to close the hole.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=705849#c6)  Tomáš Bžatek    2011-09-02 12:13:05 UTC  ``` Okay, let's keep this open.

This isn't a high-impact flaw, so we don't need to worry about this right away, but we will probably want to take care of it at some point.

Not anytime in the short term unfortunately, my TODO list is quite long these days with higher-priority things. Last time I checked the patched didn't apply cleanly on 2.8.5 release which would involve further work. I'd be happy to package new patches however.   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=705849#c22)  Vincent Danen    2011-12-02 17:48:00 UTC  ``` The RHEL6 update was to patch 2.8.3.. would not the same patch apply to 2.8.4/2.8.5?  (I don't know, I've not looked).  I don't know what changed between 2.8.5 and 3.0.0, so perhaps rebasing may be out of the question of it introduces some ABI changes.  But if we're able to patch 2.8.3, surely that patch should apply to the other releases with minimal fuss?  Having said that, this isn't a high impact security flaw, so some delay is not a problem.   ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=705849#c23)  Anssi Hannula    2012-01-01 01:32:17 UTC  ``` The [CVE-2011-1777](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1777).patch attached to this report ([attachment #523601](attachment.cgi?id=523601&action=diff "CVE-2011-1777.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=523601&action=edit "CVE-2011-1777.patch")) is broken and breaks ISO support (found out by Mageia QA, <https://bugs.mageia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3941> ).  The upstream commit added braces to several 'if' statements, but in two places those are missing from this patch, causing the execution to enter the parent 'else' code blocks which are now wrongly associated with the added 'if' statements.  Additionally, the patch adds a return value to the heap_add_entry() function. However, there is an additional return statement in the function which should also now be changed to return ARCHIVE_OK, but this was missed.
