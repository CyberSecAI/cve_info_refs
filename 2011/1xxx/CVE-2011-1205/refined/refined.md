Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-1205:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the licensing functionality of IBM Rational products on Windows, which is based on the Microsoft COM framework.
- The licensing functionality is exposed through four different COM objects to certain IBM Rational programs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Unsafe behaviors related to the use of Microsoft COM objects, allowing potential exploitation via:
    - Opening local HTML files with scripting enabled in the "My Computer" zone.
    - Running unsafe ActiveX controls in Internet Explorer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The vulnerability could allow for arbitrary code execution. While the severity was initially rated as high, it was later downgraded to medium due to the lack of immediate high risk exploitation vectors. However, potential exploitation vectors may exist.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Opening local HTML files with scripting enabled in the "My Computer" zone.
- Running unsafe ActiveX controls in Internet Explorer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to either convince a user to open a malicious local HTML file with scripting enabled in the "My Computer" zone, or to run unsafe ActiveX controls in Internet Explorer.
- The attacker needs to target systems with vulnerable versions of IBM Rational products.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was reported to IBM by DBAPP Security.
- IBM provides a Microsoft security patch and product specific fix packs.
- An alternative risk mitigation was available before the Microsoft patch, involving the modification of the system registry to "kill" the vulnerable COM objects.

This analysis provides more details than the basic CVE description, outlining the specifics of the vulnerable component, attack vectors, and remediation.
