Release updates from the Chrome team

## [Chrome Stable Release](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2011/03/chrome-stable-release.html "Chrome Stable Release")

Tuesday, March 8, 2011

The Google Chrome team is excited to announce the arrival of Chrome 10.0.648.127 to the Stable Channel for Windows, Mac, Linux, and Chrome Frame.  Chrome 10 contains some really great improvements including:

* New version of V8 - Crankshaft - which greatly improves javascript performance
* New settings pages that open in a tab, rather than a dialog box
* Improved security with malware reporting and disabling outdated plugins by default
* Sandboxed Adobe Flash on Windows
* Password sync as part of Chrome Sync now enabled by default
* GPU Accelerated Video
* Background WebApps
* webNavigation extension API (experimental but ready for testing)

Security fixes and rewards:Please see [the Chromium security page](http://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security) for more detail. Note that the referenced bugs may be kept private until a majority of our users are up to date with the fix.

As can be seen, a few lower-severity issues were rewarded on account of being particularly interesting or clever. And some rewards were issued at the $1500 and $2000 level, reflecting bug reports where the reporter also worked with Chromium developers to provide an accepted patch.

We would also like to thank Ben Hawkes of the Google Security Team, Sergey Glazunov, Martin Barbella and “temp01irc” for working with us during the development cycle and helping prevent bugs from ever reaching the stable channel.

Last, but not least, we’d like to offer special thanks (plus additional rewards to those listed above) to Christian Holler. This is for working with us on his grammar-based fuzzing project, resulting in a more stable and secure “Crankshaft” engine for v8.

More on what's new at the [Official Chrome Blog](http://chrome.blogspot.com/).  You can find full details about the changes that are in Chrome 10 in the [SVN revision log](http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/perf/dashboard/ui/changelog.html?url=/trunk/src&range=72316:67679&mode=html). If you find new issues, please let us know by [filing a bug](http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/entry). Want to change to another Chrome release channel?
