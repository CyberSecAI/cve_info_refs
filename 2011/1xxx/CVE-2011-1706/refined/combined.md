How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Security Vulnerability - Novell iPrint nipplib.dll iprint-client-config-info Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

* **Document ID:***7008730*
* **Creation Date:**07-Jun-2011
* **Modified Date:**26-Apr-2012
* + **Micro Focus Products:**iPrint

## Environment

 Novell iPrint Client for Windows
## Situation

This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Novell iPrint Client. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.

The flaw exists within the nipplib component which is used by both the ActiveX and Netscape compatible browser plugins. When handling the iprint-client-config-info parameter from the user specified printer-url the process blindly copies user supplied data into a fixed-length buffer on the stack. A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of the browser.

## Resolution

 The fix for this security vulnerability is included in the released "iPrint Client for Windows XP/Vista/Win 7 5.64" patch, available at <https://download.novell.com/Download?buildid=6_bNby38ERg>~ or later.

| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Novell iPrint Client. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The flaw exists within the nipplib component which is used by both the ActiveX and Netscape compatible browser plugins. When handling the iprint-client-config-info parameter from the user specified printer-url the process blindly copies user supplied data into a fixed-length buffer on the stack. A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of the browser. |
