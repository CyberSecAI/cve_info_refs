Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2011-1569:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation in the `download.aspx` page of the Douran Portal application. Specifically, the application uses a blacklist approach to prevent access to sensitive files, which can be easily bypassed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference:** The application directly uses user-supplied input to construct the file path, making it vulnerable to unauthorized file access.
*   **Blacklist Approach:** The application attempts to block access to certain files by checking for specific strings in the filename. This method is inherently flawed as it can be easily circumvented by various techniques.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application does not properly sanitize or validate the user input, allowing for malicious manipulation of the file path.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **File Download/Source Code Disclosure:** Attackers can bypass the intended security restrictions to download arbitrary files from the server, including sensitive configuration files (e.g., `web.config`) and source code.
*   **Information Exposure:** Access to configuration files may reveal sensitive information such as database credentials, API keys, and internal server details. Access to source code can allow further vulnerability discovery and exploitation.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** Gaining access to the application's source code could enable attackers to discover other vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection flaws, leading to further exploitation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Requests:** The vulnerability is exploited through manipulated HTTP GET requests to the `download.aspx` page. The `FilePathAttach` and `FileNameAttach` parameters are used to specify the path and file to be downloaded.
*   **Filename Manipulation:** Attackers can use different techniques to bypass the blacklist, such as:
    *   Adding trailing dots or spaces to the filename (`web.config.`, `web.config `).
    *   Using different casing (e.g., `wEB.CoNfiG`).
    *   Using Unicode characters
    *   Using special characters that are ignored by Windows

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable Douran Portal application.
*   **Basic Web Knowledge:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of HTTP requests and URL manipulation.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The exploit does not require prior authentication on the system.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by the AJAX Security Team.
*   The vendor did not respond to vulnerability reports, and no patch was issued.
*   The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates several bypass techniques.
*   The reference provided leads to a detailed blog post by Soroush Dalili explaining unrestricted file download vulnerabilities and bypass techniques
*   The vulnerable code snippet shows that the application attempts to check for forbidden file extensions using `fileName.Substring(fileName.LastIndexOf(“.”))` but can be bypassed using the attack vectors explained above.
