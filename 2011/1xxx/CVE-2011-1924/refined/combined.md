     The OOM cache cleanup is now done by looking at the downloaded counter. The
     cleanup process start at 0 and increment it to the next lowest value until
     enough bytes have been removed.

     This process could be expensive for large amount of descriptors in the cache
     but since it is very expensive to increment counters, most cleanup should
     happen within a tight range of downloaded counter target.

     Fixes #40996

     This adds a counter for the number of times a descriptor is downloaded from an
     HSDir. Future commit will change the OOM subsystem to clean that cache based on
     the lowest downloaded counts instead of time in cache.

     In order to raise the bar even more for an attacker, the downloaded counter is
     only marked when the directory request stream is closed. To pull this off, the
     HS identifier on the directory connection is populated with the blinded key
     requested (only on success). Finally, when the connection closes, we can then
     lookup the cache entry with it and increment the counter.

     Previously we would incorrectly detect that ipv6 isn't supported if the
     ping binary isn't present (as it may not be in a relatively stripped
     down container image), or if ICMP packets aren't permitted (as they
     often aren't in containers).

     We don't really have a need to run these network tests on non-IPv6
     systems, so it makes more sense to just run them unconditionally.

      While chutney currently runs tor's chutney test in its own CI,
      it's difficult to guarantee the two won't accidentally diverge.
      Probably best to use a fixed version here so that we can control
      chutney version bumps and avoid surprise breakage in tor's CI.

      This will also free us to intentionally make breaking changes in
      chutney (though I don't have any immediate plans for any).

# [tor-announce] Tor 0.2.1.30 is released

```
Tor 0.2.1.30 fixes a variety of less critical bugs. The main other
change is a slight tweak to Tor's TLS handshake that makes relays
and bridges that run this new version reachable from Iran again.
We don't expect this tweak will win the arms race long-term, but it
buys us time until we roll out a better solution.

<https://www.torproject.org/download/download>

Changes in version 0.2.1.30 - 2011-02-23
  o Major bugfixes:
    - Stop sending a CLOCK_SKEW controller status event whenever
      we fetch directory information from a relay that has a wrong clock.
      Instead, only inform the controller when it's a trusted authority
      that claims our clock is wrong. Bugfix on 0.1.2.6-alpha; fixes
      the rest of bug 1074.
    - Fix a bounds-checking error that could allow an attacker to
      remotely crash a directory authority. Bugfix on 0.2.1.5-alpha.
      Found by "piebeer".
    - If relays set RelayBandwidthBurst but not RelayBandwidthRate,
      Tor would ignore their RelayBandwidthBurst setting,
      potentially using more bandwidth than expected. Bugfix on
      0.2.0.1-alpha. Reported by Paul Wouters. Fixes bug 2470.
    - Ignore and warn if the user mistakenly sets "PublishServerDescriptor
      hidserv" in her torrc. The 'hidserv' argument never controlled
      publication of hidden service descriptors. Bugfix on 0.2.0.1-alpha.

  o Minor features:
    - Adjust our TLS Diffie-Hellman parameters to match those used by
      Apache's mod_ssl.
    - Update to the February 1 2011 Maxmind GeoLite Country database.

  o Minor bugfixes:
    - Check for and reject overly long directory certificates and
      directory tokens before they have a chance to hit any assertions.
      Bugfix on 0.2.1.28. Found by "doorss".
    - Bring the logic that gathers routerinfos and assesses the
      acceptability of circuits into line. This prevents a Tor OP from
      getting locked in a cycle of choosing its local OR as an exit for a
      path (due to a .exit request) and then rejecting the circuit because
      its OR is not listed yet. It also prevents Tor clients from using an
      OR running in the same instance as an exit (due to a .exit request)
      if the OR does not meet the same requirements expected of an OR
      running elsewhere. Fixes bug 1859; bugfix on 0.1.0.1-rc.

  o Packaging changes:
    - Stop shipping the Tor specs files and development proposal documents
      in the tarball. They are now in a separate git repository at
      git://git.torproject.org/torspec.git
    - Do not include Git version tags as though they are SVN tags when
      generating a tarball from inside a repository that has switched
      between branches. Bugfix on 0.2.1.15-rc; fixes bug 2402.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=705192#c0)  Vincent Danen    2011-05-16 22:20:41 UTC  ``` A vulnerability in Tor was reported [1] that could allow a malicious remote attacker to cause a denial of service.  This vulnerability is due to a boundary error within the policy_summarize() function in src/or/policies.c which can be exploited to crash a Tor directory authority.  Upstream announced the release of 0.2.1.30 [2] that is noted to correct this flaw.
