- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to the way the Historian Data Archiver service (ihDataArchiver.exe or ihDataArchiver_x64.exe) processes incoming TCP/IP message traffic on Port 14000/TCP.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack-based buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could cause the Historian Data Archiver service to crash, and potentially allow an attacker to take control of the system running the vulnerable software.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable via TCP/IP message traffic on port 14000/TCP.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to send malicious TCP/IP traffic to port 14000/TCP. The attacker requires a moderate skill set to exploit this vulnerability.
