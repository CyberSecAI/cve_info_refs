How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Session key validation not working in pieforms

Bug #771598 reported by
[Richard Mansfield](/~richard-mansfield)
on 2011-04-27

### Bug Description

The 'sesskey' hidden element is added automatically to every form created by the pieform constructor, but it's not validated because on submission, the sesskey's value is regenerated in the pieform constructor rather than read from the posted value.

For the fix on stable versions, we should check the name of the hidden element and for 'sesskey', read it in from the appropriate parameter.

On master, we should leave the hidden element as it is, and use a new pieform element type for sesskey validation.

Reported by Bart van Delft.

Changed my mind for the master patch. The previously uploaded patch, which introduced a new pieform element called 'sesskey', caused the edit profile form to fail with 'no sesskey', and it would require a bunch more hacks in pieforms to fix that. This replacement fixes the bug by setting a 'sesskey' property on the hidden element instead.

Package        : mahara
Vulnerability  : several vulnerabilities
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-1402 CVE-2011-1403 CVE-2011-1404 CVE-2011-1405
                 CVE-2011-1406

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in mahara, an electronic portfolio,
weblog, and resume builder. The following Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project ids identify them:

CVE-2011-1402

  It was discovered that previous versions of Mahara did not check user
  credentials before adding a secret URL to a view or suspending a user.

CVE-2011-1403

  Due to a misconfiguration of the Pieform package in Mahara, the cross-site
  request forgery protection mechanism that Mahara relies on to harden its
  form was not working and was essentially disabled.
  This is a critical vulnerability which could allow attackers to trick other
  users (for example administrators) into performing malicious actions on
  behalf of the attacker. Most Mahara forms are vulnerable.

CVE-2011-1404

  Many of the JSON structures returned by Mahara for its AJAX interactions
  included more information than what ought to be disclosed to the logged in
  user. New versions of Mahara limit this information to what is necessary for
  each page.

CVE-2011-1405

  Previous versions of Mahara did not escape the contents of HTML emails sent
  to users. Depending on the filters enabled in one's mail reader, it could
  lead to cross-site scripting attacks.

CVE-2011-1406

  It has been pointed out to us that if Mahara is configured (through its
  wwwroot variable) to use HTTPS, it will happily let users login via the HTTP
  version of the site if the web server is configured to serve content over
  both protocol. The new version of Mahara will, when the wwwroot points to an
  HTTPS URL, automatically redirect to HTTPS if it detects that it is being
  run over HTTP.

  We recommend that sites wanting to run Mahara over HTTPS make sure that
  their web server configuration does not allow the serving of content over
  HTTP and merely redirects to the secure version. We also suggest that site
  administrators consider adding the HSTS headers
  (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security>) to their web
  server configuration.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.4-4+lenny10.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.6-2+squeeze2.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.6-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.6-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your mahara packages.
