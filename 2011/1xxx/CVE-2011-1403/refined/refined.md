Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2011-1403:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The 'sesskey' hidden element, automatically added to forms by the pieform constructor in Mahara, was not being validated correctly.
- The session key ('sesskey') value was being regenerated upon form submission instead of being read from the posted value. This effectively disabled the intended CSRF protection mechanism.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper CSRF protection. By failing to validate the session key, the application became susceptible to CSRF attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- An attacker could trick a user (including administrators) into performing unwanted actions on the application by submitting a forged request, as the session key validation was not effective.
- The impact could range from altering user settings to more critical actions, depending on the user's privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is a crafted HTTP request, typically submitted via a malicious link or script embedded in a website or email.
- An attacker can exploit this by creating a form that targets a vulnerable action, and trick a logged-in user into submitting that form.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to craft an HTTP request that targets a vulnerable form.
- The attacker needs to trick a user logged into Mahara to submit the crafted request. This could be done by persuading them to visit a malicious webpage or click a malicious link.
- No specific position or high level access within the Mahara application is required from the attacker.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was found in Mahara's Pieform package, which is responsible for handling form creation and submission.
- Patches were created for multiple Mahara versions (1.0, 1.2, 1.3 and master).
- The fix involved ensuring that the session key was read from the posted value instead of being regenerated.
- The master branch solution included a `sesskey` property to the hidden form element for validation, instead of creating a completely new element.
