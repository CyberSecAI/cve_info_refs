This has been assigned [CVE-2011-1007](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1007).

The base patch was
 <https://github.com/bestpractical/rt/commit/917c211820590950f7eb0521f7f43b31aeed44c4>
but, as discussed in
 <http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.oss.general/4247>
this breaks RT-Authen-ExternalAuth and was augmented by other changes on
the same branch later.

A targeted fix should be discussed with <security@bestpractical.com>,
as requested by Thomas Sibley in the above message.

This has been assigned [CVE-2011-1008](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1008).
A patch is
 <https://github.com/bestpractical/rt/commit/2338cd19ed7a7f4c1e94f639ab2789d6586d01f3>
but again, upstream requests coordination for targeted fixes in
 <http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.oss.general/4247>

I don't have the time to drive this further myself, just noticed the
thread at oss-security.

It is possible that Josh didn't realize it was packaged in Fedora and
EPEL (we do package quite a few things).

# CVE-2011-1007

| **Name** | CVE-2011-1007 |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | Best Practical Solutions RT before 3.8.9 does not perform certain redirect actions upon a login, which allows physically proximate attackers to obtain credentials by resubmitting the login form via the back button of a web browser on an unattended workstation after an RT logout. |
| **Source** | [CVE](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-1007) (at [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2011-1007); [CERT](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/byid?searchview=&query=CVE-2011-1007), [LWN](https://lwn.net/Search/DoSearch?words=CVE-2011-1007), [oss-sec](https://marc.info/?l=oss-security&s=CVE-2011-1007), [fulldisc](https://marc.info/?l=full-disclosure&s=CVE-2011-1007), [Red Hat](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2011-1007), [Ubuntu](https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1007), [Gentoo](https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2011-1007), SUSE [bugzilla](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2011-1007)/[CVE](https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1007/), GitHub [advisories](https://github.com/advisories?query=CVE-2011-1007)/[code](https://github.com/search?type=Code&q=%22CVE-2011-1007%22)/[issues](https://github.com/search?type=Issues&q=%22CVE-2011-1007%22), [web search](https://duckduckgo.com/html?q=%22CVE-2011-1007%22), [more](https://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/vendors)) |

The information below is based on the following data on fixed versions.

| Package | Type | Release | Fixed Version | Urgency | Origin | Debian Bugs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [request-tracker3.6](/tracker/source-package/request-tracker3.6) | source | (unstable) | (unfixed) | unimportant |  |  |
| [request-tracker3.8](/tracker/source-package/request-tracker3.8) | source | (unstable) | 3.8.10-1 | unimportant |  |  |

## Notes

```
A physically proximate attacker can do far more damage anyway

# CVE-2011-1008

| **Name** | CVE-2011-1008 |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | Scrips\_Overlay.pm in Best Practical Solutions RT before 3.8.9 does not properly restrict access to a TicketObj in a Scrip after a CurrentUser change, which allows remote authenticated users to obtain sensitive information via unspecified vectors, as demonstrated by custom-field value information, related to SQL logging. |

Hi folks,

Is Redhat packaging RT now, or are you just handling the CVEs?

In all future security mail, please use our security contact address
security@...tpractical.com, not developer email addresses pulled from
commits.  Details for our security contact are at:
<http://bestpractical.com/security/>

We have no context for Redhat's (and Debian's?) involvement here.  Can
you bring us up to speed on your plans regarding CVEs and/or security
releases in your distributions?

The commit you linked to is not the full fix.  As noted in our own bug
report you also link to above, the fix was merged into 3.8-trunk with
commit 057552287159e801535e59b8fbd5bd98d1322069.

That said, what are your plans for the diffset?  The commit itself can't
be used as a standalone patch for the issue.  It introduced a few other
bugs in core RT and broke the current stable versions of
RT-Authen-ExternalAuth (a very popular, critical extension).  The bugs
have been fixed by other commits and there are development releases of a
fixed ExternalAuth.

Are you trying to package a patch in a security update?

The above commit is an unrelated bug fix.  The correct commit is
2338cd19ed7a7f4c1e94f639ab2789d6586d01f3, however we've never tested it
as a standalone fix.  Again, what are your plans?

Thomas, for Best Practical

Correct. rt3 is community maintained in Fedora and RHEL. I am doing so
for Fedora and other people do for RHEL.
So, strictly speaking it's not "Red Hat packaged", but
community-contributed to "Red Hat owned products" (Fedora rsp. Fedora
EPEL) and some folks @RH are filing CVS against it, for reasons I don't
know.

Subject: CVE Request -- rt3 -- two issues: 1) Improper management of form
 data resubmittion upon user log out 2) SQL queries information leak by user
 account transition

Hello Josh, Steve, vendors,

   RT3 upstream has released latest v3.8.9 version:
   [1] <http://lists.bestpractical.com/pipermail/rt-announce/2011-February/000186.html>

   addressing three security flaws:
   1) * Move to a SHA-256 based password hashing scheme
      This has already got CVE id of CVE-2011-0009:
      <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-0009>

   2) * Redirect users to their desired pages after login.
      This prevents possible back button attacks after a user logs out.

      Further issue details:
      A security flaw was found in the way the RT3 ticketing
      system handled resubmitting of form data after the user
      has logged out of the browser (but not closed it).
      A local attacker could use this flaw to access the user
      account of the victim (login without providing a password
      or obtain user credentials).

      References:
      [a] <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=614575>
      [b] <http://lists.bestpractical.com/pipermail/rt-announce/2011-February/000186.html>

      Upstream bug report:
      [c] <http://issues.bestpractical.com/Ticket/Display.html?id=15804>

      Upstream changeset:
      [d] <https://github.com/bestpractical/rt/commit/917c211820590950f7eb0521f7f43b31aeed44c4>

      Thomas, could you please confirm [d] is the proper fix for 2) issue? Thank you.
      (* Redirect users to their desired pages after login.)

   3) * Clone Scrip's TicketObj since we change the CurrentUser and it can leak
      information (Custom field values, etc)

      Further issue details:
      A security flaw was found in the way the RT3 ticketing
      system handled logging of SQL queries during performing
      of user account transition. A remote, authenticated RT3
      user could use this flaw to obtain sensitive information.

      References:
      [i]  <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=614576>
      [ii] <http://lists.bestpractical.com/pipermail/rt-announce/2011-February/000186.html>

      Upstream changeset (needs confirmation from upstream if it's
      real fix for the issue yet):
      [iii] <https://github.com/bestpractical/rt/commit/56e20b874e8d67ab93aa80c2c00155110a27e764>

      Shawn, could you please confirm [iii] is the proper fix for 3) issue?
      (* Clone Scrip's TicketObj since we change the CurrentUser and it can leak)

      If [iii] not being the correct one for 3) issue, could you point us
      to the right one? Thank you.

Steve, once patches confirmed, could you allocate CVE ids for the 2), and 3) issues?

Thanks && Regards, Jan.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

We are happy to announce that RT 3.8.9 is now available. You can
download it from:

<http://download.bestpractical.com/pub/rt/release/rt-3.8.9.tar.gz>
<http://download.bestpractical.com/pub/rt/release/rt-3.8.9.tar.gz.sig>

This release of RT contains 9 months of small improvements and bug fixes. It
includes a fix for the security issue announced here:

<http://lists.bestpractical.com/pipermail/rt-announce/2011-January/000185.html>

If you have previously installed RT-Extension-SaltedPasswords, it will
automatically disable itself after the upgrade. You may then safely
remove it from @Plugins.

Important upgrade notes:

In addition to the normal /opt/rt3/sbin/rt-setup-database upgrade step,
there are a few standalone upgrade scripts you should run. You can find
full details in the "UPGRADING" file in the distribution.  Please review
'UPGRADING FROM 3.8.8 and earlier' and ensure you follow each of the
steps.

A list of changes is below.

95dc126acaba7b5069f83bf042c31e6857e7397f  rt-3.8.9.tar.gz.sig

SECURITY

 * Move to a SHA-256 based password hashing scheme

 * Add a callback to allow extensions to redirect a user to an external auth logout URL using RT's logout button. This ensures that the user's RT session is cleared
 * Add SuppressAutoOpenOnUpdate preference

DOCUMENTATION

 * Clean up README
 * Update UPGRADING.mysql documentation for users of older mysql
 * Flag that "Let this user be granted rights" means "Privileged"
 * Fix rt-crontool examples to use a real Condition
 * Undocument SenderMustExistInExternalDatabase since the code was never merged
 * Better document SetOutgoingMailFrom
 * Better document shrink_cgm_table.pl

DATABASE

 * Add support for Postgres 9
 * No longer record transactions for ACL Equivalence Groups
 * Don't delete all RT MySQL ACLs before invoke GRANT
 * Quote database name for GRANT on MySQL
 * Insert extensions' schema and acl files as the DBA
 * Fix searches for empty Attachments on Oracle

EMAIL

 * Better handling of mail generated by Outlook
 * When RT's SendmailCommand fails, record it in ticket history
 * New GPG tests and bugfixes for corner cases
 * use EmailOutputEncoding for Content-Type.charset
 * Handle failures in MIME Encoding better
 * Small bugfixes for text/html templates
