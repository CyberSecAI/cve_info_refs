{
  "CVE-2011-1008": {
    "Description": "Scrips_Overlay.pm in Best Practical Solutions RT before 3.8.9 does not properly restrict access to a TicketObj in a Scrip after a CurrentUser change, which allows remote authenticated users to obtain sensitive information via unspecified vectors, as demonstrated by custom-field value information, related to SQL logging.",
    "Root cause": "The `Scrips_Overlay.pm` component in RT did not properly restrict access to the `TicketObj` after a change in the `CurrentUser` context within a Scrip.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient access control",
      "Information exposure"
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote, authenticated user could obtain sensitive information, such as custom field values, by exploiting this flaw. This is due to the system's logging of SQL queries during user account transitions where it failed to properly sanitize data based on the current user.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered through unspecified vectors related to how the system handles SQL logging during user account transitions.",
     "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a remote, authenticated user of the RT system."
