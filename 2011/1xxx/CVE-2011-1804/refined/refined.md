Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2011-1804:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a stale pointer issue during the rendering of floats in WebKit. Specifically, the code that determines if a block contains a float was using a pointer (`currBlock`) which could become stale, leading to a use-after-free condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use-after-free:** The core weakness is a use-after-free vulnerability. The code was using a `RenderBlock* currBlock` pointer that could become invalid if the underlying RenderBlock object was deallocated or modified. When this stale pointer is later accessed, it could point to arbitrary memory, leading to a crash or potentially arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Crash:** The most immediate impact of exploiting this vulnerability is a crash of the browser or rendering process.
- **Potential for arbitrary code execution:** While not explicitly stated, use-after-free vulnerabilities can, under certain circumstances, be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution by manipulating the memory that was previously pointed to by the stale pointer.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious HTML:** The vulnerability can be triggered by crafting a malicious HTML page containing specific float elements within block elements. This HTML would manipulate the float rendering and cause the stale pointer scenario to occur. The provided test case `LayoutTests/fast/block/float/float-not-removed-crash.html` demonstrates this.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to serve or inject a crafted HTML page with specific floating elements.
- The attacker does not require any elevated privileges on the user's system.
- The attacker would typically be in the position of a website operator, or an attacker who could perform a man-in-the-middle attack.
