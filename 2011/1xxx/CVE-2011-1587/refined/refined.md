Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2011-1587:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The initial fix for an XSS vulnerability (CVE-2011-1578) in MediaWiki 1.16.3 was incomplete. The vulnerability was related to how Internet Explorer 6 and earlier parsed URLs containing file extensions before question marks. The original fix did not account for multiple question marks in a URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** A flaw in how MediaWiki handled URLs could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts when viewed with Internet Explorer 6 and earlier.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation would result in an XSS vulnerability, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Crafted URLs: An attacker could create a malicious link containing multiple question marks and a file extension, which, when clicked by a user using Internet Explorer 6 or earlier, would trigger the XSS vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to generate and distribute malicious URLs, likely via a link on a website, an email, or some other method.
- The victim needs to be using Internet Explorer 6 or earlier for the exploit to work.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability specifically affects Internet Explorer 6 and earlier.
- A web server configuration change is also required for a complete fix, especially if AllowOverride is disabled. The recommended Apache configuration change is to add the following rewrite rule:

```
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} \.[a-z0-9]{1,4}(#|\?|$) [nocase]
RewriteRule . - [forbidden]
```
This rule blocks any requests where the query string includes a file extension, preventing the vulnerability from being exploited.

- MediaWiki 1.16.4 was released to address this incomplete fix.
- This CVE is associated with the original CVE-2011-1578.
