# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

                 CVE-2011-4360 CVE-2011-4361
Debian Bug     : 650434

Several problems have been discovered in mediawiki, a website engine for
collaborative work.

CVE-2011-1578 CVE-2011-1587

   Masato Kinugawa discovered a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue, which
   affects Internet Explorer clients only, and only version 6 and
   earlier. Web server configuration changes are required to fix this
   issue. Upgrading MediaWiki will only be sufficient for people who use
   Apache with AllowOverride enabled.

   For details of the required configuration changes, see the upstream
   announcements:
  <http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/mediawiki-announce/2011-April/000096.html>
  <http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/mediawiki-announce/2011-April/000097.html>

CVE-2011-1579

   Wikipedia user Suffusion of Yellow discovered a CSS validation error
   in the wikitext parser. This is an XSS issue for Internet Explorer
   clients, and a privacy loss issue for other clients since it allows
   the embedding of arbitrary remote images.

CVE-2011-1580

   MediaWiki developer Happy-Melon discovered that the transwiki import
   feature neglected to perform access control checks on form submission.
   The transwiki import feature is disabled by default. If it is enabled,
   it allows wiki pages to be copied from a remote wiki listed in
   $wgImportSources. The issue means that any user can trigger such an
   import to occur.

CVE-2011-4360

   Alexandre Emsenhuber discovered an issue where page titles on private
   wikis could be exposed bypassing different page ids to index.php. In the
   case of the user not having correct permissions, they will now be redirected
   to Special:BadTitle.

CVE-2011-4361

   Tim Starling discovered that action=ajax requests were dispatched to the
   relevant function without any read permission checks being done. This could
   have led to data leakage on private wikis.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:1.12.0-2lenny9.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:1.15.5-2squeeze2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:1.15.5-5.

We recommend that you upgrade your mediawiki packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

# [MediaWiki-announce] MediaWiki security release 1.16.4

**Tim Starling**

```
Our patch for the Internet Explorer 6 XSS issue (bug 28235) released
two days ago in 1.16.3 was insufficient to fix that bug. The original
reporter, Masato Kinugawa, pointed out the flaw on bug 28507. So we
are doing another release, which contains a second attempt at fixing
the issue.

Apologies to everyone for the inconvenience. Big thanks go to Masato
Kinugawa for helping to keep MediaWiki secure. Thanks also to Roan
Kattouw who helped me test the patch this time around, so that we can
hopefully avoid a repeat.

It is necessary to upgrade MediaWiki to avoid an XSS vulnerability for
Internet Explorer clients, version 6 and earlier. Also, if you used
the Apache configuration I suggested in the previous release
announcement, you should update it to:

    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} \.[a-z0-9]{1,4}(#|\?|$) [nocase]
    RewriteRule . - [forbidden]

We missed the fact that there can be more than one question mark in a
URL. In certain circumstances, IE 6 will use a file extension
immediately before a question mark character, regardless of how many
question marks precede it. For example, with the URL:

<http://example.com/a?b?c.html?d?e>

IE 6 will see the file extension as ".html".

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=696360#c0)  Vincent Danen    2011-04-13 21:59:47 UTC  ``` Mediawiki 1.16.3 was released [1] to correct three security flaws:  Masato Kinugawa discovered a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue, which affects Internet Explorer clients only, and only version 6 and earlier. Web server configuration changes are required to fix this issue. Upgrading MediaWiki will only be sufficient for people who use Apache with AllowOverride enabled. ([CVE-2011-1578](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1578))  Wikipedia user Suffusion of Yellow discovered a CSS validation error in the wikitext parser. This is an XSS issue for Internet Explorer clients, and a privacy loss issue for other clients since it allows the embedding of arbitrary remote images. ([CVE-2011-1579](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1579))  MediaWiki developer Happy-Melon discovered that the transwiki import feature neglected to perform access control checks on form submission. The transwiki import feature is disabled by default. If it is enabled, it allows wiki pages to be copied from a remote wiki listed in $wgImportSources. The issue means that any user can trigger such an import to occur. ([CVE-2011-1580](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1580))  [1] <http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/mediawiki-announce/2011-April/000096.html>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=696360#c1)  Vincent Danen    2011-04-13 22:02:01 UTC  ``` Created mediawiki tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 696361](show_bug.cgi?id=696361 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2011-1578 CVE-2011-1579 CVE-2011-1580 mediawiki: multiple vulnerabilities fixed in 1.16.3 [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=696360#c2)  Vincent Danen    2011-04-13 22:02:04 UTC  ``` Created mediawiki116 tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: epel-all [[bug 696362](show_bug.cgi?id=696362 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2011-1578 CVE-2011-1579 CVE-2011-1580 CVE-2011-1765 mediawiki116 various flaws [epel-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=696360#c3)  Vincent Danen    2011-04-14 02:49:31 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 695577](show_bug.cgi?id=695577 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - MediaWiki 1.16.2 Cross-Site Scripting (2) and Access Control Bypass CVE-2011-1578 CVE-2011-1579 CVE-2011-1580") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=696360#c4)  Vincent Danen    2011-04-14 14:39:39 UTC  ``` 1.16.3 is not sufficient, as it does not fully fix the [CVE-2011-1578](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1578) issue.  Mediawiki 1.16.4 has been released to fully address it: <http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/mediawiki-announce/2011-April/000097.html>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=696360#c5)  Vincent Danen    2011-04-18 21:57:46 UTC  ``` The issue noted in [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=696360#c4) (incomplete fix for [CVE-2011-1578](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1578)) has been assigned the name [CVE-2011-1587](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1587).   ``` |  |
