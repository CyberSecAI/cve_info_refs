Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-1020:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the fact that file descriptors to `/proc/$pid/` entries, opened by a less privileged process, remain open even after a `setuid` binary is executed. This allows the original, unprivileged process to continue reading from or writing to those files, effectively bypassing Discretionary Access Control (DAC) protections.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Bypassing DAC:**  The primary vulnerability is the circumvention of DAC. Normally, the kernel would restrict access to `/proc/$pid/` files based on the user ID of the current process. However, because the file descriptor remains open from before the `setuid` transition, the permissions are not revalidated.
*   **Information Leakage:** This allows an unprivileged process to access potentially sensitive information related to the `setuid` process, such as:
    *   ASLR offsets (specifically the stack and ld base address) via `auxv`.
    *   Kernel stack contents via `stack`.
    *   System call parameters via `syscall`.
    *   Resource limits via `limits`.
*   **Process Manipulation:** The vulnerability also allows for the manipulation of the setuid process via `/proc/$pid/` entries, like:
    *   Modifying the coredump filter via `coredump_filter`.
    *   Changing the Out-of-Memory (OOM) adjust value via `oom_adj`, potentially leading to denial of service (DoS).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:**  An attacker can gain knowledge of the memory layout of the `setuid` process, including ASLR offsets, which can be used to bypass security mechanisms.
*   **Privilege Escalation (Indirect):** While not a direct privilege escalation, this vulnerability allows an attacker to gather information about a `setuid` program, potentially leading to further exploitation and gaining higher privileges in a different step.
*   **Denial of Service:** Modifying the oom\_adj value can lead to a denial of service by causing the setuid program to be killed by the kernel.
*   **Process Manipulation:** An attacker could control process behavior by modifying parameters via the /proc interface.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** This vulnerability requires local access to the system.
*   **Pre-opened file descriptors:**  The attacker needs to open file descriptors to `/proc/$pid/` files before the target process executes a `setuid` binary.
*   **Setuid Binary Execution:** The target program must be a `setuid` binary for the attack to succeed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** The attacker needs to be a local user with the ability to execute programs and open files.
*   **Timing:** The attacker has to open the file descriptors to the target process before that process execs the setuid binary
*   **Knowledge of Target:** The attacker needs to know or determine the PID of the process to attack, since /proc/$pid/ needs an existing PID to open files.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was originally reported on the `full-disclosure` mailing list and subsequently discussed on the Linux Kernel Mailing List (LKML).
*   The `O_CLOEXEC` flag, while a valid way to close file descriptors across execve, does not address the kernel-side vulnerability of file descriptors not being revalidated after `setuid` execution.
*   The `security_may_ptrace()` check was proposed as a method for revalidating permissions on `/proc/$pid/` files. This is because ptrace already allows one process to inspect another, therefore /proc can be locked down with the same restrictions
*   The `dumpable` flag was also discussed as a potential way to handle this problem.
*   A python script called `procleak.py` was created to demonstrate the vulnerability.
*  The vulnerability was assigned CVE-2011-1020 in response to the request.
*  The vulnerability was also assigned OSVDB-71271

This vulnerability allows for the leakage of various information related to the `setuid` process, which can be used to further exploit the system.
