Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2011-1894:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how the MHTML protocol handler interprets MIME-formatted requests for content embedded within an HTML document. Specifically, the MHTML parser incorrectly handles these requests, leading to a security context issue.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper MHTML Parsing:** The core issue is the flawed way the MHTML parser handles MIME-formatted requests, allowing for injection of client-side scripts.
*   **Incorrect Security Context:** The vulnerability enables an attacker to inject and run scripts in an unintended security context (e.g., an incorrect Internet Explorer security zone). This is similar to a server-side XSS vulnerability but occurs client-side due to the way MHTML content is processed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can potentially disclose sensitive information.
*   **Client-Side Script Injection:** An attacker can inject malicious client-side scripts into a user's instance of Internet Explorer.
*   **Spoofing Content:** The injected script can alter the appearance of content.
*   **Taking Actions on User's Behalf:** The injected script can perform actions as if they were initiated by the user on an affected website.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web-Based Attack:** An attacker hosts a malicious web page with embedded content designed to exploit the MHTML vulnerability. The victim has to visit this page.
*  **E-mail or Instant Messenger:** An attacker convinces a user to click a link in a message which points to the malicious web page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Hosting a Malicious Web Page:** The attacker needs to host a webpage or compromise an existing website.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker must convince a user to visit the malicious web page via a link.
*   **Understanding of HTML and MHTML:** The attacker needs the technical knowledge to craft malicious content utilizing HTML <EMBED> tags.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is mitigated on servers due to the Enhanced Security Configuration of Internet Explorer on Windows Servers.
*   Microsoft Outlook, Outlook Express, and Windows Mail by default open HTML emails in the restricted sites zone, which mitigates the risk through email.
*   A workaround to disable the MHTML protocol handler is provided, but it impacts applications that rely on MHTML.
* The vulnerability was publicly disclosed before the security update was released.
