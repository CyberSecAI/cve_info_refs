| [Description](#c0)  Paweł Hajdan, Jr. (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2011-03-09 16:26:27 UTC  ``` It was found, that Postfix, a Mail Transport Agent (MTA), recognized SMTP commands during plaintex to TLS session switch (by TLS protocol initialization). A remote attacker could use this flaw to insert plaintext SMTP protocol commands into TLS protocol initialization messages, leading to SMTP commands execution during the ciphertext protocol phase, allowing the attacker to steal user credentials and conduct man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.  <http://www.postfix.org/announcements/postfix-2.7.3.html> ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Tim Harder   gentoo-dev  2011-03-09 20:40:18 UTC  ``` I'll bump 2.7.3 but I'd rather drop the 2.6.* series from the tree unless someone has a good reason not to. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Eray Aslan   gentoo-dev  2011-03-10 03:27:07 UTC  ``` Just get the non-vulnerable versions in the tree quickly and have them stabilized.  Currently, the stable version is vulnerable which is something we should try to avoid.  Go with whatever you are comfortable with regarding the number of past versions you want to keep. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Tim Harder   gentoo-dev  2011-03-10 03:43:40 UTC  ``` 2.7.3 is now in CVS and 2.6.* have been removed from the tree. ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Paweł Hajdan, Jr. (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2011-03-10 07:59:52 UTC  ``` Thank you.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : postfix
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2009-2939 CVE-2011-0411 CVE-2011-1720

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Postfix, a mail transfer
agent.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following problems:

CVE-2009-2939
        The postinst script grants the postfix user write access to
        /var/spool/postfix/pid, which might allow local users to
        conduct symlink attacks that overwrite arbitrary files.

CVE-2011-0411
        The STARTTLS implementation does not properly restrict I/O
        buffering, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to insert
        commands into encrypted SMTP sessions by sending a cleartext
        command that is processed after TLS is in place.

CVE-2011-1720
        A heap-based read-only buffer overflow allows malicious
        clients to crash the smtpd server process using a crafted SASL
        authentication request.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.5.5-1.1+lenny1.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.7.1-1+squeeze1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.8.0-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your postfix packages.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=699035#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-04-22 18:27:29 UTC  ``` A heap-based buffer overread flaw was found in the way Postfix mail transport agent performed SASL handlers management for SMTP sessions, when the Cyrus SASL authentication was enabled. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause Postfix smtpd server crash via specially-crafted SASL authentication request.  Note: The default configuration of Postfix mail transport agent,       as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5, and 6 do       not enable SASL support for SMTP authentication for mail       clients (thus Postfix server instances using it are not       vulnerable to this flaw).  Workaround: If your Postfix server configuration contains       directive like:          smtpd_sasl_auth_enable = yes        change 'yes' to 'no' or comment the whole line out not       to be vulnerable to this flaw.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=699035#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-04-22 18:29:08 UTC  ``` This issue affects the versions of the postfix package, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5, and 6.  --  This issue affects the versions of the postfix package, as shipped with Fedora release of 13 and 14.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=699035#c6)  Tomas Hoger    2011-05-09 14:33:21 UTC  ``` Public now via:   <http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.mail.postfix.announce/127>   <http://www.postfix.org/CVE-2011-1720.html> (to be available soon)   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=699035#c8)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-05-13 10:27:00 UTC  ```  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank the CERT/CC for reporting [CVE-2011-1720](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1720). Upstream acknowledges Thomas Jarosch of Intra2net AG as the original reporter.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=699035#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-05-31 15:46:09 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2011:0843 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0843.html>   ``` |  |

# USN-1131-1: Postfix vulnerability

11 May 2011

An attacker could send crafted input to Postfix and cause it to crash or
run programs.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 11.04](/security/notices?release=natty)
* [Ubuntu 10.10](/security/notices?release=maverick)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)
* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Packages

* [postfix](/security/cves?package=postfix) - High-performance mail transport agent

## Details

Thomas Jarosch discovered that Postfix incorrectly handled authentication

mechanisms other than PLAIN and LOGIN when the Cyrus SASL library is used.

A remote attacker could use this to cause Postfix to crash, leading to a

denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code as the postfix user.

### Reduce your security exposure

1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
A security problem in the Postfix mail transport agent was fixed that
could potentially be used by remote attackers to exploit a memory
corruption issue in postfix SASL implementation to execute arbitrary
code (CVE-2011-1720).
The upstream announcement is here:
<http://www.postfix.org/announcements/postfix-2.8.3.html>
and notes:
CVE-2011-1720 does not affect Postfix SMTP servers that use Dovecot
SASL authentication. It also does not affect the common Postfix
SMTP server configurations that use only Cyrus SASL mechanisms PLAIN
and LOGIN.
We thank Wietse Venema for notifying us on this issue and Thomas
Jarosch of Intra2net AG for reporting it.
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
postfix should restart itself after installing the update.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
"Online Update" module or the "zypper" commandline tool. The package and
patch management stack will detect which updates are required and
automatically perform the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

```
```

Summary
=======

The Postfix SMTP server has a memory corruption error when the Cyrus
SASL library is used with authentication mechanisms other than PLAIN
and LOGIN (the ANONYMOUS mechanism is unaffected but should not be
enabled for different reasons). See below for instructions to
determine what systems are affected.

Examples of affected Cyrus SASL authentication methods are CRAM-MD5,
DIGEST-MD5, EXTERNAL, GSSAPI, KERBEROS_V4, NTLM, OTP, PASSDSS-3DES-1,
and SRP.

The error was introduced with the Postfix SASL patch, and is present
in all Postfix versions where the command "postconf mail_release_date"
reports a value of 20000314 (March 14, 2000) or greater.

This problem was discovered by Thomas Jarosch of Intra2net AG.

The memory corruption is known to result in a program crash (SIGSEV).
Remote code execution cannot be excluded. Such code would execute
as the unprivileged "postfix" user. This user has no control over
processes that run with non-postfix privileges including Postfix
processes running as root; the impact may be reduced with configurations
that enable the Postfix chroot feature or that use platform-dependent
privilege-reducing features.

The problem is fixed in Postfix stable releases 2.5.13, 2.6.10,
2.7.4, 2.8.3; in the Postfix 2.9 development release as of May 1,
2011; patches exist for Postfix version 1.1 and later. All this is
available from Postfix mirrors at <http://www.postfix.org/download.html>.

What systems are affected
=========================

The Postfix SMTP client is not affected.

Affected are Postfix SMTP server configurations that have SASL
authentication turned on, and that use Cyrus SASL authentication
mechanisms other than ANONYMOUS, PLAIN and LOGIN. Here,

  * the command "postconf smtpd_sasl_auth_enable" produces as output
    "smtpd_sasl_auth_enable = yes";

  * and the command "postconf smtpd_sasl_type" produces as output
    "smtpd_sasl_type = cyrus" (or "smtpd_sasl_type: unknown
    parameter");

  * and the Postfix SMTP server's reply to the EHLO command shows
    AUTH methods other than ANONYMOUS, PLAIN and LOGIN. Examples
    of other methods are CRAM-MD5 or DIGEST-MD5.

    Example for the "port 25" service:

    $ telnet server.example.com 25
    Connected to server.example.com.
    Escape character is '^]'.
    220 server.example.com ESMTP Postfix
    ehlo client.example.com
    250-server.example.com
    250-PIPELINING
    250-SIZE 10240000
    250-STARTTLS
    250-AUTH DIGEST-MD5 LOGIN PLAIN CRAM-MD5
    250-AUTH=DIGEST-MD5 LOGIN PLAIN CRAM-MD5
    250-ENHANCEDSTATUSCODES
    250-8BITMIME
    250 DSN
    quit
    221 2.0.0 Bye
    Connection closed by foreign host.

    Example for the "port 587" (submission) service. This service
    is not enabled by default.

    $ openssl s_client -quiet -starttls smtp -connect server.example.com:587
    [TLS handshake information deleted]
    250 DSN
    ehlo client.example.com
    250-server.example.com
    250-PIPELINING
    250-SIZE 10240000
    250-AUTH DIGEST-MD5 LOGIN PLAIN CRAM-MD5
    250-AUTH=DIGEST-MD5 LOGIN PLAIN CRAM-MD5
    250-ENHANCEDSTATUSCODES
    250-8BITMIME
    250 DSN
    quit
    221 2.0.0 Bye

Although it is not affected, the ANONYMOUS authentication mechanism
should not be enabled as it can make an SMTP server an open relay.

What systems are not affected
=============================

The Postfix SMTP client is not affected.

Not affected are Postfix SMTP server configurations that have SASL
authentication turned off, including configurations without SASL
support compiled in. Here, the command "postconf smtpd_sasl_auth_enable"
produces as output "smtpd_sasl_auth_enable = no".

Not affected are Postfix SMTP server configurations that use Dovecot
SASL instead of Cyrus SASL. Here, the command "postconf smtpd_sasl_type"
produces as output "smtpd_sasl_type = dovecot".

Not affected are Postfix SMTP server configurations that enable
Cyrus SASL support with only the PLAIN or LOGIN methods, or both.
Here,

  * the command "postconf smtpd_sasl_auth_enable" produces as output
    "smtpd_sasl_auth_enable = yes";

  * and the command "postconf smtpd_sasl_type" produces as output
    "smtpd_sasl_type = cyrus" (or "smtpd_sasl_type: unknown
    parameter");

  * and the Postfix SMTP server's reply to the EHLO command shows
    only AUTH mechanisms of PLAIN, LOGIN, or both.

    Example for the "port 25" service:

    $ telnet server.example.com 25
    Connected to server.example.com.
    Escape character is '^]'.
    220 server.example.com ESMTP Postfix
    ehlo client.example.com
    250-server.example.com
    250-PIPELINING
    250-SIZE 10240000
    250-STARTTLS
    250-AUTH LOGIN PLAIN
    250-AUTH=LOGIN PLAIN
    250-ENHANCEDSTATUSCODES
    250-8BITMIME
    250 DSN
    quit
    221 2.0.0 Bye
    Connection closed by foreign host.

    Example for the "port 587" (submission) service. This service
    is not enabled by default.

    $ openssl s_client -quiet -starttls smtp -connect server.example.com:587
    [TLS handshake information deleted]
    250 DSN
    ehlo client.example.com
    250-server.example.com
    250-PIPELINING
    250-SIZE 10240000
    250-AUTH LOGIN PLAIN
    250-AUTH=LOGIN PLAIN
    250-ENHANCEDSTATUSCODES
    250-8BITMIME
    250 DSN
    quit
    221 2.0.0 Bye

Not affected is the ANONYMOUS authentication mechanism, but this
should not be enabled as it can make an SMTP server an open relay.

Workarounds
===========

Disable Cyrus SASL authentication mechanisms for the Postfix SMTP
server other than PLAIN and LOGIN. The mechanisms are specified in
a Cyrus SASL smtpd.conf configuration file. This file may be found
in /etc/postfix/sasl/, /var/lib/ sasl2/, /etc/sasl2/, /usr/lib/sasl2/
or /usr/local/lib/sasl2/.

In this file, update the "mech_list:" entry and remove any methods
other than PLAIN and LOGIN. For example, this configuration is not
affected:

    mech_list: PLAIN LOGIN

Execute the command "postfix reload" to make the change effective,
then verify that the "port 25" and "port 587" services no longer
announce other SASL mechanisms, as shown in the previous section.

Technical details
=================

The Postfix SMTP server creates a SASL handle for each SMTP session,
when SASL authentication is enabled. The Postfix SMTP server will
use this SASL handle until it closes the SMTP connection (the Postfix
SMTP server may create a new server SASL handle when the client and
server agree to switch from a plaintext session to a TLS-encrypted
session, but this does not eliminate the memory corruption problem).

According to a comment in a Cyrus SASL include source file, a server
must not reuse a Cyrus SASL server handle after client authentication
failure. Instead, a server must create a new Cyrus SASL server
handle including mechanism list, before processing another client
authentication request.

The Postfix SMTP server fails to create a new Cyrus SASL server
handle after authentication failure. This causes memory corruption
when, for example, a client requests CRAM-MD5 authentication, fails
to authenticate, and then invokes some other authentication mechanism
except PLAIN (or ANONYMOUS if available). The likely outcome is
that the Postfix SMTP server process crashes with a segmentation
violation error (SIGSEGV, a.k.a. signal 11).

In the following example, S: indicates server output and C: indicates
client input. Line numbers are prepended for reference in the
background discussion in the next section.

     1 S: 220 server.example.com ESMTP
     2 C: EHLO client.example.com
     3 S: 250-server.example.com
     4 S: ...other server output skipped...
     5 S: 250-AUTH DIGEST-MD5 LOGIN PLAIN CRAM-MD5
     6 S: 250-AUTH=DIGEST-MD5 LOGIN PLAIN CRAM-MD5
     7 S: ...other server output skipped...
     8 C: AUTH CRAM-MD5
     9 S: 334 PDg5ODE0OTI3MS4xMDQyMTg1OUBzZXJ2ZXIuZXhhbXBsZS5jb20+Cg==
    10 C: *
    11 S: 501 5.7.0 Authentication aborted
    12 C: AUTH DIGEST-MD5
    13 Connection closed by foreign host.

In the mail logfile, Postfix will log a warning similar to:

    postfix/master[2213]: warning: process /usr/libexec/postfix/smtpd
    pid 22585 killed by signal 11

Background
==========

Each Cyrus SASL authentication mechanism is implemented with a) one
statically-allocated shared data structure containing data and
pointers to functions that implement the mechanism, and b)
dynamically-allocated session context data structures with
authentication state.

When the Postfix SMTP server receives "AUTH CRAM-MD5" (line 8 above),
the Cyrus SASL CRAM-MD5 method initializes one CRAM-MD5 session
context data structure, and generates the "step 1" initial client
challenge which the Postfix SMTP server sends in line 9 above.

When the SMTP client sends "*" to abort the CRAM-MD5 authentication
request (line 10 above), the CRAM-MD5 session context data structure
remains attached to the Cyrus SASL server handle. Postfix fails to
create a new Cyrus SASL server handle when the client sends the
subsequent "AUTH DIGEST-MD5" request (line 12 above); the DIGEST-MD5
method will therefore use the "wrong" session context data structure
(which was created after the "AUTH CRAM-MD5" request on line 8),
and will skip its "step 1" challenge.

Each Cyrus SASL authentication method has a different context data
structure layout. Because of these differences, the bits from the
CRAM-MD5 method's context data structure will not work as intended
with the DIGEST-MD5 method. As shown in the stack trace below, the
Postfix SMTP server process crashes in "step 2" of the DIGEST-MD5
authentication protocol. This happens while attempting to read from
a pointer that contains an invalid address.

In this particular example, the Postfix SMTP server crashes while
running under control of the GDB debugger (see the Postfix master(5)
manpage discussion of the -D option), while processing the SMTP
commands shown in the example above.

(gdb) where

    reply=0x8851aee8) at xsasl_cyrus_server.c:529
[Remainder of stack trace omitted for brevity]

This stack trace was obtained after informing the GDB debugger of
SASL authentication methods that are linked in at runtime (example:
"add-symbol-file /usr/local/lib/sasl2/libdigestmd5.so.2 0x884b8e50").
Without that information, GDB reports a corrupted stack, because
it does not know that the program is executing legitimate code.

Impact analysis
===============

What context data structure bits does the DIGEST-MD5 method inherit
from the aborted CRAM-MD5 authentication request? As mentioned
earlier, different Cyrus SASL authentication methods have different
per-session context data structures.  In particular, the CRAM-MD5
method uses a small structure while DIGEST-MD5 uses a larger one.

The DIGEST-MD5 method will therefore access memory outside the block
that was allocated during the aborted CRAM-MD5 request. That is,
it accesses random memory on the heap. The contents of that memory
will depend on the malloc implementation and on the program execution
history.

Version 2.1.23 of the Cyrus SASL library implements 12 authentication
methods.  Of these, 9 methods maintain server session context data
structures that contain some mix of data and data pointers. When
these are read from random heap memory, or from a structure that
was allocated for a different SASL mechanism, all kinds of things
could happen. This is why remote code execution cannot be excluded.

Why the Cyrus SASL PLAIN and LOGIN methods are not affected
===========================================================

There is no memory corruption problem with the "AUTH PLAIN" method,
because this does not use or create a dynamically-allocated session
context data structure. In particular, sending "AUTH LOGIN" after
aborting or failing an "AUTH PLAIN" request does not result in
memory corruption, because the PLAIN authentication method does not
allocate a session context data structure. Also, sending "AUTH
PLAIN" after aborting or failing an "AUTH LOGIN" request does not
result in memory corruption, because the PLAIN authentication method
ignores the per-session context data structure that is created by
the LOGIN authentication method. Finally, there is no memory
corruption when the LOGIN authentication method inherits a session
context data structure from an aborted or failed "AUTH LOGIN"
request.

It is for these reasons that Postfix SMTP servers with Cyrus SASL
support for only PLAIN and LOGIN are not affected. Fortunately,
PLAIN + LOGIN is the most commonly-used configuration, usually
combined with TLS encryption to protect passwords on the wire. There
will be a minor memory leak, but the Postfix SMTP server limits the
number of failed requests and thereby limits the leak.

There is no memory corruption problem with the "AUTH ANONYMOUS"
method, because just like "AUTH PLAIN" this does not create or use
a dynamically-allocated session context data structure. However,
"AUTH ANONYMOUS" support should not be enabled as it can make an
SMTP server an open relay.

Timeline
========

  * April 8, 2011: Thomas Jarosch (Intra2net AG) reported the
    problem.

  * April 18, 2011: After completing a detailed analysis of what
    configurations are affected, and after testing solutions for
    Postfix 1.1 ..  2.9, Wietse asked CERT/CC to notify vendors.
    Thank you, CERT/CC.

  * April 20, 2011: Pre-release versions available for Postfix 2.5
    .. 2.8 and patches for Postfix 1.1 .. 2.9.

  * Most vendors honored Wietse's request to avoid non-public
    information in plaintext email headers or content. The exceptions
    were SUSE and Red Hat.  Shame on you, SUSE and Red Hat.

  * May 9, 2011: Announcement and public release of fixes.

## Postfix SMTP server Cyrus SASL support contains a memory corruption vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#727230

Original Release Date: 2011-05-11 | Last Revised: 2011-05-17

---

### Overview

The Postfix SMTP server has a memory corruption error when the Cyrus SASL library is used with authentication mechanisms other than PLAIN and LOGIN.

### Description

| The [Postfix Advisory for CVE-2011-1720](http://www.postfix.org/CVE-2011-1720.html) states:  *"The Postfix SMTP server fails to create a new Cyrus SASL server handle after authentication failure. This causes memory corruption when, for example, a client requests CRAM-MD5 authentication, fails to authenticate, and then invokes some other authentication mechanism except PLAIN (or ANONYMOUS if available). The likely outcome is that the Postfix SMTP server process crashes with a segmentation violation error (SIGSEGV, a.k.a. signal 11)."**...**"The memory corruption is known to result in a program crash (SIGSEV). Remote code execution cannot be excluded. Such code would execute as the unprivileged "postfix" user. This user has no control over processes that run with non-postfix privileges including Postfix processes running as root; the impact may be reduced with configurations that enable the Postfix chroot feature or that use platform-dependent privilege-reducing features."* |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker can cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an Update**This vulnerability has been fixed in Postfix stable versions 2.5.13, 2.6.10, 2.7.4, 2.8.3. Patches for Postfix version 1.1 and later can be obtained from the [Postfix Download Site](http://www.postfix.org/download.html). |
| --- |

| **Workarounds**  The following workaround is provided in the [Postfix Advisory for CVE-2011-1720](http://www.postfix.org/CVE-2011-1720.html):Disable Cyrus SASL authentication mechanisms for the Postfix SMTP server other than PLAIN and LOGIN. The mechanisms are specified in a Cyrus SASL smtpd.conf configuration file. This file may be found in /etc/postfix/sasl/, /var/lib/sasl2/, /etc/sasl2/, /usr/lib/sasl2/ or /usr/local/lib/sasl2/.In this file, update the "mech\_list:" entry and remove any methods other than PLAIN and LOGIN. For example, this configuration is not affected: mech\_list: PLAIN LOGINExecute the command "postfix reload" to make the change effective, then verify that the "port 25" and "port 587" services no longer announce other SASL mechanisms, as shown in the previous section. |
