Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-1720:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overread flaw in Postfix's handling of SASL authentication when using the Cyrus SASL library.
- Specifically, the issue arises because Postfix does not properly manage SASL handles after a client authentication failure. It reuses the same SASL handle, which can lead to memory corruption if the client then attempts a different SASL authentication method (other than PLAIN or LOGIN).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Improper Resource Management:** Postfix reuses SASL handles after authentication failure.
- **Heap-Based Buffer Overread:** This reuse causes a buffer overread due to different authentication methods having different context data structure layouts.
- **Lack of Input Validation:**  Postfix does not properly validate the subsequent SASL authentication attempt after a failed one.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The most likely outcome is a crash of the `smtpd` server process, leading to a denial of service as the server terminates.
- **Potential Remote Code Execution:** While not confirmed, the memory corruption could potentially allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the `postfix` user (which is an unprivileged user).

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Remote Attack:** The attacker sends specially crafted SASL authentication requests to the Postfix SMTP server.
- **SMTP Protocol:** The vulnerability is triggered during the SMTP authentication process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to connect to the Postfix server (port 25 or 587).
- The attacker needs to initiate an authentication attempt using a vulnerable mechanism (other than PLAIN or LOGIN) and cause it to fail, then attempt another mechanism (also other than PLAIN or LOGIN).
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability affects Postfix SMTP servers using Cyrus SASL with mechanisms other than PLAIN, LOGIN or ANONYMOUS.
- Postfix SMTP clients are not affected.
- Configurations using Dovecot SASL are not vulnerable.
- The vulnerability exists in Postfix versions released after March 14, 2000 and is fixed in versions 2.5.13, 2.6.10, 2.7.4, and 2.8.3.
- A workaround is to disable SASL authentication mechanisms other than PLAIN and LOGIN in the Cyrus SASL configuration file.
- The vulnerability was reported by Thomas Jarosch of Intra2net AG.

**CVE-2011-0411 vs CVE-2011-1720:**
The content also mentions CVE-2011-0411 which is a separate vulnerability. CVE-2011-0411 is related to SMTP command injection during plaintext to TLS session switch. While both issues are in Postfix, they are different vulnerabilities.

**Summary of the fixes**
- Patched versions of Postfix are provided by various Linux distributions.
- The upstream fix was to release Postfix versions 2.5.13, 2.6.10, 2.7.4, and 2.8.3, with patches for earlier versions back to 1.1.
