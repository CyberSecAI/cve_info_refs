Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2011-1872:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of specific sequences of machine instructions sent from a guest virtual machine to the Hyper-V host via the VMBus. Specifically, the Hyper-V server does not properly validate malformed packets.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient input validation:** The Hyper-V server fails to adequately validate specific packets received from guest virtual machines.
*   **Resource consumption:** Processing of malformed packets leads to excessive resource consumption on the Hyper-V server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation causes the Hyper-V server to stop responding, requiring a restart. This affects all virtual machines hosted by the compromised server.
*   The denial of service vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate their user rights on the Hyper-V server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local access from a guest VM:** An attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to one of the guest virtual machines hosted on the Hyper-V server.
*   **Malicious VMBus packets:** The attacker sends specially crafted, malformed packets through the VMBus from the compromised guest VM to the Hyper-V host.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated user:** The attacker must have valid logon credentials for a guest virtual machine.
*  **Administrator privilege on guest VM:** The attacker must have administrator privileges to one of the virtual machines hosted on the Hyper-V server. They do not need admin access to the Hyper-V host.
*   **Arbitrary code execution on guest VM:** The attacker needs the ability to execute arbitrary code within the guest VM environment.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability is specific to Hyper-V on Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2008 R2.
*   The provided document also emphasizes that this update must not be applied to Hyper-V guest machines, but only to the servers that have the Hyper-V role enabled.
*   Microsoft was not aware of any public disclosure or exploitation of this vulnerability at the time the bulletin was released.
