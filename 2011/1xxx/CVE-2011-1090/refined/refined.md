  "vulnerability_summary": {
    "cve": "CVE-2011-1090",
    "description": "The __nfs4_proc_set_acl function in fs/nfs/nfs4proc.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.38 stores NFSv4 ACL data in memory that is allocated by kmalloc but not properly freed, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (panic) via a crafted attempt to set an ACL.",
    "details": [
      {
        "component": "nfs4 setacl operation",
        "root_cause": "The nfs code attempts to convert the passed-in buffer to an array of pages in __nfs4_proc_set_acl, which gets used by the skb->frags list in xs_sendpages. __nfs4_proc_set_acl converts each page in the buffer to a page struct via virt_to_page, but the vfs allocates the buffer via kmalloc, meaning the PG_slab bit is set. The code fails to properly free memory allocated by kmalloc.",
        "vulnerability": "Memory leak/Incorrect memory handling",
        "attack_vector": "Local",
        "impact": "Denial of service (panic). A \"bad_page()\" page allocator sanity check occurs, leading to a kernel oops.",
        "affected_systems": [
          "Linux kernel before 2.6.38",
          "VMware ESXi and ESX"
        ],
        "attacker_capabilities": "A privileged user can trigger the vulnerability by performing a setacl operation that exceeds a page of data, leading to a local denial-of-service.",
        "remediation": "Allocate a page from the buddy allocator directly and copy the data over to it. This ensures that a put_page free-able page is present for every entry that winds up on an skb frag list, so it can be safely freed when the frame is acked."
