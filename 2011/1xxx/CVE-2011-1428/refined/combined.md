| [Mon 14 Feb 2011 11:21:27 PM UTC, comment #2:](#comment2) Quote  Here is another version of the patch that doesn't modify the API. It just adds another parameter to the gnutls\_callback\_t prototype that specify the mode (either "verify" or "set certificate").

| [Wed 09 Feb 2011 05:46:07 PM UTC, comment #1:](#comment1) Quote  oh, and i forgot the POC:  $ openssl genrsa -out server.key 4096  $ openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr  $ openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in server.csr -signkey server.key -out server.crt  $ openssl dhparam -outform PEM -out dhparam.pem 4096  $ openssl s\_server -cert server.crt -key server.key -dhparam dhparam.pem -accept 6697   then try to connect on 127.0.0.1/6697 -ssl and there will be no verification of the server certificate.  If we configure openssl to request a client certificate using s\_server's '-verify' option, then weechat will check the certificate (and detect it as self-signed).   $ openssl s\_server -cert server.crt -key server.key -dhparam dhparam.pem -accept 6697 -verify yes | Anonymous |
| [Wed 09 Feb 2011 05:39:41 PM UTC, **original submission:**](#comment0) Quote  It might be possible to fix the problem without changing the API by calling the gnutls\_cb (=irc\_server\_gnutls\_callback) function twice, first to verify the server's certificate and then to set the client certificate ? | Anonymous |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
