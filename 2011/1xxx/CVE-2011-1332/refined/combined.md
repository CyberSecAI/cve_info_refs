| Measures | Conditions | Severity |
| Access Required | can be attacked over the Internet using packets | * High |
| Authentication | anonymous or no authentication (IP addresses do not count) | * High |
| User Interaction Required | the user must be convinced to take a standard action that does not feel harmful to most users, such as click on a link or view a file | * Mid |
| Exploit Complexity | the user must be convinced to take a difficult or suspicious action. If the honest user must have elevated privileges, they are likely to be more suspiciouse | * High |
