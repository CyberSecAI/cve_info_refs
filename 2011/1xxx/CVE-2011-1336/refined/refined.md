Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2011-1336

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in ALZip, caused by improper handling of "mim" files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Buffer Overflow: The software fails to properly manage memory when processing a specially crafted "mim" file, leading to a buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Code Execution: By opening a malicious "mim" file, an attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.

**Attack Vectors:**
- File-based Attack: The attacker crafts a malicious "mim" file.
- User Interaction: The victim must be convinced to open the malicious file using the vulnerable ALZip software.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-  The attacker needs to create a malicious "mim" file
- The attacker must convince the user to open the file.
- Some expertise is required to exploit the buffer overflow

**Additional Information:**
- Affected versions include ALZip v8.21 and earlier.
- According to the developer, only copies of version 8.21 downloaded before June 29, 2011 are vulnerable.
- The fix is to re-download and reinstall ALZip 8.21 after June 29, 2011 12:00 (JST) from the developer's website.
- Automatic updates are not provided because the version number did not change.
- JPCERT/CC analysis indicates the vulnerability can be exploited over the Internet (high access required), with no authentication required, but user interaction is needed. The exploit complexity is rated as mid-high.
- The vulnerability was reported by Takahiko Funakubo of Fourteenforty Research Institute, Inc.
