How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Debian Security Advisory DSA-2169-1                   security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                                Nico Golde
February 16, 2011                      <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : telepathy-gabble
Vulnerability  : insufficient input validation
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : none yet

It was discovered that telepathy-gabble, the Jabber/XMMP connection manager
for the Telepathy framework, is processing google:jingleinfo updates without
validating their origin.  This may allow an attacker to trick telepathy-gabble
into relaying streamed media data through a server of his choice and thus
intercept audio and video calls.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.7.6-1+lenny1.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.15-1+squeeze1.

For the testing (wheezy) and unstable (sid) distributions, this problem
will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your telepathy-gabble packages.

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <http://www.debian.org/security/>

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: Re: CVE id request: telepathy-gabble

As best as I can tell, we should only need one ID:

CVE-2011-1000
• In jingle-factory.c, a malicious contact can trick Gabble into relaying media
through a server of their choosing. This allows any contact to intercept your
audio and video calls (as opposed to only attacker who can passively intercept
your network traffic, which is the normal state of affairs for unencrypted
calls).

If you think any of the others deserve an ID, let me know.

Thanks.

This is harmless: contacts can waste your bandwidth in other ways. • In conn-presence.c, a contact can fake a Google Shared Status update, causing our local perception of our status (but not our *actual* status) to be incorrect. This is annoying, but is not crucially important, and this code is not present on any stable branch. • Also in conn-presence.c, a contact can cause Gabble to poll the server for the contents of the privacy list named "invisible"; it cannot cause Gabble to change its status or to modify the privacy list or our current visibility, so this is simply a(nother) way to waste bandwidth. • In jingle-factory.c, a malicious contact can trick Gabble into relaying media through a server of their choosing. This allows any contact to intercept your audio and video calls (as opposed to only attacker who can passively intercept your network traffic, which is the normal state of affairs for unencrypted calls). ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=34048#c2)  Will Thompson    2011-02-08 11:20:20 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 43124](attachment.cgi?id=43124 "Fix for the jingleinfo issue, applicable to 0.10 and 0.11") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=43124&action=edit "Fix for the jingleinfo issue, applicable to 0.10 and 0.11") [[review]](page.cgi?id=splinter.html&bug=34048&attachment=43124) Fix for the jingleinfo issue, applicable to 0.10 and 0.11 ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=34048#c3)  Will Thompson    2011-02-08 11:20:36 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 43125](attachment.cgi?id=43125 "Fix for the jingleinfo issue, applicable to 0.8") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=43125&action=edit "Fix for the jingleinfo issue, applicable to 0.8") [[review]](page.cgi?id=splinter.html&bug=34048&attachment=43125) Fix for the jingleinfo issue, applicable to 0.8 ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=34048#c4)  Sjoerd Simons    2011-02-09 02:29:35 UTC  ``` Both patches look good to me ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=34048#c5)  Will Thompson    2011-02-15 03:34:33 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 43369](attachment.cgi?id=43369 "Fix, applicable to 0.7.6 (and other early 0.7.x revisions)") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=43369&action=edit "Fix, applicable to 0.7.6 (and other early 0.7.x revisions)") [[review]](page.cgi?id=splinter.html&bug=34048&attachment=43369) Fix, applicable to 0.7.6 (and other early 0.7.x revisions) ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=34048#c6)  Will Thompson    2011-02-16 08:55:53 UTC  ``` As committed to master, and released in 0.11.7: <<http://git.collabora.co.uk/?p=telepathy-gabble.git;a=commitdiff;h=158c988>> As committed to 0.10, and released in 0.10.5: <<http://git.collabora.co.uk/?p=telepathy-gabble.git;a=commitdiff;h=5b9ee62>> As committed to 0.8, and released in 0.8.15: <<http://git.collabora.co.uk/?p=telepathy-gabble.git;a=commitdiff;h=ed73e1f>> ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=34048#c7)  Will Thompson    2011-02-16 09:09:52 UTC  ``` Fixed in telepathy-gabble 0.8.15, 0.10.5 and 0.11.7. ``` |  |
