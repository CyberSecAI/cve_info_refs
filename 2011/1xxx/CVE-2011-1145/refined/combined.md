### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

Changes:
 unixodbc (2.2.14p2-3) unstable; urgency=low
 .
   * Add Vcs-Bzr field.
   * Build for multiarch.
   * Split unixodbc into a libodbc1 package and a unixodbc package,
     the latter now containing just isql and with a versioned dependency on
     libodbc1 for compatibility with existing dependencies.  This is better
     that moving isql into a new 'isql' package and having unixodbc depend
     on it because 'unixodbc' is a wrong name for a library package.
   * exe/isql.c: patch from upstream to fix isql segfault with the -b option.
     Thanks to Tim Gokcen <hexetic@gmail.com> for reporting.  Closes: #[607895](bugreport.cgi?bug=607895).
   * Call lt_dlsetsearchpath() so that we can use relative paths for ODBC
     modules in a multiarch-clean manner
   * Document the availability of multiarch driver support in debian/NEWS.
   * DriverManager/SQLDriverConnect.c: fix a potential buffer overflow.
     Closes: #[617655](bugreport.cgi?bug=617655)
   * debian/rules: update libltdl/config.sub, not just config.sub, when out
     of date.  Closes: #[576980](bugreport.cgi?bug=576980).
   * odbcinst1debian2 Breaks the old drivers that reference driver setup
     modules in /usr/lib that are shipped in this package, so declare this.
   * Standards-Version to 3.9.2.
   * Drop .la files from unixodbc-dev, now that there are no shared libraries
     left that depend on them.
   * Pull patch from Ubuntu to fix FTBFS on ppc64.

Dear maintainer,

Recently you fixed one or more security problems and as a result you closed
this bug. These problems were not serious enough for a Debian Security
Advisory, so they are now on my radar for fixing in the following suites
through point releases:

squeeze (6.0.6) - use target "stable"

Please prepare a minimal-changes upload targetting each of these suites,
and submit a debdiff to the Release Team [0] for consideration. They will
offer additional guidance or instruct you to upload your package.

I will happily assist you at any stage if the patch is straightforward and
you need help. Please keep me in CC at all times so I can
track [1] the progress of this request.

For details of this process and the rationale, please see the original
announcement [2] and my blog post [3].

Since when do we expect maintainers to spend their time preparing stable
release updates for security bugs that are not important enough to have DSAs
issued?  I find this absurd.  If it's worth fixing, it should be fixed
through the security process.

This particular bug is a buffer overflow in handling of user-provided input
to a non-privileged library.  Don't expect me to prepare a stable upload for
this if it's not important enough to get a DSA.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=684036#c0)  Vincent Danen    2011-03-10 22:55:55 UTC  ``` It was reported [1] that a possible buffer overrun flaw exists in unixODBC's SQLDriverConnect() function.  A large value for the SAVEFILE parameter in the connection string could trigger this, resulting in a crash.  SecurityFocus claims this may also lead to the execution of arbitrary code as the user running the application using unixODBC [2].  This has been corrected upstream [3].   References:  [1] <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2011/q1/446> [2] <http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/46805/discuss> [3] <http://unixodbc.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/unixodbc/trunk/DriverManager/SQLDriverConnect.c?r1=23&r2=27>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=684036#c3)  Josh Bressers    2011-03-11 19:33:53 UTC  ``` This is just a DoS for us on RHEL5+. It's a stack buffer that gets overflowed, which will be caught by stack protector. I would suggest we wontfix this on those platforms.  We should also probably wontfix this on RHEL4, it's certainly a low severity issue since you have to connect to a malicious server (which isn't very likely), and RHEL4 is near the end of its life. We have more important issues to invest our time in.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=684036#c4)  Vincent Danen    2011-03-24 20:18:16 UTC  ``` Statement:  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this issue as having low security impact. We do not currently plan to fix this flaw. If more information becomes available at a future date, we may revisit the issue.   ``` |  |

| [Description](#c0)  Paweł Hajdan, Jr. (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2011-03-12 20:33:45 UTC  ``` It was reported [1] that a possible buffer overrun flaw exists in unixODBC's SQLDriverConnect() function.  A large value for the SAVEFILE parameter in the connection string could trigger this, resulting in a crash.  SecurityFocus claims this may also lead to the execution of arbitrary code as the user running the application using unixODBC [2].  This has been corrected upstream [3].   References:  [1] <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2011/q1/446> [2] <http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/46805/discuss> [3] <http://unixodbc.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/unixodbc/trunk/DriverManager/SQLDriverConnect.c?r1=23&r2=27> ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Paweł Hajdan, Jr. (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2011-03-12 20:35:42 UTC  ``` We have no maintainer for this package at this time. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Alexandr Tiurin    2011-04-02 18:29:50 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 268231](attachment.cgi?id=268231 "fix patch") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=268231&action=edit "fix patch"), [diff](attachment.cgi?id=268231&action=diff "fix patch")] fix patch ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Alexandr Tiurin    2011-04-02 18:31:28 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 268233](attachment.cgi?id=268233 "ebuild") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=268233&action=edit "ebuild")] ebuild ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Christopher Brannon (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2011-04-06 13:14:36 UTC  ``` I stepped up to maintain this, since it was maintainer-needed. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Christopher Brannon (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2011-04-06 14:31:29 UTC  ``` I just committed the new ebuild and patch.  @Alexandr: Thanks. ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Alex Legler (RETIRED)   archtester gentoo-dev Security  2011-04-07 14:59:34 UTC  ``` Arches, please test and mark stable:  =dev-db/unixODBC-2.3.0-r1 Target KEYWORDS="alpha amd64 arm hppa ia64 ppc ppc64 s390 sh sparc x86" ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Jeroen Roovers (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2011-04-07 17:57:25 UTC  ``` Stable for HPPA. ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Agostino Sarubbo   gentoo-dev  2011-04-08 15:49:43 UTC  ``` amd64 ok ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Thomas Kahle (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2011-04-08 20:19:47 UTC  ``` x86 stable.
