\* xpdf : multiple vulnerabilities in t1lib \*
\* allow arbitrary remote code execution \*
-
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- --[ Vulnerability Summary:
Date Published: 28/03/2011
Last Update: 28/03/2011
Advisory ID: TSSA-2011-01
CVE Name: CVE-2011-0764 (previously known as VU#376500)
Title: xpdf : multiple vulnerabilities in t1lib
Remotely Exploitable: Yes
Locally Exploitable: No
Impact: Arbitrary code execution
Advisory URL: http://www.toucan-system.com/advisories/tssa-2011-01.txt
- --[ Introduction:
Following 3 paragraphs taken from the vendors' documentation:
Xpdf is an open source viewer for Portable Document Format (PDF)
files. (These are also sometimes also called 'Acrobat' files, from
the name of Adobe's PDF software.) The Xpdf project also includes a
PDF text extractor, PDF-to-PostScript converter, and various other
utilities.
Xpdf runs under the X Window System on UNIX, VMS, and OS/2. The non-X
components (pdftops, pdftotext, etc.) also run on Win32 systems and
should run on pretty much any system with a decent C++ compiler.
Xpdf is designed to be small and efficient. It can use Type 1 or
TrueType fonts.
- --[ Synopsis:
The linux version of xpdf is linked against t1lib, which is vulnerable
to multiple vulnerabilities including off by ones, integer overflows
and heap corruptions. At least one of those is exploitable and allows
arbitrary code to be executed on the target machine when opening a
specially crafted pdf file.
- --[ Vulnerabilities overview:
When parsing specially crafted Type 1 fonts, the t1lib library
is subject to several memory corruption vulnerabilities. We will
exemplify only a few of them : t1lib being decomissioned by xpdf
anyways, it will probably never get fixed.
[\*] Invalid memory reads (off by few):
The following valgrind trace exemplifies an invalid read from
t1lib:
==24009== Invalid read of size 8
==24009== at 0x406364A: ??? (in /usr/lib/libt1.so.5.1.2)

==24009== by 0x458DB55: (below main) (libc-start.c:220)
Note: This given vulnerability cannot execute arbitrary code :
it only allows a remote denial of service of the xpdf reader.
[\*] Invalid memory writes:
In the same fashion, the following trace exemplifies an invalid
memory write, dur to a use after free():

[\*] Off by one leading to invalid memory read, then integer overflow:
A more interresting case arrises in the following trace, for which
the pointer being dereferenced suggests the presence of an integer
overflow:

In fact, there is an off by one in t1lib responsible for the wrong
reading
of 4 null bytes from a mapped (t1lib's data) location at:
=> 0x4005f348: mov DWORD PTR [ebx+0x32b8],eax
Later on, this memory location is used to initialize eax with the value
of a (wrong) function pointer :
=> 0x4005f86a: imul eax,DWORD PTR [ebx+0x32b8],0x68
(at this point, eax will be NULL).
Then a fixed offset is substrated to eax (0 here), resulting in the
integer
overflow by wrap around:
=> 0x4005f885: sub eax,0xd0
(eax now worhes 0 - 0xd = 0xffffff30)
This pointer is finally used in floating point arithmetic to read a
pointer
into the FPU stack from an unmapped location, resulting in an
unvalid pointer
dereference and in fine in a segmentation fault:
Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.

[ code]
--[ Instruction:
=> 0x80c512b: call DWORD PTR [ecx+0x28]
By having ecx point 0x28 bytes to a location in the heap and
dereferencing a
pointer to this very same location, an attacker can execute
arbitrary shellcode,
hence performing arbitrary remote code execution on the target
machine uppon
opening of a given pdf file.
Reliability considerations: this particular bug is dependant on an
invalid
pointer dereferencing null data from a valid memory region. In order for
this to be performed without resulting in a segmentation fault, the
t1lib
library must read from a region wich is actually mapped, which
empirically
occures with a probability of around 10% of the cases on a machine
with ASLR
enabled.
- --[ Mitigation:
Instead of fixing the Type 1 library, the xpdf team has decided to
end support for this library and encourages to link xpdf against the
truetype library only. Versions starting with 3.02pl6 will therefor
deprecate the use of t1lib completely.
When compiling older versions manually, the CERT offers the following
compilation options, which mitigate the vulnerability by not linking
xpdf against the Type 1 library:
To build Xpdf without t1lib, add the "--with-t1-library=no" flag to the
configure command:
./configure --with-t1-library=no .....
To double-check, run "xpdf --help". The "-freetype" option should be
listed, and the "-t1lib" option should NOT be listed. That indicates
that Xpdf was built with FreeType and without t1lib.
With this setting, Xpdf will use FreeType instead of t1lib to rasterize
Type 1 fonts. With recent versions of FreeType, the Type 1 quality is
as good or better than t1lib, so this should not present any problems.
- --[ Vulnerable versions:
Vulnerable : Xpdf up to (including) version 3.02pl5.
Non vulnerable (non linked to t1lib) : Xpdf version 3.02pl6.
- --[ Disclosure timeline:
\* 05/01/2011: Contact Vendor and CERT, providing full description
and PoC samples to audit the issue.
\* 21/03/2011: The vendor releases a new version of the xpdf package,
decomissioning the t1lib entirely, hence mitigating the problem.
The CERT publishes a vulnerability note at the url:
http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/376500
\* 24/03/2011: The CERT assigns CVE number CVE-2011-0764 to this
vulnerability.
\* 28/03/2011: Public disclosure.

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A1201)

## Topic

Updated tetex packages that fix multiple security issues are now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

teTeX is an implementation of TeX. TeX takes a text file and a set of
formatting commands as input, and creates a typesetter-independent DeVice
Independent (DVI) file as output.

teTeX embeds a copy of t1lib to rasterize bitmaps from PostScript Type 1
fonts. The following issues affect t1lib code:

Two heap-based buffer overflow flaws were found in the way t1lib processed
Adobe Font Metrics (AFM) files. If a specially-crafted font file was opened
by teTeX, it could cause teTeX to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user running teTeX. (CVE-2010-2642,
CVE-2011-0433)

An invalid pointer dereference flaw was found in t1lib. A specially-crafted
font file could, when opened, cause teTeX to crash or, potentially, execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running teTeX.
(CVE-2011-0764)

A use-after-free flaw was found in t1lib. A specially-crafted font file
could, when opened, cause teTeX to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user running teTeX. (CVE-2011-1553)

An off-by-one flaw was found in t1lib. A specially-crafted font file could,
when opened, cause teTeX to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code
with the privileges of the user running teTeX. (CVE-2011-1554)

An out-of-bounds memory read flaw was found in t1lib. A specially-crafted
font file could, when opened, cause teTeX to crash. (CVE-2011-1552)

teTeX embeds a copy of Xpdf, an open source Portable Document Format (PDF)
file viewer, to allow adding images in PDF format to the generated PDF
documents. The following issues affect Xpdf code:

An uninitialized pointer use flaw was discovered in Xpdf. If pdflatex was
used to process a TeX document referencing a specially-crafted PDF file, it
could cause pdflatex to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with
the privileges of the user running pdflatex. (CVE-2010-3702)

An array index error was found in the way Xpdf parsed PostScript Type 1
fonts embedded in PDF documents. If pdflatex was used to process a TeX
document referencing a specially-crafted PDF file, it could cause pdflatex
to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
user running pdflatex. (CVE-2010-3704)

Red Hat would like to thank the Evince development team for reporting
CVE-2010-2642. Upstream acknowledges Jon Larimer of IBM X-Force as the
original reporter of CVE-2010-2642.

All users of tetex are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

## Foolabs Xpdf contains a denial of service vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#376500

Original Release Date: 2011-03-21 | Last Revised: 2011-04-05

---

### Overview

Foolabs Xpdf contains a denial of service vulnerability caused by the t1lib library incorrectly parsing Type 1 fonts.

### Description

| According to [Foolabs](http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/about.html): *Xpdf is an open source viewer for Portable Document Format (PDF) files. (These are sometimes also called 'Acrobat' files, from the name of Adobe's PDF software.) The Xpdf project also includes a PDF text extractor, PDF-to-PostScript converter, and various other utilities.* Foolabs Xpdf contains a denial of service vulnerability caused by the t1lib library incorrectly parsing Type 1 fonts. This vulnerability may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker can cause the device to crash and may be able to execute arbitrary code. |
| --- |

### Solution

| The vendor has stated they will stop using t1lib in their product and users should build Xpdf without t1lib.  *To build Xpdf without t1lib, add the "--with-t1-library=no" flag to the**configure command:**./configure --with-t1-library=no .....**To double-check, run "xpdf --help". The "-freetype" option should be**listed, and the "-t1lib" option should NOT be listed. That indicates**that Xpdf was built with FreeType and without t1lib.**With this setting, Xpdf will use FreeType instead of t1lib to rasterize**Type 1 fonts. With recent versions of FreeType, the Type 1 quality is**as good or better than t1lib, so this should not present any problems.* |

“We use MOABI to continually improve our Softwaree Development Life Cycle and check complex projects for flawlessness before they go into production. It’s a unique and useful product to have in your toolbox. The “0-days” function is real, as Moabi not only detects obvious flaws but goes deep into binaries to assess any potential flaws, then formalises a report with a clear description, with help for problem resolution. Finally, the support team is very responsive.”

“MOABI helped us achieve a unique synthesis to improve the quality of our software. I was very impressed by the level of detail and the different techniques used by MOABI in its scans, something I’ve never seen in other tools. Their support is of an excellent level of knowledge, is very available to discuss technical details and responds quickly to all our requests.”

## Foolabs Xpdf contains a denial of service vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#376500

Original Release Date: 2011-03-21 | Last Revised: 2011-04-05

---

### Overview

Foolabs Xpdf contains a denial of service vulnerability caused by the t1lib library incorrectly parsing Type 1 fonts.

### Description

| According to [Foolabs](http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/about.html): *Xpdf is an open source viewer for Portable Document Format (PDF) files. (These are sometimes also called 'Acrobat' files, from the name of Adobe's PDF software.) The Xpdf project also includes a PDF text extractor, PDF-to-PostScript converter, and various other utilities.* Foolabs Xpdf contains a denial of service vulnerability caused by the t1lib library incorrectly parsing Type 1 fonts. This vulnerability may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker can cause the device to crash and may be able to execute arbitrary code. |
| --- |

### Solution

| The vendor has stated they will stop using t1lib in their product and users should build Xpdf without t1lib.  *To build Xpdf without t1lib, add the "--with-t1-library=no" flag to the**configure command:**./configure --with-t1-library=no .....**To double-check, run "xpdf --help". The "-freetype" option should be**listed, and the "-t1lib" option should NOT be listed. That indicates**that Xpdf was built with FreeType and without t1lib.**With this setting, Xpdf will use FreeType instead of t1lib to rasterize**Type 1 fonts. With recent versions of FreeType, the Type 1 quality is**as good or better than t1lib, so this should not present any problems.* |
