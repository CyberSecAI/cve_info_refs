Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-1404:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from several AJAX scripts in Mahara that returned excessive user information via JSON structures, beyond what was necessary for the intended functionality. This included sensitive data like email addresses. Specifically identified scripts are:
* `group/membersearchresults.php`
* `json/usersearch.php`
* `json/friendsearch.php`
* `myfriends pagination script`

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary weakness is the exposure of sensitive user information (like email addresses) in JSON responses intended for AJAX calls. This occurs because the scripts were not properly sanitizing the data being returned.
*   **Insufficient Output Sanitization:** The code did not limit the information output to only the necessary user IDs and names, or HTML in some cases, revealing additional data.
*   **Lack of Access Control:** In the case of the 'myfriends pagination script', it did not check if the logged-in user had permission to view the block or if the user ID matched the view owner.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Privacy Violation:** Attackers could potentially harvest email addresses and other private data of Mahara users.
*   **Data Exposure:** The excessive user information could be used in other attacks, such as social engineering or targeted phishing campaigns.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** In the case of the 'myfriends pagination script', an attacker could potentially access view information they weren't authorized to see.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **AJAX Requests:** Exploitation is achieved by sending crafted AJAX requests to the vulnerable scripts (`group/membersearchresults.php`, `json/usersearch.php`, `json/friendsearch.php`, and the 'myfriends pagination script').
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a logged-in Mahara user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Logged-in User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user of the Mahara platform.
*   **Network Access:**  The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Mahara server.
*   **Knowledge of API:** The attacker needs to know the API endpoints for the vulnerable scripts to exploit the information disclosure.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability affected Mahara versions 1.3 and later, with some scripts also impacting version 1.2.
*   Patches were created to address the issue by limiting the JSON responses to only include essential data (user IDs and names) and/or only return HTML.
*   The fixes were released in Mahara 1.3.6, 1.2.9 and 1.4.0.
*   The Debian Security Advisory DSA-2246-1 also mentions this vulnerability.
