Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2011-1699:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the `nipplib.dll` component of Novell iPrint Client, specifically how it handles the `uri` parameter from a user-specified printer URL.
*   The `nipplib` component, used by both ActiveX and Netscape browser plugins, copies user-supplied data directly into a fixed-length buffer on the heap without proper bounds checking.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap-based Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow.  The software fails to validate the size of the data received in the `uri` parameter before copying it into a fixed-size buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code.
*   **Browser Context:** The code executes within the security context of the browser that is running the vulnerable iPrint plugin.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
*   **Malicious Web Page or File:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerability by tricking the target user into visiting a malicious web page or opening a malicious file. This suggests that the malicious URL is embedded in a web page or file that is processed by the browser and iPrint plugin.
*   **User Interaction Required:** The attack requires user interaction in that the target must visit the malicious page or open the malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Location:** The attacker can be located remotely, exploiting the vulnerability over a network.
*   **Ability to Craft Malicious Content:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious printer URL that contains an overly long URI parameter to trigger the buffer overflow.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability is exploitable without any prior authentication, as the user interaction is the vector of attack.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Component:** The vulnerable component is `nipplib.dll`.
*  **Affected Products:** Novell iPrint Client is vulnerable.
*   **Mitigation:** A patch was released as "iPrint Client for Windows XP/Vista/Win 7 5.64" to address this vulnerability.
*   **Trend Micro Protection:** Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected by Digital Vaccine filter ID '11201'.

In summary, CVE-2011-1699 describes a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the Novell iPrint Client that can be exploited remotely through malicious web pages or files to achieve arbitrary code execution on a user's system.
