  "vulnerability": {
    "cveID": "CVE-2011-1137",
    "description": "An integer overflow flaw was reported in the mod_sftp module of ProFTPD. If a specially crafted SSH message was sent to a ProFTPD server using mod_sftp, it could lead to the allocation of enormous amounts of memory and an eventual OOM termination by the kernel.",
    "rootCause": "Integer overflow in the mod_sftp module of ProFTPD when handling SSH messages.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer overflow leading to excessive memory allocation.",
       "Lack of proper validation of packet and payload lengths in SSH messages."
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service (DoS) due to excessive memory consumption leading to an out-of-memory (OOM) condition.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Sending a specially crafted, malformed SSH message to a ProFTPD server using mod_sftp."
    ],
    "requiredCapabilities": "Ability to send network packets to the vulnerable ProFTPD server."
