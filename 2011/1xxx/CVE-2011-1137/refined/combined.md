| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=681718#c0)  Vincent Danen    2011-03-03 01:48:48 UTC  ``` An integer overflow flaw was reported [1],[2] in the mod_sftp module of ProFTPD.  If a specially crafted SSH message was sent to a ProFTPD server using mod_sftp, it could lead to the allocation of enormous amounts of memory and an eventual OOM termination by the kernel.  This issue was assigned the name [CVE-2011-1137](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1137) [3].  It was fixed in CVS [4],[5],[6]  References:  [1] <http://bugs.proftpd.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3586> [2] <http://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/16129/> [3] <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/03/02/5> [4] <http://proftp.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/proftp/proftpd/contrib/mod_sftp/packet.c?r1=1.14.2.2&r2=1.14.2.3> [5] <http://proftp.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/proftp/proftpd/contrib/mod_sftp/packet.h?r1=1.3&r2=1.3.2.1> [6] <http://proftp.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/proftp/proftpd/contrib/mod_sftp/mod_sftp.c?r1=1.29.2.1&r2=1.29.2.2>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=681718#c1)  Vincent Danen    2011-03-03 01:49:56 UTC  ``` Created proftpd tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 681719](show_bug.cgi?id=681719 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2011-1137 proftpd: integer overflow in mod_sftp [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=681718#c2)  Paul Howarth    2011-06-29 12:07:21 UTC  ``` I believe this one can be closed now.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=681718#c3)  Vincent Danen    2011-07-01 04:57:10 UTC  ``` All current releases now have this fixed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=3587#c0)  mail    2011-02-07 12:08:11 UTC  ``` The following DoS just showed up today: <http://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/16129/>  Is this related to [bug #3586](show_bug.cgi?id=3586 "CLOSED FIXED - mod_sftp behaves badly when receiving badly formed SSH messages")? ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=3587#c1)  TJ Saunders    2011-02-12 13:04:55 UTC  ``` It appears that this is indeed the same issue as [Bug#3586](show_bug.cgi?id=3586 "CLOSED FIXED - mod_sftp behaves badly when receiving badly formed SSH messages").  When I run the Perl script in the link, in the SFTPLog/TraceLog I see:  Feb 12 10:01:45 [56007] <ssh2:20>: SSH2 packet len = 2164260863 bytes Feb 12 10:01:45 [56007] <ssh2:20>: SSH2 packet padding len = 65 bytes Feb 12 10:01:45 [56007] <ssh2:20>: SSH2 packet payload len = 2164260797 bytes Feb 12 10:01:45 [56007] <ssh2:20>: payload len (2164260797 bytes) exceeds max payload len (262144), ignoring payload Feb 12 10:01:45 mod_sftp/0.9.7[56007]: client sent buggy/malicious packet payload length, ignoring  which is exactly the same symptoms as in [Bug#3586](show_bug.cgi?id=3586 "CLOSED FIXED - mod_sftp behaves badly when receiving badly formed SSH messages").  Thus I'm marking this as a duplicate.  Thanks!  *** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of [bug 3586](show_bug.cgi?id=3586 "CLOSED FIXED - mod_sftp behaves badly when receiving badly formed SSH messages") *** ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=3586#c0)  TJ Saunders    2011-01-24 20:54:52 UTC  ``` A proftpd user noticed that mod_sftp behaves badly (i.e. crashes, tries to allocate enormous amounts of memory and is eventually killed by the kernel, etc) in certain situations.  Some analysis showed that the problem relates to badly-formed SSH messages, e.g. messages from clients where the packet length and/or payload length encoded in the message is of enormous (and usually ridiculous) size.  One such TraceLog showed:    <ssh2:20>: SSH2 packet len = 1264032678 bytes   <ssh2:20>: SSH2 packet padding len = 158 bytes   <ssh2:20>: SSH2 packet payload len = 1264032519 bytes  and then mod_sftp would try to allocate that much memory -- which led to the problems.  Why does mod_sftp not check for such things as it's reading in the packet, and simply drop the packet/connection as soon as it sees bad values like this?  An issue was reported against the SSH protocol: CPNI-957037, see:    <http://www.cpni.gov.uk/Docs/Vulnerability_Advisory_SSH.txt>   <http://openssh.com/txt/cbc.adv>  The actual details revolved around sending a malformed SSH packet to a server, and watching how quickly the server choked/dropped on the packet.  Very similar to an information leak attack in nature.  To work around this attack, clients can use CTR modes (if supported).  Servers can read in the entire packet, even if it is determined to be malformed early, so that the client can't get a good idea of how far into the packet the server read before dropping it.  This is what mod_sftp does.  Except that it is still trying to allocate memory for that reported payload length -- and that's what is causing problems.  The fix, then, is to keep reading in the entire packet, but to NOT allocate that payload length if it is above some hardcoded limit, one that in practice is not encountered by well-behaved clients. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=3586#c1)  TJ Saunders    2011-01-24 20:55:43 UTC  ``` One such badly behaved client implementation, for example, is libssh-0.2. ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=3586#c2)  TJ Saunders    2011-01-24 21:00:24 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 3539](attachment.cgi?id=3539 "Fixes problem") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=3539&action=edit "Fixes problem") Fixes problem  This patch should catch such situations, and handle them properly.  In the SFTPLog, you would see a message like:    client sent buggy/malicious packet payload length, ignoring  And a detailed TraceLog would show:    <ssh2:20> payload len (1264032519 bytes) exceeds max payload len (262144), ignoring payload ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=3586#c3)  TJ Saunders    2011-02-12 12:41:46 UTC  ``` Patch committed to CVS, and backported to 1.3.3 branch. ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=3586#c4)  TJ Saunders    2011-02-12 13:04:55 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 3587](show_bug.cgi?id=3587 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - mod_sftp Integer Overflow DoS") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=3586#c5)  Henri Salo    2011-03-02 18:22:19 UTC  ``` CVE-2011-1137 identifier got assigned to this vulnerability. ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=3586#c6)  TJ Saunders    2011-04-06 03:37:46 UTC  ``` Resolved in 1.3.4rc2. ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=3586#c7)  TJ Saunders    2011-05-13 18:05:06 UTC  ``` For future reference, another terse but very accurate description of the CPNI-957037 issue can be found in the PuTTY docs:    <http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/wishlist/ssh2-cbc-pktlen-weakness.html> ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
