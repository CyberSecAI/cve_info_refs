# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on

Please use CVE-2011-1947.

I can't help but wonder what else could be vulnerable to a similar flaw.
Has anyone looked?

Thanks.

I wrote too fast.
Just so that the list archives reflect the actual fix:

The fixed fetchmail version 6.3.20 runs the SSL_connect() [OpenSSL]
under a real-time setitimer() that triggers SIGALRM after a
user-configurable setting (default 300 s).

SO_KEEPALIVE takes more than two hours on some systems' defaults before
even sending the first TCP keepalive probe, which is too long, but can
be tuned through sysctl or ndd on many relevant systems -- and, more
importantly, bears no relation to what happens up in the application
layer. That's what I meant with "does not defend against malice" (for
instance, a server deliberately keeping the TCP connection open without
responding), and that situation is what the real-time setitimer() will
signal.

0. Release history
==================
2011-05-30 0.1 first draft (visible in Git and through oss-security)
2011-06-06 1.0 release
1. Background
=============
fetchmail is a software package to retrieve mail from remote POP3, IMAP,
ETRN or ODMR servers and forward it to local SMTP, LMTP servers or
message delivery agents. fetchmail supports SSL and TLS security layers
through the OpenSSL library, if enabled at compile time and if also
enabled at run time, in both SSL/TLS-wrapped mode on dedicated ports as
well as in-band-negotiated "STARTTLS" and "STLS" modes through the
regular protocol ports.
2. Problem description and Impact
=================================
Fetchmail version 5.9.9 introduced STLS support for POP3, version
6.0.0 added STARTTLS for IMAP. However, the actual S(TART)TLS-initiated
in-band SSL/TLS negotiation was not guarded by a timeout.
Depending on the operating system defaults as to TCP stream keepalive
mode, fetchmail hangs in excess of one week after sending STARTTLS were
observed if the connection failed without notifying the operating
system, for instance, through network outages or hard server crashes.
A malicious server that does not respond, at the network level, after
acknowledging fetchmail's STARTTLS or STLS request, can hold fetchmail
in this protocol state, and thus render fetchmail unable to complete the
poll, or proceed to the next server, effecting a denial of service.
SSL-wrapped mode on dedicated ports was unaffected by this problem, so
can be used as a workaround.
3. Solution
===========
Install fetchmail 6.3.20 or newer.
The fetchmail source code is always available from
.
Distributors are encouraged to review the NEWS file and move forward to
6.3.20, rather than backport individual security fixes, because doing so
routinely misses other fixes crucial to fetchmail's proper operation,
for which no security announcements are issued. Several such
(long-standing) bugs were fixed through recent releases, and an erratum
notice for SASL authentication was issued.
Fetchmail 6.3.X releases have always been made with a focus on unchanged
user and program interfaces so as to avoid disruptions when upgrading
from 6.3.X to 6.3.Y with Y > X. Care was taken to not change the
interface incompatibly.
4. Workaround
=============
If supported by the server's configuration, fetchmail can be run in
ssl-wrapped rather than starttls mode. To that extent, the "ssl sslproto
ssl3" option must be configured (possibly replacing sslproto tls1 where
configured) to the rcfile, or "--ssl --sslproto ssl3" can be given on
the command line (where it applies to all poll configurations).
It is generally also advisable to enforce SSL certificate validation, by
either using --sslcertck on the command line, or using sslcertck in a
"default" configuration entry of the rcfile, or using sslcertck in
each of the relevant individual poll descriptions of the rcfile.

I seriously considered not asking for a CVE in the first place because
it's rather close to a resource-hogging-through-slowdowns attack vector,
if you send at a very slow pace just avoiding the timeout by a notch,
you hog your peer's resources for extended amounts of time -- and I
can't think of good heuristics to tell abuse from legit use by those on
slow links apart, and it's pointless listing CVEs for the unfixable
situations.

Anecdotal story from the fix: I've been particularly disappointed that
Solaris 10 doesn't support setsockopt(n, SOL_SOCKET, SO_RCVTIMEO, &foo,
sizeof foo); (returns -1 with errno == EAFNOSUPPORT), which would have
been the thorough and easy way out.  I've had the code in place and
released as candidate, but umm, no, didn't work. I do set SO_KEEPALIVE
now, but that's not anywhere close of defending against malice.

Rewriting the whole socket stuff as non-blocking code with
poll()/select() which is supposed to be the canonical portable way was
too intrusive, hence, a no-go for a stable release update.
