Based on the provided content, here's the information related to CVE-2011-1492:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of requests, specifically related to how `modcss.inc` processes and relays them. This allows for the relaying of malicious requests through the `modcss.inc` component.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The vulnerability is a security flaw in how Roundcube handles requests, which allows an attacker to relay malicious requests through the `modcss.inc` file. This is a form of request forgery.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially use the vulnerability to perform malicious actions by relaying requests through `modcss.inc`. The specific impact of this will depend on what actions a malicious request can trigger within the Roundcube application.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves crafting malicious requests and sending them to the vulnerable Roundcube instance. The `modcss.inc` component then relays these requests, potentially leading to exploitation.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable Roundcube server. This usually means being able to reach the application over the network (e.g., by using a web browser or scripting tools).
