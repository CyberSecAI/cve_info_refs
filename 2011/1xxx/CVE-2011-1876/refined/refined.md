Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2011-1876:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the way Windows kernel-mode drivers manage kernel-mode driver objects, specifically within the `win32k.sys` component. There is improper handling of these objects, leading to a "use-after-free" condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Use-After-Free:**  The core issue is that the `win32k.sys` driver attempts to use a kernel-mode driver object after it has been freed from memory. This can lead to unpredictable behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Elevation of Privilege:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to run arbitrary code in kernel mode. This effectively grants them complete control of the affected system.
*   **Full System Control:** With kernel-level access, an attacker can install programs, view, change, or delete data, and create new accounts with full administrative rights.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access Required:** The attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to the affected system.
*   **Specially Crafted Application:** The attacker must execute a specially crafted application designed to trigger the "use-after-free" condition in the kernel driver.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Valid Local User:** An attacker must have a valid user account on the target system.
*   **Ability to Execute Programs:** The attacker needs to be able to run executable code on the system to initiate the exploit.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in multiple versions of Windows, including XP, Server 2003, Vista, Server 2008, Windows 7, and their respective server counterparts.
*   The provided documents indicate that the vulnerability was privately reported and not publicly disclosed before the release of the security patch.
*   Microsoft has issued security update KB2555917 to address the issue. The update corrects the improper object management in the kernel driver.
*   The vulnerability is considered "Important" in terms of severity by Microsoft.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Tarjei Mandt of Norman.
*   This CVE is part of a larger set of vulnerabilities fixed in MS11-054.

This detailed information goes beyond the basic CVE description by specifying the vulnerable component, the specific type of memory corruption, the required privileges and capabilities of the attacker, the nature of the malicious program and how the exploit works.
