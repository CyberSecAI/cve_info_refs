  "CVE-2011-1495": {
    "description": "drivers/scsi/mpt2sas/mpt2sas_ctl.c in the Linux kernel 2.6.38 and earlier does not validate (1) length and (2) offset values before performing memory copy operations, which might allow local users to gain privileges, cause a denial of service (memory corruption), or obtain sensitive information from kernel memory via a crafted ioctl call, related to the _ctl_do_mpt_command and _ctl_diag_read_buffer functions.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The mpt2sas driver does not properly validate user-supplied length and offset values before performing memory copy operations.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper input validation",
        "Use of user-supplied length and offset values without bounds checking",
        "Heap-based buffer overflow",
	"Arbitrary Kernel Memory Read"
      ],
      "impact": "A local unprivileged user with access to the /dev/mpt2sas device can achieve privilege escalation, denial of service, and information leaks. It may also lead to arbitrary kernel memory read",
      "attack_vectors": "Local exploitation via crafted ioctl calls to the /dev/mpt2sas device.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "Local unprivileged user access to the /dev/mpt2sas device is required.  While this device file is created with root-root 660 permissions, it may have more open permissions on some systems."
