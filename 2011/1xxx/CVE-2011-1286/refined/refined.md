*   **[[42574](http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=42574)] [[42765](http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=42765)] Low Possible to navigate or close the top location in a sandboxed frame. Credit to sirdarckcat of the Google Security Team.**

Based on this entry:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: It is possible to navigate or close the top location in a sandboxed frame. This implies that the sandboxing mechanism was not correctly preventing certain actions from being performed in sandboxed iframes.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The primary vulnerability is a sandbox escape, where a sandboxed iframe can perform actions that it shouldn't be able to, specifically navigating or closing the top level document.

*   **Impact of exploitation**:  The ability to navigate or close the top location of a sandboxed frame could be used to disrupt the user's browsing experience. More severely, it could be leveraged as part of a more complex attack to potentially redirect a user to a malicious site or to exfiltrate sensitive data. The impact is considered low in this specific case.

*   **Attack vectors**: The attacker would need to control or influence the content loaded inside the sandboxed iframe to trigger this vulnerability.

*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious code into a sandboxed iframe or control the content loaded within.
