  "response": {
    "cve": "CVE-2011-1018",
    "root_cause": "Improper sanitization of special characters in log file names.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Shell command injection"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the privileged system user (root).",
    "attack_vectors": "A remote attacker could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code with root privileges by creating a specially-crafted log file that is subsequently analyzed by the logwatch script.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to create log files with specially crafted names that contain shell metacharacters that can then be parsed by the logwatch script.",
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability exists because logwatch did not properly sanitize log file names that were passed to the shell as part of a command. This could be exploited via Samba logging or any other process that generates log files with attacker-controlled names.\n\nPatches encapsulate logfiles in 's and ensure logfile names don't contain '."
