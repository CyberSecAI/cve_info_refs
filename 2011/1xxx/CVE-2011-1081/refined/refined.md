    "Metadata": {
      "ID": "CVE-2011-1081",
      "Description": "It was discovered that OpenLDAP did not properly validate modrdn requests. An unauthenticated remote user could use this to cause a denial of service via application crash."
    },
    "Analysis": {
      "Root cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper input validation when processing MODRDN requests with an empty 'olddn' value.",
      "Vulnerabilities": [
        "Improper input validation",
        "Denial of Service (DoS)"
      ],
      "Impact": "An attacker can crash the OpenLDAP slapd daemon, leading to a denial of service. This can affect the availability of the LDAP service.",
      "Attack vector": "A remote attacker can send a specially crafted MODRDN request to the OpenLDAP server.",
      "Attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send LDAP requests to the OpenLDAP server. No prior authentication is required. The attacker can be unauthenticated."

   "Affected_Software":{
        "OpenLDAP": "< 2.4.24"
