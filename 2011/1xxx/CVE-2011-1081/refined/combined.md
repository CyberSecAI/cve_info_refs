### Affected packages

| Package | **net-nds/openldap** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.4.35** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.4.35** |

### Background

OpenLDAP is an LDAP suite of application and development tools.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenLDAP. Please review
the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker might employ a specially crafted certificate to
conduct man-in-the-middle attacks on SSL connections made using OpenLDAP,
bypass security restrictions or cause a Denial of Service condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All OpenLDAP users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-nds/openldap-2.4.35"

```

Subject: Re: CVE Request -- OpenLDAP -- two issues

The following might also need a CVE-ID.

<https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=674985#c1>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<http://www.openldap.org/its/index.cgi/Software> Bugs?id=6768

That's a pretty bad DOS. Everybody (even unauthenticated users) can kill the
server by submitting a MODRDN request with an empty "olddn" value and "remove
old RDN" set (-r). Example:

      ldapmodrdn -x -H ldap://ldapserver -r '' o=test
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=680975#c0)  Vincent Danen    2011-02-28 17:01:16 UTC  ``` It was reported [1],[2] that OpenLDAP's slapd daemon would crash when it received a request to modify a DN and submits an empty old DN in the request.  No binding is necessary, so even an anonymous user could cause slapd to crash.  This was reported against OpenLDAP 2.4.23 and was fixed in 2.4.24 [3].  References:  [1] <http://www.openldap.org/its/index.cgi/Software%20Bugs?id=6768> [2] <https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=674985#c1> [3] <http://www.openldap.org/devel/cvsweb.cgi/servers/slapd/modrdn.c.diff?r1=1.170.2.8&r2=1.170.2.9>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=680975#c1)  Vincent Danen    2011-02-28 17:09:30 UTC  ``` I was able to reproduce this with openldap (2.4.19-15.el6) using:  $ ldapmodrdn -x -H ldap://ldapserver -r '' o=test  with the following results:   Feb 28 08:50:30 dns slapd[1331]: conn=1389 fd=28 ACCEPT from IP=192.168.1.11:46650 (IP=0.0.0.0:389) Feb 28 08:50:30 dns slapd[1331]: conn=1389 op=0 BIND dn="" method=128 Feb 28 08:50:30 dns slapd[1331]: conn=1389 op=0 RESULT tag=97 err=0 text= Feb 28 08:50:30 dns slapd[1331]: conn=1389 op=1 MODRDN dn="" Feb 28 08:50:47 dns slapd[20575]: @(#) $OpenLDAP: slapd 2.4.19 (Jun 30 2010 03:58:53) $#012#011mockbuild.bos.redhat.com:/builddir/build/BUILD/openldap-2.4.19/openldap-2.4.19/build-server s/servers/slapd Feb 28 08:50:47 dns slapd[20576]: bdb_db_open: database "dc=example,dc=ca": unclean shutdown detected; attempting recovery.

The code is quite different, but I see similarities, so I cannot tell whether or not a slightly changed ldapmodrdn command will cause a crash, or if this is specific to 2.4.x.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=680975#c4)  Jan Vcelak    2011-03-01 08:36:01 UTC  ``` Verified that only OpenLDAP 2.4.x is affected. Fixed in 2.4.24.  It seems that the code was reordered. The list of modifications is being built before the operation is passed to DB backend operation. While access to root DSE is checked from backend operation. (The upstream fix is strange, however it works. CVS comment "quick fix for null DN" is a good explanation.)   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=680975#c6)  Jan Vcelak    2011-03-01 10:51:34 UTC  ``` Fedora 16 not affected Fedora 15 affected, but 2.4.24 is waiting in updates-testing Fedora 14 affected Fedora 13 affected   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=680975#c7)  Vincent Danen    2011-03-01 20:22:36 UTC  ``` As noted by Ralf Haferkamp from SUSE:  "It seems you are right. Even though the bug slipped into CVS HEAD already in 2006 it never got merged into the 2.3 release branch. So only 2.4.x  releases are affected by this. Sorry for causing confusion here"  <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/03/01/11>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=680975#c8)  Vincent Danen    2011-03-01 21:20:59 UTC  ``` This was assigned the name [CVE-2011-1081](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1081).   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=680975#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-03-10 20:47:27 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2011:0347 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0347.html>   ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

I've just tried this here.  I noted in your bug report that you indicate
that it seems to affect all of your currently maintained products, but
I've tried it here against openldap 2.3.43 and do not see a crash (I can
reproduce the crash on 2.4.19).

Have you tested this one against older openldap, or is it just an
assumption (it might be ACLs or something that is preventing me from
seeing the crash, but I don't believe so if no authentication is
required to affect this).

Seems that this is the patch to fix it:

<http://www.openldap.org/devel/cvsweb.cgi/servers/slapd/modrdn.c.diff?r1=1.170.2.8&r2=1.170.2.9&hideattic=1&sortbydate=0>

The code is different enough in 2.3.x that I can't tell by looking at it
whether or not it is affected (enough looks similar that perhaps it
might be and may just require a changed ldapmodrdn command).

It seems you are right. Even though the bug slipped into CVS HEAD already
in 2006 it never got merged into the 2.3 release branch. So only 2.4.x
releases are affected by this. Sorry for causing confusion here.

# USN-1100-1: OpenLDAP vulnerabilities

31 March 2011

An attacker could send crafted input to OpenLDAP and cause it to crash.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 10.10](/security/notices?release=maverick)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)
* [Ubuntu 9.10](/security/notices?release=karmic)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)

## Packages

* [openldap](/security/cves?package=openldap) - OpenLDAP utilities
* [openldap2.3](/security/cves?package=openldap2.3) - OpenLDAP utilities

## Details

It was discovered that OpenLDAP did not properly check forwarded

authentication failures when using a consumer server and chain overlay. If

OpenLDAP were configured in this manner, an attacker could bypass

authentication checks by sending an invalid password to a consumer server.

([CVE-2011-1024](/security/CVE-2011-1024))

It was discovered that OpenLDAP did not properly perform authentication

checks to the rootdn when using the back-ndb backend. An attacker could

exploit this to access the directory by sending an arbitrary password.

Ubuntu does not ship OpenLDAP with back-ndb support by default. This issue

did not affect Ubuntu 8.04 LTS. ([CVE-2011-1025](/security/CVE-2011-1025))

It was discovered that OpenLDAP did not properly validate modrdn requests.

An unauthenticated remote user could use this to cause a denial of service

via application crash. ([CVE-2011-1081](/security/CVE-2011-1081))
