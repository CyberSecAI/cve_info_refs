{
  "CVE-2011-1751": {
    "description": "A privileged user inside the guest could exploit a missing hotplug check during device removal in the PIIX4 Power Management emulation layer of QEMU to crash the guest instance or potentially execute arbitrary code on the host.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists because the PIIX4 Power Management emulation layer in QEMU does not properly check for hot plug eligibility during device removals.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Missing hotplug check during device removal",
         "Use-after-free vulnerability when a guest triggers the hot-unplug of the pci-isa bridge causing qemu process to access freed memory"
      ],
      "impact": "A privileged user inside the guest could cause a crash of the guest instance or potentially execute arbitrary code on the host.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "A privileged user inside the guest can trigger the hot-unplug of the PCI-ISA bridge, leading to the vulnerability"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a privileged user within the guest operating system."
    },
    "affected_products": [
      "openSUSE 11.4",
      "openSUSE 11.3",
      "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6"
    ],
      "patch_information": "The vulnerability is fixed by applying a patch that makes qemu ignore unplug requests from the guest for PCI devices which are tagged as non-hotpluggable. The patch is included in qemu-kvm updates provided by Red Hat and openSUSE."
