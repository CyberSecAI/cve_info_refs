Based on the provided content, here's information regarding CVE-2011-1406:

*   **Vulnerability:** Possible HTTPS to HTTP downgrade.
*   **Root Cause:** When Mahara is configured to use HTTPS (via the `wwwroot` variable), it doesn't automatically redirect users to the HTTPS version if they access the site via HTTP. If the web server is configured to serve content over both HTTP and HTTPS, users can log in via an insecure HTTP connection, sending their credentials over an insecure connection.
*   **Weakness:** The application doesn't enforce HTTPS when it is configured to use it, allowing users to potentially interact with the site over an insecure connection.
*   **Impact:** User credentials can be intercepted if they log in via HTTP instead of HTTPS.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker could potentially sniff network traffic and steal user credentials if a user accesses the Mahara site via HTTP. An attacker could also potentially perform a man-in-the-middle attack.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be in a position to sniff network traffic between the user and the server, or perform a man-in-the-middle attack.
*   **Mitigation:** The new version of Mahara automatically redirects to HTTPS if the `wwwroot` variable points to an HTTPS URL and the site is accessed over HTTP. It is also recommended to configure the webserver to only serve content over HTTPS, and to add HSTS headers.
*   **Affected versions:** Mahara before 1.3.6.
