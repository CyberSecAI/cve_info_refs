### Bug Description

Interesting that with both, [bug #646713](/bugs/646713) and [bug #684190](/bugs/684190), we overlooked the most obvious and relatively sensitive issue.

Even though $cfg->wwwroot might be set '<https://somemaharasite'>, depending on apache config, user may still be able to use insecure page for logging in by entering '<http://somemaharasite'> in the web browser address field, then, upon logging-in, user credentials will be passed through insecure connection first, before sever respond with redirection to https secured page.

This is valid for other pages after logging in - at any time used may switch back to insecure connection by typing '[http://somemaharasite/somedir/somepage.php'](http://somemaharasite/somedir/somepage.php%27).

This can be fixed by ensuring that $\_SERVER['HTTPS'] is set when $cfg->wwwroot = '<https://...'>, otherwise redirecting user to the same page using https.

Another thing that is worth doing as far as the server configuration is concerned is to enable HSTS:

With the current httpswwwroot removal changes, it is probably the time to release this fix as well.

I didn't notice the fix was incomplete before because I was also bitten by this Ubuntu cron bug: [https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/pam/+bug/790538](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/pam/%2Bbug/790538)

Now that cronjobs are run, I've noticed that my Mahara cronjob is run but nothing appears in the logs. I run the cronjob from the command line using the same config you can find in the wiki, and I have just switched to HTTPS for the whole Mahara site.

I've traced the issue to the commit for this bug, as it tries to make a redirect to secure URLs if the wwwroot is configured for HTTPS but the request is not done using HTTPS. When you run Mahara cron from the command line, HTTPS is obviously not set, so init.php tries to redirect the execution to the secured URL. But HTTP redirection doesn't work in command line (for obvious reasons), so the execution dies inside redirect().

We need to check if we are running in command line mode before checking HTTPS and trying to redirect the request to the secure URL. The attached patch (for 1.3\_STABLE, that's what we are running right now) should do the trick. I think the patch should also be applied to 1.4\_STABLE and master, but I don't have the time to test them right now.

Saludos.

Iñaki.

Hi Ruslan,

yup, it's been fixed for 1.4\_STABLE and master, but not for 1.3\_STABLE (see <http://gitorious.org/mahara/mahara/blobs/1.3_STABLE/htdocs/init.php#line194> ). I thought 1.3\_STABLE was still supported, am I right?

Saludos.

Hi Iñaki,

1.3\_STABLE is supported for security fixes only. However, given that this "cron not running" bug is a regression caused by a security update, we should fix it in 1.3.7.

[Bug #794490](/bugs/794490) is the bug that tracks this problem (and that's what change I991f51d2cc9272e5f33e5f4b7486d3565924d8c7 should have been pointing to). I have reopened it with a milestone of 1.3.7.

Cheers,

Francois

CVE ID         : CVE-2011-1402 CVE-2011-1403 CVE-2011-1404 CVE-2011-1405
                 CVE-2011-1406

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in mahara, an electronic portfolio,
weblog, and resume builder. The following Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project ids identify them:

CVE-2011-1402

  It was discovered that previous versions of Mahara did not check user
  credentials before adding a secret URL to a view or suspending a user.

CVE-2011-1403

  Due to a misconfiguration of the Pieform package in Mahara, the cross-site
  request forgery protection mechanism that Mahara relies on to harden its
  form was not working and was essentially disabled.
  This is a critical vulnerability which could allow attackers to trick other
  users (for example administrators) into performing malicious actions on
  behalf of the attacker. Most Mahara forms are vulnerable.

CVE-2011-1404

  Many of the JSON structures returned by Mahara for its AJAX interactions
  included more information than what ought to be disclosed to the logged in
  user. New versions of Mahara limit this information to what is necessary for
  each page.

CVE-2011-1405

  Previous versions of Mahara did not escape the contents of HTML emails sent
  to users. Depending on the filters enabled in one's mail reader, it could
  lead to cross-site scripting attacks.

CVE-2011-1406

  It has been pointed out to us that if Mahara is configured (through its
  wwwroot variable) to use HTTPS, it will happily let users login via the HTTP
  version of the site if the web server is configured to serve content over
  both protocol. The new version of Mahara will, when the wwwroot points to an
  HTTPS URL, automatically redirect to HTTPS if it detects that it is being
  run over HTTP.

  We recommend that sites wanting to run Mahara over HTTPS make sure that
  their web server configuration does not allow the serving of content over
  HTTP and merely redirects to the secure version. We also suggest that site
  administrators consider adding the HSTS headers
  (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security>) to their web
  server configuration.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.4-4+lenny10.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.6-2+squeeze2.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.6-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.6-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your mahara packages.
