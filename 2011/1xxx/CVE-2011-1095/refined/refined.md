  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2011-1095",
      "description": "The glibc's locale command does not properly quote locale strings, leading to potential command injection when the output is used in an 'eval' statement. This violates the POSIX specification which states that the output of 'locale' should be properly quoted for reentry to the shell.",
      "root_cause": "The locale command in glibc does not properly escape or quote special characters in locale strings, making it vulnerable to command injection.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper input sanitization",
        "Command injection"
      ],
      "impact": "Arbitrary code execution due to command injection. Scripts using 'eval $(locale)' could execute malicious code injected through locale environment variables.",
      "attack_vector": "An attacker can set specially crafted locale environment variables (e.g., LANG, LC_ALL) containing malicious code, which is then executed when the 'locale' command output is evaluated within a shell using 'eval'.",
      "required_capabilities": "Ability to set environment variables, such as LANG, LC_ALL, etc., which are then used by the vulnerable 'locale' command. This could be done by a local user or through remote means, depending on the context of usage."
