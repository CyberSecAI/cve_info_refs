How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=11904#c0)  Harald van Dijk    2010-08-11 20:07:07 UTC  ``` eval "`locale`" is supposed to be safe. From <<http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/000095399/utilities/locale.html>>: "The <value> and <implied value> shown above shall be properly quoted for possible later reentry to the shell." glibc's locale command does not do this, and as a result, if a script does eval "`locale`", it misbehaves badly when someone figures out to set LANG to ' rm -rf /'.  $ LANG=' rm -rf /' locale locale: Cannot set LC_CTYPE to default locale: No such file or directory locale: Cannot set LC_MESSAGES to default locale: No such file or directory locale: Cannot set LC_ALL to default locale: No such file or directory LANG= rm -rf / LC_CTYPE=" rm -rf /" LC_NUMERIC=" rm -rf /" LC_TIME=" rm -rf /" LC_COLLATE=" rm -rf /" LC_MONETARY=" rm -rf /" LC_MESSAGES=" rm -rf /" LC_PAPER=" rm -rf /" LC_NAME=" rm -rf /" LC_ADDRESS=" rm -rf /" LC_TELEPHONE=" rm -rf /" LC_MEASUREMENT=" rm -rf /" LC_IDENTIFICATION=" rm -rf /" LC_ALL= $ echo $? 0 ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=11904#c1)  Ulrich Drepper    2010-08-12 16:06:13 UTC  ``` Fixed in git. ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: glibc locale escaping issue

Hi!

Following glibc upstream and gentoo bug reports describe a bug in the
way locale command escapes its output.

<http://sources.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=11904>
<http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=330923>

Gentoo bug points out possible security implications.  I've not managed
to find an example where the locale command is used in a problematic way
and where this may cross trust boundaries, so I wonder if this is worth
handling as security fix vs. security enhancement.  Comments are
welcome.

The issue was fixed in GLSA 201011-01, but its text really only
mentions Tavis' issues.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=625893#c0)  Vincent Danen    2010-08-20 18:00:07 UTC  ``` Harald van Dijk discovered [1],[2] that glibc's locale command does not sufficiently sanitize the user environment.  According to POSIX specifications [3], the output of the 'locale' command must be appropriately quoted and safe to execute, in order to restore the locale after temporarily forcing a change (such as LC_ALL=C).  However, this is not the case with glibc versions up to and including 2.12.1:  LANG=' rm -rf /' locale locale: Cannot set LC_CTYPE to default locale: No such file or directory locale: Cannot set LC_MESSAGES to default locale: No such file or directory locale: Cannot set LC_ALL to default locale: No such file or directory LANG= rm -rf / LC_CTYPE=" rm -rf /" LC_NUMERIC=" rm -rf /" LC_TIME=" rm -rf /" LC_COLLATE=" rm -rf /" LC_MONETARY=" rm -rf /" LC_MESSAGES=" rm -rf /" LC_PAPER=" rm -rf /" LC_NAME=" rm -rf /" LC_ADDRESS=" rm -rf /" LC_TELEPHONE=" rm -rf /" LC_MEASUREMENT=" rm -rf /" LC_IDENTIFICATION=" rm -rf /" LC_ALL=  Any script that does "eval $(locale)" or something similar will execute the unquoted commands.  The POSIX specification states:  "The <value> and <implied value> shown above shall be properly quoted for possible later reentry to the shell. The <value> shall not be quoted using double-quotes (so that it can be distinguished by the user from the <implied value> case, which always requires double-quotes)."  This has been corrected upstream [4].  [1] <http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=330923> [2] <http://sources.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=11904> [3] <http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/000095399/utilities/locale.html> [4] <http://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=patch;h=026373745eab50a683536d950cb7e17dc98c4259>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=625893#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2011-02-07 13:19:44 UTC  ``` Is there any real world example where this bug actually allows crossing trust boundary?  I was not able to find any use where this "eval $(locale)" pattern is used even with trusted environment.  Additionally, glibc locale man page does not document POSIX requirement to have the output safe for re-entry to the shell.  I don't think this got any CVE assigned either.  Gentoo GLSA 201011-01 does link their bug listed in [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=625893#c1) as [1], but the issue is not described in the text.  <http://www.gentoo.org/security/en/glsa/glsa-201011-01.xml>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=625893#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-04-04 20:06:14 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2011:0412 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0412.html>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=625893#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-04-04 20:22:15 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2011:0413 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0413.html>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=625893#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-02-13 20:35:35 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4  Via RHSA-2012:0125 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0125.html>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=625893#c9)  Vincent Danen    2012-02-13 20:54:42 UTC  ``` Statement:  (none)   ``` |  |

# GNU C library: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201011-01**

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in glibc, the worst of which allowing
local attackers to execute arbitrary code as root.

### Affected packages

| Package | **sys-libs/glibc** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.11.2-r3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.11.2-r3** |

### Background

The GNU C library is the standard C library used by Gentoo Linux
systems.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in glibc, amongst others the
widely-known recent LD\_AUDIT and $ORIGIN issues. For further
information please consult the CVE entries referenced below.

### Impact

A local attacker could execute arbitrary code as root, cause a Denial
of Service, or gain privileges. Additionally, a user-assisted remote
attacker could cause the execution of arbitrary code, and a
context-dependent attacker could cause a Denial of Service.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All GNU C library users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sys-libs/glibc-2.11.2-r3"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

I think this deserves an ID: CVE-2011-1095

The documentation clearly states that the output of this command will be
properly quoted. Even if we can't find a bad usage, there is quite likely a
shell script doing this in the universe.

I think the line between fix vs enhancement is crossed when we're talking
about documented behavior.

Thanks.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
