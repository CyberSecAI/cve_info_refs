  {
    "CVE": "CVE-2011-1202",
    "description": "A flaw was found in the Firefox XSLT generate-id() function. This function returned the memory address of an object in memory, which could possibly be used by attackers to bypass address randomization protections.",
    "root_cause": "The `generate-id()` function in XSLT was directly returning the memory address of an object.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Information Exposure",
       "Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) Bypass"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially bypass ASLR protection by obtaining memory addresses.",
    "attack_vectors": "By crafting a malicious XSLT transform that uses the generate-id() function.",
     "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need to be able to serve or inject the malicious XSLT transform to be processed by a vulnerable application (e.g., Firefox)."
