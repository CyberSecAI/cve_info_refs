Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-1082:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the Linux kernel's `epoll` subsystem, which failed to prevent the creation of circular epoll file structures. Specifically, an `epoll` file descriptor could call another file's `->f_op->poll()` method while holding a lock (`ep->mtx`). If that other file was also an `epoll` file descriptor that included the original one, it would result in a recursive call to `->poll()` leading to a deadlock.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Circular Dependency:** The primary weakness is the lack of validation to prevent the creation of circular dependencies between `epoll` file descriptors.
- **Unsafe `->poll()` Calls:** The kernel's `epoll` implementation made unsafe calls to other file's `->poll()` methods without proper checks, which created an opportunity for recursion and deadlock.
- **Locking Issue**: The `ep->mtx` lock was held while calling another file's `poll` method which could lead to deadlock if the other file also tries to acquire the same lock indirectly.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Kernel Deadlock:** The most significant impact is a kernel deadlock. This effectively freezes the system, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS).
- **System Unavailability:** The system becomes completely unresponsive, requiring a reboot to recover.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local User:** A local, unprivileged user with the ability to create and manipulate file descriptors can trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system to execute code.
- **File Descriptor Manipulation:** The attacker needs the capability to create `epoll` file descriptors, add file descriptors to them, and perform `epoll_ctl` operations.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability occurs because of the kernel calls to `->f_op->poll()` in `ep_insert`, `ep_modify`, and `ep_send_events_proc` methods which do not prevent recursive calls when an epoll file descriptor is added to another epoll file descriptor.
- The fix involves wrapping these calls within the `ep_call_nested()` function, preventing recursion and potential deadlocks.
- The provided code snippet demonstrates the vulnerability. The vulnerable code path is triggered by adding an epoll file descriptor `e1` to another epoll file descriptor `e2`, then adding `e2` back to `e1`, creating a circular dependency.
- The fix introduced `ep_poll_file()` to wrap the call to `file->f_op->poll()` using `ep_call_nested`, using the same `nested_calls` instance as the `ep_eventpoll_poll` method.
- The bug report mentions that this issue does not affect Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5. It was addressed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG.
