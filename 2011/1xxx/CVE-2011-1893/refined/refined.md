Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-1893:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization within Microsoft SharePoint Server and Windows SharePoint Services. Specifically, the application fails to properly handle and sanitize JavaScript elements embedded within specially crafted URLs. This allows the malicious script to be reflected back to the user's browser.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is a reflected XSS flaw. The unsanitized user-supplied data in a URL is reflected back to the user's browser within the HTML context without proper escaping or encoding.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Elevation of Privilege:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim user's session.
- **Information Disclosure:** The attacker could potentially read information the user has access to.
- **Unauthorized Actions:** An attacker could perform actions on the targeted SharePoint site on behalf of the victim, such as modifying content, changing permissions, or deleting data.
- **Phishing:** The attacker could inject malicious content into the page, potentially redirecting the user to phishing sites or stealing credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious URLs:** Attackers craft URLs containing malicious JavaScript.
- **E-mail:**  Attackers distribute these malicious URLs via e-mails, tricking users into clicking them.
- **Compromised Websites:** Attackers can host malicious websites or inject such URLs into compromised websites or through user provided content on other websites.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to authenticate on the targeted SharePoint site to deliver the malicious URL to the victim.
- **User Interaction:** The victim user must click on the specially crafted URL for the attack to succeed.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs the ability to send URLs to the victim via email, messaging services, or through a website.

**Additional Notes:**
- Internet Explorer's XSS filter reduces the risk when accessing SharePoint sites in the Internet Zone, but this filter is not enabled by default in the Intranet Zone.
- The attacker cannot directly steal the user's authentication cookies as they are HttpOnly cookies.
- The vulnerability is mitigated by an update which modifies how SharePoint validates and sanitizes user input.
