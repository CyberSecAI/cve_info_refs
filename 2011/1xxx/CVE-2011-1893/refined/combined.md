# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS11-074 - Important

## Vulnerabilities in Microsoft SharePoint Could Allow Elevation of Privilege (2451858)

Published: September 13, 2011 | Updated: October 11, 2011

**Version:** 1.3

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves five privately reported vulnerabilities and one publicly disclosed vulnerability in Microsoft SharePoint and Windows SharePoint Services. The most severe vulnerabilities could allow elevation of privilege if a user clicked on a specially crafted URL or visited a specially crafted Web site. For the most severe vulnerabilities, Internet Explorer 8 and Internet Explorer 9 users browsing to a SharePoint site in the Internet Zone are at a reduced risk because, by default, the XSS Filter in Internet Explorer 8 and Internet Explorer 9 helps to block the attacks in the Internet Zone. The XSS Filter in Internet Explorer 8 and Internet Explorer 9, however, is not enabled by default in the Intranet Zone.

This security update is rated Important for Microsoft Office Groove 2007, Microsoft SharePoint Workspace 2010, Microsoft Office Forms Server 2007, Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007, Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2010, Microsoft Office Groove Data Bridge Server 2007, Microsoft Office Groove Management Server 2007, Microsoft Groove Server 2010, Microsoft SharePoint Services 2.0, Microsoft SharePoint Services 3.0, Microsoft SharePoint Foundation 2010, Microsoft Office Web Apps 2010, and Microsoft Word Web App 2010. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying the way that Microsoft SharePoint validates and sanitizes user input, parses malicious XML and XSL files, and handles script contained inside of specific request parameters. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

**Recommendation.** Customers can configure automatic updating to check online for updates from Microsoft Update by using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service. Customers who have automatic updating enabled and configured to check online for updates from Microsoft Update typically will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates from Microsoft Update and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating in supported editions of Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871). For information about automatic updating in supported editions of Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2, see [Understanding Windows automatic updating](https://windows.microsoft.com/windows-vista/understanding-windows-automatic-updating).

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update at the earliest opportunity using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service.

See also the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, later in this bulletin.

**Known Issues.** [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2451858](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2451858) documents the currently known issues that customers may experience when installing this security update. The article also documents recommended solutions for these issues. When currently known issues and recommended solutions pertain only to specific releases of this software, this article provides links to further articles.

#### Affected and Non-Affected Software

The following software have been tested to determine which versions or editions are affected. Other versions or editions are either past their support life cycle or are not affected.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update

**Why was this bulletin revised on October 11, 2011?**
Microsoft revised this bulletin to announce the following changes to detection logic:

* To address an installation issue, changed detection logic so that the update for Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2010 and Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2010 Service Pack 1 (pplwfe) (KB2560890) will no longer be offered to customers running Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2010 on systems configured as part of a multiple-system SharePoint server farm. Instead, the update must be applied manually to servers in a Microsoft SharePoint Server 2010 farm. For more information about installing an update on a Microsoft SharePoint Server 2010 farm, see the TechNet article, [Install a software update (SharePoint Server 2010)](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/ff806338.aspx). This is a change to detection logic only. There were no changes to the security update files. Customers of Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2010 who have successfully applied the KB2560890 update do not need to take any further action.
* To address an offering issue, corrected detection logic so that the update for Microsoft SharePoint Foundation 2010 and Microsoft SharePoint Foundation 2010 Service Pack 1 (KB2494001) properly replaces previous update packages. This is a change to detection logic only. There were no changes to the security update files. Customers of Microsoft SharePoint Foundation 2010 who have successfully applied the KB2494001 update do not need to take any further action.

**Where are the file information details?**
Refer to the reference tables in the **Security Update Deployment** section for the location of the file information details.

**How is this security update related to MS11-050?**
The HTML Sanitization Vulnerability (CVE-2011-1252) is addressed by this update (MS11-074) and the [Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=217212) (MS11-050) update.

Two different updates are needed because the modifications that are required to address the issue are located in different Microsoft products. This update (MS11-074) addresses the vulnerability in affected Microsoft productivity software and MS11-050 addresses the vulnerability in Internet Explorer.

**Why does this update address several reported security vulnerabilities?**
This update contains support for several vulnerabilities because the modifications that are required to address these issues are located in related files.

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site and then convince them to click a specially crafted URL that is used to exploit the vulnerability.
* Internet Explorer 8 and Internet Explorer 9 users browsing to a SharePoint site in the Internet Zone are at a reduced risk because, by default, the XSS Filter in Internet Explorer 8 and Internet Explorer 9 prevents this attack in the Internet Zone. The XSS Filter in Internet Explorer 8 and Internet Explorer 9, however, is not enabled by default in the Intranet Zone.
* An attacker can cause arbitrary JavaScript to be run when the user clicks a specially crafted URL, but the attacker would not be able to steal the logged-on user's authentication credentials due to the way that SharePoint Server handles the HttpOnly authentication cookie.
* The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful, a user must click a specially crafted URL that is sent in an e-mail message.

#### FAQ for XSS in SharePoint Calendar Vulnerability - CVE-2011-0653

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a cross-site scripting vulnerability that could result in elevation of privilege or information disclosure.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused when Microsoft SharePoint does not properly handle malicious JavaScript elements contained within a specially crafted URL, allowing the script to be displayed back to the user's browser.

**What is cross-site scripting?**

Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a class of security vulnerability that can enable an attacker to inject script code into a user's session with a Web site. The vulnerability can affect Web servers that dynamically generate HTML pages. If these servers embed browser input in the dynamic pages that they send back to the browser, these servers can be manipulated to include maliciously supplied content in the dynamic pages. This can allow malicious script to be executed. Web browsers may perpetuate this problem through their assumptions of trusted sites and their use of cookies to maintain persistent state with the Web sites that they frequent. An XSS attack does not modify Web site content. Instead, it inserts new, malicious script that can execute at the browser in the context that is associated with a trusted server.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could read content that the attacker is not authorized to read, use the victim's identity to take actions on the SharePoint site on behalf of the victim, such as change permissions and delete content, and inject malicious content in the browser of the victim.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

For this vulnerability to be exploited, a user must click a specially crafted URL that takes the user to a targeted SharePoint site that then displays the script back to the user's browser.

In an e-mail attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending an e-mail message containing the specially crafted URL to the user of the targeted SharePoint site and by convincing the user to click on the specially crafted URL.

In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a specially crafted URL to the targeted SharePoint site that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to convince them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes them to the attacker's Web site, and then convince them to click on the specially crafted URL.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Systems where users connect to a SharePoint server, such as workstations or terminal servers, are primarily at risk.

**What is the Internet Explorer 8 and Internet Explorer 9** **Cross-site Scripting** **(XSS) Filter?**

Cross-site scripting attacks try to exploit vulnerabilities in the Web sites you use. In the case of this vulnerability, you might receive an e-mail message that contains a specially crafted Web site address that includes JavaScript elements. When you click on the URL, you are directed to a legitimate SharePoint site where the attacker-provided script is run. Cross-site scripting attacks have emerged as a leading online threat, so Internet Explorer 8 and Internet Explorer 9 include a cross-site scripting filter that can detect these types of attacks and disable the harmful scripts. By default, the cross-site scripting filter is turned on in Internet Explorer 8 for the Internet Zone.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the way that Microsoft SharePoint validates and sanitizes user input.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

## HTML Sanitization Vulnerability - CVE-2011-1252

An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the way that the SafeHTML function sanitizes HTML. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could perform cross-site scripting attacks and run script in the security context of the logged-on user.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2011-1252](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-1252).

#### Mitigating Factors for HTML Sanitization Vulnerability - CVE-2011-1252

Microsoft has not identified any mitigating factors for this vulnerability

#### Workarounds for HTML Sanitization Vulnerability - CVE-2011-1252

Microsoft has not identified any workarounds for this vulnerability.

#### FAQ for HTML Sanitization Vulnerability - CVE-2011-1252

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is an information disclosure vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could perform persistent cross-site scripting attacks against users of a site that is filtering HTML content via SafeHTML.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused by the way that the SafeHTML function sanitizes HTML.

**What is cross-site scripting?**

Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a class of security vulnerability that can enable an attacker to inject script code into a user's session with a Web site. The vulnerability can affect Web servers that dynamically generate HTML pages. If these servers embed browser input in the dynamic pages that they send back to the browser, these servers can be manipulated to include maliciously supplied content in the dynamic pages. This can allow malicious script to be executed. Web browsers may perpetuate this problem through their assumptions of trusted sites and their use of cookies to maintain persistent state with the Web sites that they frequent. An XSS attack does not modify Web site content. Instead, it inserts new, malicious script that can execute at the browser in the context that is associated with a trusted server.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could perform cross-site scripting attacks against users of a targeted site that uses SafeHTML to sanitize HTML. An attacker could then potentially run script on behalf of a victim user on the site.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have the ability to submit a specially crafted script to a target site using SafeHTML. Due to the vulnerability, in specific situations the specially crafted script is not properly sanitized, which subsequently could lead to an attacker-supplied script being run in the security context of a user who views the malicious content.

For cross-site scripting attacks, this vulnerability requires that a user be visiting a compromised site for any malicious action to occur. For instance, after an attacker has successfully submitted specially crafted script to the targeted site using SafeHTML, any Web page on that site that contains the specially crafted script is a potential vector for persistent cross-site scripting attacks. When a user visits a Web page that contains the specially crafted script, the script could be run in the security context of the user.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Systems where users connect to a server that uses SafeHTML to sanitize HTML content, such as workstations or terminal servers, are primarily at risk.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying the way that SafeHTML sanitizes HTML content.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

Yes. This vulnerability has been publicly disclosed. It has been assigned Common Vulnerability and Exposure number [CVE-2011-1252](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-1252).

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

#### FAQ for Contact Details Reflected XSS Vulnerability - CVE-2011-1891

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a cross-site scripting vulnerability which could result in elevation of privilege or information disclosure.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability is caused by improper input sanitization on specific SharePoint parameters.

**What is cross-site scripting?**

Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a class of security vulnerability that can enable an attacker to inject script code into a user's session with a Web site. The vulnerability can affect Web servers that dynamically generate HTML pages. If these servers embed browser input in the dynamic pages that they send back to the browser, these servers can be manipulated to include maliciously supplied content in the dynamic pages. This can allow malicious script to be executed. Web browsers may perpetuate this problem through their assumptions of trusted sites and their use of cookies to maintain persistent state with the Web sites that they frequent. An XSS attack does not modify Web site content. Instead, it inserts new, malicious script that can execute at the browser in the context that is associated with a trusted server.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

To trigger the vulnerability, the user is tricked into visiting a site that will submit a specially crafted form containing malicious script to the vulnerable SharePoint site.

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could inject script to phish for user credentials or take actions on behalf of the user, such as change permissions and modify or delete content, on a targeted SharePoint site.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a user to submit a specially crafted form that sends malicious script to an affected SharePoint 2007 instance.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Client systems that connect to SharePoint 2007 and SharePoint 2007 servers are at risk from the vulnerability.

**What is the Internet Explorer 8 and Internet Explorer 9** **Cross-site Scripting** **(XSS) Filter?**

Cross-site scripting attacks try to exploit vulnerabilities in the Web sites you use. In the case of this vulnerability, you might receive an e-mail message that contains a specially crafted Web site address that includes JavaScript elements. When you click on the URL, you are directed to a legitimate SharePoint site where the attacker-provided script is run. Cross-site scripting attacks have emerged as a leading online threat, so Internet Explorer 8 and Internet Explorer 9 include a cross-site scripting filter that can detect these types of attacks and disable the harmful scripts. By default, the cross-site scripting filter is turned on in Internet Explorer 8 and Internet Explorer 9 for the Internet Zone.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying the way that SharePoint Server handles script requests.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

## SharePoint XSS Vulnerability - CVE-2011-1893

A cross-site scripting, information disclosure, and elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in Microsoft SharePoint Server and Windows SharePoint Services where JavaScript that is encoded in a specially crafted URL can be reflected back to the user in the resulting page, allowing an attacker to issue SharePoint commands in the context of the authenticated user on a targeted SharePoint site.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2011-1893](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-1893).

#### Mitigating Factors for SharePoint XSS Vulnerability - CVE-2011-1893

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.
* Internet Explorer 8 and Internet Explorer 9 users browsing to a SharePoint site in the Internet Zone are at a reduced risk because, by default, the XSS Filter in Internet Explorer 8 prevents this attack in the Internet Zone. The Internet Explorer 8 and Internet Explorer 9 XSS Filter, however, is not enabled by default in the Intranet Zone.
* An attacker can cause arbitrary JavaScript to be run by the user who visiting a specially crafted Web site, but the attacker would not be able to steal the logged-on user's authentication credentials due to the way that SharePoint Server handles the HttpOnly authentication cookie.
* The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful, a user must click on a link to a specially crafted Web site that is sent in an e-mail message.

#### Workarounds for SharePoint XSS Vulnerability - CVE-2011-1893

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Enable Internet Explorer 8 and Internet Explorer 9 XSS filter in the Local intranet security zone**

  You can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings to enable the XSS filter in the Local intranet security zone (XSS filter is enabled by default in the Internet security zone). To do this, perform the following steps:

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

You can install the update from the appropriate download link in the Affected and Non-Affected Software section. If you installed your application from a server location, the server administrator must instead update the server location with the administrative update and deploy that update to your system. For more information about Administrative Installation Points, refer to the **Office Administrative Installation Point** information in the **Detection and deployment Tools and Guidance** subsection.

This security update requires that Windows Installer 3.1 or later be installed on the system.

To install the 3.1 or later version of Windows Installer, visit one of the following Microsoft Web sites:

* [Windows Installer 4.5 Redistributable for Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2003, and Windows XP](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=5a58b56f-60b6-4412-95b9-54d056d6f9f4&displaylang;=en)
* [Windows Installer 3.1 Redistributable for Windows Server 2003, Windows XP, and Microsoft Windows 2000](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=889482fc-5f56-4a38-b838-de776fd4138c&displaylang;=en)

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as hotfix, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

This security update supports the following setup switches.

Supported Security Update Installation Switches

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/?** or **/help** | Displays usage dialog. |
| **/passive** | Specifies passive mode. Requires no user interaction; users see basic progress dialogs but cannot cancel. |
| **/quiet** | Specifies quiet mode, or suppresses prompts, when files are being extracted. |
| **/norestart** | Suppresses restarting the system if the update requires a restart. |
| **/forcerestart** | Automatically restarts the system after applying the update, regardless of whether the update requires the restart. |
| **/extract** | Extracts the files without installing them. You are prompted for a target folder. |
| **/extract:<path>** | Overrides the install command that is defined by author. Specifies the path and name of the Setup.inf or .exe file. |
| **/lang:<LCID>** | Forces the use of a specific language, when the update package supports that language. |
| **/log:<log file>** | Enables logging, by both Vnox and Installer, during the update installation. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports many of the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841).
