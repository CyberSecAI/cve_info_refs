    - **Impact of exploitation:** Unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution
    - **Attack vectors:** Visiting a maliciously crafted website
    - **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to host the malicious website and the victim needs to visit the website.

2. **iTunes 10.5:** Similarly to the iOS update, the iTunes section includes WebKit and mentions CVE-2011-1117 as one of the memory corruption issues. The details are almost identical to the iOS WebKit vulnerability: "CVE-2011-1117 : wushi of team509."
    - **Root cause:** Memory corruption in WebKit
    - **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Memory corruption issues
    - **Impact of exploitation:** Unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution
    - **Attack vectors:** A man-in-the-middle attack while browsing the iTunes Store via iTunes.
    - **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Man-in-the-middle attacker with the ability to intercept network traffic to iTunes store.

3. **Safari 5.1 and Safari 5.0.6:** The Safari security content also includes CVE-2011-1117 as one of the WebKit memory corruption vulnerabilities. The information provided matches previous entries: "CVE-2011-1117 : wushi of team509"
    - **Root cause:** Memory corruption in WebKit
    - **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Memory corruption issues
    - **Impact of exploitation:** Unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution
    - **Attack vectors:** Visiting a maliciously crafted website
    - **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to host the malicious website and the victim needs to visit the website.

4. **Google Chrome Blog Post:** The blog post mentions a stable channel update for Chrome that includes a fix for "[71386] High Stale nodes in XHTML. Credit to wushi of team509." This issue does not directly mention CVE-2011-1117, but it indicates that the same researcher, wushi of team509, who was credited with discovering CVE-2011-1117 in Apple products was also credited for finding a related vulnerability in Google Chrome.
    - **Root cause:** Stale node in XHTML handling.
    - **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Stale nodes.
    - **Impact of exploitation:** Browser crash.
    - **Attack vectors:** Malicious website
    - **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to host the malicious website and the victim needs to visit the website.

**Summary:**

The core issue for CVE-2011-1117 across the Apple products is memory corruption within the WebKit component. This could lead to arbitrary code execution or application termination by visiting a malicious website or during man-in-the-middle attack while browsing the iTunes store. Google Chrome also had a similar vulnerability related to stale nodes that was fixed, and found by the same researcher, wushi of team509.
