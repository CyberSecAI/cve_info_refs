  "CVE-2011-1961": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Internet Explorer uses the telnet URI handler. The handler may be used in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the logged-on user.",
    "root_cause": "When Internet Explorer attempts to invoke the application associated with the telnet URI handler, a custom binary may be loaded leading to execution of arbitrary code in the context of the logged-on user.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Remote code execution"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. If the user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A specially crafted website",
       "Compromised websites",
      "Websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements"
    ],
     "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to convince a user to view a specially crafted website or open a malicious email attachment. The attacker does not need authentication.",
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability lies in the way Internet Explorer uses the telnet URI handler, potentially loading a custom binary and executing code with the privileges of the logged-on user. This can be triggered by a user visiting a specially crafted website. Disabling the WebClient service or blocking TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall can mitigate the vulnerability. Affected software includes various versions of Internet Explorer on Windows client and server systems, specifically Internet Explorer 6, 7, 8, and 9. This issue was not publicly disclosed or exploited when the security bulletin was released."
