```
Root cause of vulnerability:
  - Internet Explorer 6 incorrectly identifies file extensions in the query string of a URL if no extension is found in the path part, especially when the dot in the path is URL encoded (e.g., %2E). This allows an attacker to bypass content-type checks and force the browser to interpret content as HTML, even if it is not.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
  - Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in MediaWiki due to improper handling of file extensions in URLs when viewed with Internet Explorer 6.
  - Incomplete fix in MediaWiki 1.16.3 requiring further server configuration changes.
  - CSS validation error in wikitext parser leading to XSS on IE and privacy issues on other browsers, due to embedding of arbitrary remote images.

Impact of exploitation:
  - Successful exploitation leads to XSS, allowing an attacker to compromise user accounts by executing arbitrary JavaScript within the user's browser session.
  -  On non-IE browsers, it can lead to privacy loss by embedding arbitrary remote images.
  - Potential to run arbitrary code in the context of the user's browser, leading to complete account compromise

Attack vectors:
  - Malicious links in emails or websites that exploit the incorrect file extension handling by IE6 when dots are URL encoded.
  - Crafted URLs containing malicious HTML, CSS, or other executable content in the query string, with path name using encoded dot like %2E.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
  - Ability to craft URLs with malicious code in the query string.
  - Must target users with Internet Explorer 6
  - No special privileges are required to exploit this flaw in dynamically-generated content.
