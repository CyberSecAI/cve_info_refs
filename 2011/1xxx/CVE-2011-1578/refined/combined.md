-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

I would like to announce the release of MediaWiki 1.16.3, which is a
security release. Three security issues were discovered.

Masato Kinugawa discovered a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue, which
affects Internet Explorer clients only, and only version 6 and
earlier. Web server configuration changes are required to fix this
issue. Upgrading MediaWiki will only be sufficient for people who use
Apache with AllowOverride enabled.

Due to the diversity of uploaded files that we allow, MediaWiki does
not guarantee that uploaded files will be safe if they are interpreted
by the client as some arbitrary file type, such as HTML. We rely on
the web server to send the correct Content-Type header, and we rely on
the web browser to respect it. This XSS issue arises due to IE 6
looking for a file extension in the query string of the URL (i.e.
after the "?"), if no extension is found in path part of the URL.
Masato Kinugawa discovered that the file extension in the path part
can be hidden from IE 6 by substituting the "." with "%2E".

To fix this issue, configure your web server to deny requests with
URLs that have a path part ending in a dot followed by a dangerous
file extension. For example, in Apache with mod_rewrite:

    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} \.[a-z]{1,4}$ [nocase]
    RewriteRule . - [forbidden]

Upgrading MediaWiki is necessary to fix this issue in
dynamically-generated content. This issue is easier to exploit using
dynamically generated content, since it requires no special
privileges. Accounts on both public and private wikis can be
compromised by clicking a malicious link in an email or website. For
more details, see bug 28235.

Wikipedia user Suffusion of Yellow discovered a CSS validation error
in the wikitext parser. This is an XSS issue for Internet Explorer
clients, and a privacy loss issue for other clients since it allows
the embedding of arbitrary remote images. For more details, see bug 28450.

MediaWiki developer Happy-Melon discovered that the transwiki import
feature neglected to perform access control checks on form submission.
The transwiki import feature is disabled by default. If it is enabled,
it allows wiki pages to be copied from a remote wiki listed in
$wgImportSources. The issue means that any user can trigger such an
import to occur. For more details, see bug 28449.

The localisations were updated using content from translatewiki.net.

Package        : mediawiki
Vulnerability  : multiple
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-1578 CVE-2011-1579 CVE-2011-1580 CVE-2011-1587
                 CVE-2011-4360 CVE-2011-4361
Debian Bug     : 650434

Several problems have been discovered in mediawiki, a website engine for
collaborative work.

CVE-2011-1578 CVE-2011-1587

   Masato Kinugawa discovered a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue, which
   affects Internet Explorer clients only, and only version 6 and
   earlier. Web server configuration changes are required to fix this
   issue. Upgrading MediaWiki will only be sufficient for people who use
   Apache with AllowOverride enabled.

   For details of the required configuration changes, see the upstream
   announcements:
  <http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/mediawiki-announce/2011-April/000096.html>
  <http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/mediawiki-announce/2011-April/000097.html>

CVE-2011-1579

   Wikipedia user Suffusion of Yellow discovered a CSS validation error
   in the wikitext parser. This is an XSS issue for Internet Explorer
   clients, and a privacy loss issue for other clients since it allows
   the embedding of arbitrary remote images.

CVE-2011-1580

   MediaWiki developer Happy-Melon discovered that the transwiki import
   feature neglected to perform access control checks on form submission.
   The transwiki import feature is disabled by default. If it is enabled,
   it allows wiki pages to be copied from a remote wiki listed in
   $wgImportSources. The issue means that any user can trigger such an
   import to occur.

CVE-2011-4360

   Alexandre Emsenhuber discovered an issue where page titles on private
   wikis could be exposed bypassing different page ids to index.php. In the
   case of the user not having correct permissions, they will now be redirected
   to Special:BadTitle.

CVE-2011-4361

   Tim Starling discovered that action=ajax requests were dispatched to the
   relevant function without any read permission checks being done. This could
   have led to data leakage on private wikis.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:1.12.0-2lenny9.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:1.15.5-2squeeze2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:1.15.5-5.

We recommend that you upgrade your mediawiki packages.

The proposed fix denies access to vulnerable entry points if the request URL has %2E or %2e anywhere in the path part of the URL, i.e. before the first question mark.

Here is a detailed summary for our users to read after this bug is made public:

MediaWiki has several modules (action=raw, api.php, load.php) which provide access to arbitrary non-HTML content. This content is dangerous if the browser interprets it as HTML. MediaWiki sends a Content-Type header, which is sufficient to prevent a security breach in standards-compliant browsers. However, Internet Explorer ignores this header if it thinks that the file name in the URL it is requesting has a .html extension.

For example, in a URL like:

<http://example.com/index.php/x.html>

In most webservers, this will invoke index.php with PATH\_INFO set to /x.html. Because of the .html extension, Internet Explorer will interpret the response as HTML regardless of its headers, so MediaWiki checks PATH\_INFO for such a file extension, and denies the request if it is present.

Masato Kinugawa's discovery is that with a URL like:

[http://example.com/index%2Ephp?.html](http://example.com/index.php?.html)

When the dot in the script name is encoded as %2E, IE 6 erroneously searches for the end of the file path in the query string of the URL, that is, the part after the question mark. So this URL is interpreted as HTML regardless of the response.

I have confirmed that this bug is not present in IE 7 and later. Because the query string may legitimately end in .html, we would prefer not to blacklist this string just to protect IE 6 users.

The CGI specification does not provide a standard method to detect an improperly encoded script name. In Apache, it is possible to use the REQUEST\_URI variable. In IIS, HTTP\_X\_ORIGINAL\_URL may work; this is untested at present. Our patch scans REQUEST\_URI and HTTP\_X\_ORIGINAL\_URL for %2E, in order to determine if the file extension has been obscured. If %2E is present, the request is denied.

It is difficult to know whether this patch would fix the issue in all webservers. If you are using MediaWiki with a webserver other than Apache, we recommend that you configure your webserver to deny access to URLs with %2E or %2e in the path part of the URL.

For users using Internet Explorer 6, we recommend that you upgrade to a more secure browser.

Further testing indicates that the patch I proposed is not sufficient. You don't need to have %2E in the path to exploit it, since there are some things you can request that don't have a dot in them, like the /wiki alias. Checking QUERY\_STRING would be sufficient, but it would have to be done on static file uploads as well as api.php etc. So it can't be comprehensively fixed by patching MediaWiki only, we would need to patch or reconfigure our static file webservers also.

The issue also affects the mobile service (\*.m.wikipedia.org).

[tstarling](/p/tstarling/) added a comment.[Apr 8 2011, 6:24 AM2011-04-08 06:24:39 (UTC+0)](#331555)Comment Actions

Reverse engineering of IE 6 suggests a possible non-disruptive solution.

The problem appears to be that the cache filename extension is used to derive the content type, overriding the Content-Type header. The cache filename is determined by HTTP\_REQUEST\_HANDLE\_OBJECT::FHttpBeginCacheWrite(), which calls GetFileExtensionFromUrl(), which has the undesired behaviour in it.

But FHttpBeginCacheWrite() first checks the Content-Disposition header for a "filename" parameter, and if there is one, it uses that for the cache filename. So by sending "Content-Disposition: filename=api.php", we can avoid having to deal with the broken behaviour of GetFileExtensionFromUrl().

I tested it, it seems to work, even with Masato's Content-Disposition override script from bug 27892.

That still leaves static files. I'm going to make a change to the .htaccess we distribute in the images directory, to protect at least some servers.

The problem is not limited to HTML. If you add .exe instead, it will ask you if you want to run the application.

Block suspicious query strings

New proposed patch. I decided to go with QUERY\_STRING validation anyway, since some vulnerable entry points were using Content-Disposition for other things.

If we consider .exe to be "dangerous" seing as IE 6 will ask if you want to run the application, we might as well block .7z, .m4a, and .mp3 :

<http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki?search=Data.7z>

<http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki?search=Data.m4a>

<http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki?search=Data.mp3>

Digits may appear anywhere in a file extension, so the [a-z] class is fundamentally flawed.

I'd recommend switching to \.[a-z0-9]{1,4}$, while keeping the case insensitivity, in img\_auth.php, WebRequest.php, and the .htaccess

Those file formats are not especially dangerous. The reason for allowing numbers is because it's not unusual to append numerical version strings to URLs.

Numerical version strings prefixed by a dot ?

As for dangerosity, how are they less problematic than .html, or .gov (as seen in bug 28510 ) ?

.gov is not especially dangerous, but .html allows XSS and so complete account compromise, per the original report. With .7z, the user would have to open the file, uncompress it, and run some dangerous thing inside it. With .html, the user only has to visit an external web page which redirects to the malicious URL, and their wiki user account will be compromised.

Hello, I just started setting up private MediaWiki (v1.17.0) and I was going through the steps to make images not load using direct linking for non-logged in users. I managed to set up img\_auth.php to handle the image requests and this worked for the actual image files in /images but thumbnails no longer worked. I kept getting a "Forbidden" error: "Invalid file extension found in the path info or query string.".

After playing around a bit and looking at img\_auth.php more closely I noticed that on line 52, right under: "// Check for bug 28235: QUERY\_STRING overriding the correct extension", $dotPos was being set to: strpos( $path, '.' ). But thumbnail URLs include the file extension in the thumbnail images folder name (as well as the file extension of the files themselves). strpos would therefore return the position of the wrong dot.

Changing strpos to strrpos fixed this and I can now access thumbnails via img\_auth.php.

I'm not sure if this has been fixed already nor how to fix it myself (if that's even possible) so I though I'd let someone know. It could also be that I configured something else wrong and this is a hack...

In theory you would do so by submitting a patch, but since it's literally one character, that's not really needed :)

This issue has already been fixed in trunk in r91153, mentioning a different bug (bug 29531).

I was a new installer of 1.19 recently and using the new .htaccess file is still part of the download.

I think it should prolly be changed to remove the last two lines of the file

Options -Indexes

I was able to leave the IfModule ReWrite rules in place (I trust they do something important):

1. Protect against bug 28235
2. <IfModule rewrite\_module>
3. RewriteEngine On
4. RewriteCond %{QUERY\_STRING} \.[^\\/:\*?\x22<>|%]+(#|\?|$) [nocase]
5. RewriteRule . - [forbidden]
6. </IfModule>

but the rest of the file I had to comment out to get things to work:

1. Serve HTML as plaintext, don't execute SHTML
2. AddType text/plain .html .htm .shtml .php

1. No php execution in the upload area
2. php\_admin\_flag engine off

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Three security issues were discovered.  Masato Kinugawa discovered a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue, which affects Internet Explorer clients only, and only version 6 and earlier. Web server configuration changes are required to fix this issue. Upgrading MediaWiki will only be sufficient for people who use Apache with AllowOverride enabled.  Due to the diversity of uploaded files that we allow, MediaWiki does not guarantee that uploaded files will be safe if they are interpreted by the client as some arbitrary file type, such as HTML. We rely on the web server to send the correct Content-Type header, and we rely on the web browser to respect it. This XSS issue arises due to IE 6 looking for a file extension in the query string of the URL (i.e. after the "?"), if no extension is found in path part of the URL. Masato Kinugawa discovered that the file extension in the path part can be hidden from IE 6 by substituting the "." with "%2E".  To fix this issue, configure your web server to deny requests with URLs that have a path part ending in a dot followed by a dangerous file extension. For example, in Apache with mod_rewrite:      RewriteEngine On     RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} \.[a-z]{1,4}$ [nocase]     RewriteRule . - [forbidden]  Upgrading MediaWiki is necessary to fix this issue in dynamically-generated content. This issue is easier to exploit using dynamically generated content, since it requires no special privileges. Accounts on both public and private wikis can be compromised by clicking a malicious link in an email or website. For more details, see [bug 28235](show_bug.cgi?id=28235).  Wikipedia user Suffusion of Yellow discovered a CSS validation error in the wikitext parser. This is an XSS issue for Internet Explorer clients, and a privacy loss issue for other clients since it allows the embedding of arbitrary remote images. For more details, see bug 28450.  MediaWiki developer Happy-Melon discovered that the transwiki import feature neglected to perform access control checks on form submission. The transwiki import feature is disabled by default. If it is enabled, it allows wiki pages to be copied from a remote wiki listed in $wgImportSources. The issue means that any user can trigger such an import to occur. For more details, see bug 28449.  The localisations were updated using content from translatewiki.net.  ********************************************************************** Download: <http://download.wikimedia.org/mediawiki/1.16/mediawiki-1.16.3.tar.gz>  Patch to previous version (1.16.2), without interface text: <http://download.wikimedia.org/mediawiki/1.16/mediawiki-1.16.3.patch.gz> Interface text changes: <http://download.wikimedia.org/mediawiki/1.16/mediawiki-i18n-1.16.3.patch.gz>  GPG signatures: <http://download.wikimedia.org/mediawiki/1.16/mediawiki-1.16.3.tar.gz.sig> <http://download.wikimedia.org/mediawiki/1.16/mediawiki-1.16.3.patch.gz.sig> <http://download.wikimedia.org/mediawiki/1.16/mediawiki-i18n-1.16.3.patch.gz.sig>  Public keys: <https://secure.wikimedia.org/keys.html>  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1.4.10 (GNU/Linux) Comment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - <http://enigmail.mozdev.org/>  iEUEARECAAYFAk2jxbAACgkQgkA+Wfn4zXn38gCWISDEZuC+Ap3Z4aBfibnuNSU1 EgCfeL2lo/4XtCuoKOwah0YbuaHyf5I= =S2JZ -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=695577#c1)  Kurt Seifried    2011-04-13 23:46:26 UTC  ``` > 1) XSS with IE <= 6 due to improper handling of uploaded file names Use [CVE-2011-1578](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1578)  > 2) CSS validation error in wikitext parser Use [CVE-2011-1579](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1579)  > 3) transwiki import neglects to perform access control checks Use [CVE-2011-1580](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1580)   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=695577#c2)  Vincent Danen    2011-04-14 02:49:31 UTC  ```   *** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of [bug 696360](show_bug.cgi?id=696360 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2011-1578 CVE-2011-1579 CVE-2011-1580 CVE-2011-1587 mediawiki: multiple vulnerabilities fixed in 1.16.3, 1.16.4") ***   ``` |  |
