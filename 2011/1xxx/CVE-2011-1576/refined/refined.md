  "CVE-2011-1576": {
    "vulnerability": "The `napi_reuse_skb` function, intended for packets merged by GRO, was incorrectly used in the VLAN path, leading to memory leaks/corruption. When a GRO_DROP occurred on the VLAN path, the system would call `napi_reuse_skb` instead of `kfree_skb`.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper memory management",
      "Incorrect function usage",
        "Memory leak",
        "Memory corruption"
    ],
    "impact": "A local network attacker could trigger this vulnerability by sending specially crafted packets, possibly causing a denial of service.",
