## Synopsis

Important: kernel security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2011%3A0927)

## Topic

Updated kernel packages that fix multiple security issues and several bugs
are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

This update fixes the following security issues:

* An integer overflow flaw in ib\_uverbs\_poll\_cq() could allow a local,

unprivileged user to cause a denial of service or escalate their
privileges. (CVE-2010-4649, Important)

* A race condition in the way new InfiniBand connections were set up could

allow a remote user to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2011-0695,
Important)

* A flaw in the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) implementation

could allow a remote attacker to cause a denial of service if the sysctl
"net.sctp.addip\_enable" variable was turned on (it is off by default).
(CVE-2011-1573, Important)

* Flaws in the AGPGART driver implementation when handling certain IOCTL

commands could allow a local, unprivileged user to cause a denial of
service or escalate their privileges. (CVE-2011-1745, CVE-2011-2022,
Important)

* An integer overflow flaw in agp\_allocate\_memory() could allow a local,

unprivileged user to cause a denial of service or escalate their
privileges. (CVE-2011-1746, Important)

* A flaw allowed napi\_reuse\_skb() to be called on VLAN (virtual LAN)

packets. An attacker on the local network could trigger this flaw by
sending specially-crafted packets to a target system, possibly causing a
denial of service. (CVE-2011-1576, Moderate)

* An integer signedness error in next\_pidmap() could allow a local,

unprivileged user to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2011-1593, Moderate)

* A flaw in the way the Xen hypervisor implementation handled CPUID

instruction emulation during virtual machine exits could allow an
unprivileged guest user to crash a guest. This only affects systems that
have an Intel x86 processor with the Intel VT-x extension enabled.
(CVE-2011-1936, Moderate)

* A flaw in inet\_diag\_bc\_audit() could allow a local, unprivileged user to

cause a denial of service (infinite loop). (CVE-2011-2213, Moderate)

* A missing initialization flaw in the XFS file system implementation

could lead to an information leak. (CVE-2011-0711, Low)

* A flaw in ib\_uverbs\_poll\_cq() could allow a local, unprivileged user to

cause an information leak. (CVE-2011-1044, Low)

* A missing validation check was found in the signals implementation. A

local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to send signals via the
sigqueueinfo system call, with the si\_code set to SI\_TKILL and with spoofed
process and user IDs, to other processes. Note: This flaw does not allow
existing permission checks to be bypassed; signals can only be sent if your
privileges allow you to already do so. (CVE-2011-1182, Low)

* A heap overflow flaw in the EFI GUID Partition Table (GPT) implementation

could allow a local attacker to cause a denial of service by mounting a
disk containing specially-crafted partition tables. (CVE-2011-1776, Low)

* Structure padding in two structures in the Bluetooth implementation

was not initialized properly before being copied to user-space, possibly
allowing local, unprivileged users to leak kernel stack memory to
user-space. (CVE-2011-2492, Low)

Red Hat would like to thank Jens Kuehnel for reporting CVE-2011-0695;
Vasiliy Kulikov for reporting CVE-2011-1745, CVE-2011-2022, and
CVE-2011-1746; Ryan Sweat for reporting CVE-2011-1576; Robert Swiecki for
reporting CVE-2011-1593; Dan Rosenberg for reporting CVE-2011-2213 and
CVE-2011-0711; Julien Tinnes of the Google Security Team for reporting
CVE-2011-1182; Timo Warns for reporting CVE-2011-1776; and Marek Kroemeke
and Filip Palian for reporting CVE-2011-2492.

Bug fix documentation will be available shortly from the Technical Notes
document linked to in the References.

Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported
patches to correct these issues, and fix the bugs noted in the Technical
Notes. The system must be rebooted for this update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/kb/docs/DOC-11259>

To install kernel packages manually, use "rpm -ivh [package]". Do not
use "rpm -Uvh" as that will remove the running kernel binaries from
your system. You may use "rpm -e" to remove old kernels after
determining that the new kernel functions properly on your system.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=690028#c0)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2011-03-23 04:40:22 UTC  ``` The libc' sigqueue() function allows to queue a signal, as well as some accompanying data to a process.  The kernel's interface that is used to implement this function is known as rt_sigqueueinfo(). It has been added in Linux 2.2.  This system call is interesting from a security perspective, because it allows userland to compeletely specify the siginfo_t structure. This structure is normally typically almost entirely written by the kernel when a signal is delivered.  Since at least Linux 2.4.0, most abuses of the kernel interface have been prevented with a simple check:  	/* Not even root can pretend to send signals from the kernel. 	   Nor can they impersonate a kill(), which adds source info.  */ 	if (info.si_code >= 0) 		return -EPERM;  This check made sure that rt_sigqueueinfo() could not spoof a signal whose SI_CODE would be SI_KERNEL or SI_USER. As the comment indicates, a process receiving a signal should be able to trust its source pid or uid if its si_code matches SI_USER.  Unfortunately, a couple of years later, when tgkill() and tkill() were added, this check was forgotten and was not updated to prevent the spoofing of a TGKILL si_code.  Because of this, userland is unable to trust the pid and uid information of a TKILL signal.  This is bad, because it is a useful feature in a scenario where a process which cannot ptrace you can send you signals. This includes at least the startup code of setuid binaries.  Meanwhile, userland and libc writers still assumed that they could trust the origin of a SI_TKILL signal. Glibc authors too [1]. Worse: they even silently patched SI_TKILL with SI_USER [2], [3]. So even a userland application that (righfully so) only trusts SI_USER signals will be vulnerable.  A tentative patch for this vulnerability has been committed to Linus' kernel tree [4].  In this patch, we prevent rt_sigqueueinfo() from specifying any si_code != SI_QUEUE. While we believe it to be very unlikley, this could in theory break userland in some older Linux distributions, so we may have to revert to a more concervative patch and prevent ( (si_code == SI_TKILL) || (si_code >= SI_QUEUE) ) instead.

This was addressed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 via <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0927.html> and <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-1189.html>. A future kernel update in Red Hat Enterprise MRG may address this flaw.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=690028#c4)  Petr Matousek    2011-03-30 12:03:28 UTC  ``` From the reporter:  "If you have integrated this patch (which you should!), you should also integrate that one:  <http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=243b422af9ea9af4ead07a8ad54c90d4f9b6081a>  This relaxes the check, since it turns out that glibc does rely on changing the signal code for async IO."
