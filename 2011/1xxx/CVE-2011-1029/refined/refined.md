Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-1029:

**Summary:**

The content from IBM describes a vulnerability in IBM Rational Team Concert (RTC) identified by APAR PM22477, which is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Although the CVE ID is not explicitly mentioned, the description aligns with the vulnerability and timeframe. The vulnerability allows authenticated users to inject malicious scripts into shared reports, which can then be executed in the browsers of other users who access those reports.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application doesn't adequately validate user-controlled data before processing it.
- **Lack of Output Encoding:** The application fails to properly encode user-supplied data before rendering it in the browser.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Stored XSS:** Malicious scripts are stored within the application's database (in the shared reports), leading to a persistent XSS condition that affects all users accessing the infected report.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the browser sessions of other users.
- **Session Hijacking:** The injected scripts can steal cookie-based authentication credentials, potentially granting an attacker access to a user's account.
- **Privilege Escalation:** By targeting privileged users (e.g., project owners), attackers can gain access to administrative functions and sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**

- An authenticated user with malicious intent can exploit the vulnerability.
- The attack vector is via shared reports.
- Malicious scripts are injected into the report name.
- The injected script is then executed through RSS feeds and report views.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have an authenticated account within the IBM Rational Team Concert application to create and publish shared reports.
- **Malicious Script Creation:** The attacker must be able to craft JavaScript code that will be injected into the report name.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was addressed by parsing and escaping the report name before saving it.
- This was resolved in version 2.0 of RTC STD ED
- The vulnerability was discovered internally ( "wi 131186")
