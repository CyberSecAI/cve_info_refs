Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-1759:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `sys_oabi_semtimedop` function within the Linux kernel's ARM architecture when `CONFIG_OABI_COMPAT` is enabled. This function does not properly validate the `nsops` argument (number of operations), which is used to calculate the size of a memory allocation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** A large value for `nsops` can cause an integer overflow when calculating the allocation size (`sizeof(*sops) * nsops`). This results in a smaller-than-required buffer being allocated on the heap.
*   **Heap Overflow:** After the insufficient buffer is allocated, the code proceeds to copy user-provided data into this buffer using a loop. Because the allocation size is smaller than expected due to the integer overflow, the copy operation writes beyond the bounds of the allocated heap buffer, leading to a heap overflow.
*   **Unbounded Copy:** The vulnerability stems from the fact that the nsops argument is not bounded to a maximum, allowing for a large value to be provided by the user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Heap Corruption:** The primary impact is heap corruption. By overflowing the heap buffer, an attacker can overwrite other data structures in memory, potentially leading to unpredictable behavior or control of the execution flow.
*   **Local Privilege Escalation:** The provided information suggests that this could lead to local privilege escalation, however it notes that successful exploitation depends on winning a race condition.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local User:** A local user with the ability to make system calls, specifically `semtimedop`, can trigger this vulnerability.
*   **Malicious `nsops` Value:** The attacker provides a large value for the `nsops` argument to the `semtimedop` system call.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system and the ability to execute code that makes the vulnerable `semtimedop` system call.
*   **`CONFIG_OABI_COMPAT` Enabled:** The system must be running an ARM kernel with the `CONFIG_OABI_COMPAT` configuration option enabled.
*  **Race Condition:** The attacker needs to be able to win a race condition, however, details of this race are not in the content provided.

**Additional details from the content:**

*   The fix restricts the `nsops` argument to `SEMOPM`.
*   The vulnerability exists in the `arch/arm/kernel/sys_oabi-compat.c` file, specifically in the `sys_oabi_semtimedop` function.
*   The user-to-kernel copy functions on ARM zero out destination buffers, meaning that if an attacker does not successfully cause an overflow they will likely zero out the kernel heap, causing a crash.
