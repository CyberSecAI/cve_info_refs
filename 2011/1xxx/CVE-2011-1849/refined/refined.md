### Vulnerability Details for CVE-2011-1849

- **Root Cause:** The vulnerability exists within the `tftpserver.exe` component of HP H3C Intelligent Management Center. The server, by default, listens on UDP port 69. When handling WRQ opcode types, the server allows arbitrary file creation and is configured to truncate/overwrite existing files. This process is owned by the SYSTEM user.
- **Weakness:** Unauthenticated arbitrary file creation and overwrite due to improper handling of WRQ opcodes in the TFTP server.
- **Impact:** Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code under the context of the SYSTEM user on vulnerable installations of HP H3C Intelligent Management Center.
- **Attack Vector:** A remote attacker can send malicious WRQ opcode requests to the TFTP server (UDP port 69) to create or overwrite files with arbitrary content.
- **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker must be able to send UDP packets to the target server on port 69. No authentication is required.
