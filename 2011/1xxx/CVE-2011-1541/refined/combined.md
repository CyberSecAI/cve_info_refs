| [CVE-2024-50066](https://cxsecurity.com/cveshow/CVE-2024-50066/ "CVE-2024-50066") | [In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: mm/mremap: fix move\_normal\_pmd/retract\_page\_tables race In mremap(), move\_page\_tables() looks at the type of the PMD entry and the specified address range to figure out by which method the next chunk of page table entries should be moved. At that point, the mmap\_lock is held in ...](https://cxsecurity.com/cveshow/CVE-2024-50066/ "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm/mremap: fix move_normal_pmd/retract_page_tables race  In mremap(), move_page_tables() looks at the type of the PMD entry and the specified address range to figure out by which method the next chunk of page table entries should be moved.  At that point, the mmap_lock is held in write mode, but no rmap locks are held yet.  For PMD entries that point to page tables and are fully covered by the source address range, move_pgt_entry(NORMAL_PMD, ...) is called, which first takes rmap locks, then does move_normal_pmd().  move_normal_pmd() takes the necessary page table locks at source and destination, then moves an entire page table from the source to the destination.  The problem is: The rmap locks, which protect against concurrent page table removal by retract_page_tables() in the THP code, are only taken after the PMD entry has been read and it has been decided how to move it.  So we can race as follows (with two processes that have mappings of the same tmpfs file that is stored on a tmpfs mount with huge=advise); note that process A accesses page tables through the MM while process B does it through the file rmap:  process A                      process B =========                      ========= mremap   mremap_to     move_vma       move_page_tables         get_old_pmd         alloc_new_pmd                       *** PREEMPT ***                                madvise(MADV_COLLAPSE)                                  do_madvise                                    madvise_walk_vmas                                      madvise_vma_behavior                                        madvise_collapse                                          hpage_collapse_scan_file                                            collapse_file                                              retract_page_tables                                                i_mmap_lock_read(mapping)                                                pmdp_collapse_flush                                                i_mmap_unlock_read(mapping)         move_pgt_entry(NORMAL_PMD, ...)           take_rmap_locks           move_normal_pmd           drop_rmap_locks  When this happens, move_normal_pmd() can end up creating bogus PMD entries in the line `pmd_populate(mm, new_pmd, pmd_pgtable(pmd))`.  The effect depends on arch-specific and machine-specific details; on x86, you can end up with physical page 0 mapped as a page table, which is likely exploitable for user->kernel privilege escalation.  Fix the race by letting process B recheck that the PMD still points to a page table after the rmap locks have been taken.  Otherwise, we bail and let the caller fall back to the PTE-level copying path, which will then bail immediately at the pmd_none() check.  Bug reachability: Reaching this bug requires that you can create shmem/file THP mappings - anonymous THP uses different code that doesn't zap stuff under rmap locks.  File THP is gated on an experimental config flag (CONFIG_READ_ONLY_THP_FOR_FS), so on normal distro kernels you need shmem THP to hit this bug.  As far as I know, getting shmem THP normally requires that you can mount your own tmpfs with the right mount flags, which would require creating your own user+mount namespace; though I don't know if some distros maybe enable shmem THP by default or something like that.  Bug impact: This issue can likely be used for user->kernel privilege escalation when it is reachable.") |  |
