Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2011-1589:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The vulnerability stems from a directory traversal issue within the `Path.pm` module of the Mojolicious Perl Web Application Framework.
   - The framework failed to properly unescape paths before processing them.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Directory Traversal:** The primary weakness is the application's susceptibility to directory traversal attacks via a crafted URI.
   - **Improper Input Handling:** Specifically, the failure to properly handle encoded forward slashes (`%2f`) followed by `..` sequences.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Arbitrary File Access:** A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to read arbitrary files on the server by providing a manipulated URI containing directory traversal sequences. This could expose sensitive information, including configuration files, source code, or other restricted data.

**4. Attack Vectors:**
   - **Network:** The primary attack vector is over the network via a specially crafted HTTP request.
   - **URI Manipulation:** Attackers exploit this issue by crafting malicious URI strings, using encoded forward slashes (`%2f`) followed by `..` sequences to traverse up the directory structure.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
   - **No Authentication Needed:** The provided information suggests the exploit does not require any authentication and can be triggered by any remote attacker.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Component**: `libmojolicious-perl` package.
*   **Affected Versions**: Versions prior to 1.16 of Mojolicious were affected.
*   **Patch**: The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.16-1 for unstable distributions (sid) and 0.999926-1+squeeze1 for stable distributions (squeeze)
