      "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists in the nipplib component of Novell iPrint Client. Specifically, when handling the `op-printer-list-all-jobs` parameter from a user-specified `printer-url`, the process copies user-supplied data into a fixed-length buffer on the stack without proper bounds checking.",

        "Buffer Overflow: User-supplied data is copied into a fixed-length buffer on the stack, leading to a buffer overflow vulnerability.",
        "Lack of Input Validation: The application does not perform adequate checks on the size of the user-supplied data before copying it to the buffer."

      "impact": "A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of the browser.",
      "attack_vectors": "The attacker can exploit this vulnerability by enticing a user to visit a malicious page or open a malicious file containing a crafted `printer-url` with a long `op-printer-list-all-jobs` parameter.",
