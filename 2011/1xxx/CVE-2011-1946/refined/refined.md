Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-1946:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the `/usr/lib/libgnomesu/gnomesu-pam-backend` SUID binary, which is part of the `libgnomesu` package. This binary does not properly check the return values of the `setuid()` system call.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Error Handling:** The core issue is the lack of error checking for `setuid()`. If `setuid()` fails for some reason (e.g., due to resource limits), the program continues to operate with the original (likely root) privileges, even though the intended privilege drop did not occur.
*   **SUID Binary:** The binary has the SUID bit set, meaning it runs with the privileges of the owner (typically root). This makes it a critical target for privilege escalation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution as Root:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can escalate their privileges from a normal user account, guest account, CGI account, or web account to root.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Cooperating Users:** Two or more users can collaborate to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Compromised Accounts:**  An attacker can exploit the vulnerability from a compromised guest, CGI, or web account.
*   **Zombie Processes:** The exploit requires the presence of zombie processes, which are typically a result of normal operations, but which must exist in enough numbers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to a vulnerable system:**  The attacker needs access to a system with the vulnerable `libgnomesu` package installed.
*   **Ability to run commands** The attacker needs to be able to execute code using an account other than root.
*  **Knowledge of a password:** The attacker needs to know the password of the target user to use the `su` command.
*   **Ability to create enough zombie processes:** The attacker must be able to create enough zombie processes in the target account. This may not be explicit but this is part of the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability can be exploited via the `su` command, where an attacker 'su's to a target account and then trigger the vulnerability.
*   The fix involves checking the return value of the `setuid()` system call to ensure the privilege drop was successful.
