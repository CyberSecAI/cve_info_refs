  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2011-1519",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists in the remote console functionality of IBM Lotus Domino Server Controller. When handling user authentication, the server uses a user-supplied COOKIEFILE path to retrieve stored credentials. This path can be a UNC path, allowing an attacker to control both the known good credentials and the challenge credentials.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Authentication bypass due to insecure handling of user-supplied file paths.",
         "Use of attacker-controlled UNC path for credential lookup."
      ],
      "impact": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code under the context of the SYSTEM user.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Network-based attack via TCP port 2050 (default port for remote console functionality)."
      ],
       "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to TCP port 2050 of the vulnerable server and control a UNC path."
    }
