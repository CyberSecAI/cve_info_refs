  "CVE-2011-1184": {
    "description": "Multiple flaws were found in the way JBoss Web handled HTTP DIGEST authentication. These flaws weakened the JBoss Web HTTP DIGEST authentication implementation, subjecting it to some of the weaknesses of HTTP BASIC authentication, for example, allowing remote attackers to perform session replay attacks.",
    "root_cause": "The implementation of HTTP DIGEST authentication had several weaknesses including:\n\n*   replay attacks were permitted\n*   server nonces were not checked\n*   client nonce counts were not checked\n*   qop values were not checked\n*   realm values were not checked\n*   the server secret was hard-coded to a known string",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure implementation of HTTP DIGEST authentication",
      "Session replay attacks",
      "Lack of nonce checking",
      "Lack of client nonce count checking",
      "Lack of qop value checking",
       "Lack of realm value checking",
       "Hard-coded server secret"
    ],
    "impact": "Weakened HTTP DIGEST authentication, making it vulnerable to session replay attacks and potentially allowing unauthorized access to protected resources.",
    "attack_vector": "Remote attacker could exploit the weaknesses in the DIGEST authentication process.",
    "required_capabilities": "Ability to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.",
     "vulnerable_components": [
      "Apache Tomcat",
      "JBoss Web"
    ]
