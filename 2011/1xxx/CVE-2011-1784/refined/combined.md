Hey,

it was reported that keepalived (and some other daemons) store their pid
file with permission 666. A bug was opened for keepalived in Debian,
could a CVE be assigned to the issue?

```
tag 626281 upstream
thanks

Hi,

today I got a bugreport about a security problem in keepalived. It seems that
keepalived daemonize code explicitly sets umask(0) which leads to interesting
results:
-rw-rw-rw-  1 root   root      6 2010-11-24 00:12 keepalived.pid
-rw-rw-rw-  1 root     root        5 2011-02-08 13:00 keepalived.pid
-rw-rw-rw-  1 root     root        5 2011-02-08 13:00 vrrp.pid

Readwrite permissions to the pidfile of a daemon is a really bad idea. a
umask of 000 is probably never a good idea. So I think removing that lines
from keepalived/check/check_daemon.c, keepalived/core/daemon.c and
keepalived/vrrp/vrrp_daemon.c.

After thinking a little bit longer about it, it maybe makes sense to clear a
users umask. But if this is the case, we should explicitly set permissions
for the pidfile (and take care we did that for every open..).

Hi!

umask(0) is a classic way to daemonize a processus. See:
 <http://www.unixguide.net/unix/programming/1.7.shtml>

The problem  is with fopen()  that does not  allow to set a  mode. Maybe
we should use creat() before fopen()?

Yes. Here is a patch. I have checked other invocations of open/fopen and
this was the sole invocation which was faulty.

Yeah, but in days of defensive programming you normally prevent such things. I
haven't checked other files, but everything that uses fopen creates files
with 666. We should be permissive by default.

Sure that would work, but we should also check every fopen call so see if we
have other problems.

I honestly don't know what is  the drawback of using umask(022). You may
break some user  scripts launched by keepalived that  could write a file
(as  root)  which was  then  modified by  a  non-root  process. This  is
difficult to imagine. :)

Ah, there was something. I hoped upstream would catch this up, unfortunatly
that never happened. So I have to apply the patch on my own :(. I will do an
upload later or tomorrow.

I think the fix  will be in the next version of  keepalived. It is in my
fixes branch. But I don't know  when the next version of keepalived will
be released.

The security team already said that this problem does not warant a security

Dear maintainer,

Recently you fixed one or more security problems and as a result you closed
this bug. These problems were not serious enough for a Debian Security
Advisory, so they are now on my radar for fixing in the following suites
through point releases:

squeeze (6.0.4) 	- use target "stable"
lenny (5.0.10) 	- use target "oldstable"

Please prepare a minimal-changes upload targetting each of these suites,
and submit a debdiff to the Release Team [0] for consideration. They will
offer additional guidance or instruct you to upload your package.

I will happily assist you at any stage if the patch is straightforward and
you need help. Please keep me in CC at all times so I can
track the progress of this request.

For details of this process and the rationale, please see the original
announcement [1] and my blog post [2].

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=704039#c0)  Vincent Danen    2011-05-11 22:45:53 UTC  ``` It was reported [1] that keepalived wrote its PID files in /var/run as world-writable files.  This could allow an unprivileged user to change the referenced PID in the PID file, and upon a service restart or stop of keepalived, would kill the other process.  The keepalived daemonize code explicitly sets umask(0) which is the root cause of this flaw, so PID file creation should probably contain an explicit permissions settings.  For instance, as root:  # service keepalived status keepalived (pid  9634) is running... # cat /var/run/keepalived.pid  9634 # ls -al /var/run/keepalived.pid  -rw-rw-rw- 1 root root 5 May 10 15:13 /var/run/keepalived.pid  Then as an unprivileged user:  % echo $(ps ax|grep sshd|grep -v grep|cut -d ' ' -f 2) >/var/run/keepalived.pid  % cat /var/run/keepalived.pid  1638  Back to root:  # service keepalived status keepalived (pid  1638) is running... # service keepalived stop Stopping keepalived:                                       [  OK  ] # service sshd status openssh-daemon is stopped # ps ax|grep sshd|grep -v grep # ps ax|grep keepalived|grep -v grep  9634 ?

# World writable pid and lock files.

```

Hello!

I imagine why files listed below have 666 file mode bits set:
/var/run/checkers.pid
/var/run/vrrp.pid
/var/run/keepalived.pid
/var/run/starter.pid
/var/lock/subsys/ipsec

```
Files are created during startup of ipsec (pluto) and keepalived
deamons.
```

```
I think thar leaving them world writable is security hole. For example
delete or change of its content could confuses monit watching them
running and restarting when they die.
```

Regards.

Subject: CVE request: keepalived pid file permissions issue

Hey,

it was reported that keepalived (and some other daemons) store their pid
file with permission 666. A bug was opened for keepalived in Debian,
could a CVE be assigned to the issue?

| **Name** | CVE-2011-1784 |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | The pidfile\_write function in core/pidfile.c in keepalived 1.2.2 and earlier uses 0666 permissions for the (1) keepalived.pid, (2) checkers.pid, and (3) vrrp.pid files in /var/run/, which allows local users to kill arbitrary processes by writing a PID to one of these files. |
