 ### Analysis of CVE-2011-1784
 

 The provided content is related to CVE-2011-1784.
 

 #### Root cause of vulnerability
 The root cause of the vulnerability is the `umask(0)` call within the keepalived daemonization code, which results in the creation of world-writable PID files.
 

 #### Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present
 The vulnerability lies in the insecure permissions assigned to the PID files (keepalived.pid, checkers.pid, and vrrp.pid) created by the keepalived daemon. These files are created with `0666` permissions, making them world-writable.
 

 #### Impact of exploitation
 An unprivileged local user can modify the content of these PID files. By writing a different PID to the file, they can trick the keepalived init script to send signals to an arbitrary process, potentially leading to denial of service by killing the target process.
 

 #### Attack vectors
 The attack vector is local, where an unprivileged user gains write access to the PID files located in `/var/run/`.
 

 #### Required attacker capabilities/position
 An attacker needs to be a local user with write access to the `/var/run` directory where the keepalived PID files reside.
 

 ### Detailed Explanation from the provided content
 

 *  **Debian Bug Report:**
    *   The Debian bug report highlights that keepalived creates PID files (e.g., `/var/run/keepalived.pid`) with world-writable permissions (`-rw-rw-rw-`).
    *   The issue is considered a "grave" security problem.
    *   The root cause is identified as `keepalived`'s daemonization code explicitly setting `umask(0)`.
    *   A patch was created to use `creat()` instead of `fopen()` to explicitly set file permissions
 

 *   **Mailing List Discussions:**
    *   Discussions on `debian-security@lists.debian.org` confirm the security risk, noting that the world-writable PID files could be manipulated to send signals to arbitrary processes.
    *   It was suggested that init scripts should verify if the PID in the file belongs to the daemon before sending signals.
 

 *  **Red Hat Bugzilla:**
    *   Red Hat's bug report (704039) confirms the vulnerability and its assignment to CVE-2011-1784.
    *   The description details how an unprivileged user can alter the PID file content and cause the `keepalived` service to stop the wrong process.
    *   The `umask(0)` in `keepalived`'s daemonization process was cited as the root cause.
 

 *  **Openwall Discussion**
    *   The `oss-security` mailing list confirms the assignment of `CVE-2011-1784` to this issue
    *   The email from Yves-Alexis Perez requesting the CVE assignment provides the initial bug report
 

 *   **security-tracker.debian.org:**
  *   Provides a summary of the vulnerability
  *   Confirms that the vulnerability is fixed in version `1:1.1.20-1+squeeze1` for `squeeze` and `1:1.2.2-2` for `unstable`
  *   Links back to the Debian bug report
 

 ### Additional Notes:
 

 *   The vulnerability could also be triggered by init scripts or other monitoring tools which attempt to kill a process based on a PID in the world writable pid files
 *   The fix involves ensuring the pid files are not writable by non-root users when the file is created
 *   The `umask(0)` setting when creating the pid file is the core issue that creates the vulnerability, as `fopen` does not provide a way to restrict the permissions of the created file.
