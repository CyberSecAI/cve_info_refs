  "CVE-2011-1769": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "SystemTap's handling of DWARF expressions does not guard against divide by zero errors, which can cause a kernel panic.",
    "details": "A flaw was discovered in systemtap's handling of DWARF expressions where it did not guard against two cases of divide by zero when accessing the `$context` variable. This can result in a kernel div-by-zero message and possible busywait during stap module shutdown. A div-by-zero could cause the kernel to panic and if the kernel reboot on panic flag was set (panic_on_oops), it would cause the system to reboot.",
    "affected_versions": "Systemtap versions as shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input validation in systemtap's handling of DWARF expressions, specifically when accessing the `$context` variable.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Divide-by-zero error when processing DWARF expressions during `$context` variable access."
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploit could lead to a kernel panic, potentially causing a system reboot if the `panic_on_oops` flag is set.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A privileged user (root, or a member of the `stapdev` group) can trigger the vulnerability by instrumenting a specially crafted ELF binary with a vulnerable DWARF expression.",
       "An unprivileged user (member of the 'stapusr' group) can trigger the vulnerability if the system is in unprivileged mode and they are able to trick a privileged user to instrument a specially crafted ELF file."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "For a privileged user, access to the system and the ability to use SystemTap to instrument a specially crafted ELF binary.",
      "For an unprivileged user, unprivileged mode needs to be enabled, group membership in 'stapusr', and the ability to trick a privileged user to instrument a specially crafted ELF file."
