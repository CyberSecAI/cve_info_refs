Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-1739:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in how `mountd(8)` parses the `exports(5)` table, specifically when a network mask is specified using CIDR notation (e.g., `-network 192.0.2.0/23`).
*   The code incorrectly calculates the network mask if the prefix length (the number after the `/`) is not a multiple of 8.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   Incorrect Network Mask Calculation: The core issue is an algorithm error within `mountd` that leads to the generation of an incorrect netmask when non-octet-aligned CIDR prefixes are used.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Incorrect Access Control:  Due to the faulty netmask calculation, NFS access is granted to unintended client systems. Clients that should be denied access might be granted access and vice versa. This could lead to unauthorized access to shared resources.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Network Configuration: An attacker could potentially exploit this by being present on a network that is granted access to the NFS server due to the incorrect netmask calculations, even when they should have been blocked by the intended network restrictions. The attacker would not have to be directly on the subnet specified in exports file due to the flawed calculation.
*   Exports Configuration: An administrator specifying non-octet-aligned network masks in `/etc/exports` would inadvertently create the vulnerability and would need to use the flawed configurations, possibly based on documentation or legacy configurations that encouraged such usage.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   Network Access: The attacker needs to have network connectivity that would fall under the incorrectly calculated network mask for the NFS export.
*   No special privileges on the victim server are required.
*   Knowledge of the network configuration may be required.
