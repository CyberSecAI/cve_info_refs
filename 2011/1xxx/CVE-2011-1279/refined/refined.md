**CVE-2011-1279: Excel Out of Bounds WriteAV Vulnerability**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability arises from a memory handling error within Microsoft Excel when validating record information while parsing specially crafted Excel files. This leads to an out-of-bounds write access violation.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Improper validation of record information within Excel files.
    *   Out-of-bounds write access violation, leading to memory corruption.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to achieve remote code execution. An attacker can gain the same user rights as the logged-on user, which may lead to the following:
    *   Complete control of the affected system.
    *   Installation of programs.
    *   Viewing, changing, or deleting data.
    *   Creation of new accounts with full user rights.
*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Email:** An attacker sends a specially crafted Excel file to the user, convincing them to open it.
    *   **Web-based:** An attacker hosts a website with a malicious Excel file, or compromises a legitimate site to host it. They then convince users to visit the site and open the file.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Ability to craft malicious Excel files that trigger the vulnerability.
    *   Ability to deliver the file to the victim via email or web hosting.
    *   The user must take the action of opening the malicious file for the exploit to be triggered.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided Microsoft Security Bulletin MS11-045 addresses multiple vulnerabilities, including CVE-2011-1279.
*   The bulletin provides workarounds such as using Office File Validation to block opening of suspicious files and Microsoft Office File Block policy to prevent opening older Office files from untrusted sources. Also, using the Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment (MOICE) is recommended when opening files from untrusted sources.
*   Microsoft has provided security updates to address this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability is rated as "Important" as user interaction (opening a malicious file) is required to exploit the vulnerability.
*   The CERT/CC is credited with reporting this specific vulnerability.
