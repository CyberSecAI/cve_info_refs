# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=680360#c0)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2011-02-25 09:05:40 UTC  ``` Since a8f80e8ff94ecba629542d9b4b5f5a8ee3eb565c any process with CAP_NET_ADMIN may load any module from /lib/modules/.  This doesn't mean that CAP_NET_ADMIN is a superset of CAP_SYS_MODULE as modules are limited to /lib/modules/**.  However, CAP_NET_ADMIN capability shouldn't allow anybody load any module not related to networking.  This patch restricts an ability of autoloading modules to netdev modules with explicit aliases.  This fixes [CVE-2011-1019](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1019).  Arnd Bergmann suggested to leave untouched the old pre-v2.6.32 behavior of loading netdev modules by name (without any prefix) for processes with CAP_SYS_MODULE to maintain the compatibility with network scripts that use autoloading netdev modules by aliases like "eth0", "wlan0".  Currently there are only three users of the feature in the upstream kernel: ipip, ip_gre and sit.      root@albatros:~# capsh --drop=$(seq -s, 0 11),$(seq -s, 13 34) --     root@albatros:~# grep Cap /proc/$$/status     CapInh:	0000000000000000     CapPrm:	fffffff800001000     CapEff:	fffffff800001000     CapBnd:	fffffff800001000     root@albatros:~# modprobe xfs     FATAL: Error inserting xfs     (/lib/modules/2.6.38-rc6-00001-g2bf4ca3/kernel/fs/xfs/xfs.ko): Operation not permitted     root@albatros:~# lsmod | grep xfs     root@albatros:~# ifconfig xfs     xfs: error fetching interface information: Device not found     root@albatros:~# lsmod | grep xfs     root@albatros:~# lsmod | grep sit     root@albatros:~# ifconfig sit     sit: error fetching interface information: Device not found     root@albatros:~# lsmod | grep sit     root@albatros:~# ifconfig sit0     sit0      Link encap:IPv6-in-IPv4 	      NOARP  MTU:1480  Metric:1      root@albatros:~# lsmod | grep sit     sit                    10457  0     tunnel4                 2957  1 sit  For CAP_SYS_MODULE module loading is still relaxed:      root@albatros:~# grep Cap /proc/$$/status     CapInh:	0000000000000000     CapPrm:	ffffffffffffffff     CapEff:	ffffffffffffffff     CapBnd:	ffffffffffffffff     root@albatros:~# ifconfig xfs     xfs: error fetching interface information: Device not found     root@albatros:~# lsmod | grep xfs     xfs                   745319  0  References: <https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/2/24/203> <http://www.spinics.net/lists/netdev/msg156587.html>  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Vasiliy Kulikov of Openwall for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=680360#c3)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2011-03-12 00:53:06 UTC  ``` Upstream commit: <http://git.kernel.org/linus/8909c9ad8ff03611c9c96c9a92656213e4bb495b>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=680360#c4)  Chuck Ebbert    2011-03-12 19:47:04 UTC  ``` Needs this fix too: <http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/davem/net-2.6.git;a=commitdiff_plain;h=6dfbd87a20a737641ef228230c77f4262434fa24>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=680360#c5)  Phillip Lougher    2011-03-16 19:07:34 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=680360#c4)) > Needs this fix too: > <http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/davem/net-2.6.git;a=commitdiff_plain;h=6dfbd87a20a737641ef228230c77f4262434fa24>  Not strictly true, because net/ipv6/ip6_tunnel.c lacked an MODULE_ALIAS to begin with, so you couldn't autoload it as "ip6tnl0" before anyway.

Since Linux 2.6.32 [1] there is suchpossibility:root@albatros:~# grep Cap /proc/$$/statusCapInh: 0000000000000000CapPrm: fffffffc00001000CapEff: fffffffc00001000CapBnd: fffffffc00001000root@albatros:~# lsmod | grep xfsroot@albatros:~# ifconfig xfsxfs: error fetching interface information: Device not foundroot@albatros:~# lsmod | grep xfsxfs                   767011  0 exportfs                4226  2 xfs,nfsdAbility of CAP_NET_ADMIN to load the driver to work with a particularnetwork device is rational;  however, one may load any module not evenrelated to network this way.  Hopefully, this is not equal toCAP_SYS_MODULE since the module set is restricted to /lib/modules(additionally may be disabled with /proc/sys/kernel/modules_disabled),but the idea of non-netdev module loading is weird.My proposal is changing request_module("%s", name) to something likerequest_module("netdev-%s", name) inside of dev_load() and addingaliases to related drivers.  This would allow to load only netdevmodules via these ioctls.  I'm not sure what modules should be patches -at least real physical netdevices have names different from drivers'names, so they don't need patching.  I suppose the list is not big.Any comments are welcome.[1] <http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=a8f80e8ff94ecba629542d9b4b5f5a8ee3eb565c>Thanks,-- Vasiliy Kulikov<http://www.openwall.com> - bringing security into open computing environments ``` | \ |

net: don't allow CAP\_NET\_ADMIN to load non-netdev kernel modules

```
Since [a8f80e8](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/a8f80e8ff94ecba629542d9b4b5f5a8ee3eb565c) any process with
CAP_NET_ADMIN may load any module from /lib/modules/.  This doesn't mean
that CAP_NET_ADMIN is a superset of CAP_SYS_MODULE as modules are
limited to /lib/modules/**.  However, CAP_NET_ADMIN capability shouldn't
allow anybody load any module not related to networking.

This patch restricts an ability of autoloading modules to netdev modules
with explicit aliases.  This fixes [CVE-2011-1019](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-m9v6-qv4x-59wj "CVE-2011-1019").

Arnd Bergmann suggested to leave untouched the old pre-v2.6.32 behavior
of loading netdev modules by name (without any prefix) for processes
with CAP_SYS_MODULE to maintain the compatibility with network scripts
that use autoloading netdev modules by aliases like "eth0", "wlan0".

Currently there are only three users of the feature in the upstream
kernel: ipip, ip_gre and sit.

For CAP_SYS_MODULE module loading is still relaxed:
