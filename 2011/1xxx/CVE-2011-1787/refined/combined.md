How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

#####

b. ESX third party update for Service Console kernel
This update for the console OS kernel package resolves four security issues.

1. IPv4 Remote Denial of Service An remote attacker can achieve a denial of service via an issue in the kernel IPv4 code. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project ( [cve.mitre.org](http://cve.mitre.org/)) has assigned the name CVE-2010-1188 to this issue.
2. SCSI Driver Denial of Service / Possible Privilege Escalation A local attacker can achieve a denial of service and possibly a privilege escalation via a vulnerability in the Linux SCSI drivers. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project ( [cve.mitre.org](http://cve.mitre.org/)) has assigned the name CVE-2009-3080 to this issue.
3. Kernel Memory Management Arbitrary Code Execution A context-dependent attacker can execute arbitrary code via a vulnerability in a kernel memory handling function. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project ( [cve.mitre.org](http://cve.mitre.org/)) has assigned the name CVE-2010-2240 to this issue.
4. e1000 Driver Packet Filter Bypass There is an issue in the Service Console e1000 Linux driver for Intel PRO/1000 adapters that allows a remote attacker to bypass packet filters. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project ( [cve.mitre.org](http://cve.mitre.org/)) has assigned the name CVE-2009-4536 to this issue.

#####

c. Multiple vulnerabilities in mount.vmhgfs
This patch provides a fix for the following three security issues in the VMware Host Guest File System (HGFS). None of these issues affect Windows based Guest Operating Systems.

1. Mount.vmhgfs Information Disclosure Information disclosure via a vulnerability that allows an attacker with access to the Guest to determine if a path exists in the Host filesystem and whether it is a file or directory regardless of permissions. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project ( [cve.mitre.org](http://cve.mitre.org/)) has assigned the name CVE-2011-2146 to this issue.
2. Mount.vmhgfs Race Condition Privilege escalation via a race condition that allows an attacker with access to the guest to mount on arbitrary directories in the Guest filesystem and achieve privilege escalation if they can control the contents of the mounted directory. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project ( [cve.mitre.org](http://cve.mitre.org/)) has assigned the name CVE-2011-1787 to this issue.
3. Mount.vmhgfs Privilege Escalation Privilege escalation via a procedural error that allows an attacker with access to the guest operating system to gain write access to an arbitrary file in the Guest filesystem. This issue only affects Solaris and FreeBSD Guest Operating Systems. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project ( [cve.mitre.org](http://cve.mitre.org/)) has assigned the name CVE-2011-2145 to this issue.

VMware would like to thank Dan Rosenberg for reporting theseissues.

\* After the update is applied VMware Guest Tools must be updated in any pre-existing non-Windows guest operating systems

#####

d. VI Client ActiveX vulnerabilities
VI Client COM objects can be instantiated in Internet Explorer which may cause memory corruption. An attacker who succeeded in making the VI Client user visit a malicious Web site could execute code on the user's system within the security context of that user.

VMware would like to thank Elazar Broad and iDefense for reporting this issue to us.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project ( [cve.mitre.org](http://cve.mitre.org/)) has assigned the name CVE-2011-2217 to this issue.

Affected versions.

The vSphere Client which comes with vSphere 4.0 and vSphere 4.1 is not affected. This is any build of vSphere Client Version 4.0.0 and vSphere Client Version 4.1.0.

VI Clients bundled with VMware Infrastructure 3 that are not affected are:

* VI Client 2.0.2 Build 230598 and higher
* VI Client 2.5 Build 204931 and higher

The issue can be remediated by replacing an affected VI Client with the VI Client bundled with VirtualCenter 2.5 Update 6 or VirtualCenter 2.5 Update 6a.
