Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-1787:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a race condition within the `mount.vmhgfs` utility, part of the VMware Host Guest File System (HGFS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Race Condition:** The core issue is a race condition that occurs during the mounting process of the shared file system between a host and a guest operating system.
- **Privilege Escalation:** By exploiting this race condition, an attacker can mount on arbitrary directories within the guest file system. If the attacker can control the contents of these mounted directories, they can potentially achieve privilege escalation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Privilege Escalation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker with guest access to gain elevated privileges within the guest operating system. This could allow the attacker to read, modify, or delete files and execute arbitrary code, resulting in a full compromise of the guest OS.
- **Arbitrary File System Mounting:** The attacker can mount the shared directory to locations outside the intended mount point.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have access to a vulnerable guest operating system. The attack is launched from inside the guest.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker must have a user account and the ability to execute code within a vulnerable virtual guest OS (non-Windows).
- The attacker needs to be able to exploit the race condition, which might require specific timing or resource control on the guest OS.

**Additional Details:**

- This vulnerability does not affect Windows-based guest operating systems.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Dan Rosenberg.
- Patches were released for VMware Workstation, Player, Fusion, ESXi and ESX.
- The `mount.vmhgfs` utility is used for sharing files between the host and guest OS.
