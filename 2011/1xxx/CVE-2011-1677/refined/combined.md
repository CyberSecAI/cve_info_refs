| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=688980#c0)  Vincent Danen    2011-03-18 17:50:00 UTC  ``` Dan Rosenberg reported a flaw with suid mount helpers handle access to /etc/mtab [1], which could allow an unprivileged user to corrupt /etc/mtab and possibly manipulate mountpoint options or unmount a filesystem.  The original report follows.   This was originally sent to the now-defunct vendor-sec mailing list. Seeing how it's a relatively low-severity issue and that we're currently lacking a mechanism for coordination among package maintainers and vendors, this list seems like a perfectly acceptable venue for discussing how to fix it.  I discovered that essentially every suid mount helper that uses addmntent() (or invokes util-linux mount, which in turn calls addmntent()) to add entries to /etc/mtab fails to anticipate a low value for RLIMIT_FSIZE, allowing unprivileged users to corrupt /etc/mtab and possibly manipulate mountpoint options.  Affected software includes at least:  mount.cifs (samba) fusermount (FUSE) mount (util-linux) ncpmount (ncpfs) vmware-hgfsmounter (open-vm-tools)  Also affected are all their unmount equivalents.  This can be exploited by checking the current size of /etc/mtab, setting an RLIMIT_FSIZE of some small amount greater than that, and invoking a suid mount helper.  The edits to /etc/mtab will be truncated to the ulimit and no newline will be appended, so multiple invocations allow near-arbitrary appending to /etc/mtab.  addmntent() will octal-encode most special characters, which makes exploitation beyond simple corruption not quite as straightforward, but I'm confident that with some creativity it would be possible to perform unauthorized unmounting, for example.  There are a few possible options   We could patch glibc to try to raise the rlimit in addmntent().  Or we could fix every suid mount helper to raise the rlimit or have proper error handling for the case when addmntent() fails.  This final option requires that mtab editing be done in a temporary file and aborted on failure, which isn't the case for all helpers.  Of course, once we figure out how to fix this, we can talk about assigning CVEs, etc.   And a followup regarding specific mount helpers:  I did a survey of some suid helpers I'm aware of.  Here's the existing behavior:  util-linux mount ============= * Edits /etc/mtab.tmp with custom my_addmntent(), behaves identically to glibc addmntent() in terms of return code * Succeeds on partial writes, does not remove temp file on failure (could result in additional corruption of /etc/mtab through multiple invocations), does not remove lock file /etc/mtab~ on failure (also an issue)  fusermount (FUSE) ================ * Does not edit mtab directly, calls into util-linux mount/umount, no changes needed  mount.cifs (samba) ================ * mount.cifs edits /etc/mtab directly, no cleanup on addmntent() failure * umount.cifs edits /etc/mtab.tmp but does not check return code of addmntent()  ncpmount (ncpfs) ============== * ncpmount edits /etc/mtab directly, no cleanup on failure, does not remove lock file /etc/mtab~ on failure * ncpumount edits /etc/mtab.tmp but does not check return code of addmntent()  vmware-hgfsmounter (open-vm-tools) =============================== * edits /etc/mtab directly, no cleanup on failure   Further discussion is ongoing via the oss-security mailing list.

Citing our glibc maintainer Petr Baudis via Bugzilla:

| I have been thinking about it and I'm not at all sure the proposed solution
| makes sense. First, this may also concern the obscure interfaces like
| putspent() (not sure if anyone uses these, moreover in security relevant
| contexts). Second, messing with RLIMIT_FSIZE within library routine is just
| evil. The caller may be multi-threaded or just do something else between
| setpwent() and endpwent() too and RLIMIT_FSIZE is just evil. All setuid
| programs must sanitize things like this, on their own terms.

Sigh.  Unfortunately I think this is the truth - I just wish there
were an easier way of addressing this besides patching every affected
helper individually.  Unless anyone else has any ideas, I'll write up
some patches for affected programs later today.

I must admit that I fail to see an obvious issue here.  This should do
the right thing assuming fprintf returns what you expect (which does
not seem to happen due to stdio buffering).

Do you have any specific idea for the fix?  It seems following approach
may work:

  if (fprintf (stream, "%s %s %s %s %d %d\n", ...) < 0)
    return 1;

  return (fflush(stream) == 0 ? 0 : 1);

Detecting this error in endmntent() seems more problematic API-wise,
given that endmntent() currently "always returns 1".

Do you plan to open bug in glibc bugzilla for this issue?

This is a very good point.  I'm not sure why /etc/mtab exists anymore
given /proc/mounts is a more reliable source for this information.

It seems like fixing glibc to either raise the rlimit or correctly handle
the error condition is the way to go (as you already mentioned). I share
the concern of the helpers maybe not checking addmntent() return codes,
though. If they all do, I would think that just correct error handling
in glibc would be accepted upstream. Whatever the fix, it really feels like
it should be in glibc. It is what is responsible for actually writing to
the file...

Our system boot scripts used -n as long as / was mounted read only
and -f to update mtab once / was remounted rw.
Since openSUSE 11.4 /etc/mtab is a symlink to /proc/self/mounts
which works fine so far AFAIK.

/proc/mounts doesn't store options like user=. So replacing /etc/mtab
with a symlink wasn't feasible in general. util-linux recently
introduced /dev/.mount/utab which stores the missing information.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

You're right, I neglected to consider stdio buffering, so the

written, even if they weren't actually written yet.

This may work.  I'll do some testing later today.

One more option is to replace /etc/mtab regular file with a symlink to
/proc/mounts, thus making any /etc/mtab editing unneeded.

I imagine that mount's -f (fake mount by editing mtab) and -n (mount
without editing mtab) options are not going to work if /etc/mtab becomes
a symbolic link to /proc/mounts, so that's liable to break a few things.
  In the long run it does seem like a good plan, but there might be a
few bumps in the road.  I wonder what the rationale was for faking mtab
mounts in the first place?

Subject: Suid mount helpers fail to anticipate RLIMIT_FSIZE

Hi all,

This was originally sent to the now-defunct vendor-sec mailing list.
Seeing how it's a relatively low-severity issue and that we're
currently lacking a mechanism for coordination among package
maintainers and vendors, this list seems like a perfectly acceptable
venue for discussing how to fix it.

I discovered that essentially every suid mount helper that uses
addmntent() (or invokes util-linux mount, which in turn calls
addmntent()) to add entries to /etc/mtab fails to anticipate a low
value for RLIMIT_FSIZE, allowing unprivileged users to corrupt
/etc/mtab and possibly manipulate mountpoint options.  Affected
software includes at least:

mount.cifs (samba)
fusermount (FUSE)
mount (util-linux)
ncpmount (ncpfs)
vmware-hgfsmounter (open-vm-tools)

Also affected are all their unmount equivalents.

This can be exploited by checking the current size of /etc/mtab,
setting an RLIMIT_FSIZE of some small amount greater than that, and
invoking a suid mount helper.  The edits to /etc/mtab will be
truncated to the ulimit and no newline will be appended, so multiple
invocations allow near-arbitrary appending to /etc/mtab.  addmntent()
will octal-encode most special characters, which makes exploitation
beyond simple corruption not quite as straightforward, but I'm
confident that with some creativity it would be possible to perform
unauthorized unmounting, for example.

There are a few possible options   We could patch glibc to try to
raise the rlimit in addmntent().  Or we could fix every suid mount
helper to raise the rlimit or have proper error handling for the case
when addmntent() fails.  This final option requires that mtab editing
be done in a temporary file and aborted on failure, which isn't the
case for all helpers.

Of course, once we figure out how to fix this, we can talk about
assigning CVEs, etc.

Regards,
Dan

I'm going to assign CVE-2011-1089 to this, under the assumption the fix
will go into glibc (it's a bit confusing, but I think I follow from playing
along at home).

CC-ing various distros in case they missed the original email, which
I've included below.

This is all good to know, but what do we think is the best way to
actually fix this specific issue for all the systems supported by
distros that are using older versions of util-linux, or for various
other reasons can't get rid of /etc/mtab?

Fixing every suid mount helper individually seems a bit tedious, but
there might not be a way around it.

fusermount (FUSE)
mount (util-linux)
ncpmount (ncpfs)
vmware-hgfsmounter (open-vm-tools)

Also affected are all their unmount equivalents.

This can be exploited by checking the current size of /etc/mtab,
setting an RLIMIT_FSIZE of some small amount greater than that, and
invoking a suid mount helper.  The edits to /etc/mtab will be
truncated to the ulimit and no newline will be appended, so multiple
invocations allow near-arbitrary appending to /etc/mtab.  addmntent()
will octal-encode most special characters, which makes exploitation
beyond simple corruption not quite as straightforward, but I'm
confident that with some creativity it would be possible to perform
unauthorized unmounting, for example.

There are a few possible options   We could patch glibc to try to
raise the rlimit in addmntent().  Or we could fix every suid mount
helper to raise the rlimit or have proper error handling for the case
when addmntent() fails.  This final option requires that mtab editing
be done in a temporary file and aborted on failure, which isn't the
case for all helpers.

Of course, once we figure out how to fix this, we can talk about
assigning CVEs, etc.

Dan

Subject: Re: Suid mount helpers fail to anticipate RLIMIT_FSIZE

I did a survey of some suid helpers I'm aware of.  Here's the existing behavior:

util-linux mount
=============
* Edits /etc/mtab.tmp with custom my_addmntent(), behaves identically
to glibc addmntent() in terms of return code
* Succeeds on partial writes, does not remove temp file on failure
(could result in additional corruption of /etc/mtab through multiple
invocations), does not remove lock file /etc/mtab~ on failure (also an
issue)

fusermount (FUSE)
================
* Does not edit mtab directly, calls into util-linux mount/umount, no
changes needed

mount.cifs (samba)
================
* mount.cifs edits /etc/mtab directly, no cleanup on addmntent() failure
* umount.cifs edits /etc/mtab.tmp but does not check return code of addmntent()

ncpmount (ncpfs)
==============
* ncpmount edits /etc/mtab directly, no cleanup on failure, does not
remove lock file /etc/mtab~ on failure
* ncpumount edits /etc/mtab.tmp but does not check return code of addmntent()

vmware-hgfsmounter (open-vm-tools)
===============================
* edits /etc/mtab directly, no cleanup on failure

Regards,
Dan

Subject: Re: Suid mount helpers fail to anticipate RLIMIT_FSIZE

I've done some further investigation, and have found one of the
underlying problems.  addmntent() will return 0 (success) even if the
write was truncated:

  return (fprintf (stream, "%s %s %s %s %d %d\n",
                   mntcopy.mnt_fsname,
                   mntcopy.mnt_dir,
                   mntcopy.mnt_type,
                   mntcopy.mnt_opts,
                   mntcopy.mnt_freq,
                   mntcopy.mnt_passno)
          < 0 ? 1 : 0);

Of course, this only matters if the process is catching the SIGXFSZ
that gets thrown if the resource limit is exceeded, but nearly all
suid mount helpers block or ignore signals (if they don't, that's an
additional problem, because the process could be terminated mid-write,
corrupting /etc/mtab or leaving a stale lockfile, for example).

So, I think the first step is to patch glibc to return success in
these functions if and only if the *full* contents have been written.
Then, it will be possible to have proper error handling in these
helper utilities.  Currently, there's really no way for these programs
to know whether or not their calls to addmntent() actually succeeded
besides installing a special signal handler for SIGXFSZ (ugly).

After some further thinking and discussion, I think what needs to be
done is ensuring that all helpers make mtab edits to a temporary file,
and have proper error handling that cleans up correctly without
copying over to the actual /etc/mtab if anything bad happens.
Currently, some mount helpers edit /etc/mtab directly, and others use
a temporary file but don't have the proper error handling.

I think this one's going to fall into the hands of package maintainers
and distros, I don't have time to fix all of these.

"Today" ended up meaning "next week", but there's now a glibc bugzilla
entry for this:
<http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=12625>

As indicated in my previous email, some of the helpers will need fixes
to completely resolve this issue.  In particular:

* util-linux mount should modify its custom addmntent function to
behave as suggested in the glibc bug report, and should improve its
error handling on addmntent failure to remove lockfiles and temporary
files.

* If mount.cifs is still shipped by anyone as setuid (I know there was
discussion of removing its suid bit), then it will need to be altered
to edit a temp file instead of /etc/mtab directly and clean up on
addmntent failure.

* If ncpfs is still supported by anyone (it's orphaned in a number of
distributions), it should be fixed to have ncpmount edit a temp file
instead of /etc/mtab directly and have both ncpmount and ncpumount
clean up properly on addmntent failure.

Alternatively, I'd be happy to see mount.cifs and the ncpfs utils no
longer ship with a suid bit, since they've had security issues in the
past and I don't think there's many situations where unprivileged
users need the ability to mount filesystems other than FUSE.  I'd also
like to see distributions migrating away from /etc/mtab in general,
since /proc/mounts seems like a much better replacement.

The above issues will probably need CVE identifiers of their own, but
I'd hold off on assigning them until it's clear that glibc is amicable
to the proposed solution.  Otherwise, there may need to be other fixes
involving raising resource limits (I hope not).
