Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2011-1677

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The `umount` command in `util-linux` does not remove the `/etc/mtab~` lock file after a failed attempt to add a mount entry. This occurs when `addmntent()`, a function in glibc used for adding entries to `/etc/mtab`, encounters an error. This error is often due to the `RLIMIT_FSIZE` limit, which restricts file write sizes, being set too low.  The core issue is that `addmntent()` doesn't properly report write failures when RLIMIT_FSIZE is reached. This can be exploited to create a situation where the lockfile remains in place, even when the mount operation has failed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Inadequate Error Handling:** The primary vulnerability lies in the failure of the `umount` command to remove the lockfile (`/etc/mtab~`) when `addmntent()` fails. This is due to both the  `addmntent` function not reporting the error due to reaching the file size limit, as well as the mount helper not checking the return code of `addmntent()` or handling errors when the writes fail. This leaves the lockfile behind.
- **Reliance on /etc/mtab:** The use of `/etc/mtab` for managing mount information creates a point of vulnerability.  It's a regular file that can be manipulated by privileged programs, and if those programs don't perform all operations atomically it can lead to inconsistencies.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service:** A malicious user can repeatedly trigger failed mount operations, leaving behind stale lock files. These lock files could potentially prevent legitimate mount or unmount operations from succeeding, leading to a denial-of-service condition.
- **Potential for Further Exploitation:** While not explicitly detailed for CVE-2011-1677, the underlying issue of failing to handle `RLIMIT_FSIZE` correctly also leads to /etc/mtab corruption issues as shown in CVE-2011-1089.  This could potentially be leveraged to manipulate mountpoint options or unmount a filesystem.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** The attack is performed by a local user on the system.
- **Exploiting setuid mount helpers:** The attack leverages the fact that mount helpers often run with elevated privileges (setuid) and perform operations that write to `/etc/mtab`, which is a system file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Unprivileged User Account:** The attacker must have a local user account on the system where the vulnerable utilities are installed.
- **Ability to Set RLIMIT_FSIZE:** The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the `RLIMIT_FSIZE` resource limit. This can typically be done by any user on the system.
- **Knowledge of /etc/mtab Lock Files:** The attacker must be aware of the `/etc/mtab~` lock file and how the `umount` command interacts with it.

**Additional Information:**

- The issue is ultimately rooted in how glibc handles write errors and does not correctly report when writes to files are truncated due to `RLIMIT_FSIZE`.
- The proposed fix for the overall family of vulnerabilities involves patching `glibc`,  modifying affected utilities to perform `mtab` edits to a temporary file, and performing proper error handling.
- Other related CVEs are also assigned to the various impacted mount utilities, such as `mount`, `mount.cifs`, `ncpmount`, `ncpumount`, etc.
-  The original report was sent to the now defunct vendor-sec mailing list.
