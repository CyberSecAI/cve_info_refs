Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2011-1977:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the Microsoft Chart controls improperly handling special characters within specially crafted URIs. Specifically, the controls fail to adequately verify functions within these URIs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** The core weakness is a lack of proper input validation or sanitization of URIs passed to the chart controls. This allows an attacker to inject malicious characters or commands.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability allows for information disclosure, specifically the ability to read the content of arbitrary files within the web application's directory or subdirectories.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary impact is the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information. An attacker can potentially access any file accessible by the web application, including configuration files like web.config, which often contain sensitive data such as database connection strings, API keys, or other credentials.
*   **Potential for Further Compromise:** While the vulnerability does not directly allow code execution or privilege escalation, the disclosed information can be used in subsequent attacks to further compromise the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Specially Crafted GET Request:** An attacker exploits the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to a vulnerable web server that hosts the Microsoft Chart controls.
*   **URI Manipulation:** The attack vector relies on the attacker manipulating the URI to include malicious characters and commands that bypass the inadequate input validation within the chart controls.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated or have any special access to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target web server.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects web applications using Microsoft Chart Control. Default installations of the .NET Framework are not affected.
*   The severity of the vulnerability is rated as "Important" by Microsoft.
*   Microsoft has released security updates to address this vulnerability, which are detailed in the provided content.
*   The Microsoft Exploitability Index does not differentiate between vulnerability types and is focused on the likelihood of exploitation of each vulnerability within the range of their full impact potential.
*   The provided documents also contain information on how to detect and deploy the necessary security updates, utilizing tools such as Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA), Windows Server Update Services (WSUS), and System Management Server (SMS).

**In summary, CVE-2011-1977 is a significant information disclosure vulnerability in Microsoft Chart controls due to inadequate URI handling, allowing an unauthenticated remote attacker to potentially expose sensitive files and information. Applying the relevant updates is critical to mitigate this risk.**
