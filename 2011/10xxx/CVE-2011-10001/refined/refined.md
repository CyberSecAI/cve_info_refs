The provided content is related to CVE-2011-10001. The commit message "Fixed potential SQL exploit" and the code diffs provide information about the vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a SQL injection vulnerability in the `articles.cfm` file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL injection: The code directly embeds the `url.story` variable into the SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
- Integer type casting: The code attempts to cast `url.story` to an integer, but it does not validate whether the input was originally an integer. If `url.story` is not an integer, then the cast to an integer with `int()` will still allow injection.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Data Breach: An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive data stored in the `cms_news` and `cms_comments` tables.
- Data Manipulation: An attacker could potentially modify or delete data in these tables.
- Denial of Service: An attacker could potentially cause a denial-of-service by injecting a query that consumes excessive resources.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `url.story` parameter, which is likely passed via a URL query string or POST data.
- An attacker could inject malicious SQL code into the `url.story` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the `articles.cfm` file and manipulate the `url.story` parameter.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges.
- The attacker needs to have some knowledge of SQL syntax.

**Code diff details:**

*   The first change adds `<cfset url.story = int(url.story)>` to cast url.story to an integer type before using it in the first SQL query.
*   The second change removes `ORDER BY id ASC` from the SQL query and replaces it with `ORDER BY id DESC`. This is not a fix for the SQL Injection issue and its not clear why this change was made.
