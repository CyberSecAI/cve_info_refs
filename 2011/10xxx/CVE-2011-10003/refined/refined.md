The provided content relates to CVE-2011-10003.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization when constructing SQL update queries. Specifically, when a column type is defined as 'number' in the XML configuration, the code attempts to cast the input value to an integer. However, if the input is not a valid number, it's still used in the query without proper escaping, leading to a SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
SQL injection vulnerability is present in the `_executeUpdateAct` function of several database classes (DBCubrid, DBMssql, DBMysql, DBPostgresql, DBSqlite2, and DBSqlite3_pdo). The vulnerability occurs because the code doesn't properly sanitize input values when constructing update queries, particularly when the column type is declared as "number".

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code, leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion. The attacker can potentially gain complete control over the database.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through input data when updating a database record. An attacker can craft a malicious input value that will be interpreted as SQL code rather than data when the column is specified as number, which the application doesn't handle properly.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker must be able to send malicious data through the application's interface, which gets processed in the database update function. The attacker needs to find an entry point where they can control the input values that are used in the update queries.
