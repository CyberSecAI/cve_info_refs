{
  "CVE-2011-4108": {
    "description": "The DTLS implementation in OpenSSL executes certain error-handling code only if there is a specific relationship between a padding length and the ciphertext size, which made it easier for remote attackers to recover partial plaintext via a timing side-channel attack.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The DTLS implementation in OpenSSL had a flaw in its error-handling logic related to padding length and ciphertext size, which could be exploited via timing side-channel attack.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Timing side-channel vulnerability",
        "Incorrect error-handling in DTLS implementation"
      ],
      "impact": "Remote attackers could potentially recover partial plaintext via a timing side-channel attack by exploiting the vulnerability in DTLS implementation, potentially exposing sensitive information in the encrypted communication.",
      "attack_vector": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending specially crafted DTLS packets with varying padding lengths and measuring the time taken by the server to respond.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "Remote attackers with the ability to send network traffic to a vulnerable server.",
       "additional_information": "This is an extension of the Vaudenay padding oracle attack on CBC mode encryption. The vulnerability allows for a more efficient plaintext recovery attack against the OpenSSL implementation of DTLS by exploiting timing differences arising during decryption processing."
