## OneOrZero AIMS authentication bypass and SQLi vulnerabilities

#### Vulnerability Note VU#800227

Original Release Date: 2011-10-13 | Last Revised: 2011-10-13

---

### Overview

OneOrZero Action & Information Management System (AIMS) is vulnerable to an authentication bypass and SQL injection.

### Description

| According to the vendor's website:  [*"OneOrZero AIMS*](http://www.oneorzero.com/) *is a powerful enterprise ready suite that includes a help desk, knowledge base, time manager and reporting system supported by a highly configurable and extensible Action & Information Management System that allows you to 'build your own system' on the fly."*AIMS is susceptible to an authentication bypass. An attacker can generate a session cookie for $\_COOKIE['oozimsrememberme'] and log in as an administrator without providing a password. AIMS is also susceptible to SQL injection. On line 136 of lib\ooz\_access.php the $cookieName variable that originates from an attacker controllable cookie is passed to a SQL statement without any filtering:$sql = "SELECT \* FROM " . OOZ\_SET\_TABLE\_PREFIX . "users WHERE user\_name = '" . $cookieName . "'";$userResult = DB::query($sql, DSN, OOZ\_SET\_SHOW\_SQL); |
| --- |

### Impact

| An unauthenticated remote attacker may be able to bypass authentication or leak database information. |
| --- |

### Solution

| We are currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem. |
