{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application uses a cookie value directly in an SQL query without proper sanitization and also improperly handles session cookies for authentication.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection: The `cookieName` variable, derived from the `_COOKIE['oozimsrememberme']`, is directly incorporated into an SQL query without sanitization, leading to a potential SQL injection vulnerability.",
      "Authentication Bypass: An attacker can forge a `_COOKIE['oozimsrememberme']` to gain administrative access without a password."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could bypass authentication and gain administrative access or leak sensitive database information.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The authentication bypass attack vector involves crafting and setting a specific cookie. The SQL injection attack vector involves injecting malicious code via the `_COOKIE['oozimsrememberme']` cookie.",
       "Both attacks are remotely exploitable."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities. No special privileges are required."
