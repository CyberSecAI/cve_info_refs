- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Pixie CMS application is vulnerable to blind SQL injection due to unsanitized input in the `pixie_user` parameter and the `Referer` header.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Blind SQL Injection
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can potentially extract sensitive data from the database by injecting SQL queries using boolean conditions within the vulnerable parameters, observing the time it takes for the server to respond (time-based blind SQL injection).
- **Attack vectors**: HTTP GET requests with a crafted `pixie_user` parameter or `Referer` header to the Pixie CMS application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Pixie CMS server. No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
