Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2011-4628:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The primary root cause is inadequate input sanitization and missing access controls within the TYPO3 Core application. This leads to multiple vulnerabilities including cross-site scripting (XSS), information disclosure, authentication delay bypass, unserialize() vulnerabilities, and missing access control.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Multiple instances of XSS vulnerabilities were found in the frontend, backend, and exposed API. These occur due to improper sanitization of URL parameters, usernames, content element links, page titles, and other user inputs.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The application leaks information through HTTP headers by responding differently to incorrect login credentials based on whether the username or password was wrong, also a backend user can view workspace changes for records in all languages.
*   **Authentication Delay Bypass:** The backend login authentication delay mechanism could be bypassed by a crafted request, allowing for faster brute-force attempts.
*   **Unserialize() vulnerability:** Special user input by backend editors was treated as serialized data which could allow an editor to delete arbitrary files on the system the webserver has access to.
*   **Missing Access Control:**  ExtDirect endpoints were not associated with TYPO3 backend modules, meaning access control wasn't enforced, and allowing arbitrary backend users to use any ExtDirect service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **XSS:** Allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into the web pages viewed by other users. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  Exposes sensitive system information that could be used to further compromise the system or users.
*   **Authentication Delay Bypass:** Could reduce the effectiveness of the login delay mechanism which was put in place to mitigate brute force attacks.
*  **Unserialize() vulnerability:**  Allows backend editors to delete arbitrary files on the webserver the application runs on.
*   **Missing Access Control:** Arbitrary backend users could consume any available ExtDirect endpoint service. This would lead to privilege escalation or unauthorized access to sensitive data and functions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** All identified attack vectors involve network-based attacks, where malicious requests are sent over the network to vulnerable components of the TYPO3 application.
*  **Crafted requests:** Malicious requests are crafted to exploit the vulnerabilities such as bypassing login delay.
*   **User Interaction:** Some XSS vulnerabilities require user interaction, such as tricking a user into opening a crafted content element or visiting the recycler after a malicious page has been deleted.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** Attackers need network access to reach the vulnerable TYPO3 instance.
*   **Authentication:** While some vulnerabilities can be exploited without authentication, some backend vulnerabilities require an authenticated backend user to exploit (although the authentication bypass vulnerability could be leveraged here).
*  **Crafting requests:** An attacker needs to craft specific requests to trigger the various vulnerabilities.
* **Some exploits requires tricking users**: Some XSS vulnerabilities require social engineering to trick a user into opening a malicious link or browsing to a specific page in the TYPO3 backend.

**Additional Notes**

* The vulnerability was fixed in TYPO3 versions 4.3.12, 4.4.9, and 4.5.4.
* The identified vulnerabilities cover multiple components of the TYPO3 core application, indicating a systemic issue with input sanitization and access control practices.
