Subject: Re: CVE request: 3 flaws in libobby and libnet6

Hi Vasiliy,

thanks for your report!

I have fixed the issues 1+3 in git [1,2]. It would be great if you could
confirm the patches to really fix the issues you raised.

As for the second issue, I do not think it is worth the effort to
implement SSL certificate handling in obby. Both net6 and obby are
replaced by libinfinity in the current development version of Gobby.
libinfinity makes use of SSL certificates.

We would be pleased if you could check for similar flaws in libinfinity
though I admit that it is much more code and probably more complicated
to analyze.

Cheers,
Armin

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=750636#c0)  Vincent Danen    2011-11-01 20:33:38 UTC  ``` Vasiliy Kulikov reported [1] that obby does not check a server's SSL certificate when connecting.  It also sends the password in plaintext form over the SSL channel.  An attacker able to perform a MITM attack on the connection could easily do so without discovery due to obby not checking the server's SSL certificate.  Note: if the client is Gobby, the reconnection attempt will require user interaction.  Upstream has indicated [2] that it is not worth the effort to implement SSL certificate checking in obby as it is deprecated by libinfinity, which is used by the development version of Gobby, so there is currently no fix for obby.
