# JRuby: Denial of service — GLSA **201207-06**

A hash collision vulnerability in JRuby allows remote attackers to
cause a Denial of Service condition.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-java/jruby** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.6.5.1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.6.5.1** |

### Background

JRuby is a Java-based Ruby interpreter implementation.

### Description

JRuby does not properly randomize hash functions to protect against hash
collision attacks.

### Impact

A remote attacker could send a specially crafted input, possibly
resulting in a Denial of Service condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All JRuby users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-java/jruby-1.6.5.1"

```
### References

Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

**oCERT-2011-003 multiple implementations denial-of-service via hash algorithm collision**

**Description**:

A variety of programming languages suffer from a denial-of-service (DoS)
condition against storage functions of key/value pairs in hash data structures,
the condition can be leveraged by exploiting predictable collisions in the
underlying hashing algorithms.

The issue finds particular exposure in web server applications and/or
frameworks. In particular, the lack of sufficient limits for the number of
parameters in POST requests in conjunction with the predictable collision
properties in the hashing functions of the underlying languages can render web
applications vulnerable to the DoS condition. The attacker, using specially
crafted HTTP requests, can lead to a 100% of CPU usage which can last up to
several hours depending on the targeted application and server performance, the
amplification effect is considerable and requires little bandwidth and time on
the attacker side.

The condition for predictable collisions in the hashing functions has
been reported for the following language implementations:
[Java](http://www.java.com),
[JRuby](http://jruby.org/),
[PHP](http://www.php.net/),
[Python](http://python.org/),
[Rubinius](http://rubini.us/),
[Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/).
In the case of the Ruby language, the 1.9.x branch is not affected
by the predictable collision condition since this version includes a
randomization of the hashing function.

The vulnerability outlined in this advisory is practically identical to the one
reported in 2003 and described in the paper
[Denial of Service via Algorithmic Complexity Attacks](http://www.cs.rice.edu/~scrosby/hash/CrosbyWallach_UsenixSec2003.pdf)

## Hash table implementations vulnerable to algorithmic complexity attacks

#### Vulnerability Note VU#903934

Original Release Date: 2011-12-28 | Last Revised: 2016-02-15

---

### Overview

Some programming language implementations do not sufficiently randomize their hash functions or provide means to limit key collision attacks, which can be leveraged by an unauthenticated attacker to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

### Description

| Many applications, including common web framework implementations, use hash tables to map key values to associated entries. If the hash table contains entries for different keys that map to the same hash value, a hash collision occurs and additional processing is required to determine which entry is appropriate for the key. If an attacker can generate many requests containing colliding key values, an application performing the hash table lookup may enter a denial of service condition.  Hash collision denial-of-service attacks were first [detailed](http://www.cs.rice.edu/~scrosby/hash/CrosbyWallach_UsenixSec2003.pdf) in 2003, but [recent research](http://www.nruns.com/_downloads/advisory28122011.pdf) details how these attacks apply to modern language hash table implementations. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An application can be forced into a denial-of-service condition. In the case of some web application servers, specially-crafted POST form data may result in a denial-of-service. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**Please review the Vendor Information section of this document for vendor-specific patch and workaround details. |
| --- |

| **Limit CPU time**Limiting the processing time for a single request can help minimize the impact of malicious requests.**Limit maximum POST size**Limiting the maximum POST request size can reduce the number of possible predictable collisions, thus reducing the impact of an attack. **Limit maximum request parameters**Some servers offer the option to limit the number of parameters per request, which can also minimize impact. |

Notified:  November 01, 2011  Updated: December 28, 2011

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

We have not received a statement from the vendor.

### Vendor Information

According to the n.runs AG advisory:
"CRuby and JRuby provide updates for this issue with a randomized hash function (CRuby 1.8.7-p357, JRuby 1.6.5.1, CVE-2011-4815)."

### Vendor References

### [The PHP Group](#DWAN-8PYMFT) Affected

Updated:  December 28, 2011

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

We have not received a statement from the vendor.

### Vendor Information

According to the n.runs AG advisory:
"PHP 5 uses the DJBX33A (Dan Bernstein's times 33, addition) hash function and parses POST form data into the $\_POST hash table. Because of the structure of the hash function, it is vulnerable to an equivalent substring attack."

From the Workarounds section:
"The easiest way to reduce the impact of such an attack is to reduce the CPU time that a request is allowed to take. For PHP, this can be configured using the max\_input\_time parameter."

PHP 5.4.0 RC4 has been released which adds a max\_input\_vars directive to help mitigate hash collision attacks. Please note that this is a release candidate, not a stable release.
