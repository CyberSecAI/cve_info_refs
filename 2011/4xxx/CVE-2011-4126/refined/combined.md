### Bug Description

Hello Calibre,

There are 5 separate vulnerabilities with the calibre SUID mount helper:

These vulnerabilities concern /src/calibre/devices/linux\_mount\_helper.c.

1. Ability to create root owned directory anywhere. The mount helper calls mkdir(argv[3], ...) on line 48.

2. Ability to remove any empty directory on the system. For example, line 172.

3. Ability to create and delete user\_controlled\_dir/.created\_by\_calibre\_mount\_helper anywhere on the filesystem, lines 55 and 165.

4. Ability to inject arguments into 'mount' being exec'd. On lines 78, 81, and 83, the final two arguments to mount are user controlled. On lines 1033, 106, 108, 139, and 141, the last argument to unmount/eject is user controlled. The "exists()" check can be subverted via race condition or by creating an existing file in the working directory with a filename equal to the desired injected argument.

5. Ability to execute any program as root. The mount helper makes use of execlp on lines 78, 81, 83, 103, 106, 108, 139, and 141, and the first argument does not start with a / character. Because of this, execlp will search PATH for the executable to run. PATH is user controlled, and thus it is trivial to write a program that spawns a shell and give it "mount" as a filename, and direct PATH to its directory. A proof of concept of this is attached.

Thanks,

Jason Donenfeld

I dont see how 1-3 are security vulnerabilities. 4 is a vulnerability only if

mount itself is vulnerable to command line injection. 5 is indeed a

vulnerability, but is neccesitated by the non uniformity of linux filesystems

(mount, eject can be located anywhere). 5 can be mitigated by first checking

for mount and eject in "standard" locations and only then trying all of PATH,

changes for that will be in the next release.

Oh, and I suppose there's a very obvious but critical #6:

6. An unprivileged user an mount/unmount/eject whatever he wants, with

root permissions. Danger.

Basically though, you shouldn't be using any suid executable at all. There's no place for it. It's not written correctly here, and there are lots of ways to avoid it entirely. In fact, Debian does the smart thing and strips yours out in favor of using a wrapper script around udisks: <http://pastebin.com/HyVrJJyg>

Regarding 1-3: certain programs might depend on the existence or lack of existence of a directory or file with a certain owner. The ability to add/remove a root owned directory/file anywhere on the system is most certainly a vulnerability of sorts.

You mean that a program designed to let an unprivileged user

mount/unmount/eject anything he wants has a security flaw because it allows

him to mount/unmount/eject anything he wants? I'm shocked.

Implement a system that allows an appilcation to mount/unmount/eject USB

devices connected to the system securely, then make sure that system is

universally adopted on every linux install in the universe. Once you've done that, feel free to

re-open this ticket.

"You mean that a program designed to let an unprivileged user

Unfortunately, sarcasm does not make you right. Yes, this is a critical security flaw, because anyone with calibre installed on their system now allows any user to gain root privileges by mounting on top of important directories. Just because your application allows this by design rather than by mistake doesn't make this less of a problem.

As for the other flaws identified, they represent violations of DAC (Discretionary Access Control). Essentially, if you can't design your setuid program in a way that does not grant additional unintended capabilities to unprivileged users (besides a carefully stated intended capability like "mount/umount/eject USB devices", then you shouldn't be using a setuid application.

There are already ways to safely achieve what you're trying to do without introducing security vulnerabilities. Ubuntu implements automatic mounting of USB media using udisks in conjunction with gvfs-gdu-volume-monitor. If this isn't an option, the "pmount" application allows users to safely mount and unmount removable media without introducing (obvious) security holes.

Sarcasm doesn't make me right, being right makes me right. The sarcasm was

just a bonus earned by the sanctimoniusness of the post I was responding to.

Like I said before. Develop a way of doing this THAT ACTUALLY WORKS ACROSS AS

MANY LINUX SYSTEMS AS THE CURRENT TECHNIQUE DOES. To re-emphasize that point

since you seemed to miss it the first time. It needs to work on \*every single

linux distro that the current technique works on\* not just version >= x of distro

y. If you can do so, feel free to re-open the ticket. If you cannot,

feel free to not use calibre or patch your

local install or ask your distro maintainer to patch it for you, replacing it

with whatever technique works for that distro.

The OP pointed out one legitimate area of concern, which I

have already committed a fix for.

You point out another, I have committed a fix for that as well.

Kindly do not lecture me about using a setuid exececutable. Shocking as that

may seem, I am actually aware of the dangers, and even if I weren't, rest

assured that plenty of your ancestors have pointed it out to me in the past

four years. Is it bad to have suid executables, yes. Is there a workable alternative, no.

Fun entertaining future ideas:

Mount over /root/.ssh. Mount over /home/special-user/.ssh.

"But the permissions!" you cry out.

So first you mount it like normal:

calibre-mount-helper mount overlay /path/to

Then the second time you remount with the uid settings you want:

touch -- '-ouid=1234,gid=1234,umask=345,remount'

calibre-mount-helper mount -ouid=1234,gid=1234,umask=345,remount /path/to

This is thanks to #4.

It is irresponsible and a disservice to your users to introduce security vulnerabilities onto their machines unless you have very explicitly and carefully documented to those users that installing your software introduces security risks.

Can you explain why pmount, which is supported at least on Debian, Ubuntu, Red Hat, Gentoo, Fedora, Slackware, SuSE, and CentOS, is an unacceptable alternative?

I didn't test it and I admit that I'm not a linux guru, but isn't the CALIBRE\_DEVELOP\_FROM environment variable feature sufficient to do anything (including getting root) on a linux system with calibre installed, as I can execute arbitrary python code with it?

Problems with pmount:

1) It does not work out of the box on all distros (it needs configuration)

2) It may not even be installed on some distros, for example, it isn't

installed by default on gentoo.

3) It has been deprecated in favor of udisks (which incidentally calibre tries

to use before falling back to the mount helper)

So, no, pmount is not a suitable replacement.

Fix committed for the latest exploit. Feel free to re-open if you find another

exploit based on 4.

There's still a symlink race condition. If at first the symlink points to /dev/something-legit or /media/something-legit, the symlink can be swapped easily by hooking into inotify's IN\_ACCESS and changing what it points to just in time for mount to be called with the s ymlink pointing someplace naughty. An example of the technique is presented here: <http://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/17932/> .

So, the vulnerability still stands.

Still unfixed. There are still exploitable race conditions present that allow you to mount whatever you want wherever you want.

For example, to mount a device not under /dev, simply provide an argv[2] referring to a symlink pointing to somewhere in /dev, and after the realpath()'d version is checked, switch the target to somewhere else. If you want to do this properly, you need to update the device source such that after calling realpath(), all subsequent references to the device are to the realpath()'d version.

The same trick can be applied to mount on top of arbitrary mountpoints (which is a local root hole). First mount something you can write to onto a mountpoint in /media, and then exploit the race condition similar to above (switching from a mountpoint within /media to anywhere you like).

Even without these critical bugs, being able to mount anything in /dev on top of anything in /media is not a good idea - pmount restricts this to removable devices or devices whitelisted in a configuration file (/etc/pmount.allow). And you've done nothing to address the previously mentioned abilities to play with creating and removing arbitrary directories/files. I strongly recommend giving up on implementing this yourself and instead creating a dependency on pmount or bundling it with your package (it's GPLv3, so it's license-compatible). It is very difficult to do what you want to do safely, and it is unacceptable to permit root privilege escalation vulnerabilities without documenting it.

I've already committed a fix for symlinks in /dev, maybe you missed my last

comment.

pmount will not work, I have told you why

it will not work. I am not going to repeat myself.

Let's recap:

First note that unprivileged users cannot create symlinks in /dev

on any well designed system. So symlink attacks are not actually

possible, nonetheless, I have already removed the possibility of using

symlinks under /dev.

calibre-mount-helper currently allows an unprivileged user to:

1) Delete empty directories only under /media. I see absolutely nothing wrong with

that.

2) Mount anything under /dev to anything under /media. Again I see nothing

wrong with that, outside of highly system specific scenarios. Feel free to

post a general purpose exploit, if you can come up with one, I can always fix

it.

3) Unmount anything under /media

4) Create empty directories anywhere on the system.

This can be fixed, with some effort, but I am not yet convinced

it is an actual vulnerability.

\*) Something else courtesy of a bug. If such a thing exists, point it out and

I will fix it.

Just a note about all the histrionics around "critical" security

exploits. calibre is designed to run mainly on end user computers (single

user, typically a desktop or a laptop). On such a machine if a malicous program

can run with user privileges it already has access to everything that actually

matters on the system, namely the user's data. Privilege escalation would be

useful only in trying to hide the traces of the intrusion. The damage is

already done. Undoubtedly there are plenty of scenarios where that is not

true, but the fact remains that for the vast majority of calibre users, this

is a non issue. So kindly tone down the hyperbole, and restrict your posts to

discussion of calibre-mount-helper, otherwise you will be ignored.

You've forgotten about /dev/shm.

And you still haven't fixed the ability to mount on top of any directory via symlinks, which has already been demonstrated to allow escalation to root.

Even if this is the case for the majority of calibre users, I wouldn't consider this acceptable unless there was a big flashing banner when you install calibre that says "if you install this every user can gain root privileges." There are plenty of multi-user environments, and plenty of situations where compromising a user account isn't as bad as gaining root access.

For the record, I'm not in any way attached to using pmount, I just wanted to pose it as a potential second choice. udisks is much better, is nearly universally supported amongst desktop Linux distributions, and is what Ubuntu and Debian currently use for this.

@Rosenberg: Yes, I have. And you were warned, this is the last response you

will get from me.

@Mike: Many distros replace calibre-mount-helper with something suitable for

the particular distros' disk handling strategy, and I encourage you to do the

same in Gentoo if you dont already do it (incidentaly I'm a Gento user). You

can actually do something as simple as replacing it with a bash script that

always returns an error code and does nothing else. Add udisks as a calibre

dependency and calibre will automatically use udisks via DBUS when available. This

will, of course, break for those users for whom udisks doesn't work for

whatever reason. Whether that is a large fraction of Gentoo users or not, only you

can judge. This discussion really applies only to the calibre binary download,

which does no dependency resolution and is intended to \*work out of the box\*

on a huge variety of linux systems. Unfortunately, linux has historically had

no universal way to handle removable disks without root access, neccessitating

the use of a suid executable.

This has been fun, but in case you're actually interested in fixing the problem, I am still willing to help.

One way to fix races with the mountpoint is to chdir into the mountpoint, stat "." and check ownership, and mount on top of ".". That way there's no risk of users changing components of the mountpoint path out from under you. If the chdir fails, give a non-descriptive error message that does not delineate between the cause of failure for the chdir (otherwise an attacker can use this to determine the existence of files and directories in search paths he can't navigate to).

To fix races with the mount source, you should check against /dev/shm, as this is the only world-writable directory in most /dev filesystems that I know of.

That would at least solve the two biggest problems here, and then we can move on to addressing the smaller ones.

Or more generally, stat and check root ownership and permission on the

You additionally could make sure it is a block device. You could also

check to see if the block device is removable / matches the identifier

of supported ebook readers / something else.

You could even go a step further and not call out to mount as an

external program, but make the syscalls yourself, dealing with the

handfuls of new problems you'll have and various mtab issues and who

(Of course, at this point, you might as well just be using

You additionally could make sure it is a block device. You could also

check to see if the block device is removable / matches the identifier

of supported ebook readers / something else.

You could even go a step further and not call out to mount as an

external program, but make the syscalls yourself, dealing with the

handfuls of new problems you'll have and various mtab issues and who

knows what else.

(Of course, at this point, you might as well just be using

pmount/udisks/microsoftwindows/whatever.)

It's way past my bedtime, so I'd appreciate it if you could post the patch to

mount-helper (by now you should be as familiar with the code as I am). If not,

I'll get to it tomorrow. And thanks for the help.

Unfortunately, the saga continues. Your /shm/ check doesn't do anything, because, as it turns out, because you realpath twice, I don't need to use /shm/ at all! Your code is still broken. Giving up should still be an option on the table for you. In case, however, you've become determined and still want to fix things, I've traced through the code for your recent commit showing you where and how things are broken.

/tmp/burrito is a file

argv[2] = /tmp/burrito

332 if (strncmp(action, "mount", 5) == 0) {

333 dev = realpath(argv[2], NULL);

dev = /tmp/burrito

334 if (dev == NULL) {

335 fprintf(stderr, "Failed to resolve device node.\n");

336 exit(EXIT\_FAILURE);

337 }

339 check\_dev(dev);

239 void check\_dev(const char \*dev) {

dev = /tmp/burrito

240 char buffer[PATH\_MAX+1];

241 struct stat file\_info;

242

243 if (dev == NULL || strlen(dev) < strlen(DEV)) {

244 fprintf(stderr, "Invalid arguments\n");

245 exit(EXIT\_FAILURE);

246 }

JUST BEFORE this next line, we modify /tmp/burrito so that it points to /dev/sda

/tmp/burrito = -->/dev/sda

247

248 if (realpath(dev, buffer) == NULL) {

249 fprintf(stderr, "Unable to resolve dev path\n");

250 exit(EXIT\_FAILURE);

251 }

buffer = /dev/sda

252

253 if (strncmp(DEV, buffer, strlen(DEV)) != 0) {

254 fprintf(stderr, "Trying to operate on a dev node not under /dev\n");

255 exit(EXIT\_FAILURE);

256 }

this last block passes!

257

258 if (stat(dev, &file\_info) != 0) {

259 fprintf(stderr, "stat call on dev node failed\n");

260 exit(EXIT\_FAILURE);

261 }

262

263 if (strstr(dev, "/shm/") != NULL) {

264 fprintf(stderr, "naughty, naughty!\n");

265 exit(EXIT\_FAILURE);

266 }

dev doesnt contain /shm/, since it's /tmp/burrito

267

268 if (!S\_ISBLK(file\_info.st\_mode)) {

269 fprintf(stderr, "dev node is not a block device\n");

270 exit(EXIT\_FAILURE);

271 }

stat follows the link, so it sees /dev/sda which is a block device, so this passes

272

273 }

:-)

As well, the problem presented in .70-Calibrer HAS NOT BEEN FIXED. You can still mount over /etc/pam.d or wherever due to the still existing race there. Implement the chdir logic that I've outlined above.

Then, just after this code block, change /tmp/burrito to point to anything -- any file image at all. No shm needed :-).

Please note that I misjudged just how broken this code is, and restricting /dev/shm is not enough to prevent from mounting arbitrary devices. I expect Jason will show you how.

Just so this is perfectly clear: what's happening in this bug report right now is a perfect example of how \*not\* to do security response. When faced with two people who clearly know a few things about secure coding, rather than taking their advice and actually fixing the root cause of the problem (or abandon it as a hopeless situation, which is probably the more appropriate response), you've chosen to waste our time by demanding that we write weaponized exploits to exploit what most people already know to be exploitable. To top it off, when shown repeatedly how your half-baked "fixes" don't actually fix anything, rather than taking our advice you just add another small hurdle that can be trivially bypassed. It would be sad if it weren't so funny.

I've decided that it's time to stop beating a dead horse. Usually I get paid good money to own software this hard, and I don't think you're worth making an exception. Best of luck, I'm sure you'll figure it out eventually.

Hello. I've attached a patch for you, as requested. It replaces the mount helper with the nice udisks-based script that ubuntu ships. For distributions that do not support udisks, they can add their own. Or, you can write something different. In light of this, you might consider removing the following text from your website: "Please do not use your distribution provided calibre package, as those are often buggy/outdated. Instead use the Binary install described below." Goodbye.

@Dan: As I suspected, you're in this not to contribute something to the community, but as a destructive influence. You will not be missed. Try and remember that I am not attempting to fix calibre-mount-helper for some sort of personal gain, but simply to allow people using calibre to have the best possible experience. I readily admit I don't know as much about secure coding as you do, but hey, at least one of us is trying to learn something. Look back at the start of this bug report. Every time I was convinced of the existence of an actual exploit, I have attempted to fix it. Maybe my fixes were naive, but dont forget that it's a lot easier to find holes in something, than to build somethig without holes in the first place.

@Jason: Indeed, I did overlook the second realpath call, now fixed.

Yet you continue to ignore some major advice about how to fix it. Have you chdir'd yet? No. Still vulnerable.

My final word is that you should give up trying to reinvent the wheel, and use a method supplied by the distro for mounting disks. It's not worth my time to play whack-a-mole here. As Dan said, "Usually I get paid good money to own software this hard, and I don't think you're worth making an exception." Indeed.

The solution is easy and obvious, but it involves backing away from stubbornness and accepting that the distro-supplied tools handle mounting inline with distro policy, and it isn't your place to reinvent things. Take a look at Gentoo Mike's post from a while back -- it's dead on. Besides, you haven't even begun to address issues #1-#3.

I believe this discussion is over. Goodbye Kovid. I wish you well with Calibre and that you can restore the security confidence of your users.

I keep trying to leave this bug report but I keep getting dragged in. It's worse than Twitter.

"As I suspected, you're in this not to contribute something to the community, but as a destructive influence. You will not be missed."

You seriously think I came to this thread to start a fight with you? What about the several \*hundred\* other security bugs I've fixed in open source software on my own free time?

"Every time I was convinced of the existence of an actual exploit, I have attempted to fix it."

Except for the part where I posted a working exploit and you completely ignored me.

"Maybe my fixes were naive, but dont forget that it's a lot easier to find holes in something, than to build somethig without holes in the first place."

I disagree, I think it's more like "it's easier to do something properly from the beginning than to patch a broken implementation one exploit at a time."

Your code is still broken, you can mount a legitimate block device on top of another directory in /dev by exploiting the mountpoint race that still exists, and then use that now-writable directory in /dev to mount an arbitrary filesystem on top of wherever. I suggest you accept Jason's patch and stop trying to fix this code.

@Jason: Well, if you do not wish to help, that leaves me with no choice but to

remove the mount helper. I think it's a pity, for those people for whom

device detection in calibre will stop working out of the box. But, I tried, to

the best of my ability. I had hoped that we could work together to make it a

possibility, but, apparently not.

Closing bug as fix released (currently I only have the energy to add an exit()

at the start of main, the full removal will have to wait for a good nights

sleep).

Your behavior toward Dan is confusing, as he has been cordial and informative. There is nothing to suggest he has been a "destructive influence" in any of his posts. It was you who first showed attitude toward both Dan and Jason in posts #7 and #9, the consequences being a bug report that has now received a lot of attention elsewhere for the wrong reasons.

@Dan:

Right.

In other words, mount /dev/sdaX to /dev/newfolder using the race condition exploited in .70-calibrer. Then build the stager in /dev/newfolder/home/username/whatever. Then use the race exploited in .80-calibrer to toggle whatever between being a symlink to /dev/sda and being the stager.

The tricks are endless.

OKAY GOODBYE BUGREPORT.

@Dan: You were on my ignore list, which meant I never saw your exploit (I

interact with launchpad via email). I only saw it when Jason mentioned it in a

post of his. If I had seen it earlier, I would have attempted to fix it. See

for instance my posts asking Jason for news on an updated exploit.

And for someone not trying to pick a fight, you certainly succeeded.

"it's easier to do something properly

from the beginning than to patch a broken implementation one exploit at

a time."

Now if only we had a working time travel machine. Given that in the now we

have a broken implementation, our options are:

1) Try to fix it, one exploit at a time.

2) Re-write it from scratch. Since the only one volunteering to do any

re-writing was me, I don't see how that would have improved matters at all.

@preston:

Well, let me say that if I was the one that first showed attitude, I

apologize. But you have to remember that I do \*all\* calibre bug triage (besides

doing a large part of the developement). I get to deal with lots of bug

reports from people, the vast majority of which are dubious at best. In

Jason's original post, only one of his five flaws seemed serious to me (the one

he attached an exploit for), so that is the one I fixed. It turned out I was

wrong about the mount exploit, but, from my perspective, I don't know Jason

from Adam, and he has to convince me of the seriousness of his claims, merely

saying they are serious is something I will ignore, from long and exhausting

experience. When he did prove its seriousness to me, I tried to fix it, as

best I could.

You may well ask why I didn't just take his advice and abandon the mount

helper. For me to do something that drastic, I must be convinced it is indeed

the best course possible. That may make me stubborn at times, but it is also

the attitude that ensures calibre remains as stable as possible.

I understand that you have a full plate, but your initial reaction was not just to question the legitimacy of the exploits but to dismiss them as sanctimonious when people kept insisting that the issues were more severe than you assumed. However, that you are apologetic is to be respected.

I agree with Preston. Discussion rapidly devolved from the beginning into accusations thrown around. Everybody is in a bad mood when they report bugs and when they receive bugs. Extra care must be taken by everyone to avoid inflammation. It would be helpful if the folks involved apologized, backed up and tried again.

What I would suggest to move forward is to see if anyone would like to volunteer to do the work on a rewrite. The discussion has been focused on patching and breaking the existing implementation and arguing if it can be done better. Nobody was ever asked for volunteers for a rewrite and that sort of discussion scares volunteers away.

@kovid What you can do now, as project owner, is create a branch and let people try and write a secure, cross platform capable mounter. You don't have to do much more than provide the branch and answer questions about the implementation as needed. Most of your job will be to stay out of the way. Let the volunteers work on their problem and see where it goes.

@Jason & @Dan & others: Would you be willing to work on a cross platform mounter, either for calibre or as a 3rd party tool/library calibre could use?

As I have already said, in a previous response, I would be delighted if

someone developed a zero config library that worked across linux distributions

and BSDs to mount USB devices. What's needed is that it allow:

1) The mounting of any USB block device identified by device node

   to a mountpoint under /media

2) ejecting of any USB block device and the removal of the corresponding

mountpoint under /media

3) It needs to be embeddable in a self contained distribution like calibre. In

particular this means it must not require the application developer to tweak

it, as such tweaking introduces the possibility of security holes.

However, let me emphasize that these functions are already performed adequately

in modern linux distributions by udisks. An implementation of such a library

in python has been present in calibre in udisks.py for years. This reduces the

incentive of people to work on a solution approporiate to older distributions.

That is regrettable, but unavoidable. Personally, I doubt any such library

will ever be developed. Given the difficulties of dealing with paths securely,

the easiest route to developing it, via calls to mount and eject is closed.

Which means you would essentially have to re-implement mount and eject with

additional logic to allow unprivileged users access to certain classes of

device. That is a huge task.

At this point, people on older distributions will just have to manage their

devices manually. I have taken my best shot at it, and failed. Someone else is

more than welcome to pick up the gauntlet. A library like this has to be self

contained, so development of it should not be part of a larger project like

calibre.

I was quite concerned and excited when I learned that I've got calibre-mount-helper and saw these exploits getting lot of attention. my initial instinct was to uninstall calibre. Call me paranoid but it questions the security of the rest of the package as well. So I tested one of them:

 .50 version.

 Didn't work, then I tried .60 and .70. didn't work as well. I was disappointed.

I was curious so I tried:

$ cat /usr/bin/calibre-mount-helper

And this is what I got:

#!/bin/sh

# This is a dummy script shipped in the fedora calibre package.

# Since we have better/safer/easier ways to mount mass storage devices

# there's no need to have a suid binary try and do this.

# This script simply exits telling calibre that the device is already

# been mounted by your desktop.

exit 1

Thats when I remembered why I like Fedora.

@Fou-Lu - Please, grow up. With much difficulty, he has removed the broken functionality/exploitable code.

@Thorsten - I have /media on FreeBSD 8.2. That's where KDE likes to mount things for me.

@Kovid - HAL was deprecated on linux, but not on BSD. Instead the issues in HAL were fixed, and the HAL we have on BSD is much improved compared with whatever HAL was last developed in the Linux kernel. As far as I can tell, GIO is working fine with HAL on my system, though I can't say I've done any programming with it; I've always found it sufficient to mount/unmount manually using the dolphin file browser. As it sounds like many distros have already been specifically patching your application before distributing it in their repos, perhaps it would be good to survey what various package managers are doing on Fedora, Debian/Ubuntu, FreeBSD (it's in ports...), OpenSuse, etc. Perhaps a consensus can be found that you've overlooked.

Or maybe "a single binary that works everywhere without compiling" solution just isn't appropriate for the unix world. Certainly I make sure my users have a very good reason for installing anything from upstream sources on our network. If somethings in the repositories/ports collection, then there better be something seriously wrong with it to allow upgrading from somewhere else. I can certainly remember a few cases where the upstream developer was feigning ignorance while carefully crafting network security holes which package maintainers dutifully patched, until the project was finally excluded from the repos.

As calibre user I want it to work out of the box, but I would prefer having to execute it as root every time just to have its full features, rather than giving every user on the system the ability of become root. I agree with ravomavain on this, gksu is the way to go.

The mount helper was only used if udisks is not present. calibre still works out of the box on the vast majority of modern Linux distros.

Adding support for gksu would require dependencies (and the inclusion) on GTK, PolicyKit and gksu-polkit. I don't see it being very likely that a distro that does not support udisks will support all of the requirements for gksu. Remember the mount helper was only a fall back when better methods (udisk) was not present.

Also calibre is a Qt project. A Qt (not GTK) solution would make more sense.

While I fully agree that any form of vulnerability should be fixed, I think many here are doing Kovid wrong.

a) He is providing the currently greatest piece of software for ebook management for free, donating large portions of his free time into the project

b) Giving full support here and on the mobileread.com forum

c) Has the full right to be proud of his work and initially doubt and/or question vulnerability reports from an unknown source

d) Has shown that he is willing to learn and improve once he was convinced that people like Dan Rosenberg and Jason A. Donenfeld are really experts in their profession and know what they are talking about

The three main actors (Kovid, Dan, Jason) had a very emotional and kind of non-constructive start (for me attributable to all three - no offence meant) but it turned to the better. Kovid initially being very usability minded while Dan and Jason being completely security minded they came to a more mutual understanding during this discussion.

And given the nature of a discussion, defending once position until being convinced is just normal. Exaggerated and insulting comments like "treating users with disrespect", "I will uninstall Calibre...", "Perfect example of how not to react to bug reports" are neither appropriate nor justified.

From my side a big "thumbs up" for Kovid, Dan and Jason and many thanks for your contributions to the Open Source world.

Kind regards

It is secure. If you had read any of the number of posts where multiple people have said that the mount helper (the insecure component) is now removed you would realize this.

Please correct me if I'm wrong,

even if you have a modern distro with udisks, if you installed calibre via the official binary install, which is recommended in the website ("Please do not use your distribution provided calibre package, as those are often buggy/outdated. Instead use the Binary install described below. ") then calibre-mount-helper gets installed automatically even if udisks is present. Doesn't matter if calibre uses it or not. Every user that followed that advise is now vulnerable to privilege escalation.

@Neo139, That's why the mount helper has been removed. It introduces a security vulnerability so the issue is resolved by not installing it on users systems going forward. Just like with any other program a user will need to update to take advantage of security fixes.

Gentlemen, Kovid fixed this bug by removing the component (which was the right way to do it). I expect he's going to release the fixed version very soon and then everyone who updates will be safe - regardless of using a distro package or the binary installer.

Can we let this go now?

I am quite surprised how long this thread has gotten.

I side with Kovid. I admire him for doing this app. Because ever since Red Hat 7 or 8 I keep reading on the open source (not free software!) forums something along the lines of „if you need it — go build it, now p\*\*\* off as we're doing something cool”. He has gotten up and wrote this which is quite unique at the moment. Also he bothers to keep it updated quite often while most of the open source projects (including corporate backed Open Office for example) stagnate.

I also admire him for not playing the racism card. From what I gather most of you come from the so–called western world, and in my life of working for outsourced companies I've seen quite a few orientals supporting their lack of education, language and coding skills with this. This is the best he can do. If you can do better, please help him patch it.

I do agree that he has an „interface” problem, which is more than obvious in his forum postings on mobileread. To my shame I admit I do not know much more than tasted a few curry dishes about his culture. Just try to put yourself in his shoes. Maybe what comes up after a translation as rude, harsh or plain stupid may just be sound normal to him. And attacking him just because of a misunderstanding can just make things worse.

Maybe posting an „unsafe app” label might help. Most probably just diasabling some functions would make more people mad than those who would be happy. Myself I'm sure I'd be split between the two. Also, maybe reading closer the software licence as of „no liability whatsoever” would make people more aware. Maybe just by signing Kovid Goyal should be enough of a warning. He could have posted as Jon Johnson just as well.

He has gotten up and wrote this which is quite unique at the moment. Also he bothers to keep it updated quite often while most of the open source projects (including corporate backed Open Office for example) stagnate.
I also admire him for not playing the racism card. From what I gather most of you come from the so–called western world, and in my life of working for outsourced companies I've seen quite a few orientals supporting their lack of education, language and coding skills with this. This is the best he can do. If you can do better, please help him patch it.
I do agree that he has an „interface” problem, which is more than obvious in his forum postings on mobileread. To my shame I admit I do not know much more than tasted a few curry dishes about his culture. Just try to put yourself in his shoes. Maybe what comes up after a translation as rude, harsh or plain stupid may just be sound normal to him. And attacking him just because of a misunderstanding can just make things worse.
Maybe posting an „unsafe app” label might help. Most probably just diasabling some functions would make more people mad than those who would be happy. Myself I'm sure I'd be split between the two. Also, maybe reading closer the software licence as of „no liability whatsoever” would make people more aware. Maybe just by signing Kovid Goyal should be enough of a warning. He could have posted as Jon Johnson just as well.

Now that calibre-mount-helper has been removed, shouldn't the install script look for it and remove it? That way folks that upgrade won't end up with a dangling copy? Or do I misunderstand how the install/upgrade process goes?

# [The Calibre Bug](#the-calibre-bug)

A few weeks ago, I posted an exploit and a bug report for a Linux local root exploit in Calibre. The author, Kovid Goyal, became incensed, and rather than work with me to fix it, he insulted my colleagues and me. After each one of his fixes, I released a new exploit breaking the latest. It got a lot of social media hype, and was kind of a big deal. After several days of media frenzy and bad publicity, the stubborn developer finally bent to the advice of the chorus of leading security researchers, and the mount helper was removed in entirety. In any case, the exploits show some neat race condition tricks that you might want to check out, using inotify and a toggler.

Subject: CVE request for Calibre

Hello,

There are 5 separate vulnerabilities with the calibre SUID mount
helper, with each possibly requiring a different CVE, or perhaps two
can be clumped together:

These vulnerabilities concern /src/calibre/devices/linux_mount_helper.c
[http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~kovid/calibre/trunk/view/head:/src/calibre/devices/linux_mount_helper.c](http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~kovid/calibre/trunk/view/head%3A/src/calibre/devices/linux_mount_helper.c)

1. Ability to create root owned directory anywhere. The mount helper
calls mkdir(argv[3], ...) on line 48.

2. Ability to remove any empty directory on the system. For example, line 172.

3. Ability to create and delete
user_controlled_dir/.created_by_calibre_mount_helper anywhere on the
filesystem, lines 55 and 165.

4. Ability to inject arguments into 'mount' being exec'd. On lines 78,
81, and 83, the final two arguments to mount are user controlled. On
lines 1033, 106, 108, 139, and 141, the last argument to unmount/eject
is user controlled. The "exists()" check can be subverted via race
condition or by creating an existing file in the working directory
with a filename equal to the desired injected argument.

5. Ability to execute any program as root. The mount helper makes use
of execlp on lines 78, 81, 83, 103, 106, 108, 139, and 141, and the
first argument does not start with a / character. Because of this,
execlp will search PATH for the executable to run. PATH is user
controlled, and thus it is trivial to write a program that spawns a
shell and give it "mount" as a filename, and direct PATH to its
directory.

These have been reported in bug 885027 for the Calibre project.

Thanks,
Jason

### [Calibre and setuid](/Articles/465311/)

By **Jake Edge**
November 2, 2011

Programs that regular users can run with root privileges (i.e. setuid
programs) are
tricky to write correctly, which is why they are best avoided whenever
possible. But there are, of course, things that users need to be able to
do that require privileges (changing passwords is a canonical
example), which is why the setuid/setgid facility exists in Unix. When the
need arises, however, a great deal of care should be taken before writing
and releasing a program that is meant to be installed as setuid (aka SUID).
A recent
[bug report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/calibre/%2Bbug/885027) for
the Calibre e-book reader shows the kinds of problems that can come about
if proper care is not exercised.

Jason Donenfeld reported several bugs in the setuid
calibre-mount-helper program to
the project's
Launchpad bug tracker on
November 1. Essentially, the program is meant to allow Calibre users to
mount various removable devices (like e-book readers connected
via USB) to update the content on readers. Unfortunately, it suffered from
five separate problems that Donenfeld reported, some of which could be
easily used as a local privilege escalation—to root.

The problems themselves read like a laundry list of things *not* to do
in a setuid program including not sanitizing user input, not setting the
PATH environment variable before calling exec(), and not
sanity checking arguments. It's not completely surprising that
Calibre got these things wrong, as they are fairly common programming
mistakes. For programs running with a user's privileges, those kinds of
errors typically just lead to bugs of various sorts (some of which could
have fairly catastrophic consequences for the *user*, but not the
system as a whole). For setuid programs, though, errors like those can
lead to very serious security holes—as they did here.

Something that was a bit surprising was the combative tone that Calibre's
lead developer Kovid Goyal took in the comments on the bug. Rather than
working with Donenfeld to see what the problems were, he dismissed most of
the bugs as invalid. Even after Donenfeld tried to further point out the
problems, Goyal was rather sarcastic in [response](https://bugs.launchpad.net/calibre/%2Bbug/885027/comments/7):
You mean that a program designed to let an unprivileged user
mount/unmount/eject anything he wants has a security flaw because it allows
him to mount/unmount/eject anything he wants? I'm shocked.

The proof-of-concept that Donenfeld posted with the bug—fairly
snarky in tone, which may not have helped—clearly showed how to exploit
the lack of PATH sanitization to get root privileges, but didn't
demonstrate a different reported problem with argument injection to the
mount
program. That particular problem results from not sanitizing the user
input and passing it on to mount. The other three problems
(arbitrary root-owned directory creation, arbitrary empty directory
removal, and creating .created\_by\_calibre\_mount\_helper files
anywhere in the filesystem) are going to be harder to exploit, but they
certainly aren't capabilities that regular users should have.

Goyal fixed the PATH issue immediately, but didn't see the
argument injection problem, and therefore didn't fix it. Dan Rosenberg [pointed
out](https://bugs.launchpad.net/calibre/%2Bbug/885027/comments/8) that there was still a bug:
Unfortunately, sarcasm does not make you right. Yes, this is a critical security flaw, because anyone with calibre
installed on their system now allows any user to gain root privileges by
mounting on top of important directories. Just because your application
allows this by design rather than by mistake doesn't make this less of a
problem.

In addition, Rosenberg suggested that there were safer ways to allow users
to mount removable media, rather than writing a setuid application specific
to Calibre. Once again, though, Goyal takes the combative approach. He
committed a [fix](http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~kovid/calibre/trunk/revision/10777)
(though it doesn't really solve the problem) for the problem of
"mounting on top of
important directories", but [seems
affronted](https://bugs.launchpad.net/calibre/%2Bbug/885027/comments/9) by the bug comments:
Sarcasm doesn't make me right, being right makes me right. The sarcasm was
just a bonus earned by the [sanctimoniousness] of the post I was responding
to.

Part of the problem is that Goyal is looking for a single solution to the
mounting problem that works "on \*every single
linux distro that the current technique works on\* not just version >= x of distro
y". While that complaint has some merit, it is hardly an excuse to
introduce security holes into the system. Though Goyal claims to be aware
of the "dangers" of setuid programs, the code in
calibre-mount-helper does not really bear that out.

In fact, Donenfeld quickly came back with an [example
exploit](https://bugs.launchpad.net/calibre/%2Bbug/885027/comments/10) that routed around Goyal's fix.
The fix just disallows mounting in /usr, /bin, or
/sbin, but Donenfeld's example mounts a /etc filesystem
(with a chosen root password in passwd), thus allowing the user to
log in as root. Obviously, /etc can be added to the disallowed list,
but that becomes something of an arms race. A whitelisting approach might
be more reasonable, but a better solution would be to use the
distribution-supplied mechanisms for mounting the e-book readers. Those
solutions should have had most of the obvious (and some non-obvious)
problems shaken out, though there is no universal cross-distribution
mechanism as Goyal would like to see.

As Donenfeld [points
out](https://bugs.launchpad.net/calibre/%2Bbug/885027/comments/5), Debian does not install the mount helper, and instead uses a
wrapper script around udisks. Fedora also [avoids](/Articles/465347/) the mount helper. Judging from this [bug
report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/calibre/%2Bbug/561958), Ubuntu has picked up the Debian fix as well. It is unclear
whether any of those distributions made an effort to get the word out about
the problem or get a fix upstream. openSUSE [seems](https://build.opensuse.org/package/view_file?file=calibre.spec&package=calibre&project=home%3Alemmy04&srcmd5=a22a569f66485210a2ea36c62c868efd)
to install calibre-mount-helper, however, and various other distributions may as
well. In
any case, anyone who picks up the source package and installs it
*will* get the program installed as a setuid binary
in /opt/calibre/bin.

Writing secure code is hard. Programmers tend to focus on what they are
trying to accomplish, rather than all of the different ways the program can
be abused. That's not an excuse, but it is an explanation of sorts.
Distributions and users should be especially vigilant about setuid programs
that come in from packages that, arguably anyway, shouldn't need them.
Projects should probably also try to engage with folks that report security
problems, rather than attacking them.

As of this writing, the Calibre trunk is still vulnerable to the example
exploit that Donenfeld posted. One would expect to see a fix for it soon,
and that any distributions that install calibre-mount-helper to
issue updates. Users that have it installed from source may want to
investigate using a wrapper script or other means to disarm the bug until
the fix is made, at least on shared machines.

## Brief items

### [Security quotes of the week](/Articles/465382/)

Key signing events are boring.

-- [Alan
Cox](https://plus.google.com/111104121194250082892/posts/MqW2pfXmd4x#111104121194250082892/posts/MqW2pfXmd4x) forgets "mind-numbingly"

People often say to me "well, don't you know why this is happening to you?" and I reply that while we may all speculate, I have been refused official answers. The little official correspondence I received said it was probably a mistake. It took months and they assure me that things will be better someday, probably. I've been detained multiple times since that letter, both in the U.S. and abroad. The DHS won't share a copy of my files with me or my lawyers. It says that I have no right to know what is in them.

The redress letter suggests that even though nothing is wrong, I'll still be selected for "random" screenings. Consider what they tell us of safety and justice, and ask yourself: is it possible that a system full of such obvious and casual dishonesty will provide it?

-- Tor developer (and Wikileaks supporter) [Jacob
Appelbaum](http://boingboing.net/2011/10/31/air-space-a-trip-through-an-airport-detention-center.html) gets another "random" airport security screening

Security experts have said that RSA wasn't the only corporation victimized
in the attack, and that dozens of other multinational companies were
infiltrated using many of the same tools and Internet infrastructure. But
so far, no one has been willing to talk publicly about which other
companies may have been hit. Today's post features a
never-before-published list of those victim organizations. *The information
suggests that more than 760 other organizations had networks that were
compromised with some of the same resources used to hit RSA.* Almost 20
percent of the current Fortune 100 companies are on this list.

### [Blaze: Key escrow from a safe distance](/Articles/465127/)

Mat Blaze has published [a look back at the
clipper chip controversy [PDF]](http://www.crypto.com/papers/escrow-acsac11.pdf) for an upcoming conference. It is a
good retrospective of a crucial moment in the crypto wars. "And so
even before the Web became synonymous with the Internet, before a single
bit of encrypted SSL traffic was generated, lines were being drawn for what
would become an epic battle that would preoccupy a generation of cryptographers. (And it was a bad time for that community to be preoccupied;
this was the same time that the basic foundations of the of web and other
critical communications technologies were designed and put into
place. We've been living with the security, or lack of security, built in
to that infrastructure ever since)."

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Created**: | October 31, 2011 | **Updated**: | May 29, 2012 |
| **Description**: | From the Debian advisory: Paul McMillan, Mozilla and the Django core team discovered several vulnerabilities in Django, a Python web framework: CVE-2011-4136: When using memory-based sessions and caching, Django sessions are stored directly in the root namespace of the cache. When user data is stored in the same cache, a remote user may take over a session. CVE-2011-4137, CVE-2011-4138: Django's field type URLfield by default checks supplied URL's by issuing a request to it, which doesn't time out. A Denial of Service is possible by supplying specially prepared URL's that keep the connection open indefinitely or fill the Django's server memory. CVE-2011-4139: Django used X-Forwarded-Host headers to construct full URL's. This header may not contain trusted input and could be used to poison the cache. CVE-2011-4140: The CSRF protection mechanism in Django does not properly handle web-server configurations supporting arbitrary HTTP Host headers, which allows remote attackers to trigger unauthenticated forged requests. | | |
