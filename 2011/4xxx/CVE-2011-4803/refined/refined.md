Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the identified vulnerability:

* **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress plugin "wptouch" is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized input in the `id` parameter within the `ajax.php` file.

* **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    * **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, which allows an attacker to manipulate database queries by injecting malicious SQL code through the `id` parameter.

* **Impact of exploitation:**
    * An attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to the database.
    * An attacker can retrieve sensitive data, modify, or delete data within the database
    * An attacker could execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to full control of the application's database.

* **Attack vectors:**
    * The vulnerability is exposed through the `ajax.php` file within the `wptouch` plugin directory.
    * The attack is performed through HTTP GET requests, with the malicious SQL code injected into the `id` parameter.

* **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    * The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
    * The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint (`/wp-content/plugins/wptouch/ajax.php`).
    * No specific privileges are required beyond being able to send HTTP requests to the application.
    * Basic knowledge of SQL and SQL injection techniques are needed.

**Additional details:**

* The provided exploit examples show various SQL injection payloads, including:
    * `id=-1; id=- AND SLEEP(5) or 1=if` (time-based blind SQL injection)
    * `id=-1][CURRENT_USER()` (retrieving database user)
    * `id=-1][SELECT (CASE WHEN ((SELECT super_priv FROMmysql.user WHERE user='None' LIMIT 0,1)='Y') THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)` (checking for super privileges)
    * `id=-1][MID((VERSION()),1,6)` (retrieving database version)
* The vulnerability can be exploited using tools like SQLMap.
