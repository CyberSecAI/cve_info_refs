Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2011-4788:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a combination of a directory traversal flaw and a default account issue within the web interface of the HP StorageWorks P2000 G3 system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Directory Traversal:** The web interface, listening on TCP port 80, has a directory traversal vulnerability. This allows an attacker to access arbitrary files on the system by manipulating the URI.
*   **Default Account:** The system's password file contains a default login credential that an attacker can use to authenticate to the device's management interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The primary impact is the ability for a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.
*   **Full System Access:**  Successful exploitation of both vulnerabilities allows attackers to perform any administrative tasks on the device.
*   **Data Access:** The directory traversal flaw allows attackers to read sensitive files.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerabilities are exploitable remotely over the network via the web interface (port 80).
*   **HTTP Requests:**  The attack is carried out through crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable web interface, leveraging the directory traversal flaw and default credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** Attackers need network access to the vulnerable HP StorageWorks P2000 G3 system.
*   **No Authentication:**  Initial access to the directory traversal vulnerability does not require authentication. Exploitation of the default account vulnerability requires no previous knowledge of credentials.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability was publicly disclosed by the Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) on January 12, 2012, without a patch available at the time, adhering to their 180-day disclosure policy.
*   HP released a security bulletin on January 13, 2012, confirming the vulnerability and recommending disabling HTTP/HTTPS management and applying the TS230P008 firmware update.
*   Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers were protected by Digital Vaccine protection filter IDs ['361', '1125', '2400'].
