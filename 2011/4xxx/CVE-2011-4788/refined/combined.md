| TREND MICRO CUSTOMER PROTECTION | Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID ['361', '1125', '2400']. For further product information on the TippingPoint IPS: <http://www.tippingpoint.com> |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of HP MSA 2000 G3. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaws exists within the web interface listening on TCP port 80. There exists a directory traversal flaw that can allow a remote attacker to view any file on the system by simply specifying it in the default URI. Additionally, the pasword file contains a default login that can be used to authenticate to the device. This can be leveraged by a remote attacker to perform any tasks an administrator is able to. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | This vulnerability is being disclosed publicly without a patch in accordance with the ZDI 180 day deadline.  -- Mitigation:HP states that a patch for this vulnerability will be made available to the public "soon." Until that time, it is recommended that administrators of StorageWorks systems restrict access to the web interface on 80/tcp to authorized hosts only. |

  Reference              Base Vector             Base Score
CVE-2011-4788    (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:P/A:P)       9.0
===========================================================
             Information on CVSS is documented
            in HP Customer Notice: HPSN-2008-002

RESOLUTION

The vulnerability can be resolved by the following procedure:

Disable the array's HTTP and HTTPS network management services (Note: This will also \
disable all management access from a Web browser. Array management access may be \
maintained via Command Line Interface [CLI].) Use the instructions outlined in the \
Workaround section below to disable the HTTP and HTTPS network management services.

Install TS230P008 firmware as soon as possible. If the HTTP and HTTPS network \
management services have been previously disabled, the services may be re-enabled as \
the issue is fully resolved in TS230P008 firmware.

TS230P008 firmware installation and workaround instructions:

Go to <http://www.hp.com/support/storage>

Under Disk Storage Systems, click P2000/MSA Disk Arrays .

Click HP P2000 G3 MSA Array Systems , then click Download drivers and software .

Select your product and operating system.

Click Firmware - Storage Controller .
In the Description column of the table, click the title of the firmware:

To download the firmware, click Download .

To read the release notes, click the Release Notes tab.

Note: If you have trouble finding your product, drivers, or software, use the Product \
Search function from <http://www.hp.com/support/downloads> and enter your product \
number.

Before running the TS230P008 Smart Component, verify that both the telnet and FTP \
options are enabled on the array to allow the Smart Component to run successfully.

Workaround

Disable the HTTP/HTTPS service protocols:

Note:

Disabling the HTTP/HTTPS services will disable the Storage Management Utility (SMU), \
including Web access to manage the system. All management must be performed by CLI \
telnet. If the system can not be accessed through CLI telnet, upgrade the system to \
TS230P008 to resolve this issue.

Any scripts requiring HTTP or HTTPS access will no longer function with HTTP or HTTPS \
disabled.

To disable the HTTP/HTTPS service protocols, enter the following command at the CLI \
prompt:

# set protocols http disabled https disabled
Success: Command completed successfully.

The HTTP and HTTPS services must be re-enabled to resume SMU access.

To re-enable the HTTP or HTTPS protocols, enter the following command at the CLI \
prompt:

# set protocols http enabled https enabled
Success: Command completed successfully.
