Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-4024:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of input sanitization in the OCS Inventory NG agent. Specifically, the agent sends data to the server, and the server and admin panel do not properly control or sanitize this received data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The primary vulnerability is a persistent XSS. Malicious HTML/JavaScript code injected through the OCS agent is stored and then displayed in the admin panel, leading to the execution of the injected script each time the affected data is viewed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Session Hijacking:** Successful exploitation can lead to session hijacking, enabling an attacker to gain control of an administrator's session.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the admin panel, leading to various malicious actions.
- **Other malicious activities:** The attacker can perform any action they want through the compromised session.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **OCS Agent:** The attack vector is the OCS agent, which sends computer inventory data to the server.
- **Malicious Input:** An attacker can inject malicious HTML/JS by modifying the computer description field (e.g., in Windows XP: System Properties > Computer Name > Computer Description).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to modify computer information:** The attacker needs to be able to modify the computer description field on a system that has the OCS agent installed.
- **Access to OCS server:** The attacker does not need access to the OCS server or to the admin panel.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Nicolas DEROUET.
- The vulnerability affects OCS Inventory NG versions 2.0.1 and prior.
- The exploit has been tested successfully on OCS Agent 2.0.1 (WinXP SP3) and OCS Server 2.0.1 (Windows).
- The provided exploit targets the computer description field, but other fields might be vulnerable as well.
- The recommended solution is to upgrade to OCS Inventory NG 2.0.2 or later versions.
