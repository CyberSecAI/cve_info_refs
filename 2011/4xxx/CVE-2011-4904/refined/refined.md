Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2011-4904:

**Root Cause:**

The primary root cause across multiple vulnerabilities is the failure to properly sanitize user inputs or implement adequate access controls in various parts of the TYPO3 CMS. This lack of proper input sanitization and access control leads to multiple vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

The following vulnerabilities are present in TYPO3 Core:

1.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Frontend:**
    *   Failing to sanitize URL parameters in the "JSwindow" property of the `typolink` function allows for XSS attacks.

2.  **Information Disclosure in Backend:**
    *   Different HTTP headers are sent based on whether the username or password is wrong during authentication attempts.

3.  **Authentication Delay Bypass in Backend:**
    *   The backend login delay for failed authentication attempts can be bypassed using a crafted request.

4.  **Multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Backend:**
    *   Failing to sanitize user inputs in several backend components, including usernames, content element link attributes, page titles in the recycler, and page titles in `tcemain` flash messages leads to XSS vulnerabilities.

5.  **Information Disclosure in Backend (Workspaces):**
    *   Backend users (editors) can view workspace changes for records in all languages, even those they lack access to.

6. **Information Disclosure in Backend (getText):**
     * Using "getText" feature on content element headlines allows to retrieve arbitrary data from TYPO3 database, due to insecure configuration in css\_styled\_content system extension.

7.  **Unserialize() vulnerability in Backend:**
    *   Special user input from backend editors is treated as serialized data and deserialized by TYPO3, potentially allowing for arbitrary file deletion on the web server.

8.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Exposed API:**
    *   The `RemoveXSS` function fails to sanitize an attack vector that works in Internet Explorer 6.

9.  **Missing Access Control in Exposed API (ExtDirect):**
    *   `ExtDirect` endpoints lack association with TYPO3 backend modules. Thus, arbitrary backend users can consume any available `ExtDirect` endpoint service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

The impact of exploiting these vulnerabilities varies:

*   **XSS:** Allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, potentially leading to session hijacking, credential theft, or defacement.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can gain access to sensitive information about the system, user credentials, or other data.
*   **Authentication Delay Bypass:** Enables faster brute-force attacks on backend logins.
*    **Unserialize() vulnerability:** Allows for arbitrary file deletion on the web server.
*   **Missing Access Control:** Enables arbitrary backend users to consume any available `ExtDirect` endpoint service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Frontend XSS:**  Manipulating URL parameters.
*   **Backend Vulnerabilities:** Requires access to the TYPO3 backend, either as a regular user, editor, or in some cases, through crafted requests.
*   **Exposed API Vulnerabilities:** Exploitation through the TYPO3 API, potentially without requiring full backend access but with knowledge of available services.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Frontend XSS:** No specific user privileges required.
*   **Backend Information Disclosure and Authentication Bypass:** No specific privileges are required.
*   **Backend XSS and Unserialize():** Requires some level of access to the backend.
*   **ExtDirect Missing Access Control:** Requires backend access, but not necessarily to the module providing a particular service.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerabilities affected TYPO3 versions 4.3.11 and below, 4.4.8 and below, and 4.5.3 and below.
*   The fixes were released in TYPO3 versions 4.3.12, 4.4.9, and 4.5.4.
*   The provided content also mentions a workaround for the frontend XSS if the "realurl" extension is used with "doNotRawUrlEncodeParameterNames" set to FALSE.
*   The security advisory highlights that changes made to headline rendering need careful review after applying the update.
*   The advisories also strongly recommend following the guidelines in the "TYPO3 Security Cookbook" and subscribing to the `typo3-announce` mailing list.
