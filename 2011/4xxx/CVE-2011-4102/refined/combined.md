How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=773726#c0)  Vincent Danen    2012-01-12 17:46:22 UTC  ``` Laurent Butti discovered that Wireshark failed to properly check record sizes for many packet capture file formats.  It may be possible to make Wireshark crash by convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace file.  This is corrected in upstream 1.4.11 and 1.6.5.  <http://www.wireshark.org/security/wnpa-sec-2012-01.html>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=773726#c1)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2012-01-13 06:19:53 UTC  ``` Created wireshark tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 781268](show_bug.cgi?id=781268 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2012-0041 CVE-2012-0042 CVE-2012-0043 CVE-2012-0066 CVE-2012-0067 CVE-2012-0068 wireshark various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=773726#c2)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2012-01-17 07:23:52 UTC  ``` This CVE includes fixes for 6 upstream issues (bugs), details as follows:  1. <https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=6663> This is a type cast issue, caused because of casting an unsigned int to signed int.  In the unfixed version this would throw an exception which the application would catch, but leave it in an unstable state. The patch makes sure that the value passed was less than G_MAXINT Patch: <http://anonsvn.wireshark.org/viewvc?view=revision&amp;revision=40164>  2. <https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=6666> 5Views file format DoS due to request to allocate too large a buffer size. Normally glib should terminate the application with something like "GLib-ERROR **: gmem.c:239: failed to allocate 3221228094 bytes" Resolved by clamping the value of packet_size Patch: <http://anonsvn.wireshark.org/viewvc?view=revision&amp;revision=40165>  3. <https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=6667> Same problem and solution but with i4b capture format now Patch: <http://anonsvn.wireshark.org/viewvc?view=revision&amp;revision=40166>  4. <https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=6668> Same problem and solution but with iptrace capture format. Also some checks for bad file format. Patch: <http://anonsvn.wireshark.org/viewvc?view=revision&amp;revision=40167>  5. <https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=6669> Similar issue with netmon file format. Patch: <http://anonsvn.wireshark.org/viewvc?view=revision&amp;revision=40168>  6. <https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=6670> Similar issue with netmon file format. Patch: <http://anonsvn.wireshark.org/viewvc?view=revision&amp;revision=40169>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=773726#c3)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2012-01-17 07:45:20 UTC  ``` So there are three distinct categories in which these flaws fall:  1. Type-cast error: Caused because of casting unsigned to signed int (ws [bug 6663](show_bug.cgi?id=6663 "CLOSED WORKSFORME - Installer fails to upgrade 6.0 to 6.1.")). This leaves the app in an unstable state.  2. Application crash/Dos because of trying to allocate too large a buffer size (ws [bug 6666](show_bug.cgi?id=6666 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - Cannot Install RedHat From DOS Fat Extended Partitions"), 6667, 6669). Integer underflow causing too large buffer to be allocated and a crash (ws [bug 6668](show_bug.cgi?id=6668 "CLOSED RAWHIDE - cryptdir script broken in RH 6.1")).  3. Memory corruption (buffer-overflow) when reading novell capture file format. glibc however detects this and terminates the application (ws [bug 6670](show_bug.cgi?id=6670 "CLOSED RAWHIDE - During upgrade, smb.conf was removed and not backed up"))   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=773726#c4)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2012-01-20 05:33:05 UTC  ``` Based on:  [http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.oss.general/6656/focus=6755](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.oss.general/6656/focus%3D6755)  This issue is split into 4 parts. This bug is being used for [CVE-2012-0041](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-0041) which can be described as:  A typecast flaw was found in the way wireshark casted an unsigned int to signed int. In the unfixed version this would throw an exception which the application would catch, but leave it in an unstable state. The patch makes sure that the value passed was less than G_MAXINT  Patch: <http://anonsvn.wireshark.org/viewvc?view=revision&amp;revision=40164> Bug: <https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=6663>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=773726#c6)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2012-01-20 06:52:24 UTC  ``` This issue affects the version of wireshark shipped with Fedora 15 and Fedora 16 and has been addressed in the following security advisories:  <https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/wireshark-1.4.11-1.fc15> <https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/wireshark-1.6.5-1.fc16>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=773726#c7)  Fedora Update System    2012-01-22 22:52:37 UTC  ``` wireshark-1.6.5-1.fc16 has been pushed to the Fedora 16 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=773726#c8)  Fedora Update System    2012-01-24 20:00:56 UTC  ``` wireshark-1.4.11-1.fc15 has been pushed to the Fedora 15 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=773726#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-04-23 16:52:46 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2012:0509 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0509.html>   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=773726#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-01-08 05:00:42 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2013:0125 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0125.html>   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=773726#c14)  Huzaifa S.

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A0125)

## Topic

Updated wireshark packages that fix several security issues, three bugs,
and add one enhancement are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Wireshark, previously known as Ethereal, is a network protocol analyzer. It
is used to capture and browse the traffic running on a computer network.

A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way Wireshark handled
Endace ERF (Extensible Record Format) capture files. If Wireshark opened a
specially-crafted ERF capture file, it could crash or, possibly, execute
arbitrary code as the user running Wireshark. (CVE-2011-4102)

Several denial of service flaws were found in Wireshark. Wireshark could
crash or stop responding if it read a malformed packet off a network, or
opened a malicious dump file. (CVE-2011-1958, CVE-2011-1959, CVE-2011-2175,
CVE-2011-2698, CVE-2012-0041, CVE-2012-0042, CVE-2012-0066, CVE-2012-0067,
CVE-2012-4285, CVE-2012-4289, CVE-2012-4290, CVE-2012-4291)

The CVE-2011-1958, CVE-2011-1959, CVE-2011-2175, and CVE-2011-4102 issues
were discovered by Huzaifa Sidhpurwala of the Red Hat Security Response
Team.

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* When Wireshark starts with the X11 protocol being tunneled through an SSH

connection, it automatically prepares its capture filter to omit the SSH
packets. If the SSH connection was to a link-local IPv6 address including
an interface name (for example ssh -X [ipv6addr]%eth0), Wireshark parsed
this address erroneously, constructed an incorrect capture filter and
refused to capture packets. The "Invalid capture filter" message was
displayed. With this update, parsing of link-local IPv6 addresses is fixed
and Wireshark correctly prepares a capture filter to omit SSH packets over
a link-local IPv6 connection. (BZ#438473)

* Previously, Wireshark's column editing dialog malformed column names when

they were selected. With this update, the dialog is fixed and no longer
breaks column names. (BZ#493693)

* Previously, TShark, the console packet analyzer, did not properly analyze

the exit code of Dumpcap, Wireshark's packet capturing back end. As a
result, TShark returned exit code 0 when Dumpcap failed to parse its
command-line arguments. In this update, TShark correctly propagates the
Dumpcap exit code and returns a non-zero exit code when Dumpcap fails.
(BZ#580510)

* Previously, the TShark "-s" (snapshot length) option worked only for a

value greater than 68 bytes. If a lower value was specified, TShark
captured just 68 bytes of incoming packets. With this update, the "-s"
option is fixed and sizes lower than 68 bytes work as expected. (BZ#580513)

This update also adds the following enhancement:

* In this update, support for the "NetDump" protocol was added. (BZ#484999)

All users of Wireshark are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
which contain backported patches to correct these issues and add this
enhancement. All running instances of Wireshark must be restarted for the
update to take effect.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
