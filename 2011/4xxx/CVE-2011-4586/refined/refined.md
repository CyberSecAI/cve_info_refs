Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2011-4586:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input within the calendar module when constructing HTTP response headers, which allows for the injection of malicious data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- CRLF injection
- HTTP response splitting

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can inject arbitrary headers into the HTTP response, potentially leading to:
  - Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by injecting JavaScript code.
  - Session hijacking by injecting cookie-setting headers.
  - Cache poisoning by injecting modified cache directives.
  - Other malicious activities by controlling the HTTP response.

**Attack Vectors:**
- By manipulating request headers to inject newlines (\r\n) and additional header fields.
- Specifically, the vulnerability exists in `/calendar/set.php`
