{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the 'message_id' parameter, before including it in the HTML output. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - CWE-79",
        "Improper Input Validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious scripts that can be executed in the context of a user's browser. This can lead to session hijacking, data theft, or defacement of the website.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The attacker sends a crafted POST request to `/plesk-billing/admin/index.php/default` with a malicious script in the 'message_id' parameter."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. The attacker does not need to be logged in as the vulnerability occurs during the login process.",
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability occurs in the /plesk-billing/admin/index.php/default page. The scanner was able to inject a script into a URL encoded POST input message_id. The script payload used was: '\"()&%1<ScRiPt >prompt(XXXXXX)</ScRiPt>' where 'XXXXXX' is an id that changes with each request, this indicates that the input is being used in the response. The response from the server is a 400 bad request as it appears the server detects the invalid input. This suggests that while the server is not directly executing the code, it is still vulnerable to XSS as the payload is not encoded before being added to the page, meaning the payload would be executed on a successful response.\n\nThis vulnerability is present for a logged in user which could be an Admin, Reseller or User."
