Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the phpMyAdmin setup interface. Specifically, crafted values entered into the setup interface can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS. This occurs because user-supplied input is not correctly sanitized when displayed in the setup interface.
*   **Configuration Directory Writeability:** If the configuration directory is writeable, the XSS payload can be saved to this directory, potentially leading to persistent XSS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the phpMyAdmin setup interface.
*   If the configuration directory is writeable, the XSS payload could be saved, leading to persistent XSS, which will affect other users who visit the configuration page..
*   Successful exploitation would allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.
*   The documentation warns against having a writeable configuration directory.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the setup interface of phpMyAdmin.
*   An attacker needs to craft malicious input and provide it through the setup interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs access to the phpMyAdmin `/setup` interface.
*   The attacker needs to be able to supply crafted values through the setup form.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is considered non-critical.
*   The XSS only targets users who visit the /setup page.
*   The vulnerability affects phpMyAdmin versions 3.4.x
*   The solution is to upgrade to phpMyAdmin 3.4.9 or newer.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Jason Leyrer and Robert Foggia of Trustwave SpiderLabs.
*   The vulnerability is tracked by CVE-2011-4782.
*   CWE-661 and CWE-79 are related to the vulnerability
