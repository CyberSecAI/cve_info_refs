    "impact": "An attacker can create or overwrite arbitrary files, potentially leading to privilege escalation by overwriting system libraries. If a file already exists, the permissions of the overwritten file are preserved; however, if a file does not exist, it will be created with root ownership and be writable by both root and the user executing the exploit (e.g., 'nobody').",
