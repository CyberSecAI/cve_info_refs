{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The command line interface (CLI) for administration was not working when IP blocking was enabled.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The system's IP blocking mechanism interfered with the functionality of the CLI.",
      "The design creates a conflict between security measures (IP blocking) and system administration (CLI access)."
    ],
    "impact": "The CLI could not be used for administrative tasks, potentially hindering system management and maintenance.",
    "attack_vectors": "This is not directly an attack vector, but a system administration conflict. An attacker could exploit the inability to use the CLI if system administrators rely on it for critical security updates.",
    "required_capabilities": "No specific attacker capabilities are required. System administrators, however, would be unable to use the CLI when IP blocking is enabled."
  },
  "additional_notes": "The fix involves resolving the conflict between the CLI and the IP blocking feature. A workaround was to avoid CLI usage or disable IP blocking, but this reduces overall security."
