The provided content includes a report from xss.cx detailing multiple vulnerabilities in SmarterStats Web Server version 6.x (6.2.4100). This includes stored and reflected XSS, cleartext password submission, autocomplete enabled on password field, cross-domain referer leakage and incorrect content types. CVE-2011-4751 is listed as one of the vulnerabilities, but the report itself does not explicitly identify which issue is related to this CVE. However, given the report includes multiple XSS issues, it is highly likely CVE-2011-4751 is related to one of these.

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   **Root cause:**  The `ctl00$MPH$txtName_SettingText` parameter, submitted to various URLs such as `/Client/frmCustomReportItem.aspx`, `/Client/frmCustomReport.aspx`, and `/Client/frmFavoriteReport.aspx`, is not properly sanitized. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that is stored and then executed when a user views the affected pages.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Lack of input sanitization and proper HTML encoding of user-supplied data.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary JavaScript execution within the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, credential theft, and other malicious actions.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Sending a crafted POST request containing the malicious payload to the vulnerable endpoints. The injected payload is stored and then reflected on other pages when accessed by the victim.
    *   **Required Capabilities:**  The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoints, and the user would need to visit the page where the stored payload is reflected.

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   **Root cause:** The `ctl00$MPH$txtName_SettingText` parameter on `/Client/frmFavoriteReport.aspx` is reflected unsafely into the HTML response, enabling JavaScript injection.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Lack of input sanitization and proper HTML encoding of user-supplied data.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary JavaScript execution within the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, credential theft, and other malicious actions.
    *    **Attack Vectors:**  Crafting a URL with the malicious payload, and the user would need to visit the crafted URL
    *   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to create a malicious link and trick a user to open it.

*   **Cleartext Submission of Password:**
    *   **Root cause:** The login page (`/login.aspx`) submits the password field (`ctl00$MPH$txtPassword`) over an unencrypted HTTP connection.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Lack of transport layer encryption (HTTPS).
    *   **Impact:**  Passwords can be intercepted by network attackers.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** An attacker with access to the network traffic can easily capture the transmitted password.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Network access to monitor traffic.

*   **Password Field with Autocomplete Enabled:**
    *   **Root cause:** The password field on the login page (`/login.aspx`) has autocomplete enabled.
    *   **Weaknesses:**  The browser may store user credentials, and an attacker with access to the user's computer could potentially retrieve them.
    *   **Impact:** Local or remote compromise can lead to credential theft.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Local or remote access to user computer.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Physical or remote access to user computer.

*   **Cross-Domain Referer Leakage:**
    *   **Root cause:** The application sends the URL with a query string to external domains within `frmGettingStarted.aspx`.
    *   **Weaknesses:**  Sensitive information in the URL is leaked in the `Referer` header.
    *   **Impact:** Potential information disclosure to untrusted domains, particularly if the query string contains sensitive data.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**  Following links to external domains on the specified page.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Simply loading the affected page and clicking the links, or having the browser pre-load these URLs.

*   **Cookie without HttpOnly Flag Set:**
    *  **Root cause:**  The cookie "loginsettings" lacks the HttpOnly flag.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Client-side scripts can potentially access the cookie value.
    *   **Impact:** Increased risk of cookie theft via XSS attacks.
    *    **Attack Vectors:** A successful XSS attack can potentially lead to cookie theft.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** A successful XSS attack.

*  **Incorrect Content Type:**
    *   **Root cause:** The application returns HTML content with a `text/plain` Content-Type header.
    *   **Weaknesses:** The browser might interpret the response incorrectly potentially leading to security issues when combined with user-controlled data.
    *   **Impact:**  Unexpected browser behaviour.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Direct access to affected pages.
    *   **Required Capabilities:**  Simply loading the affected pages.

The report includes detailed HTTP requests and responses demonstrating the vulnerabilities, particularly for the Stored and Reflected XSS issues. These include the exact URLs, parameters, and payloads used to exploit the flaws.

Given the multiple XSS issues and the report's explicit mention of CVE-2011-4751, it can be concluded that CVE-2011-4751 is likely related to one of the identified XSS vulnerabilities within SmarterStats.
