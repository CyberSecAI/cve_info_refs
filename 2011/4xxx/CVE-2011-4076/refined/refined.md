  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The OpenStack Nova EC2 API returned the EC2_SECRET_KEY (password) in the error message when the provided EC2_ACCESS_KEY (username) was invalid.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Information Exposure",
      "Insecure error handling"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could obtain the EC2_SECRET_KEY by providing an incorrect signature to the EC2 API, leading to potential unauthorized access to resources.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-middle attacks if the communication channel is not properly secured (e.g., using HTTP or not verifying HTTPS certificates).",
      "Brute-force attempts against the EC2_ACCESS_KEY to trigger the error and reveal the secret key."

    "required_attacker_capabilities": "Ability to make requests to the OpenStack Nova EC2 API; knowledge of or ability to brute-force valid EC2_ACCESS_KEY.",
        "additional_details": "The issue was discovered due to how exceptions were handled during authentication. The server would return the user information (including secret key) as part of an error message, which is insecure."
