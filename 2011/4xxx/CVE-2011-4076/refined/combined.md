| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=749385#c0)  Mark McLoughlin    2011-10-26 21:22:05 UTC  ``` From:   [https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/868360](https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/%2Bbug/868360)   If the secret key doesn't match for the ec2 request, the exception  passed back to the user, showing the correct password.   To replicate:  # export EC2_ACCESS_KEY='oomNAG3AGwnlKDAM9gFe'  # export EC2_SECRET_KEY='anything'  # euca-describe-instances  [...]  InvalidSignature: Invalid signature   w6q++6lcvoEcBkcQuT1yNDURSpM8tq3a+WbhYeKWuX4= for user   User('nova', 'nova', 'oomNAG3AGwnlKDAM9gFe', 'eXTMGYDx7FhSI7ng3YfE', True).  i.e. the correct password is leaked back to the user if the incorrect password is given  CVE 2011-4076 is reserved for the issue   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=749385#c1)  Mark McLoughlin    2011-10-26 21:26:36 UTC  ``` Although a serious security issue, it's actually quite unlikely anyone has Fedora 16 OpenStack deployed in a hostile environment - the default configuration does no password checking for this API and we haven't even written any instructions for configuring, or test cases for testing, the API with authentication enabled   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=749385#c2)  Mark McLoughlin    2011-10-26 21:28:04 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=749385#c1)) > Although a serious security issue, it's actually quite unlikely anyone has > Fedora 16 OpenStack deployed in a hostile environment  Obviously, I forgot to include "*yet*" - we may well see such deployments, but I don't think any exist yet   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=749385#c3)  Mark McLoughlin    2011-10-26 21:44:26 UTC  ``` Proposing as a F16 freeze exception since going ahead and shipping with such a security issue in a Fedora 16 Feature seems like a bad idea  <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/OpenStack>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=749385#c4)  Fedora Update System    2011-10-26 21:45:35 UTC  ``` openstack-nova-2011.3-6.fc16 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 16. <https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/openstack-nova-2011.3-6.fc16>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=749385#c5)  Adam Williamson    2011-10-27 06:28:48 UTC  ``` is this stuff actually on the dvd and included in any kind of selectable package set? if not, it really doesn't make much difference whether it 'makes the release' or goes out as an update.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=749385#c6)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-10-27 08:46:04 UTC  ``` The CVE identifier of [CVE-2011-4076](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-4076) has been assigned to this issue: [1] <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/10/25/4>  Note: Wasn't sure if security response bug is necessary also for       upcoming F-16 packages. Will know next time, thanks for       dealing with this one.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=749385#c7)  Adam Williamson    2011-10-28 19:35:39 UTC  ``` Discussed at 2011-10-28 NTH review meeting. Rejected as NTH as openstack is not on any release media so this can safely be fixed with a 0-day update, it does not need to go through the freeze.   ``` |  |

### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.
Needs triage

Seconded. Had I known that Purl would take off I would have added it to the original *CVE* JSON specification I wrote.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

FWIW I'm getting a proper vulnerability management team in place so that such issues are not overlooked (and left rotting) in the future.

Ubuntu 11.04 and 10.10 are in universe, but Dave Walker gave me the ack to patch these (natty applied with some fuzz, maverick did not apply for \_\_init\_\_.py, but did for auth/manager.py, which should be enough to close the vulnerability).

In terms of priority, I've discussed this with others (including an EC2 expert). The EC2\_ACCESS\_KEY is effectively a username and the EC2\_SECRET\_KEY is effectively a password. The EC2\_ACCESS\_KEY is not generally discoverable and hard to enumerate without brute forcing and is not typically shared, so most people should be ok. That said, if someone set their EC2\_URL to http or used a toolkit that used https but did not perform certificate verification (an unfortunately common practice), then the EC2\_ACCESS\_KEY could be revealed and the EC2\_SECRET\_KEY acquired. As such, leaving this as 'High'.

Don't leak exceptions out to users

Fixed [bug 874472](/bugs/874472)

Exceptions can contain all kinds of sensitive information, including

    SQL queries (and arguments), configuration information and in some

    cases the correct password ([bug 868360](/bugs/868360)). The information isn't useful

    to users, so don't return potentially sensitive information. The

    exceptions still get logged for debugging and troubleshooting purposes.

| **Description** | OpenStack Nova before 2012.1 allows someone with access to an EC2\_ACCESS\_KEY (equivalent to a username) to obtain the EC2\_SECRET\_KEY (equivalent to a password). Exposing the EC2\_ACCESS\_KEY via http or tools that allow man-in-the-middle over https could allow an attacker to easily obtain the EC2\_SECRET\_KEY. An attacker could also presumably brute force values for EC2\_ACCESS\_KEY. |

Ubuntu 11.04 and 10.10 are in universe, but Dave Walker gave me the ack to patch these (natty applied with some fuzz, maverick did not apply for \_\_init\_\_.py, but did for auth/manager.py, which should be enough to close the vulnerability).

In terms of priority, I've discussed this with others (including an EC2 expert). The EC2\_ACCESS\_KEY is effectively a username and the EC2\_SECRET\_KEY is effectively a password. The EC2\_ACCESS\_KEY is not generally discoverable and hard to enumerate without brute forcing and is not typically shared, so most people should be ok. That said, if someone set their EC2\_URL to http or used a toolkit that used https but did not perform certificate verification (an unfortunately common practice), then the EC2\_ACCESS\_KEY could be revealed and the EC2\_SECRET\_KEY acquired. As such, leaving this as 'High'.

Don't leak exceptions out to users

Fixed [bug 874472](/bugs/874472)

Exceptions can contain all kinds of sensitive information, including

    SQL queries (and arguments), configuration information and in some

    cases the correct password ([bug 868360](/bugs/868360)). The information isn't useful

    to users, so don't return potentially sensitive information. The

    exceptions still get logged for debugging and troubleshooting purposes.

OpenStack Nova before 2012.1 allows someone with access to an
EC2\_ACCESS\_KEY (equivalent to a username) to obtain the EC2\_SECRET\_KEY
(equivalent to a password). Exposing the EC2\_ACCESS\_KEY via http or tools
that allow man-in-the-middle over https could allow an attacker to easily
obtain the EC2\_SECRET\_KEY. An attacker could also presumably brute force
values for EC2\_ACCESS\_KEY.
