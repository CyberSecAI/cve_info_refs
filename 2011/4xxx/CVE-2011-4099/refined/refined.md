Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-4099:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `capsh` program, when using the `--chroot` option, fails to change the current working directory to `/` after executing the `chroot()` system call. This leaves the current working directory outside the chroot jail.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insecure use of `chroot`: The `capsh` tool does not properly set the working directory after calling `chroot`, allowing an attacker to potentially escape the chroot environment.
- Missing `chdir("/"):`  The absence of a `chdir("/")` after the `chroot()` call is the core weakness, which violates the expected behavior of a chroot jail.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Chroot escape: An application launched within the chroot using `capsh --chroot` could potentially break out of the restricted chroot environment. This allows the process to access resources outside of the chroot.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Command line execution: An attacker would need to use the `capsh` command with the `--chroot` option.
- Running malicious applications: An attacker could launch a malicious application using the vulnerable `capsh --chroot` command which can then escape the chroot jail.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to execute the `capsh` command, with the `--chroot` option, and have control over the execution of applications within the chroot.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in the `capsh` program provided by the `libcap` package.
- The fix involves adding a `chdir("/")` call after the `chroot()` call in the `capsh` program.
- This issue was addressed in `libcap-2.16-5.5.el6` which was released as part of the RHSA-2011:1694 advisory.
- The vulnerability has a "Low" severity rating.
-  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5 are not affected by this vulnerability.
