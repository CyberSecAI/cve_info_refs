Package        : openssl
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-4108 CVE-2011-4109 CVE-2011-4354
                 CVE-2011-4576 CVE-2011-4619

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in OpenSSL, an implementation
of TLS and related protocols.  The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following vulnerabilities:

CVE-2011-4108
	The DTLS implementation performs a MAC check only if certain
	padding is valid, which makes it easier for remote attackers
	to recover plaintext via a padding oracle attack.

CVE-2011-4109
	A double free vulnerability when X509_V_FLAG_POLICY_CHECK is
	enabled, allows remote attackers to cause applications crashes
	and potentially allow execution of arbitrary code by
	triggering failure of a policy check.

CVE-2011-4354
	On 32-bit systems, the operations on NIST elliptic curves
	P-256 and P-384 are not correctly implemented, potentially
	leaking the private ECC key of a TLS server.  (Regular
	RSA-based keys are not affected by this vulnerability.)

CVE-2011-4576
	The SSL 3.0 implementation does not properly initialize data
	structures for block cipher padding, which might allow remote
	attackers to obtain sensitive information by decrypting the
	padding data sent by an SSL peer.

CVE-2011-4619
	The Server Gated Cryptography (SGC) implementation in OpenSSL
	does not properly handle handshake restarts, unnecessarily
	simplifying CPU exhaustion attacks.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed
in version 0.9.8g-15+lenny15.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 0.9.8o-4squeeze5.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 1.0.0f-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your openssl packages.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=757909#c0)  Vincent Danen    2011-11-28 22:55:03 UTC  ``` It was reported that OpenSSL 0.9.8g (only in the 32-bit build) was vulnerable to a bug where, in extremely rare instances, the bug would cause incorrect computation of finite field operations when using NIST elliptic curves P-256 or P-384.  This flaw could allow for the retrieval of a TLS server's private key.  A paper was published [1] describing the attack.  There are some very specific pre-requisites for a successful attack:  - OpenSSL 0.9.8g (32-bit build) - use of NIST elliptic curve P-256 and/or P-384 - the use of ECDH family ciphers and/or the use of ECDHE family ciphers *and* the lack of SSL_OP_SINGLE_ECDH_USE context option  This bug is corrected in OpenSSL >= 0.9.8h and does not affect earlier versions of OpenSSL than 0.9.8g.  A series of patches [2] fix this upstream (starting with r.1.15).  [1] <http://eprint.iacr.org/2011/633> [2] <http://cvs.openssl.org/rlog?f=openssl%2Fcrypto%2Fbn%2Fbn_nist.c>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=757909#c3)  Tomas Hoger    2011-11-29 14:50:05 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=757909#c0)) > A series of patches [2] fix this upstream (starting with r.1.15). >  > [2] <http://cvs.openssl.org/rlog?f=openssl%2Fcrypto%2Fbn%2Fbn_nist.c>  Related upstream bug report: <http://rt.openssl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=1593&user=guest&pass=guest>  which indicated last related revision is 1.20 / 1.21, i.e. mentioned series of patches should include following commits:  <http://cvs.openssl.org/chngview?cn=16985> <http://cvs.openssl.org/chngview?cn=17029> <http://cvs.openssl.org/chngview?cn=17030> <http://cvs.openssl.org/chngview?cn=17077> <http://cvs.openssl.org/chngview?cn=17078> <http://cvs.openssl.org/chngview?cn=17081> <http://cvs.openssl.org/chngview?cn=17085>  Cumulative bn_nist.c patch:  <http://cvs.openssl.org/filediff?f=openssl/crypto/bn/bn_nist.c&v1=1.14&v2=1.21>   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=757909#c12)  Vincent Danen    2011-11-29 21:21:11 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect the versions of openssl as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they did not include support for the ECDH or ECDHE ciphers.   ``` |  |

#### Paper 2011/633

### Practical realisation and elimination of an ECC-related software bug attack

B. B. Brumley, M. Barbosa, D. Page, and F. Vercauteren

##### Abstract

We analyse and exploit implementation features in OpenSSL version 0.9.8g which permit an attack against ECDH-based functionality. The attack, although more general, can recover the entire (static) private key from an associated SSL server via $633$ adaptive queries when the NIST curve P-256 is used. One can view it as a software-oriented analogue of the bug attack concept due to Biham et al. and, consequently, as the first bug attack to be successfully applied against a real-world system. In addition to the attack and a posteriori countermeasures, we show that formal verification, while rarely used at present, is a viable means of detecting the features which the attack hinges on. Based on the security implications of the attack and the extra justification posed by the possibility of intentionally incorrect implementations in collaborative software development, we conclude that applying and extending the coverage of formal verification to augment existing test strategies for OpenSSL-like software should be deemed a worthwhile, long-term challenge.

**Note:** Updated to include details of invalid curve attack

Subject: CVE-2011-4354 OpenSSL 0.9.8g (32-bit builds) bug leaks ECC private
 keys

This issue is tracked by CVE-2011-4354. It is publicly disclosed.

Vulnerability description
===========================
The openssl-dev mailing list thread

<http://marc.info/?t=119271238800004>

describes a bug affecting 32-bit builds of OpenSSL 0.9.8g. In extremely
rare instances, it causes incorrect computation of finite field operations
when using NIST elliptic curves P-256 or P-384.

Exploiting said bug, we designed and implemented an attack that recovers a
TLS server's private key. As far as we are aware, this is the first public
exploitation of the bug.

The bug is fixed in OpenSSL >= 0.9.8h and a series of patches is available
to resolve it for version 0.9.8g starting from check in version 1.15 at

<http://cvs.openssl.org/rlog?f=openssl%2Fcrypto%2Fbn%2Fbn_nist.c>

As a more generic countermeasure to these types of attacks, we implemented
coordinate blinding as a patch to the OpenSSL source, available on the
openssl-dev mailing list at

<http://marc.info/?l=openssl-dev&m=131194808413635>

You can find our manuscript describing the attack at

<http://eprint.iacr.org/2011/633>

and our proof-of-concept code to verify the attack at

<http://crypto.di.uminho.pt/CACE/>

Vulnerability prerequisites
===========================
REQUIRED:

- OpenSSL 0.9.8g (32-bit build)

One or more of:
- Use of curve P-256
- Use of curve P-384

One or more of:
- Use of ECDH family ciphers
- Use of ECDHE family ciphers *and* lack of SSL_OP_SINGLE_ECDH_USE context
option

Ubuntu 9.10 Karmic ships with OpenSSL 0.9.8g and we verified the attack
against it.
Debian 5.0 Lenny ships with OpenSSL 0.9.8g and, although we did not verify
the attack, the code suggests it is vulnerable.
We verified the attack against stunnel 4.43 (linked against OpenSSL
0.9.8g) configured to use an ECDH cipher and P-256.
Our methods do not seem to be effective for attacking OpenSSH: their
implementation strictly uses ephemeral ECDH keys.

Vulnerability impact
===========================
The attack allows recovery of a TLS server's private key.
For ECDH family ciphers, this is the long term private key of the public
key in a certificate.
For ECDHE family ciphers, this is the private key of the per application
instance's ECDH ephemeral-static public key.
The attack is remote and in that sense only requires observing the result
(success or failure) of repeated attacker-initiated TLS handshakes.
