The provided content discusses multiple vulnerabilities in Plesk Parallels Panel, including CVE-2011-4725 through CVE-2011-4733. It specifically highlights Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL Injection (SQLi) vulnerabilities.

**Root Cause of Vulnerabilities:**
The root cause is related to inadequate input validation and sanitization within the Plesk Parallels Control Panel. This allows for the injection of malicious code or SQL queries through user inputs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The control panel is vulnerable to reflected XSS attacks, where malicious scripts can be injected and executed in a user's browser.
*  **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The application is also vulnerable to SQL injection attacks which can allow an attacker to manipulate backend data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **XSS:** An attacker could potentially hijack user sessions, steal sensitive information, or perform actions on behalf of the victim. They could also deface the control panel or redirect users to malicious websites.
*   **SQLi:** An attacker could potentially gain access to or modify sensitive data stored in the database, including user credentials, customer data, and server settings.  It could also lead to a complete compromise of the server.
*  **DoS:** The text mentions DoS as a possible result of these vulnerabilities without providing further details.

**Attack Vectors:**
The primary attack vector is through user input within the Plesk Control Panel interface. A low-privileged user can inject malicious code or queries.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker requires a valid user account with at least the lowest level of access to the Plesk Control Panel.
*   The attacker needs to be able to insert malicious data into input fields of the control panel.

**Additional Notes:**
* The report mentions that these vulnerabilities were privately reported to Plesk in October 2010, and further reported to CERT in April 2011.
* The specific version of Plesk affected is Plesk Parallels Panel Version psa v10.2.0\_build1011110331.18 os\_RedHat el6 and Plesk Parallels Control Panel Version 20110407.20 for Windows.
