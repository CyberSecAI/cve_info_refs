## Caveats in Cisco IOS XE 3.3S Releases

---

This chapter provides information about caveats in Cisco IOS XE 3.3S releases.

Because Cisco IOS XE 3S is based on Cisco IOS XE 2 inherited releases, some caveats that apply to Cisco IOS XE 2 releases also apply to Cisco IOS XE 3S. For a list of the software caveats that apply to Cisco IOS XE 2, see the "Caveats for Cisco IOS XE Release 2" section at the following location:

<http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/ios_xe/2/release/notes/rnasr21.html>

We recommend that you view the field notices for the current release to determine whether your software or hardware platforms are affected. You can access field notices from the following location:

<http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_products_field_notice_summary.html>

This chapter contains the following section:

## Caveats in Cisco IOS XE 3.3S Releases

Caveats describe unexpected behavior. Severity 1 caveats are the most serious caveats. Severity 2 caveats are less serious. Severity 3 caveats are moderate caveats and only select severity 3 caveats are included in this chapter.

This section describes caveats in Cisco IOS XE 3.3S releases.

In this section, the following information is provided for each caveat:

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Symptom—A description of what is observed when the caveat occurs.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Conditions—The conditions under which the caveat has been known to occur.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Workaround—Solutions, if available, to counteract the caveat.

### Resolved Caveats—Cisco IOS XE Release 3.3.2S

This section documents the issues that have been resolved in Cisco IOS XE Release 3.3.2S.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCti98219

Symptoms: The router crashes upon transmission of MPLS-labeled packet.

Conditions: This symptom is observed with Cisco IOS Release 12.4(24)T3 or Cisco IOS Release 15.0(1)M3. However, others may be affected. The router acts as an MPLS/VPN PE with VRF-NAT. This issue is seen when SIP packets are sent on the MPLS-facing interface.

Workaround 1: Filter SIP traffic inbound on the IP-facing interface.

Workaround 2: Configure "no ip nat service sip udp port 5060".

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCtj14525

Symptoms: Standby is not synced to active after attaching a new policy.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when a dynamic policy is used such as RADIUS CoA.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCtj30155

Cisco IOS Software is affected by two vulnerabilities that cause a Cisco IOS device to reload when processing IP version 6 (IPv6) packets over a Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) domain. These vulnerabilities are:

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Crafted IPv6 Packet May Cause MPLS-Configured Device to Reload

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)ICMPv6 Packet May Cause MPLS-Configured Device to Reload

Cisco has released free software updates that address these vulnerabilities.

Workarounds that mitigate these vulnerabilities are available.

This advisory is posted at <http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20110928-ipv6mpls.shtml>.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCtk67768

Symptoms: RP crash is observed in the DHCPD receive process.

Conditions: This symptom occurs on the DHCP server that is used on Cisco ASR routers and acting as ISG.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCtk69114

Symptoms: RP resets while doing ESP reload with crypto configuration.

Conditions: This symptom is observed by unconfiguring and configuring interface configuration and reloading both ESPs. The RP crashes on the server.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCtl00995

Symptoms: Cisco ASR 1000 series routers with 1000 or more DVTIs may reboot when a shut/no shut operation is performed on the tunnel interfaces or the tunnel source interfaces.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when all the DVTIs have a single physical interface as the tunnel source.

Workaround: Use a different tunnel source for each of the DVTIs. You can configure multiple loopback interfaces and use them as the tunnel source.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCtn18784

Symptoms: Interface Tunnel 0 constantly sends high bandwidth alarms.

Conditions: The conditions are unknown at this time.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCtn19027

Symptoms: The show mediatrace responder sessions brief command crashes the router.

Conditions: This symptom is observed on Mediatrace Responder when showing a stale session.

Workaround: There is no workaround. Avoid issuing this impacted show command.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCtn44232

Symptoms: With multiple RP switchovers, both RPs become unusable.

Conditions: This symptom is observed with multiple RP switchovers.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCtn58128

Symptoms: BGP process in a Cisco ASR 1000 router that is being used as a route reflector may restart with a watchdog timeout message.

Conditions: This symptom may be triggered by route-flaps in a scaled scenario, where the route reflector may have 4000 route reflector clients and processing one million+ routes.

Workaround: Ensure "no logging console" is configured.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCtn68117

Symptoms: Session command does not work on Cisco C3K series routers that have become the master after a mastership change.

Conditions: This symptom is seen when failover to slave occurs.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCtn96521

Symptoms: When the Spoke (dynamic) peer group is configured before the iBGP (static) peer group, the two iBGP (static) neighbors fail to establish adjacency.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when the Spoke (dynamic) peer group is configured before the iBGP (static) peer group.

Workaround: If the order of creation is flipped, the two iBGP (static) neighbors will establish adjacency.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCtn97451

Symptoms: The bgp peer router crashes after executing the clear bgp ipv4 unicast peer command on the router.

Conditions: This symptom occurs with the following conditions:

Crash reproduce steps are as follows:

 **1.** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Traffic travel from ROUTER3 to ROUTER2.

 **2.** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)"clear bgp ipv4 unicast 10.1.1.1" on ROUTER2.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCto00796

Symptoms: In a rare and still unreproducible case, the RR (also PE) misses sending the RT extended community for one of the redistributed VPNv4 prefix to the PE (also and RR) that is part of a peer-group of PE (+RR).

Conditions: This symptom occurs when a new interface is provisioned inside a VRF and the configuration such that the connected routes are redistributed in the VRF. This redistributed route fails to tag itself with the RT when it reaches the peering PE (+RR)

Workaround: Soft clear the peer that missed getting the RT.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCto07586

Symptoms: An IPV4 static BFD session does not get established on a system which does not have IPV6 enabled.

Conditions: This symptom occurs with the following conditions:

 **1.** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Create an IOS image that does not have IPV6 enabled.

 **2.** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Enable BFD on an interface.

 **3.** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Configure an IPV4 static route with BFD routing through the above interface.

The IPV4 BFD session does not get established, so the static route does not get installed.

Workaround: Unconfigure BFD on the interface, and then reconfigure it. Then, the session will come up.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCto07919

Cisco IOS Software is affected by two vulnerabilities that cause a Cisco IOS device to reload when processing IP version 6 (IPv6) packets over a Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) domain. These vulnerabilities are:

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)ICMPv6 Packet May Cause MPLS-Configured Device to Reload

Cisco has released free software updates that address these vulnerabilities.

Workarounds that mitigate these vulnerabilities are available.

This advisory is posted at <http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20110928-ipv6mpls.shtml>.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCto16106

Symptoms: Address is not assigned when "ip dhcp use class aaa" is configured.

Conditions: When the DHCP server is configured to download a class name from the radius using "ip dhcp use class aaa" and lease an IP address from that class, the IP address is not assigned to the client.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCto31265

Symptoms: ABR does not translate Type7 when primary Type7 is deleted even if another Type7 LSA is available.

Conditions: This symptom occurs with OSPFv3. ABR receives multiple Type7 LSA for the same prefix from Multiple ASBR.

Workaround 1: Delete/readd the static route that generates Type7.

Workaround 2: Execute the clear ipv6 ospf force-spf command on ABR.

Workaround 3: Execute the clear ipv6 ospf redistribution command on ASBR.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCto35160

Symptoms: After switchover, traffic drops are seen in CARRIER-Ethernet testcase for about 15 seconds. This issue is not seen consistently.

Conditions: This symptom is seen after switchover.

Workaround: It will auto restore after 15 seconds.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCto41165

Symptoms: The standby router reloads when you use the ip extcommunity-list 55 permit|deny command, and then the no ip extcommunity-list 55 permit|deny command.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when the standby router is configured.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCto41223

Symptoms: The standby IOSD crashes when standby RP reload is executed.

Conditions: This symptom is observed in a scaled configuration with 8000 EoMPLS and 8000 EVC sessions while the traffic is flowing. On issuing standby RP reload, IOSD crashes at the process "Standby service handler".

Workaround: There is no workaround.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCto46716

Symptoms: Routes over the MPLS TE tunnel are not present in the routing table.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when the MPLS TE tunnel is configured with forwarding adjacency. In "debug ip ospf spf", when the SPF process link for the TE tunnel is in its own RTR LSA, the "Add path fails: no output interface" message is displayed. Note that not all tunnels are affected. It is unpredictable which tunnel is affected, but the number of affected tunnels grows with the number of configured tunnels.

Workaround: If feasible, use autoroute announce instead of forwarding adjacency. Otherwise, upgrade to the fixed version.

Symptoms: High CPU loading conditions can result in delayed download of multicast routes to line cards, resulting in multicast forwarding (MFIB) state on line cards out of sync with the RP. The show mfib linecard command shows line cards in sync fail state with many in LOADED state.

Conditions: This symptom occurs during high CPU loading due to router reload or line card OIR events in a highly scaled multicast environment with high line rates of multicast traffic and unrestricted processed switched packets, before HW forwarding can be programmed.

Workaround: There is no workaround. Ensure that mls rate limits are properly configured.

Further Problem Description: IPC errors may be reported in the MRIB Proxy communications channel that downloads multicast routes to line cards.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCto55983

Symptoms: After reload, incoming mcast traffic is punted into the CPU before MFIB is downloaded into line cards. Due to the high CPU rate, line cards are stuck in a continual loop of failing to complete MFIB download and retrying.

Conditions: This symptom occurs during high CPU utilization caused by multicast traffic. The show mfib line summary command does not show cards in sync.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCto69071

Symptoms: Metrics collection fails due to invalid DVMC runtime object handle.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when the transport layer is not passing up an interface type that is acceptable to DVMC.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCto72480

Symptoms: The output of the show mfib linecard command shows that line cards are in "sync fail" state.

Conditions: This symptom occurs usually when the last reload context displayed in the show mfib linecard internal command output is "epoch change". This indicates that an IPC timeout error has occurred in the MRIB communications channel that downloads multicast routing entries to the multicast forwarding information base (MFIB). In this condition, multicast routing changes are not communicated to the failed line cards and they are not in sync with the RP.

Workaround: If this issue is seen, using the clear mfib linecard slot command may clear the problem. If the problem occurs on a Cisco 7600 SP, an RP switchover is required after clearing the problem on any affected line cards. The workaround may not completely work if high CPU loading continues to be present and IPC errors are reported.

Further Problem Description: The IPC timeout errors could result from high CPU loading conditions caused by high rates of processed switched packets. High rates of multicast processed switched packets can be avoided if rate limits are applied after each router boot, especially after using the mls rate-limit multicast ipv4 fib-miss command.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCto90252

Symptoms: A standby route processor (RP) is stuck to "init, standby" for about 10 hours.

Conditions: This symptom occurs after reloading five or six times on a Cisco ASR 1000 series router.

Workaround: Disable NSR.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCto98212

Symptoms: The IPv6 address and prefix 2001:DB8:1:104::/64 at 25 Aug 2011 00:01 25 Jul 2011 00:01 are lost after a router realod.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when this command checks for the clock validity. When the router reloads the clock validity is displayed as "not yet valid". This causes the command to not be applied.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCto99523

Symptoms: Convergence can take more time if there are a lot of VRF/routes and aggregation is configured in many VRFs. Massive route churn happens (for example, session reset with RR).

Conditions: This symptom occurs when convergence can take more time if there are a lot of VRF/routes and aggregation is configured in many VRFs. Massive route churn happens (for example, session reset with RR). There is no functionality impact.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCtq04117

Conditions: This symptom occurs after SBC rejects the call if SDP is over 5k.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCtq62759

Symptoms: The CLNS routing table is not updated when the LAN interface with the CLNS router ISIS configured shuts down because ISIS LSP is not regenerated. The CLNS route will be cleared after 10 minutes when ISIS ages out the stale routes.

Conditions: This symptom is seen when only the CLNS router ISIS is enabled on the LAN interface. If IPv4/IPv6 ISIS is enabled, ISIS LSP will be updated.

Workaround: Use the clear clns route command or the clear isis \* command.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCtq83629

Symptoms: The error message is associated with a loss in multicast forwarding state on line cards under scaled conditions when an IPC error has occurred.

Conditions: This symptom is observed during router boot or high CPU loading, which can cause IPC timeout errors. This issue is seen on line cards during recovery from an IPC error in the MRIB channel.

Workaround: Line card reload is required to resolve the problem.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCtq92182

Symptoms: An eBGP session is not established.

Conditions: This issue is observed when IPv6 mapped IPv4 addresses are used, such as ::10.10.10.1.

Workaround: Use an IPv6 neighbor address with bits. Set some higher bits, along with the IPv4 mapped address.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCtq96329

Symptoms: Router fails to send withdraws for prefixes, when bgp deterministic-med is configured. This could lead to traffic blackholing and routing loops. Could also result in memory orruption/crash in rare conditions.

Conditions: This symptom can happen only when bgp deterministic-med is configured.

The following releases are impacted:

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Cisco IOS Release 15.0(1)S4

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Cisco IOS Release 15.1(2)T4

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Cisco IOS Release 15.1(3)S

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Cisco IOS Release 15.2(1)T

Workaround: Disable deterministic med in the network/AS by issuing the **no bgp deterministic-med** command and then the **clear ip bgp\*** command or hardreset of BGP session to remove any stale prefixes.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCtr07704

Symptoms: While using scripts to delete nonexistent classmap filter from a class, the router sometimes crashes (c2600XM) or returns traceback spurious memory access (c2801nm).

Conditions: This symptom occurs when trying to delete a nonexistent classmap filter, the classmap will be NULL, and passed to match\_class\_params\_same. This results in referencing a null pointer.

Workaround: Do null check in match\_class\_command and match\_class\_params\_same. To keep the existing behavior, do not print out a message like "the class does not exist" when deleting a nonexistent class map from a class.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCtr30820

Symptoms: The IP address is not assigned to the client after a DHCP request.

### Open Caveats—Cisco IOS XE Release 3.3.1S

This section documents the unexpected behavior that might be seen in Cisco IOS XE Release 3.3.1S.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCtq46745

Symptom: Default SIP profiles (option, method, or header) that were custom configured earlier are lost during a router reload.

Conditions: This issue is observed when a router is reloaded.

Workaround: Use nondefault profiles for each adjacency.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCtq36726

Symptom: Configuring ip nat inside command on the IPSEC dVTI VTEMP interface does not have any effect on the cloned virtual-access interface. The NAT functionality is thus broken, because the virtual-access interfaces does not get this command cloned from the respective VTEMP.

Conditions: This issue occurs on the Cisco ASR1006 (RP2/FP20) Router, with IKEv2 dVTI, and the router running Cisco IOS XE 3.4 throttle builds. This could be service impacting and easily reproducible.

Workaround: Reconfigure the virtual-access interface such that the ip nat inside command is configured first, followed by the other commands.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCtj94589

Symptom: The Cisco ASR 1000 Router crashes when a testbed is unconfigured.

 **2.** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Configure one IKE session per VRF.

 **3.** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Configure four SA duals per session.

 **4.** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Unconfigure the testbed when the IXIA traffic ends.

The Cisco ASR 1000 Router may crash when the no vrf vrf-name command is issued under the crypto isakmp profile.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCtk69114

Symptom: The RP resets when performing ESP reload, which includes crypto configuration.

Conditions: This issue is observed when you perform the following procedure:

 **1.** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Unconfigure and configure the interface configuration.

 **2.** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Reload both the ESPs.

The RP crashes on the server at the end of this procedure.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCtl92842

Symptom: The Cisco ASR1000 Router crashes in the controller-config mode.

Conditions: This issue is observed when SPA-CHOC3-CE-ATM is removed and configured in the controller config mode (config-controller).

Workaround: Exit the controller config (config-controller) mode before removing the SPA.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCtn28194

Symptom: When the virtual CEM interface is disabled, it drops out-of-band clocking packets, after an RP switchover.

Conditions: This issue is observed when RP switchover is performed with out-of-band clocking.

Workaround: If the network clock status changes after the standby RP is booted, execute the shut and no shut commands on the virtual CEM circuit.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCtn55892

Symptom: The CEM interface status is shown as Down on a Cisco ASR1000 Router.

Conditions: This issue is observed upon configuring CESoPSN or the SAToP circuit on a freshly booted router. However, the traffic flow is not affected despite the CEM interface status being Down.

Workaround: Execute the shut and no shut commands on the CEM interface in order to bring the interface up.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCto09829

Symptom: The standby ESP crashes intermittently, with FTP traffic generating a core and throwing tracebacks on the console.

Conditions: This issue is observed when the WCCP is configured along with the firewall and the FTP traffic is running.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCto16196

Symptom: Unconfiguring and reconfiguring of WCCP tunnels results in tracebacks. The tracebacks are accompanied by partial or full traffic loss.

Conditions: This issue is seen on the routers that have the WCCP and PFR features enabled. Reapplying the WCCP after WCCP tunnels are configured and unconfigured, causes this issue.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCto32753

Symptom: The old IPSec SAs cannot be removed after the DVTI client is reloaded.

Conditions: This issue is observed when you establish 8000 IPSec SAs using the DVTI server-client mechanism. When you reload the DVTI client a couple of times, with a reload time interval of 10 minutes, the number of IPSec SAs on the DVTI server increases above 10000 and soon approaches 20000, crossing the SAs limit of 8000.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCto76009

Symptom: The crypto SS crashes after a clear crypto session on the DVTI client.

Conditions: This issue is observed when you perform the following procedure:

 **1.** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Configure 1000 VRFs.

 **2.** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Configure one IKE session per VRF.

 **3.** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Configure four IPSec SA duals per session.

When you execute the clear crypto session command every 3 minutes on the DVTI client after all the SAs have been established, the crypto SS crashes on the DVTI server at the end of this procedure.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

### Resolved Caveats—Cisco IOS XE Release 3.3.1S

This section documents the issues that have been resolved in Cisco IOS XE Release 3.3.1S.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCtn71898

Symptom: During an ISSU subpackage upgrade from Release 3.2.x to Release 3.3.0, the router crashes. During an ISSU subpackage downgrade from Release 3.3.0 to Release 3.2.x, the standby RP does not come up correctly after the procedure. Instead, the standby RP reloads continuously and IPC timeout messages are generated each time the RP reloads.

Conditions: These issues are observed when ISSU subpackage upgrade is performed on the router.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCth52252

Symptoms: When more than one EzVPN clients initiate a connection to the dVTI EzVPN server using the same NAT device, the first client connects to the server. But when the second client connects to the server, traffic passes through the second client, but fails on the first client.

Conditions: This issue is observed when more than one EzVPN clients initiate sessions to the dVTI EzVPN server using the same NAT device.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCtj46670

Symptoms: The IPCP cannot be completed after the dialer interface has moved out of the Standby mode. CONFREJ is seen while negotiating the IPCP.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when the dialer interface has moved out of the Standby mode. When a dialer debugs is enabled, the DDR: Cannot place call, no dialer string set error message is displayed.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCtk46381

Symptoms: Service policy installation on the L2transport PVP fails when the shaping rate is changed.

Conditions: This issue occurs when the PVPs shaping rate of the PVPs is changed.

Workaround: Remove and reinclude the service policy.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCtk83638

Symptoms: An IP address from an incorrect pool is assigned to a client when the client reconnects with a different pool of IP addresses.

Conditions: This issue is observed in a setup where two clients are behind a NAT router. This occurs when one client's connection is broken and the server is not aware of it, and the client reconnects with a different group and the IP address that is assigned is not from the correct pool.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCtl70143

Symptoms: Sometimes, the Broadband L2TP Access Concentrator (LAC) does not forward a Point-to-Point-Protocol (PPP) CHAP-SUCCESS message from the L2TP Network Server (LNS) to a client.

Conditions: This issue occurs when a T1(PRI) is used between a client and the LAC.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCtl78285

Symptoms: In a VRF configuration, an RD cannot be deleted after the RD configuration is deleted.

Conditions: This occurs when the VRF is configured with the RD.

Workaround: Remove the VRF configuration and add the VRF again.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCtl84797

Symptoms: An SBC traceback occurs.

Conditions: This issue is observed when Lawful Intercept (LI) is enabled, and multiple media sessions are present in a single call. (SDP contains information about multiple media sessions.)

Workaround: There is no workaround.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCtl98535

Symptoms: The "FMANRP\_CEF-4-UPDSTATSERR: Update CEF statistics error" traceback error message is displayed when different images are running in the active and standby RPs.

Conditions: This occurs when different Cisco IOS software images are running in the active and standby RPs.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCtl99266

Symptoms: 1) CoA service login is not synchronized to the standby RP. 2) CoA multiservice login and logout are not synchronized to the standby RP.

Conditions: The first issue occurs when a CoA service logout that was not installed through CoA service login (that is installed through a rule or as an auto service) takes place. The configuration gets synced to standby. When you perform a CoA service login of the same service.

The second issue occurs when you perform a CoA multiservice login and logout of more than one service takes place. The services are applied or unapplied on an active RP, but not on a standby RP.

Workaround: For the first issue, if the CoA service login is not synchronized, reboot the standby RP. After the standby RP comes up, initiate a bulk synchronization from the active RP. This synchronizes the service login. For the second issue, there is no workaround.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCtn19444

Symptoms: Both the mLACP PoAs may bundle their memberlinks, resulting in both the PoAs becoming active.

Conditions: This issue occurs when running mLACP. The ICRM connection between the PoAs is lost. If the interface that is configured as the backbone interface also goes down on one of the PoAs, that PoA might keep its port channel memberlinks bundled. The end result is that both the PoAs are in the mLACP active state, and both have their port channel memberlinks bundled.

Workaround: Configure shared control by configuring lacp max-bundle on the Dual Homed Device (DHD) if the device supports it. This prevents the DHD from bundling the memberlinks to both the PoAs at the same time.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCtn38996

Symptoms: All MVPN traffic gets blackholed when a peer is reachable using a Traffic Engineering (TE) tunnel. Although an interface flap is performed so that a secondary path can be selected, the multicast route does not contain a native path that uses the physical interface.

Conditions: This issue occurs when MPLS traffic-eng multicast-intact is configured under OSPF.

Workaround: Execute the clear ip ospf process command on the core router.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCtn39632

Symptoms: The RSA key cannot be configured under a key ring. It can be configured only in the global configuration.

Conditions: This issue occurs on a Cisco ASR 1000 Series Router that is configured for RSA key encryption, with the key ring name having more than eight characters.

Workaround: Modify the key ring name such that it is less than eight characters.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCtn42601

Symptoms: The Cisco router may unexpectedly reload when OSPF event debugging is enabled.

Conditions: This issue is observed when you perform the following procedure:

 **1.** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Configure the OSPF router to redistribute another protocol, with redistribution being controlled by a route map.

 **2.** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Enable the debug ip ospf events command.

Workaround: Do not reconfigure route maps when OSPF event debugging is in progress. Disable OSPF event debugging before making configuration changes to the route map.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCtn46263

Symptoms: Memory leaks are seen in ikev2\_packet\_enqueue and ikev2\_hash.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCtn51058

Symptoms: Traffic drops lead to long multicast reconvergence periods.

Conditions: This issue is observed when stateful switchover (SSO) is performed.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCtn51740

Symptoms: Memory leak is observed during the EzVPN process.

Conditions: This symptom is seen when an EzVPN connection is configured with split tunnel attributes.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCtn56526

Symptoms: In the current Cisco IOS XE 3.2.0 software, MBS is calculated based only on the MTU value. User-defined MBS value that can be calculated using the show atm pvc command is not displayed.

Conditions: This issue is observed when you perform the following procedure:

 **1.** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Configure the MBS from the command-line interface (CLI).

 **2.** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Check the show atm pvc command output.

The MBS does not reflect the configured value. It's value is always based on MTU size.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCtn61834

Symptoms: The NAT-T keepalive configuration is unable to send the cause for the NAT translation timeout.

Conditions: The NAT translation table is getting timed out, because no NAT keepalive message is received.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCtn64500

Symptoms: Multicast traffic does not pass through an ATM point to a multipoint subinterface.

Conditions: This issue is caused because of an incomplete inject P2MP multicast adjacency on the ATM P2MP interface. The output of the show adjacency ATM interface detail command shows that the inject P2MP multicast adjacency is in an incomplete state.

Workaround: Execute the clear adjacency command to force the repopulation of the incomplete adjacency. You should be aware of the impact of this system-wide command. Alternatively, you can use unicast commutation if it is possible to do so.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCtn73941

Symptoms: After performing an OIR for an ES+ card having EVC configuration with the module clear-config command, performing a restore of the old configuration is no longer functional, indicating that traffic will not be forwarded over to those service instances. The VLANs used in the previous configuration cannot be effectively used on the ports, even if the service instance numbers are changed.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when the module clear-config command is configured.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCtn74169

Symptoms: The router crashes because of the memory corruption that occurs with the use of the EzVPN Web-intercept daemon process.

Conditions: This issue is observed when the EzVPN connection comes up after HTTP authentication is completed with the help of the HTTP intercept.

Workaround: HTTP intercept should not be used.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCtn80993

Symptoms: After performing an OIR of a SPA, the Cisco IOS crashes.

Conditions: This issue is observed when you perform the following procedure:

 **1.** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)The router has scaled the L2VPN configuration of 7000 EoMPLS.

 **2.** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)The router is configured with 1500 TE tunnels, 6000 EVC, and 3000 L2TPV3 sessions.

 **3.** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)A SPA OIR is performed, when the traffic is passing through the sessions.

The Cisco IOS crashes consistently after these configuration steps are performed.

Workaround: After the SPA comes up, wait for 1 minute before issuing the second reload.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCtn81231

Symptoms: Multicast traffic is not forwarded out of the RBE interface because of incomplete multicast adjacency.

Conditions: This issue is observed when you perform the following procedure:

 **1.** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)An ATM DCHP host running IGMPv2 is established over the RBE interface of the router.

 **2.** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Multicast group join configuration is successful.

However, multicast adjacency is incomplete and hence cannot forward multicast traffic.

Workaround: Execute the shut command followed by the no shut command on the ATM main interface.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCtn87155

Symptoms: The CoA sessions do not come up.

Conditions: This symptom is seen when some CLI commands are called within the shell function. The CLI commands may fail if the shell programatic APIs are used.

Workaround: Manually use the shell function on the console.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCtn98642

Symptoms: The ASR RP crashes with the: UNIX-EXT-SIGNAL: Segmentation fault(11), Process = Ether-SPA background process error message.

Conditions: This issue is observed when you perform the following configurations:

 **1.** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Perform a large-scale configuration having QinQ and QinQ-Any with the same outer VLAN on the SPA.

![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)

---

**Note** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Configuration of QinQ (min 50 ) and QinQ-Any with the same outer VLAN is mandatory.

---

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCtj31320

Symptom: MLP bundles miss adjacencies after a scaled configuration router is reloaded. The bundles either do not process traffic or process only traffic that is forwarded in one direction. When the **show ip route** command is run, the output indicates that there is no adjacency entry for the peer IP address.

Conditions: This issue is observed after the router is reloaded, a hardware OIR is performed, an interface flaps, or some other event that causes a large number of MLP bundle sessions to be terminated and re-established occurs.

Workaround: For MLP over Serial interfaces, perform one of the following actions on the bundle:

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Run the **clear interface** *bundle\_interface\_name* command.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Shut down, and then restart the bundle.

For MLPPPoE interfaces, run the **clear interface** *bundle\_interface\_name* command.

The bundle may recover after you perform one of these actions. In addition, to avoid this issue if flaps occur in the future, implement the following combination of PPP and multilink options:

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)ppp timeout retry 4

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)ppp max-failure 30

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)ppp multilink ncp sequenced never

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCtk03524

Symptom: Applying a single dynamic crypto map to a large number (for example, 2000) of subinterfaces while the crypto session is being set up causes the iosd check heap coredump error.

Conditions: This issue is observed when a large number of subinterfaces share a single dynamic crypto map.

Workaround: Configure each subinterface to use a different crypto map.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCtk10772

Symptom: The LNS CPS rate is reduced for PPP/VPDN sessions.

Conditions: This issue is observed when LNS is configured with dual RP in SSO High Availability mode. The LNS CPS rate is reduced when the session count exceeds 16000 PPP/VPDN sessions.

Workaround: Disable SNMP on the virtual-template by running the **no virtual-template snmp** command.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCtk69937

Symptom: Packets may get dropped during the IPSec rekey process in an IKEv2 session.

Conditions: This issue is observed during the IPSec rekey process in an IKEv2 session.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCtl71869

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCtl95778

Symptom: BBA traffic is dropped on the standby RP while an ISSU upgrade from Cisco IOS XE Release 3.1.x or 3.2.x to 3.3.0 is in progress. In addition, L2TPv3 traffic is lost and cannot be recovered after the ISSU is completed.

Conditions: This issue is observed when an ISSU is performed from Cisco IOS XE Release 3.1.x or 3.2.x to 3.3.0.

Workaround: Manually reload the standby RP before the final RP switchover.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCtl99266

Symptom: The following issues related to CoA services are observed:

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CoA service activation details are not propagated from the active RP to the standby RP.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CoA multiservice activation or deactivation of multiple services is not propagated from the active RP to the standby RP.

Conditions: The first issue is observed when the following steps are performed:

 **1.** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Perform a CoA service deactivation of a service that was not installed though CoA service activation (that is, it was installed through a rule or as an auto service). The deactivation details are propagated to the standby RP.

 **2.** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Perform a CoA service activation of the same service. The activation details are not propagated to the standby RP.

Workaround: For the first issue, reboot the standby RP. There is no workaround for the issue related to CoA multiservice activation or deactivation.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCtn00790

Symptom: PPPoEoA sessions are not automatically re-established after an RP switchover.

Conditions: This issue is observed when ISG is configured.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCtn28194

Symptom: After an RP switchover, the virtual-cem interface is disabled and drops out-of-band clocking packets.

Conditions: This issue is observed when an RP switchover is performed with out-of-band clocking.

Workaround: If the network clock status changes after the standby RP is started, shut down and then restart the virtual-cem circuit.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCtn28453

Symptom: The virtual-cem interface remains in the down/down state. This results in packets getting dropped because of input errors.

Conditions: This issue is observed when `system` is configured as the source of the network clock by using the **network-clock select** *priority* **system** command and is selected as the active source, but is not selected for CEM out-of-band clocking.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCtn31692

Symptom: After an RP switchover, the BITS clock is not selected as the ACTIVE clock source. Instead, the system clock is selected as the ACTIVE clock source.

Conditions: This issue is observed when a valid BITS clock source is connected to R0 or R1, the network clock is configured using the **network-clock select** *priority* **BITS** *R0/R1* command to select BITS input from R0 or R1, and an RP switchover is performed.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCtn43861

Symptom: When the parameterized L4R-Whitelist combo service is applied, incoming packets matching the whitelist may still get redirected. In addition, explicit traffic priorities configured in the service template are not inherited by the parameterized service policy. When the **show subscriber session uid** *uid* is run, the priorities configured for the services are not correctly displayed.

Conditions: This issue is observed when the **show subscriber session uid** *uid* command is run. However, note that after explicitly applying a priority to the parameterized L4R and the whitelist TCs, if you try service activation either through Access-Accept or CoA, the sessions come up and the services are activated.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCtn44232

Symptom: When multiple RP switchovers are performed, a stage may be reached where both RPs are unusable.

Conditions: This issue is observed when multiple RP switchovers are performed.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCtn55892

Symptom: The CEM interface is in the down/down state.

Conditions: This issue is observed when you configure a CESoPSN or SAToP circuit on a recently booted router. Note that traffic flow is not affected because of this issue.

Workaround: Shut down, and then restart the CEM interface.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CSCtn62287

Symptom: The standby RP may crash while flapping the interface or performing a soft OIR of the SPA.
