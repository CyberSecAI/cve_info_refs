- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Authenex A-Key/ASAS Web Management Control is vulnerable to time-based blind SQL injection. This is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the `akeyActivationLogin.do` endpoint.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary vulnerability is a time-based blind SQL injection. This means an attacker can inject SQL code into user-controlled parameters and use time delays to infer results from the database. The lack of proper input sanitization allows the attacker to manipulate the SQL queries.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to access the Authenex database, potentially dumping all OTP tokens, user information, and credentials. The impact also includes the possibility of accessing other databases or obtaining a shell on the system, depending on the database configuration and permissions.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a web request to the `akeyActivationLogin.do` endpoint. The attacker sends a crafted POST request containing malicious SQL code within the `username` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint. No specific position is mentioned, meaning a remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability if the web interface is accessible.
