**Vulnerable App:**

```
============================================================
FOREGROUND SECURITY, SECURITY ADVISORY 2011-002
- Original release date: September 21, 2011
- Discovered by: Jose Carlos de Arriba - Senior Security Analyst at Foreground Security
- Contact: (jcarriba (at) foregroundsecurity (dot) com, dade (at) painsec (dot) com)
- Severity: 9.7/10 (Base CVSS Score)
============================================================

I. VULNERABILITY
-------------------------
Authenex A-Key/ASAS Web Management Control 3.1.0.2 (latest) - Time-based SQL Injection.

II. BACKGROUND
-------------------------
Authenex provides enterprises and enterprise IT managers and staff with a wide range of products that help keep both their networks and data secure. Authenex solutions enable users to securely and efficiently access network assets and personal, sensitive data anytime, anywhere. The Authenex suite of applications can be leveraged by a variety of USB and non-USB tokens.

III. DESCRIPTION
-------------------------
The Authenex Web Management Control allows users of Authenex A-Key (OTP Tokens for 2-factor authentication) and ASAS products to manage their OTP tokens and change user information (credentials, activate tokens, etc).

The Authenex Strong Authentication System (ASAS�) is a network security application that provides strong (two-factor) authentication for LAN, remote, VPN and web access. The ASASR System helps keep your networks secure by requiring your users to use their A-Key� tokens to authenticate via One-Time Password (OTP) whenever they want remote or LAN access to networks, web sites, portals, OWA servers, etc. The ASASR System utilizes an authentication server and database, as well as the A-Key� token as the basis for the most secure, easy to use, simple to administer and cost-effective two-factor authentication solution available today.

The A-Key� 4800 tokens are USB tokens that enable users to store data in encrypted memory (4 or 8 gigabytes) and safely take that data wherever they go. All data on an A-Key� token is safe from unauthorized use and from theft. The A-Key� token is password-protected and all data is encrypted. Also, the token has brute force penetration protection: if someone tries to log in to the token and fails a predefined number of times, the token will self-erase. This feature resides at the hardware level and cannot be altered.

IV. PROOF OF CONCEPT
-------------------------
http://authenexportal/akeyActivationLogin.do

POST DATA: rgstcode=1111111111111111&username=a'; WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:30'--

V. BUSINESS IMPACT
-------------------------
An attacker would be able access the Authenex database, dump all the OTP tokens, users information including credentials, etc.

Also, depending upon the database configuration the attacker would be able to access other databases or get a shell on the system.

VI. SYSTEMS AFFECTED
----------------------
Authenex Web Management Console 3.1.0.2, (latest version available according to the vendor).
Authenex ASAS 3.1.0.2
Authenex ASAS 3.1.0.3 (latest version available).

Prior versions and other products using the Web Management Console for A-key Tokens may be affected.

VII. SOLUTION
-------------------------
- Apply the security patches available at http://support.authenex.com/

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
