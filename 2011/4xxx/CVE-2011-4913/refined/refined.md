{
  "CVE-2011-4913": {
    "description": "The rose_parse_ccitt function in net/rose/rose_subr.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.39 does not validate the FAC_CCITT_DEST_NSAP and FAC_CCITT_SRC_NSAP fields, which allows remote attackers to (1) cause a denial of service (integer underflow, heap memory corruption, and panic) via a small length value in data sent to a ROSE socket, or (2) conduct stack-based buffer overflow attacks via a large length value in data sent to a ROSE socket.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The `rose_parse_ccitt` function fails to properly validate the length fields in `FAC_CCITT_DEST_NSAP` and `FAC_CCITT_SRC_NSAP` facilities.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Integer underflow vulnerability: Sending a small length value leads to an underflow in `memcpy` size calculation, resulting in heap memory corruption and a kernel panic.",
         "Stack-based buffer overflow: Sending a large length value causes a stack overflow in the callsign array."
      ],
      "impact": "Denial of service (kernel panic) due to heap corruption, or arbitrary code execution via a stack-based buffer overflow.",
      "attack_vectors": "Sending crafted data with manipulated length fields to a ROSE socket.",
        "attacker_capabilities": "Remote attacker capable of sending network packets to a vulnerable system."
    },
    "affected_components": [
      "Linux kernel versions before 2.6.39",
      "`net/rose/rose_subr.c`"
    ],
    "additional_notes": "The issue is triggered when parsing the `FAC_CCITT_DEST_NSAP` and `FAC_CCITT_SRC_NSAP` facilities fields. The vulnerability can result in either a heap overflow/panic or a stack overflow depending on the length value.",
