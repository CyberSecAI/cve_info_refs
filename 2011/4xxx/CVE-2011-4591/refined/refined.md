Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-4591:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `print_object` function within `datalib.php`. This function was used for debugging purposes by developers, outputting object states. The issue is that the filtering of this output was not sufficient, leaving it open to exploitation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insufficient input validation: The `print_object` function lacked proper validation of the data it was processing for output, allowing for the potential injection of malicious content or unexpected behavior.
- Exposure of debugging functionality: Debugging tools and code intended for internal use were not properly secured or disabled in production, creating an attack surface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  The potential impact is the ability to exploit developer debugging scripts. This could lead to information disclosure, manipulation of data, or other unintended consequences, depending on the specific usage context of the `print_object` function.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector would involve injecting malicious input that is then processed by the `print_object` function during debugging. This could be through crafted requests or by other means of providing data to the application which then flows to the vulnerable function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to have some understanding of how the debugging mechanisms are implemented and how to introduce malicious data into the application's data flow, specifically targeting the vulnerable `print_object` function. Access to the application and the ability to interact with the debugging features either directly or indirectly is necessary.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue was reported by Rajesh Taneja and is identified as MDL-28947 in the Moodle tracker.
- The fix involves strengthening the filtering of the output of the `print_object` function.
- This vulnerability affects Moodle versions 2.1 to 2.1.2+ and 2.0 to 2.0.5+, but not 1.9.x.
- A workaround is to avoid leaving debugging code behind in production environments.
