**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable service on a machine running Indusoft WebStudio.
- **No authentication required:** The advisory states that authentication is not needed to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable component is CEServer.
- The specific operation that triggers the vulnerability is operation 0x15, which is the "Remove File" operation.
- Indusoft has released an update to address this vulnerability.
- Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID '11473'.
