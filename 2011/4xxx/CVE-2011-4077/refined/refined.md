  "cve": "CVE-2011-4077",
  "description": "A flaw was found in the way Linux kernel's XFS filesystem implementation handled links with pathname larger than MAXPATHLEN. When CONFIG_XFS_DEBUG configuration option was not enabled when compiling Linux kernel, an attacker able to mount malicious XFS image could use this flaw to crash the system, or potentially, elevate his privileges on that system.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `xfs_readlink` function within the XFS filesystem implementation. When `CONFIG_XFS_DEBUG` is not enabled, the function fails to properly validate the size of a symlink path before copying it into memory using memcpy().",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of size validation for symlink paths",
      "Missing ASSERT checks when CONFIG_XFS_DEBUG is disabled"
    ],
    "impact": "Heap memory corruption, leading to potential system crashes or privilege escalation. An attacker could potentially craft a malicious XFS image with an oversized symlink path to trigger the vulnerability and compromise the system.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Mounting a malicious XFS image with an oversized symlink",
      "Triggering the vulnerability by accessing the crafted symlink via readlink() syscall"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to mount a crafted XFS image and trigger the vulnerable function using readlink() system call. They do not necessarily need to be a local user but could be a service running on a mounted file system."

    "affected_products":[
      "Linux kernel with XFS filesystem support, when compiled without the CONFIG_XFS_DEBUG option enabled",
      "HP Rapid Deployment Pack (RDP)",
      "HP Insight Control Server Deployment"
    ],
  "patch_details": {
     "solution": "The fix involves removing the ASSERT() checks and adding a size check to ensure that the symlink length does not exceed MAXPATHLEN, returning an error if it does.",
