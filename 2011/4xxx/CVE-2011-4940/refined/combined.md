# USN-1596-1: Python 2.6 vulnerabilities

4 October 2012

Several security issues were fixed in Python 2.6.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 11.10](/security/notices?release=oneiric)
* [Ubuntu 11.04](/security/notices?release=natty)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [python2.6](/security/cves?package=python2.6) - An interactive high-level object-oriented language

## Details

It was discovered that Python would prepend an empty string to sys.path

under certain circumstances. A local attacker with write access to the

current working directory could exploit this to execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2008-5983](/security/CVE-2008-5983))

It was discovered that the audioop module did not correctly perform input

validation. If a user or automatated system were tricked into opening a

crafted audio file, an attacker could cause a denial of service via

application crash. ([CVE-2010-1634](/security/CVE-2010-1634), [CVE-2010-2089](/security/CVE-2010-2089))

Giampaolo Rodola discovered several race conditions in the smtpd module.

A remote attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service via

daemon outage. ([CVE-2010-3493](/security/CVE-2010-3493))

It was discovered that the CGIHTTPServer module did not properly perform

input validation on certain HTTP GET requests. A remote attacker could

potentially obtain access to CGI script source files. ([CVE-2011-1015](/security/CVE-2011-1015))

Niels Heinen discovered that the urllib and urllib2 modules would process

Location headers that specify a redirection to file: URLs. A remote

attacker could exploit this to obtain sensitive information or cause a

denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 11.04. ([CVE-2011-1521](/security/CVE-2011-1521))

It was discovered that SimpleHTTPServer did not use a charset parameter in

the Content-Type HTTP header. An attacker could potentially exploit this

to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks against Internet Explorer 7

users. This issue only affected Ubuntu 11.04. ([CVE-2011-4940](/security/CVE-2011-4940))

It was discovered that Python distutils contained a race condition when

creating the ~/.pypirc file. A local attacker could exploit this to obtain

sensitive information. ([CVE-2011-4944](/security/CVE-2011-4944))

It was discovered that SimpleXMLRPCServer did not properly validate its

input when handling HTTP POST requests. A remote attacker could exploit

this to cause a denial of service via excessive CPU utilization.

([CVE-2012-0845](/security/CVE-2012-0845))

It was discovered that Python was susceptible to hash algorithm attacks.

An attacker could cause a denial of service under certian circumstances.

This update adds the '-R' command line option and honors setting the

PYTHONHASHSEED environment variable to 'random' to salt str and datetime

objects with an unpredictable value. ([CVE-2012-1150](/security/CVE-2012-1150))

([CVE-2012-0845](/security/CVE-2012-0845))

It was discovered that the Expat module in Python 2.5 computed hash values

without restricting the ability to trigger hash collisions predictably. If

a user or application using pyexpat were tricked into opening a crafted XML

file, an attacker could cause a denial of service by consuming excessive

CPU resources. ([CVE-2012-0876](/security/CVE-2012-0876))

Tim Boddy discovered that the Expat module in Python 2.5 did not properly

handle memory reallocation when processing XML files. If a user or

application using pyexpat were tricked into opening a crafted XML file, an

attacker could cause a denial of service by consuming excessive memory

resources. ([CVE-2012-1148](/security/CVE-2012-1148))

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| Measures | Conditions | Severity |
| Access Required | can be attacked over the Internet using packets | * High |
| Authentication | anonymous or no authentication (IP addresses do not count) | * High |
| User Interaction Required | the user must be convinced to take a standard action that does not feel harmful to most users, such as click on a link or view a file | * Mid |
| Exploit Complexity | the user must be convinced to take a difficult or suspicious action. If the honest user must have elevated privileges, they are likely to be more suspiciouse | * High |

| ``` The security list received a report about SimpleHTTPServer's list_directory(). It needs to add a charset parameter to the Content-type header. This is already done in Python 3 (where this code lives in http/server.py) but not in any Python 2 versions I can find. A simple backport of the code in Python 3 should hopefully suffice.  I'm marking this tentatively as a release blocker, but I don't see it's necessary to issue an urgent release. It should just be fixed before the next scheduled releases of 2.5, 2.6, 2.7. ``` | | | |

| ``` >> It needs to add a charset parameter to the Content-type header. > > What is the rationale?  Without a charset parameter, IE7 engages in encoding-sniffing and can be enticed to interpret the output as UTF7. This allows an attacker to hide e.g. <script> tags in UTF-7 encoded characters which do not get quoted by cgi.encode(). This allows XSS attacks. ``` | | | |

| ``` Senthil, I just want to verify.  You applied this patch to the Python 2.6 branch in hg, but not in svn, correct?  Since I'm going to be making the 2.6.7 release from svn, I am porting this patch over to the svn 2.6 branch.  You don't have to do that, but if you can just confirm it, that would be great. ``` | | | |

| ``` Let me confirm that. Since it is a security patch the entire point of it is to be placed in the release.  I don't want to question the reasons for doing the release from svn instead of from hg, but I do want to emphasize that the hg branch ought to be considered the master which svn should track as closely as possible.  The only reason to not port a patch to the svn branch would be if it was submitted to the hg branch in contradiction with some policy (e.g. a non-security fix to a branch that should only receive security fixes), and then it should probably be rolled back in the hg branch (and the decision to do so should be very visible on python-dev). ``` | | | |

I'm okay with that.  Right now I can't push my reconciled hg repo though because line ending changes were committed to various files in hg but not svn.  I don't think they're appropriate frankly, but rolling them back causes hg push to fail.  Antoine suggested whitelisting those files in .hgeol, which I'll investigate. ``` | | | |

# USN-1592-1: Python 2.7 vulnerabilities

2 October 2012

Several security issues were fixed in Python 2.7.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 11.10](/security/notices?release=oneiric)
* [Ubuntu 11.04](/security/notices?release=natty)

## Packages

* [python2.7](/security/cves?package=python2.7) - An interactive high-level object-oriented language (version 2.7)

## Details

Niels Heinen discovered that the urllib and urllib2 modules would process

Location headers that specify a redirection to file: URLs. A remote

attacker could exploit this to obtain sensitive information or cause a

denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 11.04. ([CVE-2011-1521](/security/CVE-2011-1521))

It was discovered that SimpleHTTPServer did not use a charset parameter in

the Content-Type HTTP header. An attacker could potentially exploit this

to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks against Internet Explorer 7

users. This issue only affected Ubuntu 11.04. ([CVE-2011-4940](/security/CVE-2011-4940))

It was discovered that Python distutils contained a race condition when

creating the ~/.pypirc file. A local attacker could exploit this to obtain

sensitive information. ([CVE-2011-4944](/security/CVE-2011-4944))

It was discovered that SimpleXMLRPCServer did not properly validate its

input when handling HTTP POST requests. A remote attacker could exploit

this to cause a denial of service via excessive CPU utilization.

([CVE-2012-0845](/security/CVE-2012-0845))

It was discovered that Python was susceptible to hash algorithm attacks.

An attacker could cause a denial of service under certian circumstances.

This update adds the '-R' command line option and honors setting the

PYTHONHASHSEED environment variable to 'random' to salt str and datetime

objects with an unpredictable value. ([CVE-2012-1150](/security/CVE-2012-1150))

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)

## Packages

* [python2.4](/security/cves?package=python2.4) - An interactive high-level object-oriented language (version 2.4)

## Details

USN-1613-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Python 2.5. This update provides the

corresponding updates for Python 2.4.

Original advisory details:

It was discovered that Python would prepend an empty string to sys.path

under certain circumstances. A local attacker with write access to the

current working directory could exploit this to execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2008-5983](/security/CVE-2008-5983))

It was discovered that the audioop module did not correctly perform input

validation. If a user or automatated system were tricked into opening a

crafted audio file, an attacker could cause a denial of service via

application crash. ([CVE-2010-1634](/security/CVE-2010-1634), [CVE-2010-2089](/security/CVE-2010-2089))

Giampaolo Rodola discovered several race conditions in the smtpd module.

A remote attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service via

daemon outage. ([CVE-2010-3493](/security/CVE-2010-3493))

It was discovered that the CGIHTTPServer module did not properly perform

input validation on certain HTTP GET requests. A remote attacker could

potentially obtain access to CGI script source files. ([CVE-2011-1015](/security/CVE-2011-1015))

Niels Heinen discovered that the urllib and urllib2 modules would process

Location headers that specify a redirection to file: URLs. A remote

attacker could exploit this to obtain sensitive information or cause a

denial of service. ([CVE-2011-1521](/security/CVE-2011-1521))

It was discovered that SimpleHTTPServer did not use a charset parameter in

the Content-Type HTTP header. An attacker could potentially exploit this

to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks against Internet Explorer 7

users. ([CVE-2011-4940](/security/CVE-2011-4940))

It was discovered that Python distutils contained a race condition when

creating the ~/.pypirc file. A local attacker could exploit this to obtain

sensitive information. ([CVE-2011-4944](/security/CVE-2011-4944))

It was discovered that SimpleXMLRPCServer did not properly validate its

input when handling HTTP POST requests. A remote attacker could exploit

this to cause a denial of service via excessive CPU utilization.

([CVE-2012-0845](/security/CVE-2012-0845))

It was discovered that the Expat module in Python 2.5 computed hash values

without restricting the ability to trigger hash collisions predictably. If

a user or application using pyexpat were tricked into opening a crafted XML

file, an attacker could cause a denial of service by consuming excessive

CPU resources. ([CVE-2012-0876](/security/CVE-2012-0876))

Tim Boddy discovered that the Expat module in Python 2.5 did not properly

handle memory reallocation when processing XML files. If a user or

application using pyexpat were tricked into opening a crafted XML file, an

attacker could cause a denial of service by consuming excessive memory

resources. ([CVE-2012-1148](/security/CVE-2012-1148))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 8.04

* [python2.4-minimal](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/python2.4)
  -
  [2.4.5-1ubuntu4.4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/python2.4/2.4.5-1ubuntu4.4)
* [python2.4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/python2.4)
  -
  [2.4.5-1ubuntu4.4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/python2.4/2.4.5-1ubuntu4.4)

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=803500#c0)  Vincent Danen    2012-03-14 20:23:45 UTC  ``` A flaw was reported [1] in Python's SimpleHTTPServer's list_directory() function.  Due to a missing charset parameter, if a user were to connect to SimpleHTTPServer using IE7, which engages in encoding-sniffing and can be tricked into interpretting the output as UTF7.  Because of this, an attacker could hide <script> tags in UTF7-encoded characters which do not get quoted by cgi.encode(), allowing XSS attacks.  This has been corrected upstream in version 2.6.7rc2 [2], 2.5.6c1 [3].  It may be fixed in 2.7 as well, but I was unable to find a commit to match it against.
