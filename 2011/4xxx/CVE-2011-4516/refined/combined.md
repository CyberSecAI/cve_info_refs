## JasPer memory corruption vulnerabilities

#### Vulnerability Note VU#887409

Original Release Date: 2011-12-08 | Last Revised: 2012-06-14

---

### Overview

Some versions of JasPer contain multiple vulnerabilities that may allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code.

### Description

| JasPer fails to properly decode marker segments and other sections in malformed JPEG2000 files. Malformed inputs can cause heap buffer overflows which in turn may result in execution of attacker-controlled code.  **CVE-2011-4516**: src/libjasper/jpc/jpc\_cs.c: jpc\_cox\_getcompparmsjpc\_cox\_getcomparms is called as part of the decoding of a coding style default (COD) marker segment. The function populates a parameter struct (jpc\_msparms\_t) that is contained in a marker segment struct (jpc\_ms\_t). jpc\_cox\_getcompparms contains a loop that copies data from the input file to the jpc\_msparms\_t struct. The loop terminates on a value (numrlvls) derived from the input file:for (i = 0; i < compparms->numrlvls; ++i) {  if (jpc\_getuint8(in, &tmp)) {    jpc\_cox\_destroycompparms(compparms);  return -1;  }  compparms->rlvls[i].parwidthval = tmp & 0xf;  compparms->rlvls[i].parheightval = (tmp >> 4) & 0xf;}numrlvls is read from the input file. The attacker can control numrlvls to overflow the jpc\_msparms\_t struct and copy attacker-controlled data from the input file into a struct of callback functions (jpc\_msops\_s) that appears in jpc\_ms\_t (src/libjasper/jpc/jpc\_cs.h) just after jpc\_msparms\_t:typedef struct {  /\* The type of marker segment. \*/  uint\_fast16\_t id;  /\* The length of the marker segment. \*/  uint\_fast16\_t len;  /\* The starting offset within the stream. \*/  uint\_fast32\_t off;  /\* The parameters of the marker segment. \*/  jpc\_msparms\_t parms;  /\* The marker segment operations. \*/  struct jpc\_msops\_s \*ops;} jpc\_ms\_t;Any subsequent failures in decoding the marker segment will result in the destroyparms member of the callback struct being invoked as part of cleanup. If the attacker has overwritten this callback via the loop above, attacker-controlled values can be loaded into the program counter.**CVE-2011-4517**: src/libjasper/jpc/jpc\_cs.c: jpc\_crg\_getparmsjpc\_crg\_getparms is called as part of the decoding of a component registration (CRG) marker segment. This function populates a heap buffer with data derived from the input file (in).The function contains an allocation size/type error. The heap buffer size is calculated using sizeof(uint\_fast16\_t) but the rest of the function assumes sizeof(jpc\_crgcomp\_t).jpc\_crgcomp\_t \*comp;...if (!(crg->comps = jas\_malloc(cstate->numcomps \* sizeof(uint\_fast16\_t)))) {  return -1;}...for (compno = 0, comp = crg->comps; compno < cstate->numcomps;++compno, ++comp) {  if (jpc\_getuint16(in, &comp->hoff) ||    jpc\_getuint16(in, &comp->voff)) {    jpc\_crg\_destroyparms(ms);    return -1;  }}The attacker can overwrite the bytes after crg->comp in memory with arbitrary data. This is a heap buffer overflow, which is generally considered exploitable.There are additional security implications here as well, however. The loop above is controlled by cstate->numcomps (cstate as one member: numcomps). cstate is allocated in a calling function, and is often allocated just before crg->comp. On some platforms the heap chunk allocated for cstate is located just after the heap chunk allocated for crg->comp, separated by only 4 bytes of heap accounting info. The accounting info + cstate (8 bytes after crg->comp) can be overwritten with bytes from the input file via the loop above. In these cases, the attacker can place a large number in cstate->numcomps to make the loop above iterate past the expected bound of crg->comps and copy an arbitrary number of bytes from the input file into heap (a heap buffer overflow). This enables the attacker to perform well-known heap exploitations, as well as allowing the attacker to overwrite other active heap allocations such as the callback pointers referenced in the previous bug description. |

### Impact

| By tricking a user into opening or previewing an image file in an application that decodes images with the JasPer library, an attacker can execute arbitrary code or cause a denial-of-service crash. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**Users who obtain JasPer from a third-party vendor, such as their operating system vendor, should see the vendor information portion of this document for a partial list of affected vendors. |
| --- |

| Please consider the following workarounds:**Avoid processing malicious image files**Turn off image preview features in file browsers and other applications that use the JasPer library. Avoid opening image attachments from untrusted or unrecognized sources. |

Vulnerability  : buffer overflows
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-4516 CVE-2011-4517

Two buffer overflows were discovered in JasPer, a library for handling
JPEG-2000 images, which could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem will be fixed in
version 1.900.1-5.1+lenny2. Due to technical limitations of the Debian
archive software, the oldstable update cannot be released synchronously
with the stable update.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.900.1-7+squeeze1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your jasper packages.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Topic

Updated rhevm-spice-client packages that fix multiple security issues,
several bugs, and add one enhancement are now available for Red Hat
Enterprise Virtualization Manager 3.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager provides access to virtual
machines using SPICE. These SPICE client packages provide the SPICE client
and usbclerk service for both Windows 32-bit operating systems and Windows
64-bit operating systems.

This update adds support for the TLS Fallback Signaling Cipher Suite Value
(TLS\_FALLBACK\_SCSV), which can be used to prevent protocol downgrade
attacks against applications which re-connect using a lower SSL/TLS
protocol version when the initial connection indicating the highest
supported protocol version fails.

This can prevent a forceful downgrade of the communication to SSL 3.0.
The SSL 3.0 protocol was found to be vulnerable to the padding oracle
attack when using block cipher suites in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode.
This issue is identified as CVE-2014-3566, and also known under the alias
POODLE. This SSL 3.0 protocol flaw will not be addressed in a future
update; it is recommended that users configure their applications to
require at least TLS protocol version 1.0 for secure communication.

For additional information about this flaw, see the Knowledgebase article
at <https://access.redhat.com/articles/1232123>

Multiple flaws were found in the way JasPer decoded JPEG 2000 image files.
A specially crafted file could cause an application using JasPer to crash
or, possibly, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2014-8138, CVE-2014-8157,
CVE-2014-8158, CVE-2014-9029, CVE-2014-8137, CVE-2011-4516, CVE-2011-4517,
CVE-2008-3520, CVE-2008-3522)

Red Hat would like to thank oCERT for reporting CVE-2014-8137,
CVE-2014-8138, CVE-2014-8157, CVE-2014-8158, CVE-2014-9029, CVE-2011-4516,
and CVE-2011-4517. oCERT acknowledges Jose Duart of the Google Security
Team as the original reporter of CVE-2014-8137 and CVE-2014-8138; and
pyddeh as the original reporter of CVE-2014-8157 and CVE-2014-8158.

The mingw-openssl and mingw-jasper packages have been upgraded to the
latest upstream version, which provides a number of bug fixes and
enhancements over the previous version. (BZ#1187585)

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* Previously, a guest system installed with tools incorrectly always

started in full screen mode, even when the "Open in Full Screen" option was
unchecked in console options. Now, when connecting in window mode with the
option unchecked, the guest system starts in a window as expected.
(BZ#1172126)

* Prior to this update, copying and pasting of images from the client to

the guest did not work when spice-gtk was built from upstream. Now, images
can be copied and pasted without problems. (BZ#1187270)

In addition, this update adds the following enhancement:

* Administrators now have the option of automatic multiuser installation of

virt-viewer onto many client workstations. (BZ#1187272)

All rhevm-spice-client users are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which correct these issues and add these enhancement.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1167537#c0)  Murray McAllister    2014-11-25 02:57:55 UTC  ``` A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was reported in JasPer's jpc_dec_cp_setfromcox() and jpc_dec_cp_setfromrgn() functions. Processing a specially-crafted image with an application that uses JasPer could cause the application to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code.  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank oCERT for reporting these issues. oCERT acknowledges Jose Duart of the Google Security Team as the original reporter.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1167537#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2014-11-27 11:55:20 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 961994](attachment.cgi?id=961994&action=diff "Proposed patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=961994&action=edit "Proposed patch") Proposed patch  This seems to be an off-by-one issue in jpc_dec_process_coc and jpc_dec_process_rgn.  There are an existing checks to ensure if coc->compno / rgn->compno is not more than dec->numcomps.  The reason is that compno is later used as index to jpc_dec_cp_t's ccps[] array, which is allocated to have numcomps entries.  However, compno == numcomps is already out of allocated bounds, and the checks should be adjusted to error out when compno >= numcomps, rather than when compno > numcomps.  There is similar issue in jpc_dec_process_qcc which is also corrected by this patch.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1167537#c4)  Jiri Popelka    2014-11-27 13:23:03 UTC  ``` Comment on [attachment 961994](attachment.cgi?id=961994&action=diff "Proposed patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=961994&action=edit "Proposed patch") Proposed patch  Patch looks good to me.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# USN-1315-1: JasPer vulnerabilities

20 December 2011

JasPer could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it opened a
specially crafted file.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 11.10](/security/notices?release=oneiric)
* [Ubuntu 11.04](/security/notices?release=natty)
* [Ubuntu 10.10](/security/notices?release=maverick)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [jasper](/security/cves?package=jasper) - Library for manipulating JPEG-2000 files

## Details

Jonathan Foote discovered that JasPer incorrectly handled certain malformed

JPEG-2000 image files. If a user were tricked into opening a specially

crafted JPEG-2000 image file, a remote attacker could cause JasPer to crash
