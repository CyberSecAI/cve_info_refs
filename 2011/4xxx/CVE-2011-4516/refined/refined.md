  "CVE-2011-4516": {
    "root_cause": "A heap buffer overflow occurs in the jpc_cox_getcompparms function when decoding a coding style default (COD) marker segment in a JPEG2000 file. The function copies data from the input file to a jpc_msparms_t struct, and the loop termination condition is controlled by a value read from the input file (numrlvls). An attacker can control this value to overflow the jpc_msparms_t struct and overwrite a subsequent callback struct.",

      "Heap buffer overflow",
      "Insufficient input validation"

    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution by overwriting callback function pointers. Denial of service can also occur.",

   "CVE-2011-4517": {
    "root_cause": "A heap buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the jpc_crg_getparms function when decoding a component registration (CRG) marker segment. The function allocates a heap buffer based on sizeof(uint_fast16_t), but then assumes the size is sizeof(jpc_crgcomp_t) when populating it with data from the input file leading to a heap overflow. Also, the size of the loop that populates the buffer is controlled by a value which resides next to the allocated buffer on the heap, so this can also be overwritten to cause a larger heap overflow.",

      "Heap buffer overflow",
      "Type confusion",
