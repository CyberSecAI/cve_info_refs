Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2011-4667:

**1. Verification of Relevance:**

The advisory `Cisco-SA-20120913-CVE-2011-4667` directly addresses the vulnerability identified as CVE-2011-4667. Therefore, the content is **RELEVANT**.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability resides within the encryption library utilized by certain Cisco software. This library allows a portion of an encrypted packet to be transmitted without encryption in a subsequent packet.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- Information Disclosure: The core vulnerability lies in the potential for unencrypted data to be leaked from an encrypted connection.
- Inadequate Encryption: The encryption library fails to consistently encrypt all data, specifically during IPSec usage

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

- Sensitive Information Exposure: An attacker could potentially gain access to unencrypted parts of a communication, exposing sensitive information.
- Potential for Further Attacks:  This information could be used as a stepping stone for further, more sophisticated attacks.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

- Remote Network Access: An unauthenticated, remote attacker can potentially exploit this vulnerability.
- IPSec Environment: The vulnerability is specific to connections utilizing Internet Protocol Security (IPSec), commonly associated with Virtual Private Networks (VPNs).

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- Unauthenticated Access: The attacker does not need any credentials to attempt exploitation.
- Network Proximity: The attacker needs the ability to access the network where the vulnerable devices are operating.

**Additional Technical Details:**

- Affected Products: The advisory lists specific Cisco products and software releases that are vulnerable, including certain Cisco IOS and NX-OS software versions, along with specific hardware such as MDS switches and the VPN Services Port Adaptor.
- Workarounds: The advisory mentions workarounds such as applying appropriate updates, restricting network access to trusted users, implementing IP-based access control lists (ACLs), and system monitoring.
- Fixed Software: Customers with active contracts can get software updates through Cisco's Software Center or by contacting the Cisco TAC for assistance with obtaining updates.

**CVSS Score:**

- Base Score: 4.3
- Temporal Score: 3.7
- Vector: `AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N/E:H/RL:OF/RC:C`

**CWE:** CWE-310 (Cryptographic Issues)
