Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-4584:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in Moodle's MNet authentication process combined with the "Login As" functionality. Specifically, the MNET authentication process did not prevent a user who had utilized "Login As" from being able to jump to a remote MNET Single Sign-On (SSO), such as a connected Mahara site.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper session management during "Login As" usage when MNET is enabled
- Failure to prevent unauthorized redirection to remote MNET SSO during "Login As"

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Masquerading/Impersonation:** An attacker, having gained access to a user account through "Login As" can potentially jump to a different MNet connected site, impersonating the user on the other site. 
- **Unauthorized Access:** By gaining access to a remote MNet SSO, the attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to resources or functionalities on that connected site, depending on the permission of the user that is being impersonated.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker needs to have access to a Moodle account with the ability to use "Login As" functionality.
- MNET has to be enabled, and a remote MNET SSO has to be configured.
- The attacker can then use the "Login As" feature and jump to a remote MNET site.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Attacker must have access to a Moodle account that has permissions to use the "Login As" feature.
- The attacker must be on a Moodle instance that has MNET enabled, and a connected remote MNET SSO.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is described as "minor" in the Moodle forum post.
- The fix involves changes to how MNET authentication interacts with "Login As" functionality.
- The issue affects Moodle versions 2.1 to 2.1.2+, 2.0 to 2.0.5+, and 1.9 to 1.9.14+.
- A workaround is to turn off MNet or "Login as" functionality.
