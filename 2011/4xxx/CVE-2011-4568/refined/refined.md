The changes include a version bump in `flowplayer.php` and `readme.txt`, and most importantly, the changelog in `readme.txt` includes `* XSS fix`.\n\nThe diff in `view/frontend-head.php` shows a change in the `fp_share` function where the `$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']` is now encoded with `urlencode`. This function generates a link to share the video, and the lack of URL encoding could be the source of the vulnerability.",
