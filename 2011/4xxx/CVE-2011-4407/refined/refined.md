Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `software-properties` package, specifically the `ppa.py` file, used the `urllib2` module to download PPA GPG key fingerprints over HTTPS. The `urllib2` module, as documented, does not perform server certificate verification by default.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Missing SSL Certificate Verification:** The core vulnerability is the lack of SSL certificate verification when fetching GPG key fingerprints. This allows a machine-in-the-middle (MitM) attacker to intercept the connection and present a fake certificate.
*   **Trust of Unverified Data:** The downloaded fingerprint data was treated as trusted without proper verification, leading to the potential for installing altered package repository GPG keys.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Compromised Package Repositories:** A successful attack could lead to the installation of malicious or altered package repository GPG keys. This, in turn, allows the attacker to control the software installed on the target system.
*   **Remote System Compromise:** By adding a malicious PPA key, an attacker could potentially install arbitrary software, leading to full system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Machine-in-the-Middle (MitM):** The attack relies on a network attacker positioned between the victim and the server hosting the PPA key fingerprints.
*   **Network Interception:** The attacker needs to intercept the HTTPS connection made by the `software-properties` tool.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the victim or be able to intercept network traffic between the victim and the PPA server.
*   **MitM Capability:** The attacker must have the ability to perform a machine-in-the-middle attack, which usually implies control over network infrastructure or ARP poisoning capabilities.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability does not require the attacker to authenticate with the system.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in the `software-properties` package in Ubuntu versions 10.04 (Lucid) through 11.10 (Oneiric).
*   The fix involves switching from `urllib2` to `pycurl`, which does perform SSL certificate verification by default.
*   A new dependency on `python-pycurl` was introduced to provide the necessary functionality.
*   A test was added to prevent regressions.

**Summary**

The vulnerability allowed an attacker to perform a man-in-the-middle attack to inject their own gpg keys. This could lead to the attacker being able to install malicious software on the victim machine.
