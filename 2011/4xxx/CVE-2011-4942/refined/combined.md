# Geeklog 1.7.1sr1

* Sunday, January 02 2011 @ 12:30 pm EST
* Contributed by: [Dirk](https://www.geeklog.net/users.php?mode=profile&uid=408)
* Views: 22,367

[![Security](https://www.geeklog.net/images/topics/security.png "Security")](https://www.geeklog.net/index.php/topic/Security)

Geeklog 1.7.1sr1 addresses an XSS in the Configuration admin panel, reported by Aung Khant of the YGN Ethical Hacker Group. Due to the built-in CSRF protection this weakness is somewhat harder to exploit but we would nonetheless advise that you secure your site by installing this update ASAP.

In addition to the [complete 1.7.1sr1 tarball](https://www.geeklog.net/downloads/index.php/1044), there are also update files [for Geeklog 1.7.1](https://www.geeklog.net/downloads/index.php/1043) and [for Geeklog 1.6.1sr1](https://www.geeklog.net/downloads/index.php/1042) that contain only a fixed version of the affected file (see the included README file for installation instructions).

Users of older Geeklog releases should consider upgrading to Geeklog 1.7.1sr1 soon (use the complete 1.7.1sr1 tarball to upgrade from any older version).

A note for those who are still running on **PHP 4**: There's a [known bug](http://project.geeklog.net/tracking/view.php?id=1239) in the Static Pages plugin in Geeklog 1.7.1 that makes it incompatible with PHP 4. We will address this issue in [a future bugfix](http://www.geeklog.net/article.php/end-of-php4-support#releases) update. In the meantime, consider upgrading to Geeklog 1.6.1sr2 - or upgrade to PHP 5, if possible.

Thanks! Alas, the full package's siteconfig.php still has define('VERSION', '1.7.1');

It doesn't matter - that version number will be overwritten with the correct version during installation or upgrade.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

blists is a registered project with

Subject: CVE Request: Geeklog 1.7.1 <= Cross Site Scripting Vulnerability

Original request here: <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2011/q1/547>

<http://www.geeklog.net/article.php/geeklog-1.7.1sr1>

<http://osvdb.org/show/osvdb/70245>
<http://secunia.com/advisories/42775/>

This might have been left unassigned because of 'admin/configuration.php', but at least Geeklog thinks this as important security vulnerability. Needs 2010 identifier, thanks.

=====================================================================
1. OVERVIEW
The Geeklog was vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting in its administration backend.
2. BACKGROUND
Geeklog is a PHP/MySQL based application for managing dynamic web content.
"Out of the box", it is a blog engine, or a CMS with support for comments, trackbacks,
multiple syndication formats, spam protection, and all the other vital features of such a system.
3. VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION
User supplied input is not probably sanitized in the "subgroup" and "conf\_group"
parameters when the configuration settings are saved in /admin/configuration.php.
Attackers who manage to get/bypass anti-csrf token (\_glsectoken) via other means can effectively perform XSS against admin users.
4. VERSIONS AFFECTED
1.7.1 and lower
5. PROOF-OF-CONCEPT/EXPLOIT
[Request]
POST /geeklog/admin/configuration.php HTTP/1.1
\_glsectoken=&conf\_group=Core'"-->&subgroup='"-->
[/Request]
6. SOLUTION
Upgrade to 1.7.1sr1
7. VENDOR
Geeklog Development Team
http://www.geeklog.net/
8. CREDIT
This vulnerability was discovered by Aung Khant, http://yehg.net, YGN Ethical Hacker Group, Myanmar.
9. DISCLOSURE TIME-LINE
2010-12-31: notified vendor
2011-01-02: vendor released fixed version

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
