Message-ID: <20111117055022.GB24831@sota.gen.nz>
Date: Thu, 17 Nov 2011 05:50:22 +0000
From: Ben Hawkes <hawkes@...a.gen.nz>
To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com
Subject: CVE Request: nginx resolver heap overflow

Hi,

The nginx team have released stable version 1.0.10, which includes a fix
for a heap overflow bug in the custom DNS resolver:

<http://trac.nginx.org/nginx/changeset/4268/nginx>

The resolver is most commonly used with the proxy and fastcgi modules,
which are not enabled by default.

In order to trigger this condition an attacker would need to be in
control of an upstream resolver host, or be in a position to brute-force
the weakly generated 16-bit transaction identifier.

Thanks,
Ben Hawkes

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# nginx: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201203-22**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in nginx, the worst of
which may allow execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-servers/nginx** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.0.14** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.0.14** |

### Background

nginx is a robust, small, and high performance HTTP and reverse proxy
server.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in nginx:

* The TLS protocol does not properly handle session renegotiation
  requests (CVE-2009-3555).
* The "ngx\_http\_process\_request\_headers()" function in ngx\_http\_parse.c
  could cause a NULL pointer dereference (CVE-2009-3896).
* nginx does not properly sanitize user input for the the WebDAV COPY
  or MOVE methods (CVE-2009-3898).
* The "ngx\_resolver\_copy()" function in ngx\_resolver.c contains a
  boundary error which could cause a heap-based buffer overflow
  (CVE-2011-4315).
* nginx does not properly parse HTTP header responses which could
  expose sensitive information (CVE-2012-1180).

### Impact

A remote attacker could possibly execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the nginx process, cause a Denial of Service condition,
create or overwrite arbitrary files, or obtain sensitive information.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All nginx users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-servers/nginx-1.0.14"

```

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).
