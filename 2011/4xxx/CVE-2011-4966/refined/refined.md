The provided content is related to CVE-2011-4966.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The "unix" module in FreeRADIUS did not properly check the password expiration setting in `/etc/shadow`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**
- The FreeRADIUS server, when configured to use the "unix" module for authentication, ignores the password expiration settings in `/etc/shadow`. This allows users with expired passwords to successfully authenticate.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Users with expired passwords can successfully authenticate to systems using FreeRADIUS, despite their access should have been denied. This can lead to unauthorized access to resources.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited by users who have expired passwords attempting to authenticate with a FreeRADIUS server configured with the vulnerable "unix" module.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs a user account with an expired password.
- The attacker needs to target a system using a vulnerable version of FreeRADIUS.
- The FreeRADIUS server must be configured with the "unix" module.

**Additional details:**
- The issue was corrected in upstream FreeRADIUS commit `1b1ec5ce75e224bd1755650c18ccdaa6dc53e605`.
- Red Hat addressed this issue in RHBA-2012:0881 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and RHSA-2013:0134 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.
- openSUSE addressed the vulnerability with openSUSE-SU-2013:0137-1 for openSUSE 12.2 and 12.1, and openSUSE-SU-2013:0191-1 for openSUSE 11.4.
- The fix involves modifying the "unix" module to check for password and account expiration by checking `sp_lstchg`, `sp_max` and `sp_expire` fields.
