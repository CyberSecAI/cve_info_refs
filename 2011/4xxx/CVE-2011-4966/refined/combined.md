## Topic

Updated freeradius packages that fix several bugs and add various enhancements
are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

## Description

FreeRADIUS is an open-source Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS)
server which allows RADIUS clients to perform authentication against the RADIUS
server. The RADIUS server may optionally perform accounting of its operations
using the RADIUS protocol.

The freeradius packages have been upgraded to upstream version 2.1.12, which
provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the previous version.
(BZ#736878)

This update fixes the following bugs:

* The radtest command-line argument to request the PPP hint option was not

parsed correctly. Consequently, radclient did not add the PPP hint to the
request packet and the test failed. This update corrects the problem and radtest
now functions as expected. (BZ#787116)

* After log rotation, the freeradius logrotate script failed to reload the

radiusd daemon after a log rotation and log messages were lost. This update has
added a command to the freeradius logrotate script to reload the radiusd daemon
and the radiusd daemon reinitializes and reopens its log files after log
rotation as expected. (BZ#705723)

* The radtest argument with the eap-md5 option failed because it passed the IP

family argument when invoking the radeapclient utility and the radeapclient
utility did not recognize the IP family. The radeapclient now recognizes the IP
family argument and radtest now works with eap-md5 as expected. (BZ#712803)

* Previously, freeradius was compiled without the "--with-udpfromto" option.

Consequently, with a multihomed server and explicitly specifying the IP address,
freeradius sent the reply from the wrong IP address. With this update,
freeradius has been built with the --with-udpfromto configuration option and the
RADIUS reply is always sourced from the IP the request was sent to. (BZ#700870)

* The password expiration field for local passwords was not checked by the unix

module and the debug information was erroneous. Consequently, a user with an
expired password in the local password file was authenticated despite having an
expired password. With this update, check of the password expiration has been
modified. A user with an expired local password is denied access and correct
debugging information is written to the log file. (BZ#753764)

* Due to invalid syntax in the PostgreSQL admin schema file, the FreeRADIUS

PostgreSQL tables failed to be created. With this update, the syntax has been
adjusted and the tables are created as expected. (BZ#690756)

* When FreeRADIUS received a request, it sometimes failed with the following

message:

WARNING: Internal sanity check failed in event handler for request 6

This bug was fixed by upgrading to upstream version 2.1.12. (BZ#782905)

* FreeRADIUS has a thread pool that will dynamically grow based on load. If

multiple threads using the rlm\_perl() function are spawned in quick succession,
freeradius sometimes terminated unexpectedly with a segmentation fault due to
parallel calls to the rlm\_perl\_clone() function. With this update, mutex for the
threads has been added and the problem no longer occurs. (BZ#810605)

All users of freeradius are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
fix these bugs and add these enhancements.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>

## Topic

Updated freeradius2 packages that fix one security issue and multiple bugs
are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

## Description

FreeRADIUS is an open-source Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service
(RADIUS) server which allows RADIUS clients to perform authentication
against the RADIUS server. The RADIUS server may optionally perform
accounting of its operations using the RADIUS protocol.

It was found that the "unix" module ignored the password expiration
setting in "/etc/shadow". If FreeRADIUS was configured to use this module
for user authentication, this flaw could allow users with an expired
password to successfully authenticate, even though their access should have
been denied. (CVE-2011-4966)

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* After log rotation, the freeradius logrotate script failed to reload the

radiusd daemon and log messages were lost. This update has added a command
to the freeradius logrotate script to reload the radiusd daemon and the
radiusd daemon re-initializes and reopens its log files after log rotation
as expected. (BZ#787111)

* The radtest script with the "eap-md5" option failed because it passed the

IP family argument when invoking the radeapclient utility and the
radeapclient utility did not recognize the IP family. The radeapclient
utility now recognizes the IP family argument and radtest now works with
eap-md5 as expected. (BZ#846476)

* Previously, freeradius was compiled without the "--with-udpfromto"

option. Consequently, with a multihomed server and explicitly specifying
the IP address, freeradius sent the reply with the wrong IP source address.
With this update, freeradius has been built with the "--with-udpfromto"
configuration option and the RADIUS reply is always sourced from the IP
address the request was sent to. (BZ#846471)

* Due to invalid syntax in the PostgreSQL admin schema file, the FreeRADIUS

PostgreSQL tables failed to be created. With this update, the syntax has
been adjusted and the tables are created as expected. (BZ#818885)

* FreeRADIUS has a thread pool that dynamically grows based on load. If

multiple threads using the "rlm\_perl()" function are spawned in quick
succession, the FreeRADIUS server sometimes terminated unexpectedly with a
segmentation fault due to parallel calls to the "rlm\_perl\_clone()"
function. With this update, a mutex for the threads has been added and the
problem no longer occurs. (BZ#846475)

* The man page for "rlm\_dbm\_parser" was incorrectly installed as

"rlm\_dbm\_parse", omitting the trailing "r". The man page now correctly
appears as rlm\_dbm\_parser. (BZ#781877)

All users of freeradius2 are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
which contain backported patches to correct these issues. They are also
advised to check for RPM backup files ending in ".rpmnew" or ".rpmsave"
under the /etc/raddb/ directory after the update because the FreeRADIUS
server will attempt to load every file it finds in its configuration
directory. The extra files will often cause the wrong configuration values
to be applied resulting in either unpredictable behavior or the failure of
the server to initialize and run.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>

Users are also advised to check for RPM backup files ending in ".rpmnew" or
".rpmsave" under the /etc/raddb/ directory after the update because the
FreeRADIUS server will attempt to load every file it finds in its
configuration directory. The extra files will often cause the wrong
configuration values to be applied resulting in either unpredictable
behavior or the failure of the server to initialize and run.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=879045#c0)  Vincent Danen    2012-11-21 22:34:52 UTC  ``` When FreeRADIUS is configured to use the 'unix' module and shadow passwords, the password expiration field is ignored.  This could allow a user with an expired password to authenticate against FreeRADIUS.  This was corrected upstream:  <https://github.com/alandekok/freeradius-server/commit/1b1ec5ce75e224bd1755650c18ccdaa6dc53e605>  And was also corrected in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via RHBA-2012:0881:  <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2012-0881.html>  Statement:  (none)   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=879045#c2)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2012-11-29 08:24:19 UTC  ``` This issue affects the version of freeradius and freeradius2 as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=879045#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-01-08 05:10:58 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2013:0134 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0134.html>   ``` |  |

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=810605#c0)  Matt Ezell    2012-04-07 04:36:43 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  FreeRADIUS has a thread pool that will dynamically grow based on load.  If multiple threads using rlm_perl are spawned in quick succession, a segfault can occur due to parallel calls to rlm_perl_clone  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):  freeradius-perl-2.1.10-5.el6.x86_64  How reproducible:  Every time multiple threads are spawned in parallel  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Install freeradius and freeradius-perl 2. Setup test users and have FreeRADIUS use an example rlm_perl module 3. Hit the server with many parallel requests, such as with radclient    Actual results:  Server segfaults  Expected results:  Server should be able to handle the load just fine  Additional info:  A fix has been committed upstream (commit a97f8cc93a6f282777935e9b8a49c22c3fcc4647 at <https://github.com/alandekok/freeradius-server/commit/a97f8cc93a6f282777935e9b8a49c22c3fcc4647#src/modules/rlm_perl/rlm_perl.c>)   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=810605#c2)  Patrik Kis    2012-04-10 11:29:43 UTC  ``` Hi Matt,  I'm trying to reproduce this issue based on your description but no luck. Could you please describe the reproduce scenario more detailed?  I basically used the default config, just added "perl" in sites-enabled/default to authorize section and checked in debug logs that rlm_perl is used. Then with radtest send about 20 parallel requests. The result is: no segfault.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=810605#c3)  Karel Srot    2012-04-10 12:45:13 UTC  ``` Hi Matt, to be more specific, I have configured radiusd with rlm_perl:  $ radtest badusername passwd localhost 1 testing123Sending Access-Request of id 138 to 127.0.0.1 port 1812 	User-Name = "badusername" 	User-Password = "passwd" 	NAS-IP-Address = 127.0.0.1 	NAS-Port = 1 rad_recv: Access-Reject packet from host 127.0.0.1 port 1812, id=138, length=56 	Reply-Message = "Denied access by rlm_perl function"  $ radtest goodusername passwd localhost 1 testing123 Sending Access-Request of id 103 to 127.0.0.1 port 1812 	User-Name = "goodusername" 	User-Password = "passwd" 	NAS-IP-Address = 127.0.0.1 	NAS-Port = 1 rad_recv: Access-Accept packet from host 127.0.0.1 port 1812, id=103, length=31 	h323-credit-amount = "100"  I tried to reproduce the bug executing following loop 25x in parallel:  $ while true; do radtest goodusername passwd localhost 1 testing123 &> /dev/null ; done &  but radiusd didn't crash (I killed it after 15 minutes).   Were you able to reproduce it? How many is "many parallel requests" and how fast it should crash?  Thank you in advance.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=810605#c7)  Matt Ezell    2012-04-10 16:09:13 UTC  ``` Sorry for not being more specific with the reproducer.  I've been using "radtest" to send parallel requests. I setup a large input file with 10,000 entries like: User-Name=goodusername, User-Password=passwd (make sure to separate these with a blank line).  I've seen failures with parallelism set to 8, but bumping this number higher may make the failures more likely.  radclient -p 8 -f path_to_radclient_input_file -s -q localhost auth testing123  Adding additional computation to the part of the code where it clones the threads would help reproducibility also.  Try adding the following code to the bottom of example.pl:  sub CLONE {         &radiusd::radlog(3, "Called clone in rlm_perl"); }  The CLONE subroutine is there to setup thread-local "things" like database connections.  The rlm_perl code I was using when I originally encountered this bug was setting up database connections.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=810605#c8)  John Dennis    2012-04-11 13:55:25 UTC  ``` new builds provided.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=810605#c11)  Patrik Kis    2012-05-03 15:38:04 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=810605#c7))  Hi Matt,  I tried it again with your updates.  I'm using /etc/raddb/test.pl: # diff /etc/raddb/test.pl /etc/raddb/example.pl  90,94d76 < 	} elsif ($RAD_REQUEST{'User-Name'} =~ /^gooduser/i) { <         if ($RAD_REQUEST{'User-Password'} eq "password1075") { <             $RAD_REPLY{'Reply-Message'} = "Allow access by rlm_perl function"; <             return RLM_MODULE_OK; <         } 197,200d178 < sub CLONE { <         &radiusd::radlog(3, "Called clone in rlm_perl"); < } <   # cat aaa  User-Name = "gooduser" User-Password = "password1075" NAS-IP-Address = 192.168.100.62 NAS-Port = 0  User-Name = "baduser" User-Password = "password1075" NAS-IP-Address = 192.168.100.62 NAS-Port = 0  # for i in `seq 1 100000`; do cat aaa >> perftest-200000.data ; done  But even running: # radclient -p 100 -qs -f perftest-200000.data localhost auth testing123  do not cause crash.  Any other ideas?   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=810605#c12)  Patrik Kis    2012-05-11 09:25:01 UTC  ``` Since the issue cannot be reproduced, it is verified sanity only.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=810605#c13)  Patrik Kis    2012-05-11 10:02:54 UTC  ``` We were not able to reproduce the crash using the given reproducer. We have verified that the patch is applied and freeradius doesn't crash with the reported scenario. The package has also passed all sanity&regression testing.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=810605#c15)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-06-20 14:06:17 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.
