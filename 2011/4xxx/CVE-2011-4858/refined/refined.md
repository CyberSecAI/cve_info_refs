Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-4858:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the Java `hashCode()` method implementation, which is susceptible to predictable hash collisions. This means that an attacker can craft inputs (specifically, HTTP parameter names) that produce the same hash value, leading to collisions within the hash table used by JBoss Web (Tomcat).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Predictable Hash Collisions:** The Java `hashCode()` implementation allows for the generation of multiple keys that result in the same hash value, leading to hash collisions.
*   **Lack of Input Limits:** JBoss Web did not initially have limits on the number of parameters processed per HTTP request, which allowed attackers to exploit the hash collision vulnerability.
*   **Inefficient Parameter Handling:** JBoss Web did not efficiently handle large numbers of parameters and large parameter values.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By sending a crafted HTTP request with a large number of parameters that produce hash collisions, an attacker can force JBoss Web to use an excessive amount of CPU time, resulting in a denial of service.
*   **CPU Resource Exhaustion**: The server spends an excessive amount of time processing the colliding parameter names.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability is exploited remotely through HTTP requests.
*   **HTTP Request with Crafted Parameters:** Attackers send an HTTP request (likely a POST request) that contains a large number of parameters whose names are designed to produce hash collisions within the Java hash table.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote access to a JBoss Web server:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable JBoss Web server.
*   **Ability to craft HTTP requests**: The attacker needs the capability to send POST requests with a large number of crafted parameters.
*   **No special privileges or authentication needed:** The attack can be performed without authentication.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Mitigation:** The provided information details that updates introduce limits on the number of parameters and headers that are processed per request. The default limit is 512 for parameters and 128 for headers. The limits are configurable via system properties:
    *   `org.apache.tomcat.util.http.Parameters.MAX_COUNT` for parameter limit.
    *   `org.apache.tomcat.util.http.MimeHeaders.MAX_COUNT` for headers limit.
*   The vulnerability is also present in other application servers using the vulnerable Java's hashCode() method.
*   The vulnerability can be exploited by sending an HTTP request with a large number of parameters whose names map to the same hash value
