Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-4920:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a combination of three separate Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities within the e107 CMS, which were subsequently merged into a single CVE. These are:
  1. Multiple Script URI XSS
  2. e107_admin/users.php resend_name parameter XSS
  3. User Signatures link BBCode XSS

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization or output encoding in various parts of the e107 CMS. This allows an attacker to inject malicious script into the web application.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of these XSS vulnerabilities could lead to:
  - Arbitrary script execution in the victim's browser.
  - Session hijacking.
  - Defacement of the website.
  - Potentially further compromise of the user's machine if the malicious script exploits browser vulnerabilities.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vectors include:
   - Injecting malicious script into URI parameters.
   - Injecting malicious script in the `resend_name` parameter in the `e107_admin/users.php` page.
   - Injecting malicious script through BBCode in user signatures.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be able to inject the malicious script into the vulnerable parameters, which is generally possible for any user with access to the vulnerable functionality of e107. It would seem that in some cases, this could be a low-privilege user, as user signatures are normally a user-controlled area.
