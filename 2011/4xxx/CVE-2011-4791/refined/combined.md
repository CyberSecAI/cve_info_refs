| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of HP Data Protector. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within the DBServer.exe process which listens by default on TCP port 19813. While parsing a request, the process trusts a user-supplied 32-bit length value and uses it within a memory operation. By specifying large enough values in a packet sent to the service, a remote attacker can execute arbitrary code under the context of the SYSTEM user. |
