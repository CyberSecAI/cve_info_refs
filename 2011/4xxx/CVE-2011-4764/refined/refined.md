Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information relevant to CVE-2011-4764:

**1. Verification:**

*   The content explicitly mentions "Cross-site scripting (reflected) - CVE-2011-4764" making it directly relevant to the specified CVE.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The application copies user-supplied data from request parameters into the HTML response without proper sanitization or encoding.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the application's response, which will then execute within the victim's browser when they access the crafted URL. This can enable the attacker to:
    *   Steal session cookies or login credentials.
    *   Perform actions on behalf of the victim.
    *   Log keystrokes, among other malicious activities.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the XSS payload in specific parameters, then sends the victim a link via email or instant message.
    *   The attacker posts the crafted link on a website which permits content authoring, such as a forum or blog comment.
    *   The attacker creates an innocuous-looking website to trigger arbitrary requests towards the vulnerable application using either `GET` or `POST` requests.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft URLs with malicious payloads, and convince victims to access those URLs.

**3. Specific Vulnerable Locations (with details from the report):**

*   **2.1.** `http://vulnerarable.plesk.smb.10.2.0.site:2006/Wizard/Edit/Modules/Image` [file parameter]
    *   The `file` parameter's value is directly embedded within an HTML tag attribute surrounded by double quotes.
    *   The report specifically mentions a payload: `115d3"><script>alert(1)</script>6ce2f3d0fa8` successfully injected via this parameter.
*  **2.2.** `http://vulnerarable.plesk.smb.10.2.0.site:2006/Wizard/Edit/Modules/Image` [name of an arbitrarily supplied request parameter]
    *   The application reflects arbitrary request parameter names into HTML tag attributes (which are enclosed with double quotes).
    *   The report used payload: `dd206"><script>alert(1)</script>9d144815d58` as a parameter name to show the vulnerability.
*   **2.3.** `http://vulnerarable.plesk.smb.10.2.0.site:2006/localizedimage.php` [name of an arbitrarily supplied request parameter]
    *   Similar to the above, an attacker can inject malicious javascript using arbitrary parameter names.
    *   Payload used in the test: `3b7b4"><script>alert(1)</script>eb263b2f76a`

**4. Additional Notes:**

*   The report states the testing was done on Plesk Small Business Manager 10.2.0 running on Windows 2008 R2 Server (64 bit).
*   The report states that the disclosure of the vulnerability was uncoordinated.
*   The report contains additional vulnerabilities which are associated with different CVEs.
*   The report states "THIS REPORT MAY CONTAIN FALSE POSITIVES THAT HAVE NOT BEEN PROOFED" therefore some findings might require additional confirmation.

**5. Remediation Guidance (from report):**

*   Input validation should be performed as strictly as possible. Any invalid input should be rejected and not sanitized.
*   User-supplied input should be HTML-encoded anywhere it is copied into application responses. This includes replacing characters like `<`, `>`, `"`, `'`, and `=` with corresponding HTML entities.
