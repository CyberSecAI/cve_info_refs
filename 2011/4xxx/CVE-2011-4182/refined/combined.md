| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=735394#c0)  Jon Nelson   2011-12-07 16:16:45 UTC  ``` User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:8.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/8.0  In this context, the variable "CONFIG" comes from the *name* of the AP one might be associated with in a wireless environment (which can contain just about any old cruft.)  In my case, I connected to a network with a space in the name, and *happened* to be watching /var/log/messages and /var/log/NetworkManager.  This is what I saw:  Dec  7 09:41:23 some_laptop dbus-daemon[20761]: scripts/ifup-services: line 98: test: ./ifcfg-wlan0-Uphill: binary operator expected  Line 98-100 reads:  test -f ./ifcfg-$CONFIG && . ./ifcfg-$CONFIG if [ -d "ifservices-$CONFIG" ] ; then         cd ifservices-$CONFIG  The first and third lines make use of $CONFIG _unquoted_. I can see this being a potential security issue.  It's probably worth auditing the rest of the associated files for similar issues.

# CVE-2017-15710

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2017-15706.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2017-15713.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2017-15710 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-15710)

#### Description

In Apache httpd 2.0.23 to 2.0.65, 2.2.0 to 2.2.34, and 2.4.0 to 2.4.29, mod\_authnz\_ldap, if configured with AuthLDAPCharsetConfig, uses the Accept-Language header value to lookup the right charset encoding when verifying the user's credentials. If the header value is not present in the charset conversion table, a fallback mechanism is used to truncate it to a two characters value to allow a quick retry (for example, 'en-US' is truncated to 'en'). A header value of less than two characters forces an out of bound write of one NUL byte to a memory location that is not part of the string. In the worst case, quite unlikely, the process would crash which could be used as a Denial of Service attack. In the more likely case, this memory is already reserved for future use and the issue has no effect at all.
