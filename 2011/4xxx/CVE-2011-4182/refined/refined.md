{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `CONFIG` variable, derived from the wireless AP name, is used unquoted in shell scripts. This allows for injection of arbitrary commands if the AP name contains special characters or spaces.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper quoting of shell variables",
      "Command injection vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary command execution by exploiting the unquoted variable. This could lead to system compromise, data access, or other malicious actions, depending on the attacker's goal.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Connecting to a malicious wireless access point with a crafted name containing shell metacharacters or spaces.",
      "Manipulating the network configuration settings to inject malicious AP names"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a malicious wireless AP with a specific name to exploit the vulnerability, or to manipulate the network configuration settings."
