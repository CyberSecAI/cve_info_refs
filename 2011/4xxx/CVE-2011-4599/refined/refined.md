  "CVE-2011-4599": {
    "Metadata": {
      "ID": "CVE-2011-4599",
      "Description": "A stack-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way ICU performed variant canonicalization for some locale identifiers. If a specially-crafted locale representation was opened in an application linked against ICU, it could cause the application to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application."
    },
    "Content": {
      "Root cause": "A stack-based buffer overflow due to improper handling of locale identifiers during variant canonicalization.",
      "Vulnerabilities": [
        "Stack-based buffer overflow"
      ],
      "Impact": "Application crash or arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the application.",
      "Attack vectors": "Specially-crafted locale representation provided as input to an application linked against the ICU library.",
      "Attacker capabilities": "Ability to craft a malicious locale identifier and have a vulnerable application process it. No specific privileges are required."
