Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in various parts of the TYPO3 CMS, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. Specifically, the following were affected:
*   URL parameters in the "JSwindow" property of the typolink function
*   Usernames in the admin panel
*   Content element link attributes in the browse_links wizard
*   Page titles in the system extension recycler and tcemain flash messages.
* Additionally, an insecure configuration in the `css_styled_content` system extension allowed for information disclosure via the "getText" feature.
* Special user input by BE editors was not sanitized and was treated as serialized data which was then deserialized by TYPO3, leading to arbitrary file deletion.
* ExtDirect endpoints did not have proper access control.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Multiple instances of XSS vulnerabilities were found due to insufficient sanitization of user inputs.
*   **Information Disclosure:** TYPO3's behavior when handling incorrect login credentials exposed information, and it also allowed backend users to see workspace changes they should not have access to. It also allowed for arbitrary data to be retrieved from the TYPO3 database.
*   **Authentication Delay Bypass:** The delay implemented for failed login attempts could be bypassed.
*   **Unserialize() vulnerability:**  A vulnerability that allows backend editors to delete arbitrary files through deserialization of user-controlled data.
*    **Missing Access Control:**  ExtDirect endpoints lacked proper access control, allowing unauthorized users to consume arbitrary endpoints.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting:** Attackers could inject malicious scripts or HTML into pages viewed by other users, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers could potentially gain knowledge of usernames, system configurations, and other sensitive data.
*   **Authentication Delay Bypass:**  Attackers could potentially brute force credentials more quickly without delay.
*   **Unserialize() vulnerability:** An attacker could delete arbitrary files the webserver had access to.
*   **Missing Access Control:** Arbitrary backend users could access and potentially abuse any available ExtDirect endpoint service.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** All the attacks are network-based, exploiting vulnerabilities via HTTP requests.
*   **Specific vectors:**
    *  Manipulating URL parameters in frontend typolinks.
    *  Inputting malicious data into backend usernames, content element links, and page titles.
    *  Crafting special requests to bypass authentication delay.
    *  Crafting malicious serialized data for backend editors.
    *  Accessing ExtDirect endpoints without proper authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   For XSS in the frontend, no specific user privileges are required and can be done remotely.
*   For backend XSS, access to the backend as a user is required, but no elevated privileges are needed
*   For information disclosure, no specific user privileges are needed.
*   For the `unserialize()` vulnerability and missing access control, backend editor access is required.
*   For the authentication delay bypass, no user privileges are needed but this could be combined with other attacks to speed up brute forcing login attempts

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects TYPO3 versions before 4.3.12, 4.4.x before 4.4.9, and 4.5.x before 4.5.4.
*   Patches were released in versions 4.3.12, 4.4.9, and 4.5.4.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS v3.1 score of 5.4, classified as Medium severity.
*   The vulnerability is also tracked as DSA-2289-1 in Debian.
