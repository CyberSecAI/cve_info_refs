> ## Introduction
>
> The Cisco NX-OS software is a data center-class operating system built with modularity, resiliency, and serviceability at its foundation. Based on the industry-proven Cisco MDS 9000 SAN-OS software, Cisco NX-OS helps ensure continuous availability and sets the standard for mission-critical data center environments. The highly modular design of Cisco NX-OS makes zero-effect operations a reality and enables exceptional operational flexibility.
>
> Several new hardware and software features are introduced for the Cisco Nexus 5000 Series switch and the Cisco Nexus 2000 Series Fabric Extender (FEX) to improve the performance, scalability, and management of the product line. Cisco NX-OS Release 5.0 also supports all hardware and software supported in Cisco NX-OS Software Release 4.2.
>
>
> ### Cisco Nexus 5000 Series Switches
>
> The Cisco Nexus 5000 Series switches include a family of line-rate, low-latency, lossless 10-Gigabit Ethernet, Cisco Data Center Ethernet, Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE), and now native Fibre Channel switches for data center applications. The Cisco Nexus 5000 Series includes the Cisco Nexus 5500 Platform and the Cisco Nexus 5000 Platform.
>
> For information about the Cisco Nexus 5000 Series, see the *Cisco Nexus 5000 Series and Cisco Nexus 5500 Platform Hardware Installation Guide*.
>
>
>
> ### Cisco Nexus 2000 Series Fabric Extenders
>
> The Cisco Nexus 2000 Series Fabric Extender (FEX) is a highly scalable and flexible server networking solution that works with the Cisco Nexus 5000 Series switches to provide high-density and low-cost connectivity for server aggregation. Scaling across 1-Gigabit Ethernet, 10-Gigabit Ethernet, unified fabric, rack, and blade server environments, the FEX is designed to simplify data center architecture and operations.
>
> The FEX integrates with its parent Cisco Nexus 5000 Series switch which allows zero-touch provisioning and automatic configuration. The FEX provides a single point of management that supports a large numbers of servers and hosts that can be configured with the same feature set as the parent Cisco Nexus 5000 Series switch, including security and quality of service (QoS) configuration parameters. Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) is not required between the Fabric Extender and its parent switch, because the Fabric Extender and its parent switch allow you to enable a large multi-path, loop-free, active-active topology.
>
> Software is not included with the Fabric Extender. Cisco NX-OS software is automatically downloaded and upgraded from its parent switch. For information about configuring the Cisco Nexus 2000 FEX, see the "Configuring the Fabric Extender" chapter in the *Cisco Nexus 5000 Series Layer 2 Switching Configuration Guide*.

>
> Starting with Cisco NX-OS Release 5.0(3)N2(2), the Cisco Nexus® B22 Blade Fabric Extender for HP (Cisco Nexus B22HP) provides an extension of the Cisco Nexus switch fabric to the HP server edge.
>
>
>
> ### New Software Features
>
> Cisco NX-OS Release 5.0(3)N2(1) includes the following new or changed software features:

> ### Fibre Channel over Ethernet N-Port Virtualization
>
> Beginning with Cisco NX-OS Release 5.0(3)N2(1), Fibre Channel over Ethernet N-Port Virtualization (FCoE NPV) is supported on the Cisco Nexus 5000 Series switches. The FCoE NPV feature is an enhanced form of FIP snooping that provides a secure method to connect FCoE-capable hosts to an FCoE-capable FCoE forwarder (FCF) switch. The FCoE NPV feature provides the following benefits:
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)FCoE NPV does not have the management and troubleshooting issues that are inherent to managing hosts remotely at the FCF.
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)FCoE NPV implements FIP snooping as an extension to the NPV function while retaining the traffic-engineering, VSAN-management, administration and trouble-shooting aspects of NPV.
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)FCoE NPV and NPV together allow communication through FC and FCoE ports at the same time. This provides a smooth transition when moving from FC to FCoE topologies.
>
> For more information, see the *Cisco Nexus 5000 Series NX-OS SAN Switching Configuration Guide, Release 5.0(3)N2(1)*.
>
>
>
> ### Flex Links
>
> Beginning with Cisco NX-OS Release 5.0(3)N2(1), Flex Links are supported on Cisco Nexus 5000 Series switches. Flex Links are a pair of a Layer 2 interfaces (switchports or port channels), where one interface is configured to act as a backup to the other. Flex Links are typically configured in service-provider or enterprise networks where customers do not want to run STP. Flex Links provide link-level redundancy that is an alternative to Spanning Tree Protocol (STP). STP is automatically disabled on Flex Links interfaces.

>
>
> **Note** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)To configure flex links, you must remove the LAN\_ENTERPRISE\_SERVICES\_PKG, LAN\_BASE\_SERVICES\_PKG and then reload the switch.

>
>
>
> ### Configurable Hash Polynomial
>
> Beginning with Cisco NX-OS Release 5.0(3)N2(1), the Cisco Nexus 5500 Platform switches support 8 hash polynomials that can be used for compression on the hash-parameters. Depending on variations in the hash parameters for egress traffic flows from a port channel, different polynomials could provide improved load distribution results.
>
> For more information, see the [Cisco Nexus 5000 Series NX-OS Layer 2 Switching Configuration Guide, Release 5.0(3)N2(1)](http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/ps9670/products_installation_and_configuration_guides_list.html).
>
>
>
> ### Orphan Port Shutdown
>
> Beginning with Cisco NX-OS Release 5.0(3)N2(1), you can suspend a non-virtual port channel (vPC) port when a vPC secondary peer link goes down. A non-vPC port, also known as an orphaned port, is a port that is not part of a vPC.
>
> For more information, see the [Cisco Nexus 5000 Series NX-OS Layer 2 Switching Configuration Guide, Release 5.0(3)N2(1)](http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/ps9670/products_installation_and_configuration_guides_list.html).
>
>
>
> ### Auto-Negotiation Disable
>
> Beginning with Cisco NX-OS Release 5.0(3)N2(1), you can disable auto-negotiation on a switch port. This feature allows you to connect devices that do not support auto-negotiation (for example, certain DWDM multiplexers) to a Cisco Nexus 5000 Series switch.
>
>
>
> ### Licensing
>
> The Cisco NX-OS licensing feature allows you to access premium features on the device after you install the appropriate license for that feature. Any feature not included in a license package is bundled with the Cisco NX-OS software and is provided to you at no extra charge.
>
> You must purchase and install a license for each device.
>
> ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)
>
> ---
>
>
> **Note** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)You can enable most features without installing a license. The Cisco NX-OS software provides a grace period for most features during which time you can try out a feature before purchasing its license. The Layer 3 features do not have a grace period and require an installed Layer 3 Base license to use the routing features.
>
> ---
>
>
> Beginning with Cisco NX-OS Release 5.0(3)N2(1), the FCoE NPV license (FCOE\_NPV\_PKG) is available to use the FCoE NPV feature.
>
> For more information on licensing, see the [Cisco NX-OS Licensing Guide](http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/switches/datacenter/sw/nx-os/licensing/guide/b_Cisco_NX-OS_Licensing_Guide.html).
>
>
>
> ### Data Center Network Manager Release 5.2 Support
>
> Cisco DCNM is advanced management software that provides comprehensive life cycle management for the data center LAN and SAN.
>
> Cisco DCNM Release 5.2 combines Cisco Fabric Manager, which previously managed SANs, and Cisco DCNM, which previously managed only LANs, into a unified product that can manage a converged data center fabric. As a part of the product merger in Cisco DCNM Release 5.2, the name Cisco DCNM for SAN replaces the name Cisco Fabric Manager. The name Cisco Fabric Manager still applies to Cisco Fabric Manager Release 5.0(x) and all earlier versions.
>
> Cisco DCNM Release 5.2 supports the Cisco Nexus product family including the Cisco Nexus 5000 Series, Cisco MDS 9000 product family, Catalyst 6500 Series, and the Cisco UCS product family.
>
> For information about new DCNM features for the Cisco Nexus 5000 Series switch, see the [Cisco DCNM Release Notes, Release 5.2](http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/ps9369/prod_release_notes_list.html).

> ## Limitations
>
> This section describes the limitations for Cisco NX-OS Release 5.0(3)N2(2b), Release 5.0(3)N2(2a), Release 5.0(3)N2(1) and Release 5.0(3)N2(2).
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)When upgrading from Cisco NX-OS Release 4.2(1)N1(1) and earlier releases, to any release, the policy description is lost. This problem does not occur when upgrading from Cisco NX-OS Release 4.2(1)N1(1) and later releases. After an upgrade, We recommend that you reconfigure the policy description. For details, see CSCth14225.
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Starting with Cisco NX-OS Release 4.2(1)N2(1), LACP fast timers are supported. If you downgrade to an earlier release that does not support this feature, entering the **install all** command displays the following warning:
>
>
> ```
> "Configuration not supported - Lacp fast rate is enabled",
>
> ```
>
>
> ```
>   "Use \"lacp rate normal\" on those interfaces"
>
> ```
>
>
> ```
>
>
> ```
>
> Before downgrading to an earlier release, change the LACP rate to normal. If you ignore the warning and force the installation, then it is possible that the leftover LACP rate fast configuration would still be active with previous releases of software but the behavior would be unpredictable and link flap might occur. We recommend that you change the LACP rate setting to normal. For details, see CSCth93787.
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)When an FC SPAN destination port is changed from SD to F mode and back to SD mode on a NPV switch, the port goes into an error-disabled state. Perform a shut/no-shut after the mode change recovers the port. This issue occurs only in NPV mode. For details, see CSCtf87701.
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)If you configure a Cisco Nexus 2248TP port to 100 Mbps instead of autonegotiation, autonegotiation does not occur, which is expected behavior. Both sides of the link should be configured to both hardwired speed or both autonegotiate.
>
> **no speed**—Autonegotiates and advertises all speeds (only full duplex)
>
> **speed 1000**—Autonegotiates only for a 802.3x pause
>
> **speed 100**—Does not autonegotiate; pause cannot be advertised. The peer must be set to not autonegotiate and fix at 100 Mbps (similar to the N2248TP)
>
> For details, see CSCte81998.
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Given the implementation of a single CPU ISSU, the STP root on the PVST region with switches on an MST region is not supported. The PVST simulation on the boundary ports go into a PVST SIM inconsistent blocked state that breaks the STP active path. To work around this issue, move all STP roots on the MST region. However, the work around causes a nondisruptive ISSU to fail because Non-Edge Designated Forwarding Ports are required for an ISSU. For additional information, see CSCtf51577. For information topologies that a nondisruptive upgrade is supported, see to the *Cisco Nexus 5000 Series NX-OS Upgrade and Downgrade Guide*.
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)IGMP queries sent in CSCtf94558 are group-specific queries that are sent with the destination IP/MAC address as the group's address.
>
> GS queries are sent for IP address: 224.1.14.1 to 224.1.14.100 [0100.5E01.0E01 to 0100.5E01.0E64]
>
> These are not link-local addresses. By default, they are not flooded by the hardware into the VLAN. They are sent only to the ports that have joined this group.
>
> This is expected behavior during an ISSU.
>
> In another scenario, the IGMP global queries [dest IP 224.0.0.1] get flooded correctly in the VLAN.
>
> Group-specific queries are not forwarded to ports other than the one that joined the group during ISSU. The reason to forward group-specific queries toward hosts is to avoid having them leave the group. However, if a group has not joined the group, then this is not an issue. If there is an interface that has joined the group, then the queries are expected to make it to the host. While the behavior is different when ISSU is not occurring, it is sufficient and works as expected and there is no impact to traffic. For details, see CSCtf94558.
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)The meaning of an MTU configuration has changed in Cisco NX-OS Release 4.2(1)N1(1) and earlier releases. In releases earlier than Cisco NX-OS Release 4.2(1)N1(1), the configured MTU included the Ethernet payload and Ethernet headers. In Cisco NX-OS Release 4.2(1)N1(1), the configured MTU includes only the Ethernet payload and not the Ethernet headers. When upgrading or downgrading between Cisco NX-OS Release 4.2(1)N1(1) and earlier releases, Cisco NX-OS automatically converts the configuration to address this semantic change by adding or subtracting 38 to the MTU to address the Ethernet header size.
>
> In a vPC configuration, the MTU per class needs to be consistent on both switches in the vPC domain for the vPC peer link to come up. When upgrading/downgrading a working vPC setup between pre-4.2(1)N1(1) and 4.2(1)N1(1) releases, the MTU is adjusted to make sure that the MCT peer-link always comes up.
>
> However if you add a peer-link between two switches in a vPC domain that are identically configured (MTU in particular) with one switch running Cisco NX-OS Release 4.2(1)N1(1) and another switch running an earlier release, then the vPC peer link does not come up because the MTU is inconsistent between the two switches.
>
> This is not an issue when upgrading or downgrading peer switches in a vPC domain; this is only an issue when adding a peer link between two switches running Cisco NX-OS Release 4.2(1)N1(1) and earlier releases that were not previously in the same vPC domain.
>
> To resolve this issue, upgrade or downgrade one switch to match the version on the other switch and reconfigure the MTU to be consistent on both sides. For details, see CSCtg27538.
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)The channel-group configuration is not applied to the Cisco Nexus 2000 Series downlink interface after downgrading to the Cisco NX-OS Release 4.1(3)N1(1) software. This issue occurs if the **speed 1000** command is present under the context of the port channel. To work around this issue, reconfigure the channel-group command after the system comes up and reapply the configuration from the saved configuration in the bootflash. For details, see CSCtc06276.
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)When a private VLAN port is configured as a TX (egress) SPAN source, the traffic seen at the SPAN destination port is marked with the VLAN of the ingressed frame. There is no work around.
>
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)In large-scale configurations, some Cisco Nexus 2000 Series Fabric Extenders may take up to 3 minutes to appear online after entering the **reload** command. A configuration can be termed large scale when the maximum permissible Cisco Nexus 2000 Series Fabric Extenders are connected to a Cisco Nexus 5000 Series switch, and all host-facing ports are connected and each host-facing interface has a large configuration (that supports the maximum permissible ACEs per interface).
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)The Cisco Nexus 2000 Fabric Extender does not support PVLANs over VLAN trunks used to connect to another switch. The PVLAN trunks are used only on inter-switch links but the FEX ports are only meant to connect to servers. Because it is not a valid configuration to have an isolated secondary VLAN as part of a Fabric Extender port configured as a VLAN trunk, all frames on isolated secondary VLANs are pruned from going out to a FEX.
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Egress scheduling is not supported across the drop/no-drop class. Each Fabric Extender host port does not support simultaneous drop and no drop traffic. Each Fabric Extender host port can support drop or no drop traffic.
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)The Cisco Nexus 2148 Fabric Extender does not support frames with the dot1p vlan 0 tag.
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)VACLs of more than one type on a single VLAN are unsupported. Cisco NX-OS software supports only a single type of VACL (either MAC, IPv4, or IPv6) applied on a VLAN. When a VACL is applied to a VLAN, it replaces the existing VACL if the new VACL is a different type. For instance, if a MAC VACL is configured on a VLAN and then an IPv6 VACL is configured on the same VLAN, the IPv6 VACL is applied and the MAC VACL is removed.
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)A MAC ACL is applied only on non-IP packets. Even if there is a **match eth type = ipv4** statement in the MAC ACL, it does not match an IP packet. To avoid this situation, use IP ACLs to apply access control to the IP traffic instead of using a MAC ACL that matches the EtherType to IPv4 or IPv6.
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Multiple **boot kickstart** statements in the configuration are not supported.
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)If you remove an expansion module with Fibre Channel ports, and the cable is still attached, the following FCP\_ERRFCP\_PORT errors are displayed:
>
>

>
> ### Configuration Synchronization Limitation
>
> When you remove a switch profile using the **no switch-profile** *name* [all-config | local-config] command, the configuration in the switch profile is immediately removed from the running configuration. This disrupts the configurations that were present in the switch profile. For example, port channel and vPC configurations are disrupted. For current information about this issue, refer to CSCtl87240 and CSCtl87260.
>
>
> ### Limitations on the Cisco Nexus 5010 and Cisco Nexus 5020
>
> The limitations on the Cisco Nexus 5010 switch and the Cisco Nexus 5020 switch are as follows:
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Traffic going out the Ethernet SPAN destination is always tagged. The SPAN destination can be in the access or trunk mode and frames on the SPAN source port can be tagged or untagged. Frames are always tagged internally as they travel through the system. Information about whether the frame was originally tagged or untagged, as it appeared in the SPAN source, is not preserved in the SPAN destination. The spanned traffic exiting the SPAN destination port always has the VLAN tag on it. The correct VLAN tag is applied on the frame as it goes out the SPAN destination. The only exception is if frames ingress on a SPAN source port on an invalid VLAN. In this case, **vlan 0** is applied on a spanned frame.
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Spanned FCoE frames do not preserve original SMAC and DMAC fields. The Ethernet header gets modified as the frame is spanned to the destination. The modified header fields are displayed when monitored on the SPAN destination.
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)The CoS value in spanned FCoE frames on the Ethernet SPAN destination port does not match with the CoS value in the SPAN FCoE source frame. The CoS value on the captured SPAN FCoE frame should be ignored.
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)The class-fcoe cannot be removed even if Fibre Channel is not enabled on a switch.
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)If a port drains traffic at a rate less than 100 Kbps, it is errdisabled in 10 seconds to avoid buffer exhaustion. However, if the drain rate is larger than 100 Kbps, the port may not be consistently errdisabled within 10 seconds which exhaust ingress buffers and discard frames. Use the **shut** command to disable the slow-draining port.
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)The multicast storm control functionality in the Cisco Nexus 5000 Series does not distinguish between IP, non-IP, registered, or unregistered multicast traffic. All multicast traffic is subject to a single-multicast storm control policer when configured.
>
>
> ### IGMP Snooping Limitation
>
> On the Cisco Nexus 5010 switch and the Cisco Nexus 5020 switch with a Cisco Nexus 2000 Series Fabric Extender (FEX) installed, unregistered IP multicast packets on one VLAN are forwarded to other VLANs where IGMP snooping is disabled. We recommend that you do not disable IGMP snooping on the Cisco Nexus 5010 switch and the Cisco Nexus 5020 switch. A static IGMP join can be configured for devices intended to receive IP multicast traffic but not to send IGMP join requests. This limitation applies to the Cisco Nexus 5010 switch and the Cisco Nexus 5020 switch only.
>
>
>
> ### SPAN Limitations on Fabric Extender Ports
>
> The SPAN limitations on Fabric Extender ports are as follows:
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)On a Cisco Nexus 5000 Series switch, if the SPAN source is a FEX port then the frames will always be tagged when leaving the SPAN destination.
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)On a Cisco Nexus 5010 switch or a Nexus 5020 switch, if the SPAN source is an access port on a switch port or FEX port, the spanned frames at the SPAN destination will be tagged.
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)On a Cisco Nexus 5010 switch or a Nexus 5020 switch, if the span source is an access port on a switch port or FEX port, the spanned frames at the SPAN destination will be tagged.
>

> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)When a FEX port is configured as a tx-source, the multicast traffic on all VLANs for which the tx-source port is a member, is spanned. The FEX port sends out only multicast packets that are not filtered by IGMP snooping. For example, if FEX ports 100/1/1-12 are configured on VLAN 11 and the switch port 1/5 sends multicast traffic on VLAN 11 in a multicast group, and hosts connected to FEX ports 100/1/3-12 are interested in receiving that multicast traffic (through IGMP), then that multicast traffic goes out on FEX ports 100/1/3-12, but not on 100/1/1-2.
>
> If you configure SPAN Tx on port 100/1/1, although the multicast traffic does not egress out of port 100/1/1, the SPAN destination does receive that multicast traffic, which is due to a design limitation.
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)When a FEX port is configured as both SPAN rx-source and tx-source, the broadcast, non-IGMP Layer-2 multicast, and unknown unicast frames originating from that port may be seen twice on the SPAN destination, once on the ingress and once on the egress path. On the egress path, the frames are filtered by the FEX to prevent them from going out on the same port on which they were received. For example, if FEX port 100/1/1 is configured on VLAN 11 and is also configured as SPAN rx-source and tx-source and a broadcast frame is received on that port, the SPAN destination recognizes two copies of the frame, even though the frame is not sent back on port 100/1/1.
