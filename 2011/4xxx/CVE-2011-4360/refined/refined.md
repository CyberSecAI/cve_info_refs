Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2011-4360:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from how MediaWiki processed the `curid` parameter in requests to `index.php`. By manipulating this parameter, an attacker could potentially expose page titles on private wikis.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the disclosure of page titles from private wikis to unauthorized users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Enumeration of Page Titles:** Attackers could use this flaw to enumerate page titles on private MediaWiki installations by making batch requests with varying page IDs using the `curid` parameter.
*   **Privacy Violation:** Exposing page titles could reveal sensitive information about the content and structure of private wikis.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through specially crafted HTTP requests to `index.php` with manipulated `curid` parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the MediaWiki installation. No specific user role or privileges are needed to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   The fix involves redirecting users to `Special:BadTitle` if they lack the necessary permissions, preventing the exposure of page titles.
*   The issue was resolved by modifying the behavior of how MediaWiki handles the request context and title setting when the user doesn't have the appropriate permissions to view a specific page and uses the `curid` parameter.
*   The vulnerability also existed via the `oldid` parameter, allowing attackers to enumerate page titles and revisions. This was addressed alongside the `curid` vulnerability.

In summary, CVE-2011-4360 is an information disclosure vulnerability in MediaWiki that allows an unauthenticated attacker to enumerate page titles on private wikis through the `curid` parameter.
