Package        : mediawiki
Vulnerability  : multiple
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-1578 CVE-2011-1579 CVE-2011-1580 CVE-2011-1587
                 CVE-2011-4360 CVE-2011-4361
Debian Bug     : 650434

Several problems have been discovered in mediawiki, a website engine for
collaborative work.

CVE-2011-1578 CVE-2011-1587

   Masato Kinugawa discovered a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue, which
   affects Internet Explorer clients only, and only version 6 and
   earlier. Web server configuration changes are required to fix this
   issue. Upgrading MediaWiki will only be sufficient for people who use
   Apache with AllowOverride enabled.

   For details of the required configuration changes, see the upstream
   announcements:
  <http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/mediawiki-announce/2011-April/000096.html>
  <http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/mediawiki-announce/2011-April/000097.html>

CVE-2011-1579

   Wikipedia user Suffusion of Yellow discovered a CSS validation error
   in the wikitext parser. This is an XSS issue for Internet Explorer
   clients, and a privacy loss issue for other clients since it allows
   the embedding of arbitrary remote images.

CVE-2011-1580

   MediaWiki developer Happy-Melon discovered that the transwiki import
   feature neglected to perform access control checks on form submission.
   The transwiki import feature is disabled by default. If it is enabled,
   it allows wiki pages to be copied from a remote wiki listed in
   $wgImportSources. The issue means that any user can trigger such an
   import to occur.

CVE-2011-4360

   Alexandre Emsenhuber discovered an issue where page titles on private
   wikis could be exposed bypassing different page ids to index.php. In the
   case of the user not having correct permissions, they will now be redirected
   to Special:BadTitle.

CVE-2011-4361

   Tim Starling discovered that action=ajax requests were dispatched to the
   relevant function without any read permission checks being done. This could
   have led to data leakage on private wikis.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:1.12.0-2lenny9.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:1.15.5-2squeeze2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:1.15.5-5.

We recommend that you upgrade your mediawiki packages.

Subject: CVE request: mediawiki before 1.17.1

<http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/mediawiki-announce/2011-November/000104.html>

From announce mail:

-------------
I would like to announce the release of MediaWiki 1.17.1. Two security
issues were discovered.

Alexandre Emsenhuber discovered an issue where page titles on private
wikis could be exposed bypassing different page ids to index.php. In the
case of the user not having correct permissions, they will now be
redirected to Special:BadTitle.

For more details, see
<https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=32276>

The second issue was found by Tim Starling, who discovered that
action=ajax requests were dispatched to the relevant function without
any read permission checks being done. This could have led to data
leakage on private wikis.

For more details, see
<https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=32616>

Please assign two CVEs.

oldid appears to allow a similar data-exposure attack; you'd have to iterate through more things but you could get a basic list of page titles along with the page & revision id numbers.

Looks straightforward enough. Pinging Sam to see if we can get this into 1.18.

I am not sure what is the release process for security bugs :-(

At the very minimal it needs to be reviewed and deployed live first. Might need a backport in 1.17 too and immediate release of 1.17.X.

The RELEASE-NOTES entry is in the wrong section, it should be in "Changes since 1.17.0".

Tim is working on a security release now around this bug. We'll probably hold 1.18.0 final for this fix.

I applied the patch to trunk, and found that there were still two instances of the actual title in the page. I haven't tested the branches, but on the face of it, it seems to be insufficient.

Maybe we should just do a redirect.

We can surely redirect the user to Special:Userlogin. The problem is that we will then loose all the various error messages logic which is handled in output page and just show a login page with no error message.

I could not find any instances of the real title despite Tim said so. I tried using ?oldid= and ?curid= and the title never show up :-(

+ $this->context->setTitle( SpecialPage::getTitleFor( 'Badtitle' ) );

This only affects things that actually use RequestContext, you didn't set $wgTitle. I had an extension enabled which uses $wgTitle in a head script.

Updated patch for trunk

Changes from Hashar's patch:

* Rewrote the comments
* The logic and comment in OutputPage.php didn't really make sense given that $this->getTitle() now returns Special:Badtitle for a private request, it doesn't return a private page title. Instead, unconditionally get the page title from the title parameter in the request.
* Use Title::newFromURL() when processing the title parameter, for consistency with Wiki.php.
* In SkinTemplate, fixed the returnto parameter in the login link, using similar code to OutputPage. It was pointing to Special:Badtitle. Still needs refactoring in a non-security commit, since the code is duplicated and $wgSecureLogin is (and was always) broken in OutputPage.
* If there was no title in the WebRequest, don't send returntoquery without returnto. This is more consistent since nothing else in the chain supports returntoquery without returnto (LoginForm::successfulLogin(), OutputPage::returnToMain()).

For the record: does NOT affect 1.15, and the backported patch (in Debianâ€™s package) does acutal harm. In 1.15 there is no information disclosure wrt. whether a page exists in this case.

1.15 is definitively affected by this, but it is not supported anymore, so the patch wasn't backported by us. What you are reporting concerns Debianâ€™s

package that we don't manage. Please contact the reponsible for that package, we can't do anything about this.

I would like to announce the release of MediaWiki 1.17.1. Two security
issues were discovered.

Alexandre Emsenhuber discovered an issue where page titles on private
wikis could be exposed bypassing different page ids to index.php. In the
case of the user not having correct permissions, they will now be redirected
to Special:BadTitle.

For more details, see <https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=32276>

The second issue was found by Tim Starling, who discovered that action=ajax
requests were dispatched to the relevant function without any read
permission checks being done. This could have led to data leakage on
private wikis.

For more details, see <https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=32616>
