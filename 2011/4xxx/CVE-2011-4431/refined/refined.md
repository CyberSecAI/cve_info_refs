```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Centreon web application allows remote code execution via the command help web page due to insufficient input validation. Additionally, user passwords are not hashed with a salt, making them vulnerable to reverse engineering.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Remote Command Execution",
    "Insecure Password Hashing (unsalted MD5/SHA1)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote command execution allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the web server, potentially leading to full system compromise. The unsalted password hashes can be reversed, allowing attackers to gain unauthorized access to user accounts.",
  "Attack vectors": "The primary attack vector is through crafted HTTP requests to the Centreon web interface, specifically the command help page.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have an account with access to \"Configuration > Nagios > Checks\" within the Centreon application. The attacker also needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the Centreon application."
