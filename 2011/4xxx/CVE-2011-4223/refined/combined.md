## Investintech.com SlimPDF Reader contains multiple vulnerabilities

#### Vulnerability Note VU#275036

Original Release Date: 2011-10-03 | Last Revised: 2011-11-29

---

### Overview

Investintech.com's [SlimPDF](http://www.investintech.com/resources/freetools/slimpdfreader/) viewer contains multiple vulnerabilities which may result in a denial of service and possibly arbitrary code execution.

### Description

| Investintech.com's [SlimPDF](http://www.investintech.com/resources/freetools/slimpdfreader/) viewer contains multiple vulnerabilities, which include; user mode write access violations, read access violations on block data moves, write addresses being controlled by data from faulting instructions, data from faulting addresses control branch selection, and tainted data is passed to function calls. These vulnerabilities may be exploitable to leverage arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the vulnerable application. If vulnerable code is shared among other Investintech.com products they may also be affected. It has been reported that the following applications are susceptible to a denial of service crash, which may possibly lead to arbitrary code execution: Able2Doc, Able2Doc Professional, Able2Extract, Absolute PDF Server, and Able2Extract Server. |
| --- |

### Impact

| By convincing a user to open an untrusted specially-crafted .PDF file, a remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the vulnerable application. |

### Solution

| **Apply an Update**  Investintech.com has released the following versions to address these issues in SlimPDF Reader and related products.Slim PDF Reader v1.0.1.12:<http://www.investintech.com/download/SPR/1.0.1.12/InstallSlimPDFReader.exe>Able2Doc Std 6.0.8.22:<http://www.investintech.com/download/A2E/7.0.8.22/InstallAble2Doc.exe>Able2Doc Pro 6.0.8.22:<http://www.investintech.com/download/A2E/7.0.8.22/InstallAble2DocPro.exe>Able2Extract Std 7.0.8.22:<http://www.investintech.com/download/A2E/7.0.8.22/InstallAble2Extract.exe>Able2Extract Pro 7.0.8.22:<http://www.investintech.com/download/A2E/7.0.8.22/InstallAble2ExtractPro.exe> |

| **Workarounds****Use the Microsoft Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit**The [Microsoft Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=c6f0a6ee-05ac-4eb6-acd0-362559fd2f04) (EMET) can be used to help prevent exploitation of these vulnerabilities.**Enable DEP in Microsoft Windows**Consider enabling Data Execution Prevention (DEP) in supported versions of Windows. DEP should not be treated as a complete workaround, but it can mitigate the execution of attacker-supplied code in some cases. Microsoft has published detailed technical information about DEP in Security Research & Defense blog posts "Understanding DEP as a mitigation technology" [part 1](http://blogs.technet.com/srd/archive/2009/06/05/understanding-dep-as-a-mitigation-technology-part-1.aspx) and [part 2](http://blogs.technet.com/srd/archive/2009/06/12/understanding-dep-as-a-mitigation-technology-part-2.aspx). DEP should be used in conjunction with the application of patches or other mitigations described in this document.Note that when relying on DEP for exploit mitigation, it is important to use a system that supports Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) as well. ASLR is not supported by Windows XP or Windows Server 2003 or earlier. ASLR was introduced with Microsoft Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008. Please see the Microsoft SRD blog entry: [On the effectiveness of DEP and ASLR](http://blogs.technet.com/b/srd/archive/2010/12/08/on-the-effectiveness-of-dep-and-aslr.aspx) for more details. |
