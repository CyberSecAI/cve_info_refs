{
  "CVE-2011-4808": {
    "Description": "The provided content indicates the presence of multiple vulnerabilities in the Joomla! Component HM Community, including SQL injection, blind SQL injection, and persistent cross-site scripting (XSS).",
    "Root cause": "The component suffers from insecure handling of user input, leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities. Additionally, it allows for the storage of malicious code, resulting in persistent XSS vulnerabilities.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection",
      "Blind SQL Injection",
      "Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to the database (SQL injection), extract sensitive information (blind SQL injection) or execute malicious scripts within the application context, potentially compromising user accounts (XSS).",
    "Attack vectors": {
        "SQL Injection": "The SQL injection vulnerability is triggered via the 'id' parameter in the `index.php?option=com_hmcommunity&view=fnd_home` URL, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL queries.",
        "Blind SQL Injection": "The blind SQL injection is also triggered via the `index.php?option=com_hmcommunity&view=fnd_home` URL using the 'id' parameter by injecting SQL conditions such as `and @@version=5`.",
       "Persistent XSS": "The persistent XSS vulnerability can be exploited by creating a user account and inserting malicious code into profile input fields. The code will then be executed when a user views the attacker's profile `index.php?option=com_hmcommunity&view=fnd_profile&uid=155`"
    },
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable component. For the persistent XSS, the attacker needs to create an account. Knowledge of SQL is needed to exploit the SQL injection vulnerabilities."
