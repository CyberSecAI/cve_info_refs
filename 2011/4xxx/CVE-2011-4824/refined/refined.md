The provided content discusses several security vulnerabilities in Cacti 0.8.7g, as identified by a security team. These vulnerabilities are detailed below:

**Vulnerabilities:**
1. **Authentication Bypass Using SQL Injection:**
   - **Root cause:**  Improper sanitization of user input, specifically the `login_username` parameter in `index.php`, allows for SQL injection attacks.
   - **Weakness:** Lack of input validation and sanitization of user-provided data.
   - **Impact:** An attacker can potentially bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to the application.
   - **Attack vector:** Sending a crafted request to `/cacti/index.php` with a malicious value in the `login_username` parameter.
   - **Attacker capabilities:** Requires the ability to send HTTP requests to the Cacti web interface.

2. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
   - **Root cause:** Inadequate filtering of user input in `graph_settings.php` allows for injection of malicious scripts.
   - **Weakness:** Lack of input sanitization.
   - **Impact:** Attackers can execute malicious scripts in the context of the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or defacement.
   - **Attack vector:** Injecting malicious JavaScript through parameters in `/cacti/graph_settings.php`.
   - **Attacker capabilities:** Requires ability to send crafted HTTP requests to the Cacti web interface.

3. **Phishing Through URL Redirection:**
   - **Root cause:** The application redirects users to external sites based on the value of the `referer` parameter in `graph_settings.php` without proper validation.
   - **Weakness:** Allowing redirection to arbitrary URLs based on user-supplied input.
   - **Impact:**  Attackers can redirect users to a malicious site that may phish for credentials.
   - **Attack vector:** Crafting a request to `/cacti/graph_settings.php` with a malicious URL in the `referer` parameter.
   - **Attacker capabilities:** Requires ability to send crafted HTTP requests to the Cacti web interface.

4.  **Stored Cross-Site Scripting:**
    - **Root cause:** Improper sanitization of user input in `graph_settings.php` leading to the ability to store malicious scripts persistently in the application.
    - **Weakness:** Lack of output encoding.
    - **Impact:** Similar to regular XSS, but the malicious script is stored and executed whenever an affected page is loaded.
    - **Attack vector:** Injecting malicious JavaScript through parameters in `/cacti/graph_settings.php`.
    - **Attacker capabilities:** Requires ability to send crafted HTTP requests to the Cacti web interface.

5. **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):**
   - **Root cause:** Lack of CSRF protection in `logout.php`.
   - **Weakness:** Absence of anti-CSRF tokens or other mechanisms.
   - **Impact:** Attackers can trick authenticated users into performing unwanted actions, such as logging out, without their knowledge.
   - **Attack vector:**  Crafting a malicious request that is executed by an authenticated user, such as sending a crafted `logout.php` request.
   - **Attacker capabilities:** Requires the ability to lure a user into visiting a malicious page.

6. **Inadequate Account Lockout:**
    - **Root cause:** No lockout mechanism after several failed login attempts using the `login_password` parameter in `index.php`.
    - **Weakness:** Lack of brute-force protection mechanisms.
    - **Impact:** Allows an attacker to perform brute-force attacks on user accounts.
    - **Attack vector:** Sending multiple login attempts to `/cacti/index.php` with invalid credentials.
    - **Attacker capabilities:** Requires ability to send HTTP requests to the Cacti login page.

7. **Phishing Through Frames:**
   - **Root cause:** Insufficient filtering of the `num_columns` parameter in `graph_settings.php`, which may allow framing the page in an external site.
   - **Weakness:**  Improper handling of user-provided input that influences the display of the application.
   - **Impact:**  Attackers can use frames to overlay malicious content on top of the Cacti interface, potentially phishing user credentials.
   - **Attack vector:** Crafting a request to `/cacti/graph_settings.php` with a malicious value in the `num_columns` parameter.
   - **Attacker capabilities:** Requires ability to send crafted HTTP requests to the Cacti web interface.
