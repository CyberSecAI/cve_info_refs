- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Jetty Web Server, a third-party component embedded in VMware vSphere Update Manager, is configured in a way that allows for directory traversal. This is a variant of a previous directory traversal issue.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Directory traversal vulnerability in the Jetty Web Server component.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially access files and directories outside of the intended web server root, potentially leading to information disclosure or other unauthorized access. The specific impact is not detailed.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the exposed Jetty web server component within vSphere Update Manager.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need to be able to send requests to the vulnerable Jetty web server. No specific attacker position requirements are described in the document but the attacker likely needs to be on the same network or have network access to the server hosting vSphere Update Manager.
