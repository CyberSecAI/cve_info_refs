You can still figure it out bywatching the files in /dev/pts/ and /dev/tty* for changes in last-modifytime.This whack-a-mole  "turn off permissions on generally useful files becausethere's an exposure" really has to stop.  On probably the vast majority ofLinux systems, it's an embedded or a laptop/desktop, and if you have amalicious user running code on it already, the fact they can find out how manycharacters are in the password is the *least* of your problems.This sort of thing needs to be done as part of an overall security model(in other words, something like Smack or SELinux should be moderatingthe accesses in a more fine-grained manner than "chmod it to 0").And if you're worried about them knowing the length of the password, youprobably should be using appropriate PAM configurations to enforce a minimumlength/complexity high enough that even if they know the password is 23characters long, it doesn't do them any real good...[unhandled content-type:application/pgp-signature] ``` | \ |
