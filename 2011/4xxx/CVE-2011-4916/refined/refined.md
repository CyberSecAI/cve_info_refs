Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-4916:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from information disclosure through the `/dev/pts/` and `/dev/tty*` files. Specifically, the last-modified timestamp of these files changes when characters are typed on the associated terminal. This timing information can be used to infer the number of characters typed, potentially revealing the length of passwords or other sensitive input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Information Leak:** The core issue is the exposure of timing information related to terminal activity via file modification times.
- **Lack of Access Control:** The default file permissions on `/dev/pts/` and `/dev/tty*` allowed unauthorized users to access this information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Password Length Inference:** An attacker can infer the length of passwords entered by a user. Knowing the exact length, especially for shorter or predictable passwords, reduces the search space for brute-force attacks.
- **Information Disclosure:** The modification times of these files can leak other sensitive user input if a malicious user is monitoring the files.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system to monitor the modification time of the `/dev/pts/` or `/dev/tty*` files.
- **File Monitoring:** The attacker must monitor the files for changes in the last-modified time. This can be done using system calls or scripting.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local User Account:** The attacker must have a user account on the target system.
- **Ability to Execute Code:** The attacker needs to be able to execute code that can monitor file modification times.
- **Access to TTY Files:** The attacker needs read access to the `/dev/pts/` and `/dev/tty*` files

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided content suggests this is part of a broader discussion about information leaks in the `/proc` filesystem and device files.
- The vulnerability is not exploitable remotely without first obtaining local access.
- The content mentions that this is a "whack-a-mole" situation, suggesting there are other similar information leaks and that relying solely on file permissions is not sufficient for a comprehensive security model.
