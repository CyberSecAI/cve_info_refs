| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 7.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 6.4 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: 6.4 |

Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities.    Workarounds that mitigate these vulnerabilities are available.          This advisory is available at the following link:   <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20120229-cucm>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable ProductsThe following products are affected by the vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory:   + Cisco Unified Communications Manager Software versions 6.x   + Cisco Unified Communications Manager Software versions 7.x   + Cisco Unified Communications Manager Software versions 8.x   + Cisco Business Edition 3000   + Cisco Business Edition 5000   + Cisco Business Edition 6000**Note**: Cisco Unified Communications Manager version 6.1 reached the End of Software Maintenance on September 3, 2011. Customers using Cisco Unified Communications Manager Software versions 6.x, should contact their Cisco support team for assistance in upgrading to a supported version of Cisco Unified Communications Manager.Products Confirmed Not VulnerableNo other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Details  * Cisco Unified Communications Manager is the call processing component of the Cisco IP Telephony solution that extends enterprise telephony features and functions to packet telephony network devices, such as IP phones, media processing devices, VoIP gateways, and multimedia applications.      Cisco Unified Communications Manager contains two vulnerabilities that involve the processing of SCCP packets. These issues may allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker with the ability to send crafted SCCP messages to an affected device to cause a reload or execute attacker-controlled SQL code. Both SCCP ports (TCP ports 2000 and 2443) are affected.      **Cisco Unified Communications Manager SCCP Registration may Cause Reload**    Cisco Unified Communication Manager may reload when a specially crafted SCCP message is processed. Successful exploitation could cause a loss of all voice services that are being handled by the affected device. After the device restarts, voice services will be restored. This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCtu73538](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtu73538) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2011-4486.      **Cisco Unified Communications Manager Vulnerable to Blind SQL Injection During Registration**    Cisco Unified Communications Manager may allow the blind execution of attacker-controlled SQL code when processing a specially crafted SCCP message. Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to modify certain sections of the SQL database that are utilized by the device. This vulnerability is also documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCtu73538](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtu73538) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2011-4487.  Workarounds  * Administrators can mitigate these vulnerabilities limiting access to TCP ports 2000 and 2443 to only allow traffic from networks that require SCCP access to Cisco Unified Communications Manager appliances.  Additional mitigation techniques that can be deployed on Cisco devices within the network are available in the Cisco Applied Mitigation Bulletin companion document for this advisory:  <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoAppliedMitigationBulletin/cisco-amb-20120229-cucm>  Fixed Software  * When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories and Responses archive at <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.         | Cisco Unified Communication Manager Version | First Fixed Release |   | --- | --- |   | 6.x | Vulnerable; migrate to 7.1(5b)su5 or later |   | 7.x | 7.1(5b)su5; available April 6, 2012 |   | 8.0 | 8.0(3a)su3 |   | 8.5 | Vulnerable; migrate to 8.6(2a)su1 |   | 8.6 | 8.6(2a)su1; available in March 2012 |   | Cisco Business Edition 3000 Software | 8.6.3 |   | Cisco Business Edition 5000 Software | 8.6(2a)su1; available in March 2012 |   | Cisco Business Edition 6000 Software | 8.6(2a)su1; available in March 2012 |       Cisco Unified Communications Manager Software can be downloaded at the following link: <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/support/downloads/go/Redirect.x?mdfid=268439621>  Cisco Business Edition Software can be downloaded at the following link: <http://www.cisco.com/cisco/software/navigator.html?mdfid=283661240&i=rm>  Exploitation and Public Announcements  * These vulnerabilities were publicly disclosed on Bugtraq on November 8, 2011.
