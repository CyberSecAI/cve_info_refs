Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2011-4201:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the `remote_support.cgi` script of the Tadasoft Restorepoint appliance's evaluation image (version 3.2).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Code Injection:** The script is vulnerable to code injection via the `pid1` or `pid2` parameters when used in conjunction with the `stop_remote_support` parameter. By injecting a semicolon followed by a Unix shell command, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable without authentication on port 443, prior to license activation.
*   **Insecure File Permissions:** The system uses sudo to run a number of scripts with root access. These scripts can be modified by the www user, allowing for a direct path to root access. This is related to CVE-2011-4202

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Command Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the Restorepoint appliance with the privileges of the `www` user.
*   **Root Access:** Due to the vulnerable Linux kernel and insecure use of `sudo`, achieving root access is considered trivial.
*   **Compromise of Backed-Up Data:** The Restorepoint appliance stores credentials for network devices it backs up, which could allow an attacker to reconfigure network devices.
*   **Lateral Movement:** A compromised Restorepoint appliance can be used as a launchpad to attack other parts of the network.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Restorepoint appliance on port 443.
*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker sends a specially crafted HTTP request to the `remote_support.cgi` script, including the code injection payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs to be able to connect to the Restorepoint appliance on port 443. This could be within the same network or, if exposed, from the internet.
*   **Technical Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of HTTP request manipulation and basic Unix shell commands to craft the attack.
*   **Timing:** The vulnerability is exploitable in the period between powering up the appliance and before license activation.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects the evaluation version of the Restorepoint software.
*   The vendor claims the vulnerability is not present in licensed versions and that the evaluation image would be patched automatically upon license activation.
*   The vendor was notified, and a patch was available.
*   The advisory suggests mitigating the issue by activating the license or restricting access to port 443.
