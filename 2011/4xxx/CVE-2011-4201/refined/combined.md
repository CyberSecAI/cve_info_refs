### VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT

**Cost-effective Security Assessments Managed by our senior security consultants.**

External Vulnerability Scanning is a crucial part of every security programme. However, budgets do not always allow for the cost of an extensive consultancy-based Penetration Test.

Cost-effective automated scanners go some way to resolving this issue, but the limitations of automated systems are well-documented and understood. The reports produced contain multiple false positives, and it becomes the responsibility of the client to work through the issues to determine the real issues from the false ones. On a typical external network of 64 IP addresses, this can take between one and three full-time days for someone will the skills and up-to-date knowledge to perform.

### Penetration TESTING

Which Penetration Test is Right for You? Penetration Testing can include so many different elements, that the first challenge is first deciding what tests should be commissioned.

Matta has advisors, which can help you scope the requirements based on your objectives, budget and timescale. In a perfect world all the requirements can be met with the existing budget you had in mind. If this is not possible, however, we can suggest ways to gain the most benefit, and prioritise activities.

External Penetration Test Conducting a penetration test on the public facing network is something most companies should consider doing at least annually. Apart from the obvious reasons of good compliance, it is important to supplement any VA work you may be doing with a full consultant based Penetration Test to ensure that your network is truly as robust as you think it may be from an attacker.

Restorepoint Remote root command execution vulnerability
Advisory ID: MATTA-2011-003
CVE reference:
CVE-2011-4201 - Code injection vulnerability
CVE-2011-4202 - Privilege escalation through insecure file permissions
Affected platforms: Tadasoft Restorepoint
Version: 3.2-evaluation
Date: 2011-October-20
Security risk: Critical
Vulnerability: Remote root command execution
Researcher: Tavaris Desamito
Vendor Status: Notified, Patch available
Vulnerability Disclosure Policy:
https://www.trustmatta.com/advisories/matta-disclosure-policy-01.txt
Permanent URL:
https://www.trustmatta.com/advisories/MATTA-2011-003.txt
=====================================================================
Introduction:
Restorepoint is a network appliance backup and disaster recovery system
from Tadasoft.
More information can be found on the following page:
http://www.restorepoint.com/restorepoint/
=====================================================================
Vulnerability:
The 3.2 evaluation image of Restorepoint is vulnerable to a remote command
execution vulnerability in the remote\_support.cgi script prior to license
activation. By supplying a semi colon followed by a unix shell command to
the pid1 or pid2 parameters in conjunction with the stop\_remote\_support
parameter, an unauthenticated remote attacker can execute commands on the
Restorepoint appliance with the privileges of the www user. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name
CVE-2011-4201 to this issue. This is a candidate for inclusion in
the CVE list (http://cve.mitre.org), which standardizes names for security
problems.
Given that the Restorepoint appliance uses a Linux kernel compiled in
2009, obtaining root access is trivial.
Furthermore, Restorepoint uses sudo in order to run a number of scripts with
root access. As a large number of these scripts can be modified by the www
user, root access can be obtained directly through Restorepoint
functionality, without relying on additional exploits. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name
CVE-2011-4202 to this issue.
=====================================================================
Impact:
Anyone who is able to connect to Restorepoint on port 443 between powering up
the appliance and before the appliance is license activated is able to obtain
root level shell access to the appliance.
The Restorepoint appliance is used to back up the configurations of network
devices and as such, the Restorepoint appliance holds credentials for all the
devices it backs up; Which in most cases will be privileged accounts that will
allow reconfiguration of the network devices.
If someone was able to compromise the security of the Restorepoint appliance
in the period between powering up the appliance and before the appliance is
license activated, an attacker is then able to go on to compromise the
security of all devices backed up by Restorepoint.
Having achieved this, an attacker may reposition and begin to compromise the
rest of the network by using the Restorepoint appliance to launch further
attacks.
=====================================================================
Versions affected:
Version 3.2 - evaluation image
The vendor reports that they maintain different trees for evaluation and
licensed copies of their software. The version available to licensed customers
is not vulnerable to this issue. Moreover, all appliances including
evaluations use a built-in auto-update mechanism upon license activation
that downloads additional software components and security updates which
ensures their customers are using the latest version of the product. The
vendor reports that the evaluation image would have been patched if the
evaluation license had been applied.
Matta have not confirmed this at this stage.
=====================================================================
Threat mitigation:
Anyone with evaluation versions of Restorepoint prior to 3.2 should activate
the license, at which point the software is automatically updated.
Matta suggests that affected parties running this version of the software
restrict access to port 443 on their Restorepoint appliances to only allow
trusted administrators to connect.
The vendor reports that the latest version available evaluation image
(3.3) is not vulnerable to this issue. Moreover, the vendor reports that
the 3.2 evaluation image would have been patched if an evaluation license
was applied.
In this case, Matta recommends that users activate their appliance to be
able to download the necessary software components and security updates.
