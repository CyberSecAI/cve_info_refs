Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-4343:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how Apache MyFaces handles navigation parameters when a redirect is triggered with `faces-redirect=true` and `includeViewParams=true` (or its alias `faces-include-view-params=true`). In this scenario, EL (Expression Language) expressions within the navigation parameters are not properly sanitized, allowing them to be injected directly into input fields mapped as view parameters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **EL Injection:** The core vulnerability is the ability to inject arbitrary EL expressions into view parameters. Because EL expressions are evaluated by the server, this allows an attacker to potentially execute arbitrary code or access sensitive data, depending on the context in which the expression is evaluated.
*   **Improper Input Handling:** The application fails to sanitize or properly handle EL expressions provided as parameters during navigation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary impact, as indicated in the description, is information disclosure. By injecting EL expressions, an attacker can potentially access and reveal sensitive data within the application's scope.
*   **Potential for other attacks:** Depending on the application and EL usage, this vulnerability could be exploited to execute arbitrary code on the server, leading to a full system compromise.
*   **Data manipulation:** In some cases, it could allow the modification of application data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Manipulated Navigation:** The attacker crafts a navigation request that includes both the `faces-redirect=true` and `includeViewParams=true` parameters.
*   **EL Injection:** The attacker embeds malicious EL expressions within the view parameters of the navigation request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to trigger navigation:** An attacker must be able to cause a navigation event within the application.
*   **Knowledge of the application:** The attacker needs to know which view parameters are vulnerable to EL injection and which EL expressions can be used to achieve the desired malicious outcome.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects MyFaces Core versions 2.0.1 to 2.0.10 and 2.1.0 to 2.1.4.
*   Patches were provided in versions 2.0.11 and 2.1.5, or a separate patch can be applied.
*   The provided example demonstrates how to reproduce the vulnerability with a simple bean and JSF view, showing how the injected EL expression would be evaluated.

The code changes provided show that the fix was to evaluate the EL expressions before using them in `NavigationCase`. The `NavigationUtils` class is introduced to handle the evaluation of the EL expressions. The `NavigationUtils.getEvaluatedNavigationParameters` method is called to evaluate the parameters before the URL is generated, preventing the injection.
