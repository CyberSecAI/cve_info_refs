Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2011-4718:

**Root Cause:**

*   The PHP session module was "adoptive," meaning it would accept and use a session ID even if it was not previously initialized or associated with a valid session.
*   This behavior stemmed from how web browsers handle cookies, where multiple cookies could be sent without clear domain or path association. This could lead to the wrong session ID being used.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Session Fixation:** The primary vulnerability was session fixation. An attacker could set a session ID (e.g., via a crafted URL or cookie) and force a user to use that ID. When the user logged in, their session would be associated with the attacker's controlled session ID.
*   **Cookie Handling Issues:** The vulnerability was exacerbated by inconsistencies in how browsers handle cookies and the lack of domain/path information when sending them to the server. This allowed for the possibility of "overriding" a legitimate session cookie with an attacker-supplied one.
*   **Lack of Session ID Validation:** The PHP session module did not validate the session ID against known valid sessions by default.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Session Hijacking:** Attackers could gain unauthorized access to a user's account and sensitive data by hijacking their session.
*   **Account Takeover:** In scenarios where session fixation is successful, the attacker could effectively take control of the user's account.
*   **Data Breach:** Compromised sessions could lead to the exposure of user data, both personally identifiable and potentially sensitive.
*   **Targeted DoS:** While not the primary issue, the fix introduces a potential for targeted denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. If an attacker could set a malicious cookie preventing new session IDs, the session module might continuously attempt to generate new IDs, rendering the session unusable.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Manually Setting Cookies:** Attackers could directly set session cookies via browser developer tools or by directly manipulating the cookie database.
*   **Malicious Links/URLs:** A malicious link could contain a session ID that the user's browser would then use.
*   **JavaScript Vulnerabilities:** Although less direct, attackers could also potentially use JavaScript to set a malicious session cookie if a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability existed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to set a Session ID:** The attacker must be able to set a cookie with a specific session ID in the victim's browser (via javascript, direct cookie manipulation or crafted url).
*   **Awareness of target application:** The attacker needs some knowledge of the target application and its session name.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix for this vulnerability introduced a `session.use_strict_mode` setting in PHP. When enabled, the session module validates the session ID against a known, initialized session.
*   The fix also included a `validate_sid()` function for session save handlers that allows them to check if the session ID is already initialized.
*   A further option, `session.safe_session_cookie`, was added to delete potentially malicious cookies that could prevent new session IDs, although this option is disabled by default due to potential compatibility problems
*   The vulnerability is described in CWE-384: Session Fixation and CAPEC-61: Session Fixation.

This is more detail than the official CVE description which just states "Session module is adoptive, so there are chances for session fixation due to adoption".
