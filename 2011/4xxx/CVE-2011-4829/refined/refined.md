Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2011-4829:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Joomla! component "Barter Sites" version 1.3 has both a SQL injection vulnerability and multiple persistent XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) vulnerabilities.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The `category_id` parameter in the `com_listing` component is vulnerable to SQL injection.
*   **Persistent XSS:**
    *   Multiple locations, including the listing title, website address, payment types, sell price, shipping cost, and quantity fields within the componentâ€™s post form, are susceptible to persistent XSS.
    *   XSS can also be inserted via the description field while uploading images.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:** An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to the database, allowing them to read, modify, or delete sensitive data.
*  **Persistent XSS:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts that will execute in the browsers of users who view the affected content. This can lead to various malicious outcomes, including session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious websites.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The `category_id` parameter is exploited via a crafted URL: `/index.php?option=com_listing&task=browse&category_id=1[SQL]`
*   **Persistent XSS:**
    *   By submitting a crafted listing title, with malicious Javascript:  `<IMG """><SCRIPT>alert("XSS")</SCRIPT>`
    *   By inserting malicious Javascript into form fields: website address, payment types, sell price, shipping cost and quantity fields.
    *    By inserting malicious Javascript into the description field when submitting an image.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable web application
*   **Persistent XSS:** An attacker must be able to interact with the component and post content. Registration is needed to post content, though the XSS is triggered when viewing the content, so it doesn't require special privileges to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content indicates that the vulnerabilities were discovered by Chris Russell.
*   The vendor was never notified about the vulnerability.
*   A newer version (1.3.1) has been released, addressing the issue.
