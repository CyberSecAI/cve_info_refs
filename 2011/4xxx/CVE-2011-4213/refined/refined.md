- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Google App Engine SDK for Python had multiple vulnerabilities that could be exploited to achieve remote code execution on a developer's machine. These include CSRF vulnerabilities in the admin console and weaknesses in the restriction mechanisms for file access and os module access.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    -   **CSRF in Admin Console**: The SDK's admin console was vulnerable to CSRF attacks, allowing an attacker to perform actions on behalf of a victim by redirecting their browser to the console. Specifically, the Interactive Console page allowed arbitrary code execution.
    -   **Improper security restrictions in FakeFile object**: The FakeFile object, intended to control file open actions, could be manipulated by rewriting `ALLOWED_MODES` and `ALLOWED_DIRS`. This allowed attackers to create or overwrite arbitrary files on the system.
    -   **Direct access to original os object**: Despite attempting to restrict os.popen, the original os module was still accessible, enabling attackers to execute system commands.
    -   **Access to os object through `google.appengine.api.blobstore.os`**: Similar to the previous point, the original os module could be accessed via the `file_blob_storage.os` object within the blobstore API.
-   **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers could achieve full remote code execution on the developer's machine. This would allow them to execute arbitrary code, create or overwrite files, and potentially compromise the entire system.
-   **Attack vectors**:
    -   **CSRF**: An attacker could lure a victim to their website and then redirect the victim's browser to the vulnerable admin console page to execute malicious code.
    -   **Code Execution**: By exploiting the weaknesses in the file access restrictions or the access to the original `os` module, attackers could execute arbitrary code on the victim’s machine. This could be done through the CSRF vulnerability.
-   **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    -   The attacker needs to be able to lure a victim to visit a malicious website while the victim is running a vulnerable Google App Engine development server.
    -   The attacker needs to be able to send a POST request to the victim’s local server with malicious code.
