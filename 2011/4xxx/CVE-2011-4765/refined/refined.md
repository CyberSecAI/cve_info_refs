## CVE-2011-4765 Analysis

**1. Verification:**
The provided content directly references CVE-2011-4765 and describes it as "Cookie without HttpOnly flag set". This aligns with the official description of CVE-2011-4765 which would relate to cookies missing the HttpOnly flag, therefore this content is considered relevant to the specified CVE.

**2. Extracted Information:**

   - **Root Cause:** The application issues cookies without the `HttpOnly` flag set.

   - **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The absence of the `HttpOnly` flag makes the cookies vulnerable to access through client-side JavaScript.

   -  **Impact of Exploitation:**
      - Cookies can be read and possibly manipulated via client-side JavaScript attacks, such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
      - Session tokens stored in these cookies could be compromised, potentially allowing for session hijacking by an attacker.

   -  **Attack Vectors:**
      - An attacker could leverage Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities or other methods to execute JavaScript within the user's browser.

   - **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
      - An attacker needs to be able to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's session with the vulnerable application. This could potentially be achieved by exploiting other vulnerabilities on the server.

   - **Additional Details:**
      - The report identifies 37 instances of this issue, across various URLs of the Plesk Small Business Manager.
      - The `SessionID` cookie appears to store session tokens and was seen without the HttpOnly flag set.
      - The report does not specify any way to directly exploit this vulnerability other than XSS.
