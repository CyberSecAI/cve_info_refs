  "CVE-2011-4605": {
    "description": "It was found that the JBoss JNDI service allows unauthenticated remote write access by default. The JNDI service, HA-JNDI service and HAJNDIFactory invoker servlet are all affected. A remote attacker that is able to access port 1099 (JNDI), port 1100 (HA-JNDI) or the HAJNDIFactory invoker servlet on a JBoss server could exploit this flaw to add, delete and modify items in the JNDI tree. This could lead to a wide range of attacks, affecting the integrity, availability and confidentiality of the system.",
