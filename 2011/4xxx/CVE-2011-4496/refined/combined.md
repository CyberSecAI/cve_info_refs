## Aviosoft DTV Player buffer overflow vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#998403

Original Release Date: 2011-11-08 | Last Revised: 2011-11-09

---

### Overview

Aviosoft DTV Player contains a buffer overflow in the handling of playlist (.plf) files, which can allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.

### Description

| [Aviosoft DTV Player](http://www.aviosoft.com/dtv-player.html) is a multiple format video player application. Aviosoft DTV Player 1.0.1.2 and possibly earlier versions fail to properly handle malformed user-supplied data within a playlist (.plf) file before copying it into an insufficiently sized buffer, resulting in a buffer overflow. |
| --- |

### Impact

| By causing the Aviosoft DTV Player to parse a specially-crafted playlist (.plf) file, a remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the application using the application. |
| --- |

### Solution

| We are currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem. |
| --- |

| **Use the Microsoft Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit**The [Microsoft Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit](http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=1677) (EMET) can be used to help prevent exploitation of these vulnerabilities.**Enable DEP in Microsoft Windows**Consider enabling Data Execution Prevention (DEP) in supported versions of Windows. DEP should not be treated as a complete workaround, but it can mitigate the execution of attacker-supplied code in some cases. Microsoft has published detailed technical information about DEP in Security Research & Defense blog posts "Understanding DEP as a mitigation technology" [part 1](http://blogs.technet.com/srd/archive/2009/06/05/understanding-dep-as-a-mitigation-technology-part-1.aspx) and [part 2](http://blogs.technet.com/srd/archive/2009/06/12/understanding-dep-as-a-mitigation-technology-part-2.aspx). DEP should be used in conjunction with the application of patches or other mitigations described in this document.Note that when relying on DEP for exploit mitigation, it is important to use a system that supports Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) as well. ASLR is not supported by Windows XP or Windows Server 2003 or earlier. ASLR was introduced with Microsoft Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008. Please see the Microsoft SRD blog entry: [On the effectiveness of DEP and ASLR](http://blogs.technet.com/b/srd/archive/2010/12/08/on-the-effectiveness-of-dep-and-aslr.aspx) for more details. |
