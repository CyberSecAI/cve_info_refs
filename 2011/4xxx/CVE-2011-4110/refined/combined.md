Subject: CVE-2011-4110 kernel: keys: NULL pointer deref in the user-defined
 key type

There is a NULL pointer deref in the user-defined key type whereby
updating a negative key into a fully instantiated key will cause
an oops to occur when the code attempts to free the non-existent
old payload.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# USN-1328-1: Linux kernel (Marvell DOVE) vulnerabilities

13 January 2012

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 10.10](/security/notices?release=maverick)

## Packages

* [linux-mvl-dove](/security/cves?package=linux-mvl-dove) - Linux kernel for DOVE

## Details

Clement Lecigne discovered a bug in the HFS filesystem. A local attacker

could exploit this to cause a kernel oops. ([CVE-2011-2203](/security/CVE-2011-2203))

A flaw was found in how the Linux kernel handles user-defined key types. An

unprivileged local user could exploit this to crash the system.

([CVE-2011-4110](/security/CVE-2011-4110))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 10.10

* [linux-image-2.6.32-422-dove](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-mvl-dove)
  -
  [2.6.32-422.40](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-mvl-dove/2.6.32-422.40)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

# USN-1324-1: Linux kernel (EC2) vulnerabilities

11 January 2012

Two security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [linux-ec2](/security/cves?package=linux-ec2) - Linux kernel for EC2

## Details

Clement Lecigne discovered a bug in the HFS filesystem. A local attacker

could exploit this to cause a kernel oops. ([CVE-2011-2203](/security/CVE-2011-2203))

A flaw was found in how the Linux kernel handles user-defined key types. An

unprivileged local user could exploit this to crash the system.

([CVE-2011-4110](/security/CVE-2011-4110))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 10.04

* [linux-image-2.6.32-342-ec2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ec2)
  -
  [2.6.32-342.43](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ec2/2.6.32-342.43)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

# USN-1344-1: Linux kernel vulnerabilities

24 January 2012

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

Clement Lecigne discovered a bug in the HFS filesystem. A local attacker

could exploit this to cause a kernel oops. ([CVE-2011-2203](/security/CVE-2011-2203))

A flaw was found in how the Linux kernel handles user-defined key types. An

unprivileged local user could exploit this to crash the system.

([CVE-2011-4110](/security/CVE-2011-4110))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).
