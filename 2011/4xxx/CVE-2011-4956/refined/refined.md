Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2011-4956:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is that certain unspecified input was not properly sanitized before being returned to the user. This lack of sanitization allowed for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The primary vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) flaw. This is due to the lack of sanitization of user-supplied input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary HTML and Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary HTML and script code within a user's browser session.
- **Context of Affected Site:** This execution occurs within the security context of the vulnerable website. This means the attacker could potentially perform actions as the logged in user, steal cookies, redirect users to malicious sites etc.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Unspecified Input:** The exact attack vector is not specified, but the vulnerability lies in how the application processes and displays user-provided input. This suggests that the attack would likely be through manipulated user-controlled input fields.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to be able to introduce malicious input into the vulnerable application. This might involve commenting, posting or other areas that allows users to supply information.
- The attacker could be remote, and no special privileges would be required.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was present in WordPress versions prior to 3.1.1 and was addressed in the 3.1.1 release.
- The specific function or area of the code where sanitization was missing is not explicitly detailed in the provided text.
