How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Two issues in 3.1.1 are without 2011 CVE-identifiers, which are announced in here: <http://wordpress.org/news/2011/04/wordpress-3-1-1/> (April 5, 2011).

Issue #1:

<http://osvdb.org/show/osvdb/72141>
<http://secunia.com/advisories/44038/>

"Certain unspecified input is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site."

Issue #2:

<http://osvdb.org/show/osvdb/72142>
<http://secunia.com/advisories/44038/>

"The "make_clickable()" function in wp-includes/formatting.php does not properly check the URL length in comments before passing it to the PCRE library, which can be exploited to cause a crash."

Both vulnerabilities are reported in versions prior to 3.1.1.

# WordPress 3.1.1

---

[WordPress 3.1.1](https://wordpress.org/download/) is now available. This maintenance and security release fixes [almost thirty issues](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&resolution=fixed&milestone=3.1.1&group=resolution&order=priority "Bugs fixed in 3.1.1") in 3.1, including:

* Some security hardening to media uploads
* Performance improvements
* Fixes for IIS6 support
* Fixes for taxonomy and PATHINFO (/index.php/) permalinks
* Fixes for various query and taxonomy edge cases that caused some plugin compatibility issues

Version 3.1.1 also addresses three security issues discovered by WordPress core developers [Jon Cave](http://joncave.co.uk/) and [Peter Westwood](http://blog.ftwr.co.uk/), of our security team. The first hardens CSRF prevention in the media uploader. The second avoids a PHP crash in certain environments when handling devilishly devised links in comments, and the third addresses an XSS flaw.

We suggest you update to 3.1.1 promptly. [Download 3.1.1](https://wordpress.org/download/) or update automatically from the Dashboard → Updates menu in your site’s admin area.

Our release haiku:

Only the geeks know

What half this stuff even means

Don’t worry — update

Debian Bug     : 670124

Several vulnerabilities were identified in Wordpress, a web blogging
tool.  As the CVEs were allocated from releases announcements and
specific fixes are usually not identified, it has been decided to
upgrade the Wordpress package to the latest upstream version instead
of backporting the patches.

This means extra care should be taken when upgrading, especially when
using third-party plugins or themes, since compatibility may have been
impacted along the way.  We recommend that users check their install
before doing the upgrade.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), those problems have been fixed in
version 3.3.2+dfsg-1~squeeze1.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), those problems have been fixed in version 3.3.2+dfsg-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your wordpress packages.
