Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-4181:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how the open build service (OBS) handles source access permissions when copying packages. Specifically, the issue arises when a package link is constructed with a `_link` file referring to another project, but without specifying a package target. This allows an attacker to exploit the server-side package copy mechanism by renaming a package using the name of a source access-protected package from a different project.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Access Control:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper access control enforcement during package copying operations. The system fails to verify if the user has the necessary permissions to access the source of the target package in the foreign project, especially when a `_link` file is involved.
*   **Insecure Package Linking:** The way package links are constructed and handled (specifically the missing package target) introduces a vulnerability that can be exploited for unauthorized source access.
*   **Server-Side Package Copy Misuse:** The server-side copy mechanism is used without sufficient checks, allowing for the renaming of packages under restricted names, thus bypassing source access protection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Leak:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the source code of packages that are supposed to be protected by source access restrictions. This would lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, potentially including intellectual property, security vulnerabilities, or other proprietary data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Package Link Construction:** The attacker needs to construct a specially crafted package link that refers to a source access-protected package in another project using the `_link` file without a package target.
*   **Server-Side Package Copy Trigger:** The attacker has to trigger the server-side package copy/rename mechanism.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have an account on the OBS instance.
*   The attacker needs to have the ability to create and manipulate package links, specifically using the `_link` file.
*   The attacker needs to have the ability to trigger the server-side package copy mechanism, most likely by initiating a rename.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to OBS versions prior to 2.1.15 and 2.3.
*   The fix was implemented in version 2.1.16 with commit `614e7fba23c2007cd486cac624d47f18cc5a5533`.
