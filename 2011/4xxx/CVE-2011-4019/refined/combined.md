  Introduction

Introduction

This Service Update (SU) ReadMe file contains important information about installation procedures and
resolved caveats for Cisco Unified Communications Manager release 7.1(5b)su5. The SU can be applied
to Cisco Unified Communications Manager, Business Edition and Cisco Unity Connection.

System Requirements

The following sections comprise the system requirements for this release of Cisco Unified CM.

Server Support
Make sure that you install and configure this service update on a Cisco Media Convergence Server
(MCS) or a Cisco-approved HP server configuration or a Cisco-approved IBM server configuration.

To find which servers support Cisco Unified CM Release 7.1(5), refer to the Cisco Unified
Communications Manager Server Support Matrix at

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/voicesw/ps6790/ps5748/ps378/prod_brochure0900aecd80
62a4f9.html

Note Make sure that the matrix shows that your server model supports Cisco Unified CM Release 7.1(5).

Uninterruptible Power Supply
Ensure that you connect each Unified CM node to an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) to provide
backup power and protect your system.

Caution

Failure to connect the Cisco Unified Communication Manager nodes to a UPS may result in damage to
physical media and require a new installation of Cisco Unified CM.

Version and Description

This Service Update is a cumulative update that incorporates all of the fixes and changes from Cisco
Unified Communications Manager 7.1(5), 7.1(5a), 7.1(5b), 7.1(5)su1, 7.1(5)su1a, 7.1(5b)su2,
7.1(5b)su3, 7.1(5b)su4, along with additional changes that are specific to this Service Update.

Note

The installation file described in this readme only applies for installing this Service Update on Cisco Unified
Communications Manager Release 6.1(3x), 6.1(4x), 6.1(5x), 7.0(2x), 7.1(2x), 7.1(3x), 7.1(5), 7.1(5a),
7.1(5b), 7.1(5)su1, 7.1(5)su1a, 7.1(5b)su2, 7.1(5b)su3, 7.1(5b)su4 or any 7.1(5)es from 7.1.5.11001-6 to

  Important Notes

Important Notes

Service Updates do not impact system compatibility unless specifically stated.

Cisco provides the following guidance to help you successfully upgrade Cisco Unified Communications
Manager software:

  • To minimize call-processing interruptions during the upgrade process, register all devices to servers
that are running the same version of Cisco Unified Communications Manager software. Make sure
that you register all devices to the backup Cisco Unified Communications Manager server or to the
primary Cisco Unified Communications Manager server, but not to both the backup and primary
servers.

Performance Impact to Contact Center, CCMAdmin, and Extension Mobility users.

An issue exists in some versions of Cisco Unified Communications Manager where, in some situations,
large amounts of memory are consumed by the Tomcat service.  If not addressed, this issue can disrupt
web services which include the CCMAdmin and CCMUser web sites, Extension Mobility operations,
and Cisco Unified Contact Center agent logins.  Please see the Bug Details for the following defect for
a detailed description of this issue and the steps required to address it:

CSCtj50884 : Tomcat - java.lang.OutOfMemoryError due to large number of RTMT requests

Firmware Upgrade Issues

For all SCCP and SIP firmware upgrades from firmware release versions earlier than 8.3(3) to version
8.5(2)SR1 or greater, you must first upgrade your firmware to version 8.5(2). Once you have upgraded
to version 8.5(2), you can upgrade your IP Phone to version 8.5(2)SR1 or later. Refer to the Firmware
Versions in this Release section of this document to determine the firmware load provided in this Service
Update.

For additional details, Firmware Upgrade Instructions, and Firmware Download locations please see:

  Before You Begin

Before You Begin

Before you upgrade the software version of Cisco Unified Communications Manager, verify your
current software version.

To do that, open Cisco Unified Communications Manager Administration. The following information
displays:

  • Cisco Unified Communications Manager Administration System version

Installation Instructions

Note

Apply this Service Update to all of your Cisco Unified Communications Manager servers, beginning
with the publisher server and TFTP server.

Please refer to the “Upgrading to Cisco Unified Communications Manager 7.1(5b)” section of the Release
Notes for Cisco Unified Communications Manager Release 7.1(5b) for detailed information about doing
this upgrade:

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/voice_ip_comm/cucm/rel_notes/7_1_5/cucm-rel_notes-715b.pdf

Note

Because the 7.1.5.34900-7 build is a nonbootable ISO, it proves useful only for upgrades. You cannot use it
for new installations.

Release 7.1(5) is available in both restricted (which is the release type that has always been available from
Cisco) and unrestricted versions of software to comply with import / export restrictions to various coun-
tries. The unrestricted version is available in limited markets. Please refer to the 7.1(5b) Release Notes ref-
erenced above for a more detailed description.
Because the 7.1.5.34900-7 build is a nonbootable ISO, it proves useful only for upgrades. You cannot use it
for new installations.
