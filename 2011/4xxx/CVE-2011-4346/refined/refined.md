Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2011-4346:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a failure to properly sanitize user-supplied input within the "Custom System Info" feature of Red Hat Network Satellite's web interface. Specifically, the 'Description' field of the custom system information key was not being sanitized when displayed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS. By injecting malicious HTML or JavaScript code into the Description field of a custom system information key, an attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of other users' browsers when they view the affected page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows the attacker to execute arbitrary HTML or web script code in the browser of a user viewing the vulnerable page. This could lead to various malicious actions:
    *   **Session Hijacking:** Stealing user session cookies and gaining unauthorized access to their accounts.
    *   **Data Theft:** Accessing and exfiltrating sensitive information.
    *   **Phishing:** Redirecting users to malicious websites or displaying fake login forms to steal credentials.
    *   **Defacement:** Altering the content of the page the user is viewing.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the web interface of Red Hat Network Satellite. An attacker would need to:
    1.  Be an authenticated user of Red Hat Network Satellite.
    2.  Navigate to the 'Custom System Info' page.
    3.  Create or modify an asset tag or key using the 'Custom System Info' page and insert malicious HTML/JavaScript code into the Description field.
    4.  Wait for another authenticated user to view the "System Details" => "Details" => "Custom Info" page. When that page loads, the injected script executes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have valid login credentials for the Red Hat Network Satellite web interface. This indicates that this is not an unauthenticated attack.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Feature:** The attacker needs to be aware of the specific vulnerable page within the Satellite web interface.

**Additional Details from the Bugzilla Comments:**

*   **Affected Pages:** The vulnerability was initially identified in `/network/systems/details/custominfo/index.pxt` and later also found to be exploitable on `/network/systems/details/custominfo/edit.pxt`.
*   **Patching:** The provided patches involve using the `PXT::Utils->escapeHTML` function to properly encode the user-provided input, preventing the browser from interpreting it as executable code. This was applied in both Perl code as well as Java code (for later Spacewalk version).
*   **Spacewalk Issue:** The comments mention that newer versions of Spacewalk, which have the UI rewritten in Java, were not directly vulnerable to the XSS, but there were issues where special characters were being stripped when they should not be, this was addressed in patches to the Java code.
