**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Guest User Access:** The attacker must have guest user access to a vulnerable Moodle instance.
*   **Knowledge of URL Structure:** The attacker needs to know or be able to deduce the correct URL structure required to perform a global search.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The issue is considered a "Minor" severity by Moodle.
*   This vulnerability affects Moodle versions prior to 2.1.2 and 2.0.5. Version 1.9.x is not affected.
*   The fix for this issue is available in the linked commit, `5eb1cec34f013fdcb559b66bc401f2845ce0bbb7`.
