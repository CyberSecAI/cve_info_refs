### Bug Description

Oliver-Tobias Ripka reported a vulnerability in /etc/acpi/powerbtn.sh

that could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code as the user that

is logged into the current X session. The prerequisites for the attack

are as follows:

1.) The attacker must be able to run an application on the system.

2.) A power management daemon cannot be running. See $PMS in

powerbtn.sh for the list of known daemons.

3.) powerbtn.sh must be triggered. This may happen by pressing a power

button in a bare-metal installation or by virsh shutdown in a

virtualized environment.

Oliver-Tobias pointed us to this excerpt from line 40 of powerbtn.sh:

su - $XUSER -c "eval $(echo -n 'export '; cat /proc/$(pidof

kded4)/environ |tr '\0' '\n'|grep DBUS\_SESSION\_BUS\_ADDRESS); qdbus

org.kde.kded"

$(pidof kded4) returns the pid of any process(es) named kded4. Due to command

expansion, cat /proc/$(pidof kded4)/environ is ran as root, allowing the

environ of any process, owned by any user, to be successfully read.

The attacker may be running a "fake" kded4 binary which has a malicious

DBUS\_SESSION\_BUS\_ADDRESS environment variable. The variable could inject

shell commands that would be expanded as $XUSER. This opens up the

possibility of the attacker running code as $XUSER. The prerequisites

listed above must be met in order for the vulnerable code to be

exploited.

sbeattie suggested that su command could be changed to the following:

su - $XUSER -c 'eval $(echo -n "export "; grep -z DBUS\_SESSION\_BUS\_ADDRESS /proc/$(pidof kded4)/environ); qdbus org.kde.kded'

In the attack scenario, this causes the grep command to fail due to $XUSER not having permission to read /proc/$(pidof kded4)/environ. However, we may want to clean this up a little more because qdbus is still executed. sbeattie also pointed out that $(pidof kded4) returning multiple pids could be problematic.

And that's true.

For example, if I use ssh to access a remote machine, which is using KDE:

    ganton@t1:~$ pidof kded4

    12511 1382

those were two results returned.

For more information:

    ganton@t1:~$ ps aux | grep [1]2511

    root 12511 0.0 0.8 79700 5300 ? S Dec06 0:07 kdeinit4: kded4 [kdeinit]

    ganton@t1:~$ ps aux | grep [1]382

    ganton 1382 0.0 7.1 266424 45632 ? Sl Dec06 0:43 kdeinit4: kded4 [kdeinit]

we see that there are two process named "kded4", one for "root" and another for the user "ganton".

But if something like "pgrep -u" is used:

    ganton@t1:~$ pgrep "kded4" -u "$USER"

    1382

there is no "two results returned" problem.

I suggest changing those "pidof" that appear in the code (for example, in the patch).

Thanks for the work!

For more information:

    The "cat /proc/[...]/environ" method that is used now there... is said to cause problems:

    - "you have multiple hosts"

    - "when more than one X session is used"

Thanks for the suggestion, Ganton. The update did make the change from

pidof to pgrep. The script's new usage of pgrep uses the -n and -u

options.

That's a good point. However, this was strictly a security update that

focused on preventing powerbtn.sh from being fooled into executing code

provided by another user.

Completely changing how the DBUS session bus address is retrieved in all

of the ACPI scripts was outside of the scope for this update. You may

want to consider opening a separate bug for the issue you raised.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).
