## Unbound multiple denial-of-service vulnerabilities

#### Vulnerability Note VU#209659

Original Release Date: 2011-12-19 | Last Revised: 2011-12-19

---

### Overview

A specially crafted DNS query containing signed duplicate resource records or a malformed NSEC3 signed resource record may cause Unbound to crash.

### Description

| [NLnetLabs advisory](http://www.unbound.net/downloads/CVE-2011-4528.txt) states:  *== Description 1: crash on signed duplicate Resource Records**There are authoritative servers that erroneously send duplicated redirection Resource Records. Unbound has had a workaround that deals with this problem since version 1.0.1 whereby it ignores the duplicate answers. At the time, likely, no DNSSEC signed versions of such zones existed and only recently such misbehaving authority servers also started serving signed duplicate RRs causing improper memory allocation in a portion of the workaround code.**Referencing this improper allocated data causes a crash which can look like 'uninitialised lock', segmentation faults or free() errors as it tries to free memory that was never allocated.**== Description 2: crash on missing NSEC3 Resource Records.**If an authority server sends a reply for an NSEC3-signed zone, and Unbound is configured to validate that zone, then a malformed response can trigger an assertion failure: when an authority server sends a response that contains RR types that trigger special processing and where part of the non-existence proof is missing then an assertion failure is triggered in unbound. This response case was observed in the wild on authority servers that host zones at different points in the hierarchy at the same time.**The code crashes at assertion failure validator/val\_nsec3.c:1214: nsec3\_do\_prove\_nodata: assertion ce.nc\_rrset failed Or, if assertions are not compiled it, it crashes soon after as it attempts to access an expected NSEC3 RR.*Additional details can be found in the full [NLnetLabs Unbound advisory](http://www.unbound.net/downloads/CVE-2011-4528.txt). |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker could cause the Unbound daemon to crash creating a denial-of-service condition. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an Update**This vulnerability has been addressed in Unbound 1.4.14 and 1.4.13p2. The following patch may also be applied to resolve the issue:For unbound version 1.4.0 - 1.4.13 the patch is:<http://www.unbound.net/downloads/patch_CVE-2011-4528_unbound_140-1413.diff>For unbound version 1.0.1 - 1.3.4 the patch is:<http://www.unbound.net/downloads/patch_CVE-2011-4528_unbound_101-134.diff> |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

This text is on http://www.unbound.net/downloads/CVE-2011-4528.txt
Subject: Unbound denial of service vulnerabilities from nonstandard
redirection and denial of existence [ VU#209659 CVE-2011-4528 ]
== Summary
Unbound crashes when confronted with a non-standard response from a
server for a domain. This domain produces duplicate RRs from a certain
type and is DNSSEC signed. Unbound also crashes when confronted with
a query that eventually, and under specific circumstances, resolves to
a domain that misses expected NSEC3 records.
These two problems were discovered within 24 hours, hence a combined
vulnerability disclosure.
By constructing the non standard responses an attacker can use these
vulnerabilities for a DOS attack.
To our knowledge 'denial of service' is the only type of exploit possible.
NLnet Labs has patched the code.
== Description 1: crash on signed duplicate Resource Records
There are authoritative servers that erroneously send duplicated
redirection Resource Records. Unbound has had a workaround that deals
with this problem since version 1.0.1 whereby it ignores the duplicate
answers. At the time, likely, no DNSSEC signed versions of such zones
existed and only recently such misbehaving authority servers also started
serving signed duplicate RRs causing improper memory allocation in a
portion of the workaround code.
Referencing this improper allocated data causes a crash which can look
like 'uninitialised lock', segmentation faults or free() errors as it
tries to free memory that was never allocated.
== Description 2: crash on missing NSEC3 Resource Records.
If an authority server sends a reply for an NSEC3-signed zone, and Unbound
is configured to validate that zone, then a malformed response can trigger
an assertion failure: when an authority server sends a response that
contains RR types that trigger special processing and where part of the
non-existence proof is missing then an assertion failure is triggered in
unbound. This response case was observed in the wild on authority servers
that host zones at different points in the hierarchy at the same time.
The code crashes at assertion failure validator/val\_nsec3.c:1214:
nsec3\_do\_prove\_nodata: assertion ce.nc\_rrset failed
Or, if assertions are not compiled it, it crashes soon after as it
attempts to access an expected NSEC3 RR.
== Workaround
If the misbehaving domain is known then it can be blocked block domain
names that exploit this with local-zone: "misbehaving.example.com"
refuse lines in config.
There is no easy way to determine what misbehaving domains, except by
carefully analyzing the unbound log files with a high verbosity.
== Solution
Download patched version of unbound, or apply the patch manually.
+ Downloading Patched Versions
\* 1.4.14 is released with the patch, but 1.4.14rc1 is vulnerable.
http://www.unbound.net/downloads/unbound-1.4.14.tar.gz
\* 1.4.13p2 can be downloaded, it is 1.4.13 with the patch applied.

+ Applying the Patch manually
The patch to apply can be downloaded here and is verbatim included at
the end of this description.
For unbound version 1.4.0 - 1.4.13 the patch is:
http://www.unbound.net/downloads/patch\_CVE-2011-4528\_unbound\_140-1413.diff
For unbound version 1.0.1 - 1.3.4 the patch is:
http://www.unbound.net/downloads/patch\_CVE-2011-4528\_unbound\_101-134.diff
(different patch because surrounding code was changed, same contents).
Apply the patch on unbound source directory with 'patch -p0 rr\_count != 1) {
+ struct rr\_parse\* sig;
verbose(VERB\_ALGO, "Found CNAME rrset with "
"size > 1: %u", (unsigned)rrset->rr\_count);
/\* use the first CNAME! \*/
rrset->rr\_count = 1;
rrset->size = rrset->rr\_first->size;
