  "description": "Django's field type URLfield by default checks supplied URL's by issuing a request to it, which doesn't time out. A Denial of Service is possible by supplying specially prepared URL's that keep the connection open indefinitely or fill the Django's server memory.",

  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The URLField in Django, when verifying a URL, issues a request to the provided URL without a timeout.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Denial of Service (DoS)",
