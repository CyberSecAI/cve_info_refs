Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-4087:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from a regression introduced in Linux kernel version 2.6.37 by commit `462fb2af9788a82a534f8184abfde31574e1cfa0`. This commit introduced a change in how skb (socket buffer) is handled in the bridge networking code, specifically within `br_parse_ip_options`.
- The issue is a missing initialization of the IPCB (IP control block) within the skb before calling `ip_options_compile()`, when the IPv4 header does not contain IP options,  which could lead to use of uninitialized memory

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Missing IPCB Initialization:** The core weakness is that the IPCB, which stores IP options, is not properly initialized in `br_parse_ip_options` before being used.  Specifically, when IPv4 headers does not contains IP options, the code was not zeroing the IPCB, this caused `ip_options_compile` to operate on uninitialized data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability can be exploited to cause a remote denial-of-service condition. By sending specifically crafted network packets, an attacker can trigger the flaw in the bridge networking code causing system instability or crash.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network Packets:** The attack vector is through specially crafted network packets. These packets would exploit the flawed logic in the `br_parse_ip_options` function, particularly when handling IPv4 headers without options.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Remote Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to a system using the vulnerable Linux kernel version and that has bridging enabled. This suggests the attacker could be on the same LAN or an external network.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was introduced in Linux kernel 2.6.37 and fixed in versions 2.6.39 and 3.0.
- Several commits fixed the issue:
    - `f8e9881c2aef1e982e5abc25c046820cd0b7cf64` (2.6.39)
    - `66944e1c5797562cebe2d1857d46dff60bf9a69e` (2.6.39)
    - `c65353daf137dd41f3ede3baf62d561fca076228` (3.0)
    - `10949550bd1e50cc91c0f5085f7080a44b0871fe` (3.0)
- The fix involves ensuring the IPCB is zeroed out in the `br_parse_ip_options` function before processing any IP options.

In summary, CVE-2011-4087 describes a remote DoS vulnerability in Linux kernel bridging code due to a missing IPCB initialization that can be triggered by specific network packets and has been fixed in subsequent kernel versions.
