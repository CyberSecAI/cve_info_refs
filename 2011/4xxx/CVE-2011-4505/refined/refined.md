Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to UPnP requests accepted over router WAN interfaces:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is that some router devices incorrectly accept UPnP (Universal Plug and Play) requests over their WAN (Wide Area Network) interface. UPnP is intended for devices on the LAN to discover and communicate, but the vulnerability stems from the exposure of UPnP control points on the WAN side.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure UPnP Implementation:** The primary vulnerability is that routers expose UPnP control points on the WAN, allowing external, unauthenticated entities to send requests.
*   **Lack of Authentication:** UPnP lacks proper authentication, allowing anyone to send requests to exposed control points.
*   **Vulnerable Actions:** The "AddPortMapping" and "DeletePortMapping" actions, used for NAT traversal, are accessible via the WAN interface.
*   **Open Control Points:** Some routers have open control points by default. Some even continue to accept UPnP requests after disabling UPnP WAN requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Internal Host Scanning:** Attackers can use the vulnerable UPnP implementation to scan for internal hosts behind the NAT firewall.
*   **Port Mapping Manipulation:** Attackers can use "AddPortMapping" to forward traffic from external ports on the router's WAN IP to internal hosts or external hosts. This allows redirection of traffic.
*   **Traffic Proxying:** Attackers can proxy Internet traffic through the vulnerable device, concealing their location and activity.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Information such as the router's MAC address, serial number, and model can be disclosed through the UPnP interface.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **WAN Interface:** Attackers target the publicly exposed WAN interface of the vulnerable router.
*   **SOAP Requests:** Attackers send SOAP requests to the exposed UPnP control points.
*   **Direct Control Point Access:** Attackers can directly access control points by their known locations without needing discovery methods like SSDP and multicast.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the router's WAN IP address. They do not need to be on the local network.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to authenticate to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Knowledge of Control Point:** The attacker needs to know or discover the location of the UPnP control point to send requests to. They can rely on a database of common locations and ports of XML description files.

**Additional Points from the Content:**

*   The tool Umap was developed to exploit this vulnerability. It works as a scanner for UPnP devices with exposed WAN control points, a SOCKSv4 proxy and an internal host scanner and mapper.
*   The content highlights that some routers have issues even if UPnP is disabled for WAN requests and recommends to totally disable UPnP only if the router accepts requests even when configured to not accept them.
*   Affected vendors include Linksys, Edimax, Sitecom, Speedtouch/Alcatel/Thomson, and Thomson.
*   The CVE is not explicitly mentioned, but this vulnerability note and the associated paper outline the underlying issues.

This analysis provides a more comprehensive understanding of the vulnerability than a generic CVE description alone.
