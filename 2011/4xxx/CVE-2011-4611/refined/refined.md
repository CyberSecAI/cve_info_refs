Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2011-4611:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from an incorrect comparison of a Performance Monitoring Counter (PMC) value on PowerPC architecture.
- A PMC is a 32-bit integer, but it was being passed around as an unsigned long without proper casting before comparison, leading to incorrect overflow detection.
- This was introduced when fixing another bug.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Integer comparison issue:** The code was comparing a 32-bit integer value stored as an unsigned long without proper casting. This resulted in the code failing to detect the PMC overflow in certain circumstances, especially when an exception occurred due to a speculative event rollback.
- **Inadequate exception handling:** The vulnerability also involves a lack of proper handling for events that raise exceptions, specifically performance monitor exceptions on Power7.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A local, unprivileged user could trigger this flaw, leading to a denial-of-service condition. This occurs because the PMC isn't reset properly after an exception, causing the performance monitoring to malfunction.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** A local, unprivileged user on a PowerPC system is required for the exploit.
- **Specific Hardware:** The issue was specific to the PowerPC architecture, particularly POWER7.
- **Usage of perf:** The vulnerability is triggered through the use of the perf subsystem in the Linux kernel.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have a local user account on a PowerPC system.
- The user must be able to use the `perf` tool.
- The system should be running a vulnerable version of the Linux kernel.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was introduced as a regression during a previous bug fix.
- The issue was fixed in the upstream kernel via commit `0837e3242c73566fc1c0196b4ec61779c25ffc93`.
- The fix involves a proper cast of the PMC value before comparison and the addition of logic to catch and reset the PMC when a performance monitor exception occurs, ensuring proper handling when a speculative event rolls back.
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5 were not affected as they did not have support for performance events on the PowerPC platform. Red Hat Enterprise MRG was also not affected as it did not provide PowerPC support.
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 was affected and addressed in RHSA-2012:0350.
