| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=767914#c0)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2011-12-15 08:45:45 UTC  ``` A PMC is 32 bits (ie an int). Since we pass it around as an unsigned long, we need to cast it before doing the comparison.  This does not affect the upstream kernel as it is already fixed. This is an issue that was introduced in [bug 720743](show_bug.cgi?id=720743).  Upstream commit: <http://git.kernel.org/linus/0837e3242c73566fc1c0196b4ec61779c25ffc93>  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Maynard Johnson for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=767914#c2)  Kurt Seifried    2011-12-15 16:18:30 UTC  ``` Assigned [CVE-2011-4611](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-4611) to this issue <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2011/q4/504>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=767914#c3)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2012-01-18 07:14:55 UTC  ``` Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 782688](show_bug.cgi?id=782688 "CLOSED NOTABUG - kernel: perf, powerpc: Handle events that raise an exception without overflowing [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=767914#c6)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2012-01-29 14:54:55 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect the Linux kernels as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5 as they did not have support for Performance event. It did not affect Red Hat Enterprise MRG as it did not provide support for PowerPC. This has been addressed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0350.html>.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=767914#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-03-06 18:45:22 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2012:0350 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0350.html>   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=767914#c0)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2011-12-15 08:45:45 UTC  ``` A PMC is 32 bits (ie an int). Since we pass it around as an unsigned long, we need to cast it before doing the comparison.  This does not affect the upstream kernel as it is already fixed. This is an issue that was introduced in [bug 720743](show_bug.cgi?id=720743).  Upstream commit: <http://git.kernel.org/linus/0837e3242c73566fc1c0196b4ec61779c25ffc93>  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Maynard Johnson for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=767914#c2)  Kurt Seifried    2011-12-15 16:18:30 UTC  ``` Assigned [CVE-2011-4611](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-4611) to this issue <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2011/q4/504>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=767914#c3)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2012-01-18 07:14:55 UTC  ``` Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 782688](show_bug.cgi?id=782688 "CLOSED NOTABUG - kernel: perf, powerpc: Handle events that raise an exception without overflowing [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=767914#c6)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2012-01-29 14:54:55 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect the Linux kernels as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5 as they did not have support for Performance event. It did not affect Red Hat Enterprise MRG as it did not provide support for PowerPC. This has been addressed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0350.html>.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=767914#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-03-06 18:45:22 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2012:0350 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0350.html>   ``` |  |

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

Events on POWER7 can roll back if a speculative event doesn't
eventually complete. Unfortunately in some rare cases they will
raise a performance monitor exception. We need to catch this to
ensure we reset the PMC. In all cases the PMC will be 256 or less
cycles from overflow.
