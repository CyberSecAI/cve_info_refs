| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=749677#c0)  Vincent Danen    2011-10-27 21:12:50 UTC  ``` A local file inclusion flaw was found in the way the phpLDAPadmin, a web based LDAP client for managing LDAP servers, processed certain values of the "Accept-Language" HTTP header. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause a denial of service (generate recursive inclusions leading to resource exhaustion) via specially-crafted request.  Note: A different issue than [CVE-2011-4075](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-4075) (due the different attack vector and different source code file in question).  References:  <http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/50328/info> <http://www.securityfocus.com/data/vulnerabilities/exploits/50328.java>  This was corrected in phpLDAPAdmin 0.9.8.5 and was assigned the name [CVE-2011-4082](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-4082).   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=749677#c1)  Vincent Danen    2011-10-27 21:13:40 UTC  ``` Created phpldapadmin tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: epel-4 [[bug 749678](show_bug.cgi?id=749678 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2011-4082 phpldapadmin: local file inclusion flaw fixed in 0.9.8 [epel-4]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=749677#c2)  Vincent Danen    2011-10-31 15:43:20 UTC  ``` This was actually fixed in 0.9.8 (only versions <= 0.9.7 are vulnerable).  EPEL4 currently has 0.9.8.3, and the contents of common.php in 0.9.8.3 and 0.9.8.5 are identical, so EPEL4 is not vulnerable to this.   ``` |  |

### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.
Needs triage
