Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- A simple buffer overflow vulnerability exists in Novell iPrint Server. Specifically, it is related to the `attributes-natural-language` functionality.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
-  Buffer overflow, likely due to insufficient bounds checking when handling user-supplied input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution, meaning an attacker can potentially run arbitrary code on the affected server.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  The vulnerability is remotely exploitable, suggesting it can be triggered over a network.
-  The specific input leading to the overflow involves the "attributes-natural-language" component of iPrint, suggesting a network-based attack vector through iPrint's communication channels.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have network access to the iPrint server.
- They need the ability to send specially crafted input that targets the vulnerable `attributes-natural-language` functionality to trigger the overflow.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Novell iPrint for Linux on Open Enterprise Server Support Pack 3 (OES 2 SP3) and OES 2 Linux Support Pack 3.
- Patches for both x86 and x86_64 architectures are available to resolve this.
- The provided download links point to the specific patches for this vulnerability.
