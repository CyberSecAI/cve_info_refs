The provided content is related to CVE-2011-4336.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the lack of sanitization of user-supplied input passed via the GET "ajax" parameter to the `snarf_ajax.php` script.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists due to the failure to properly sanitize user-controlled input before reflecting it back to the user.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML and script code into a user's browser session, in the context of the affected website. This could lead to session hijacking, information theft, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through a crafted GET request to the `snarf_ajax.php` script, with malicious code supplied in the "ajax" parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to craft and send a malicious HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `snarf_ajax.php` script. The attacker must target users who are in the "Admins" group for the exploit to be successful.
