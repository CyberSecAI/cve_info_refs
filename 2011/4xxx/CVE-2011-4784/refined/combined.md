## Note for Linux Drivers

Many Linux distributions provide their own packages of the NVIDIA Linux Graphics Driver in the distribution's native package management format. This may interact better with the rest of your distribution's framework, and you may want to use this rather than NVIDIA's official package.

## Download Type

**Production Branch/Studio** Most users select this choice for optimal stability and performance. The NVIDIA RTX Enterprise Production Branch driver is a rebrand of the Quadro Optimal Driver for Enterprise (ODE). It offers the same ISV certification, long life-cycle support, regular security updates, and access to the same functionality as prior Quadro ODE drivers and corresponding Studio Drivers (i.e., of the same driver version number).

**New Feature Branch (NFB)/Quadro New Feature (QNF)** Users occasionally select this choice for access to new features, bug fixes, new operating system support, and other driver enhancements offered between Production Branch releases. Support duration for New Feature Branches is shorter than that for Production Branches.

## Download Type

**"All"** Shows all available driver options for the selected product.

**"Game Ready Drivers"** provide the best possible gaming experience for all major games. NVIDIA's driver team exhaustively tests games from early access through release of each DLC to optimize for performance, stability, and functionality. These drivers are certified by Microsoft’s Windows Hardware Quality Labs (WHQL).

**"NFB / SLB"** **New Feature Branch (NFB)** [formerly known as Linux Short Lived Branch (SLB)] New Feature Branch Linux drivers provide early adopters and bleeding edge developers access to the latest driver features before they are integrated into the Production Branches.

## Product Category

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Vulnerability in NVIDIA Stereoscopic 3D Driver Could Allow Elevation of Privilege

Published: December 20, 2011

**Version:** 1.0

### Overview

#### Executive Summary

Microsoft is providing notification of the discovery and remediation of a vulnerability affecting the NVIDIA Stereoscopic 3D driver. Microsoft discovered and disclosed the vulnerability under coordinated vulnerability disclosure to the affected vendor, NVIDIA. NVIDIA has remediated the vulnerability in their software.

A vulnerability exists when the NVIDIA Stereoscopic 3D driver does not correctly validate and sanitize specific commands to a named pipe. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run commands in the security context of the Local System and take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full administrative rights.

Microsoft Vulnerability Research reported this issue to and coordinated with NVIDIA to ensure remediation of this issue. The vulnerability has been assigned the entry CVE-2011-4784, in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list. For more information about updates from NVIDIA, please see the [NVIDIA driver download page](https://www.nvidia.com/download/index.aspx).

#### Mitigating Factors
