# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2015

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2015

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

[Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore *strongly* recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes *without* delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 169 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that a blog entry summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at <https://blogs.oracle.com/security>.

Please note that on October 16, 2014, Oracle released information for  [CVE-2014-3566 "POODLE"](/security-alerts/poodlecve-2014-3566.html) .Customers of affected Oracle products are strongly advised to apply the fixes and/or configuration steps that were announced for CVE-2014-3566 in addition to the fixes announced in this CPU.

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available at:  [https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF).

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in  [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is available  [here](/security-alerts/cpujan2015verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](//cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same**CVE#** in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 2.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS 2.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see  [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the only variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review  [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and how to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update January 2015 Availability Document,  [My Oracle Support Note 1942215.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1942215.1).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/) . We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in  [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1) .Please review the  [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available to customers who have Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/) . Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download patches released through the Critical Patch Update program for products in the Extended Support Phase.

### Appendix - Oracle Java SE

#### Oracle Java SE Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 19 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE. 14 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found  [here](https:///security-alerts/cpujan2015verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Partial" instead of "Complete", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 10.0 becomes 7.5.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 7 and 8 releases.

[My Oracle Support Note 360870.1](https:///https%3A//support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=360870.1) explains the impact of Java security vulnerabilities on Oracle products that include an Oracle Java SE JDK or JRE.

Debian Security Advisory DSA-2405-1                   security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                            Stefan Fritsch
February 06, 2012                      <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : apache2
Vulnerability  : multiple issues
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-3607 CVE-2011-3368 CVE-2011-3639 CVE-2011-4317
                 CVE-2012-0031 CVE-2012-0053

Several vulnerabilities have been found in the Apache HTTPD Server:

CVE-2011-3607:

  An integer overflow in ap_pregsub() could allow local attackers to
  execute arbitrary code at elevated privileges via crafted .htaccess
  files.

CVE-2011-3368 CVE-2011-3639 CVE-2011-4317:

  The Apache HTTP Server did not properly validate the request URI for
  proxied requests. In certain reverse proxy configurations using the
  ProxyPassMatch directive or using the RewriteRule directive with the
  [P] flag, a remote attacker could make the proxy connect to an
  arbitrary server. The could allow the attacker to access internal
  servers that are not otherwise accessible from the outside.

  The three CVE ids denote slightly different variants of the same
  issue.

  Note that, even with this issue fixed, it is the responsibility of
  the administrator to ensure that the regular expression replacement
  pattern for the target URI does not allow a client to append arbitrary
  strings to the host or port parts of the target URI. For example, the
  configuration

    ProxyPassMatch ^/mail(.*)  <http://internal-host$1>

  is still insecure and should be replaced by one of the following
  configurations:

    ProxyPassMatch ^/mail(/.*)  <http://internal-host$1>
    ProxyPassMatch ^/mail/(.*)  [http://internal-host/$1](http://internal-host/%241)

CVE-2012-0031:

  An apache2 child process could cause the parent process to crash
  during shutdown. This is a violation of the privilege separation
  between the apache2 processes and could potentially be used to worsen
  the impact of other vulnerabilities.

CVE-2012-0053:

  The response message for error code 400 (bad request) could be used to
  expose "httpOnly" cookies. This could allow a remote attacker using
  cross site scripting to steal authentication cookies.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version apache2 2.2.9-10+lenny12.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version apache2 2.2.16-6+squeeze6

For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems will be fixed in
version 2.2.22-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.2.22-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your apache2 packages.

This update also contains updated apache2-mpm-itk packages which have
been recompiled against the updated apache2 packages. The new version
number for the oldstable distribution is 2.2.6-02-1+lenny7. In the
stable distribution, apache2-mpm-itk has the same version number as
apache2.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

openSUSE Security Update: update for apache2
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Announcement ID: openSUSE-SU-2013:0248-1
Rating: moderate
References:
Affected Products:
openSUSE 11.4
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that contains security fixes can now be installed.
Description:
- ignore case when checking against SNI server names.
[bnc#798733] httpd-2.2.x-bnc798733-SNI\_ignorecase.diff
- better cleanup of busy count after recovering from
failure [bnc#789828]
httpd-2.2.x-bnc789828-mod\_balancer.diff
-
httpd-2.2.x-bnc788121-CVE-2012-4557-mod\_proxy\_ajp\_timeout.di
ff: backend timeouts should not affect the entire worker.
[bnc#788121]
- httpd-2.2.x-envvars.diff obsoletes
httpd-2.0.54-envvars.dif: Fix for low profile bug
CVE-2012-0883 about improper LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH handling.
[bnc#757710]
-
httpd-2.2.x-bnc777260-CVE-2012-2687-mod\_negotiation\_filename
\_xss.diff Escape filename for the case that uploads are
allowed with untrusted user's control over filenames and
mod\_negotiation enabled on the same directory.
CVE-2012-2687 [bnc#777260]
- httpd-2.2.x-CVE-2011-3368\_CVE-2011-4317-bnc722545.diff
reworked to reflect the upstream changes. This will
prevent the "Invalid URI in request OPTIONS \*" messages
in the error log. [bnc#722545]
- /etc/init.d/apache2: new argument "check-reload". Exits 1
if httpd2 runs on deleted binaries such as after package
update, else 0. This is used by equally modified
/etc/logrotate.d/apache2, which uses "/etc/init.d/apache2
check-reload" in its prerotate script. These changes
prevent httpd2 from being (gracefully) reloaded by
logrotate, executed by cron, if new binaries have been
installed. Instead, a warning is printed on stdout and is
being logged to the syslogs. If this happens, apache's
logs are NOT rotated, and the running processes are left
untouched. This limits the maximum damage of log rotation
to unrotated logs. "/etc/init.d/apache2 restart" (or
"rcapache2 restart") must be executed manually in such a
case. [bnc#728876]

# RHSA-2012:0128 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Moderate: httpd security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A0128)

## Topic

Updated httpd packages that fix multiple security issues are now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The Apache HTTP Server is a popular web server.

It was discovered that the fix for CVE-2011-3368 (released via
RHSA-2011:1391) did not completely address the problem. An attacker could
bypass the fix and make a reverse proxy connect to an arbitrary server not
directly accessible to the attacker by sending an HTTP version 0.9 request,
or by using a specially-crafted URI. (CVE-2011-3639, CVE-2011-4317)

The httpd server included the full HTTP header line in the default error
page generated when receiving an excessively long or malformed header.
Malicious JavaScript running in the server's domain context could use this
flaw to gain access to httpOnly cookies. (CVE-2012-0053)

An integer overflow flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was
found in the way httpd performed substitutions in regular expressions. An
attacker able to set certain httpd settings, such as a user permitted to
override the httpd configuration for a specific directory using a
".htaccess" file, could use this flaw to crash the httpd child process or,
possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the "apache" user.
(CVE-2011-3607)

A flaw was found in the way httpd handled child process status information.
A malicious program running with httpd child process privileges (such as a
PHP or CGI script) could use this flaw to cause the parent httpd process to
crash during httpd service shutdown. (CVE-2012-0031)

All httpd users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
backported patches to correct these issues. After installing the updated
packages, the httpd daemon will be restarted automatically.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

Upstream mailing list post identifies following request forms, which are not handled correctly:   GET @localhost::8880 HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n  GET qualys:@qqq.qq.qualys.com HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n  Reference: <http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.apache.devel/46440>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=756483#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2011-11-25 18:34:17 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://community.qualys.com/blogs/securitylabs/2011/11/23/apache-reverse-proxy-bypass-issue>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=756483#c5)  Werner Maes    2011-11-28 14:17:25 UTC  ``` Well, If I try this with a similar setup and post the request forms, I always get an error stating that the request-URI is invalid:  [Mon Nov 28 13:57:34 2011] [error] [client a.b.c.d] invalid request-URI @localhost::8080  Am I doing something wrong :) ?

Newer apr-util versions include the following change:    <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=594624>  to allow URIs as: scheme:rest, where rest does not need to start with "//".  In that case, rest is parsed as path component of the URI, and can possibly start with ':' or '@', which allow redirecting request to a different port on the configured remote host or different remote host as was demonstrated.  Older versions require scheme to be followed by "://" and the part following "://" is parsed as authority (host + optional port and username/password) followed by path.  That code path does not allow paths starting with ':' or '@'.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=756483#c9)  Tomas Hoger    2012-01-12 09:41:32 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #8](show_bug.cgi?id=756483#c8))  > Older versions require scheme to be followed by "://" and the part following > "://" is parsed as authority (host + optional port and username/password) > followed by path.  That code path does not allow paths starting with > ':' or '@'.  Let's extend this explanation a bit to make it easier to understand.  The original [CVE-2011-3368](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-3368) fix added following check to reject invalid URIs:  +    if (r->method_number != M_CONNECT  +        && !r->parsed_uri.scheme  +        && uri[0] != '/' +        && !(uri[0] == '*' && uri[1] == '\0')) {  The aim is to reject requests which contain path that does not start with /.  There are exceptions like URI "*" or any URI that contains scheme part.  In recent apr-util, it is easy to provide URI which is parsed by apr_uri_parse() to non-NULL scheme and path not starting with / (scheme: @localhost, path: :8880 and scheme: qualys, path: @qqq.qq.qualys.com).  In older versions, when apr_uri_parse() returns non-NULL scheme, path is always either NULL or starting with /, which is safe.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=756483#c10)  Tomas Hoger    2012-01-19 10:49:16 UTC  ``` Proposed upstream fix:   <http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.apache.devel/47061>  originally proposed in the discussion thread linked in [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=756483#c0):   [http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.apache.devel/46440/focus=46742](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.apache.devel/46440/focus%3D46742)   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=756483#c11)  Tomas Hoger    2012-01-20 11:06:33 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #10](show_bug.cgi?id=756483#c10)) > Proposed upstream fix: >   <http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.apache.devel/47061>  In trunk and 2.4.x now: <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1233604> <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1233619>   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=756483#c12)  Tomas Hoger    2012-01-26 14:43:55 UTC  ``` Fixed in 2.2.x now too, queued for 2.2.22 release:   <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1235443>   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=756483#c14)  Vincent Danen    2012-02-10 16:05:25 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect the versions of httpd as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5 due to differences in apr-util's apr_uri_parse() implementation.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=756483#c15)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-02-13 20:34:21 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2012:0128 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0128.html>   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=756483#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2011-11-23 18:17:32 UTC  ``` Additional problems were discovered in the httpd fix for [CVE-2011-3368](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-3368) - a reverse proxy bypass flaw - tracked via [bug #740045](show_bug.cgi?id=740045 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2011-3368 httpd: reverse web proxy vulnerability").  Upstream mailing list post identifies following request forms, which are not handled correctly:   GET @localhost::8880 HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n  GET qualys:@qqq.qq.qualys.com HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n  Reference: <http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.apache.devel/46440>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=756483#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2011-11-25 18:34:17 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://community.qualys.com/blogs/securitylabs/2011/11/23/apache-reverse-proxy-bypass-issue>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=756483#c5)  Werner Maes    2011-11-28 14:17:25 UTC  ``` Well, If I try this with a similar setup and post the request forms, I always get an error stating that the request-URI is invalid:  [Mon Nov 28 13:57:34 2011] [error] [client a.b.c.d] invalid request-URI @localhost::8080  Am I doing something wrong :) ? I'm using the latest Redhat httpd rpm.  Kind regards  Werner   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=756483#c6)  Werner Maes    2011-11-29 09:32:00 UTC  ``` This works fine:  : httpd-2.2.3 10:24#; fp;echo -e  "GET / HTTP/1.0\r\n" |nc a.b.c.d 80 HTTP/1.1 200 OK  but this command generates the bad request error.  : httpd-2.2.3 10:26#; fp;echo -e  "GET @localhost::80 HTTP/1.0\r\n" |nc a.b.c.d 80 HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request   tcpdump -A 'host x and tcp port 80  and (((ip[2:2] - ((ip[0]&0xf)<<2)) - ((tcp[12]&0xf0)>>2)) != 0)' shows   E..RDE@.>....: g.:...'.Pd4..........>...... "#..L...GET @localhost::80 HTTP/1.0   E....<@.@..[.:...: g.P.'....d4......h...... L..."#..HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request   So my proxy setup does not seem to vulnerable?   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=756483#c8)  Tomas Hoger    2011-12-05 12:06:50 UTC  ``` The scheme trick does not work against httpd in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5, due to the difference in apr-util's apr_uri_parse() implementation.  Newer apr-util versions include the following change:    <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=594624>  to allow URIs as: scheme:rest, where rest does not need to start with "//".  In that case, rest is parsed as path component of the URI, and can possibly start with ':' or '@', which allow redirecting request to a different port on the configured remote host or different remote host as was demonstrated.  Older versions require scheme to be followed by "://" and the part following "://" is parsed as authority (host + optional port and username/password) followed by path.  That code path does not allow paths starting with ':' or '@'.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=756483#c9)  Tomas Hoger    2012-01-12 09:41:32 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #8](show_bug.cgi?id=756483#c8))  > Older versions require scheme to be followed by "://" and the part following > "://" is parsed as authority (host + optional port and username/password) > followed by path.  That code path does not allow paths starting with > ':' or '@'.  Let's extend this explanation a bit to make it easier to understand.  The original [CVE-2011-3368](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-3368) fix added following check to reject invalid URIs:  +    if (r->method_number != M_CONNECT  +        && !r->parsed_uri.scheme  +        && uri[0] != '/' +        && !(uri[0] == '*' && uri[1] == '\0')) {  The aim is to reject requests which contain path that does not start with /.  There are exceptions like URI "*" or any URI that contains scheme part.  In recent apr-util, it is easy to provide URI which is parsed by apr_uri_parse() to non-NULL scheme and path not starting with / (scheme: @localhost, path: :8880 and scheme: qualys, path: @qqq.qq.qualys.com).  In older versions, when apr_uri_parse() returns non-NULL scheme, path is always either NULL or starting with /, which is safe.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=756483#c10)  Tomas Hoger    2012-01-19 10:49:16 UTC  ``` Proposed upstream fix:   <http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.apache.devel/47061>  originally proposed in the discussion thread linked in [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=756483#c0):   [http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.apache.devel/46440/focus=46742](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.apache.devel/46440/focus%3D46742)   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=756483#c11)  Tomas Hoger    2012-01-20 11:06:33 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #10](show_bug.cgi?id=756483#c10)) > Proposed upstream fix: >   <http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.apache.devel/47061>  In trunk and 2.4.x now: <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1233604> <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1233619>   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=756483#c12)  Tomas Hoger    2012-01-26 14:43:55 UTC  ``` Fixed in 2.2.x now too, queued for 2.2.22 release:   <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1235443>   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=756483#c14)  Vincent Danen    2012-02-10 16:05:25 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect the versions of httpd as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5 due to differences in apr-util's apr_uri_parse() implementation.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=756483#c15)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-02-13 20:34:21 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2012:0128 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0128.html>   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c0)  Vincent Danen    2012-01-27 06:27:17 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the default error response for status code 400.  This could be used by an attacker to expose "httpOnly" cookies, when no custom ErrorDocument was specified.  This affects all versions of Apache from 2.2.0 up to and including 2.2.21.  It will be fixed upstream in 2.2.22 (via r1235454 [1]).  [1] <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1235454>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c1)  Vincent Danen    2012-01-27 06:33:29 UTC  ``` Created httpd tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 785070](show_bug.cgi?id=785070 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2011-3368 CVE-2012-0053 CVE-2012-0031 CVE-2012-0021 CVE-2011-3607 httpd: multiple vulnerabilities [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c2)  Kurt Seifried    2012-01-28 06:13:41 UTC  ``` ====================================================== Name: [CVE-2012-0053](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-0053)  protocol.c in the Apache HTTP Server 2.2.x through 2.2.21 does not properly restrict header information during construction of Bad Request (aka 400) error documents, which allows remote attackers to obtain the values of HTTPOnly cookies via vectors involving a (1) long or (2) malformed header in conjunction with crafted web script.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c4)  Tomas Hoger    2012-01-29 14:52:53 UTC  ``` Upstream fix (linked in [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c0)) changes the amount of information sent back to an HTTP client when httpd detects one of the following problems:  1) HTTP request header line is longer than configured LimitRequestFieldSize limit.  In this case, httpd adds the line (actually, a prefix of it read before reaching the limit) to its default 400 error page.  2) HTTP request header line is continuation of the previous line and both lines combined together exceed configured LimitRequestFieldSize limit.  In this case, httpd adds previous line to its default 400 error page.  Note: previous line here may refer to a concatenation of more than one line, if previous lines were continuations too.  3) HTTP request header line does not contain : , which is a separator between the header name and its value.  Case 1) is the one that can be used by malicious javascript to gain access to httpOnly cookies.  A script can set additional cookies to make Cookie: request header line length exceed LimitRequestFieldSize and read values of a httpOnly protected cookies from the httpd's error page.  This may allow a script injected via some XSS flaw to gain access to cookies it can not access directly.  Upstream fix ensures that error page only contains header name, or 80 character prefix of the header name, if the name exceeds that limit.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c5)  Tomas Hoger    2012-02-01 08:20:33 UTC  ``` Write up of the issue for the original reporter:   <http://fd.the-wildcat.de/apache_e36a9cf46c.php>  It confirms the analysis above ([comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c4)).   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-02-13 20:34:32 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2012:0128 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0128.html>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c10)  Denis    2012-02-20 14:29:13 UTC  ``` Is httpd-2.2.3-53  impacted by the issue httpd-2.2.3-53 ?

John, it has been resolved now via RHSA-2012:0323.  Previously it was vulnerable.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c15)  bmorriso    2012-02-27 16:34:48 UTC  ``` Hi,  Any information on that status of the EWS fixes for this CVE?   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c17)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-03-07 15:50:42 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #15](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c15)) > Hi, >  > Any information on that status of the EWS fixes for this CVE?  Hi Blair,   We are working towards addressing of this issue in various versions of JBoss Enterprise Web Server too. But unfortunately as of right now we are unable to provide exact release date, when the updates can be expected (as the final date is subject of change depending on couple of internal conditions).  Hope the above being sufficient and helpful. Apologize, but can't provide more exact information.  Regards, Jan. -- Jan iankko Lieskovsky / Red Hat Security Response Team   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c19)  Tomas Hoger    2012-03-09 15:28:25 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue affects httpd packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and 4, which are now in the Extended Life Phase of their life cycle. Therefore this issue is not planned to be addressed in future updates. For additional information, refer to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle: <https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/>   ```  [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c24)  Mark J. Cox    2012-04-05 08:45:37 UTC  ``` Note that this issue does affect Apache 2.0 despite the Mitre CVE description.  Verification: <https://svn.apache.org/viewvc/httpd/httpd/branches/2.0.x/STATUS?view=diff&r1=1237164&r2=1237165&pathrev=1237165>   ```  [Comment 27](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c27)  Coty Sutherland    2012-05-01 16:43:10 UTC  ``` Are we making any kind of progress on this for EWS 1.0.2 (tomcat 6.0.32)?   ```  [Comment 28](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c28)  Coty Sutherland    2012-05-01 16:47:20 UTC  ``` Sorry, this isn't a tomcat issue, I meant to inquire about EWS 1.0.2's Apache (2.2.17)...   ```  [Comment 30](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c30)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-05-07 18:51:14 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    JBoss Enterprise Web Server 1.0.2  Via RHSA-2012:0543 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0543.html>   ```  [Comment 31](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c31)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-05-07 19:17:36 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    JBEWS 1.0 for RHEL 5   JBEWS 1.0 for RHEL 6  Via RHSA-2012:0542 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0542.html>   ```  [Comment 32](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c32)  Tomas Hoger    2012-07-27 07:15:59 UTC  ``` Mitigation instructions:  As noted in the original reporter's advisory (see [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c5)), this issue can be mitigated by using a custom ErrorDocument setting, such as:    ErrorDocument 400 "Bad Request"    <http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/core.html#errordocument>  It should be noted that ErrorDocument setting using path or external URL does not mitigate this issue.   It should also be noted that this is not an issue by itself.  This can only be exploited via some other cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw found in a web application running on the server and may allow injected JavaScript to gain access to HttpOnly cookies, if the application uses this protection for its cookies.   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=769844#c0)  Ramon de C Valle    2011-12-22 13:44:51 UTC  ``` Vincent Danen 2011-11-02 17:14:55 EDT  It was reported [1] that an integer overflow was found in Apache in the ap_pregsub() function called from mod-setenvif.  When a header field is mangled using SetEnvIf, the new environment variable data can be multiples of the size of the submitted header field.  This would cause ap_pregsub() to overflow the length value in buffer size calculations, leading to the subsequent allocation call of a too-small buffer.  Filling this buffer with user-supplied data will lead to a buffer overflow.  Depending on the input data, this can lead to excessive allocation of server memory (resulting in killed processes due to out-of-memory conditions), invalid memory access when copying large amounts of data (which can lead to a termination of the httpd process), or possibly allowing the execution of arbitrary code.  To trigger this flaw, mod_setenvif must be enabled (the default) and the attacker needs to be able to place a crafted .htaccess file on the server (which, in most cases, would require local access to the file system or some web interface that allows for writing arbitrary files to the local file system, such as for custom .htaccess files).  There is currently no upstream fix, however to work around the problem, disable mod_setenvif.  [1] <http://www.halfdog.net/Security/2011/ApacheModSetEnvIfIntegerOverflow/>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=769844#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2012-01-12 10:06:25 UTC  ``` This issue was originally tracked with [CVE-2011-4415](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-4415) via [bug #750935](show_bug.cgi?id=750935 "CLOSED WONTFIX - CVE-2011-4415 httpd: SetEnvIf resource exhaustion").  Patch for this issue was added upstream to trunk (future 2.4.x httpd versions) via following commit:   <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1198940>  That fix is not applicable to older httpd versions, such as 2.2.x.  There still on-going upstream discussion on how to address this in older httpd versions:   <http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.apache.devel/46260>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=769844#c2)  Ramon de C Valle    2012-01-24 14:49:21 UTC  ``` There are still no follow up on this discussion.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=769844#c3)  Tomas Hoger    2012-01-26 14:46:10 UTC  ``` Following fix is already committed in upstream SVN for 2.2.x:   <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1227280>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=769844#c4)  Ramon de C Valle    2012-01-27 09:02:09 UTC  ``` Theese are the only exploits/reproducers currently available/released for this: <http://www.halfdog.net/Security/2011/ApacheModSetEnvIfIntegerOverflow/DemoExploit.html>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=769844#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-02-13 20:34:26 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2012:0128 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0128.html>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=769844#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-02-21 21:58:14 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2012:0323 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0323.html>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=769844#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-05-07 18:48:43 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    JBoss Enterprise Web Server 1.0.2  Via RHSA-2012:0543 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0543.html>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=769844#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-05-07 19:17:29 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    JBEWS 1.0 for RHEL 5   JBEWS 1.0 for RHEL 6  Via RHSA-2012:0542 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0542.html>   ``` |  |

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2012

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2012

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

[Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible.** This Critical Patch Update contains 87 new security fixes across the product families listed below.

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle’s use of CVRF is available at: </security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF>.

#### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is available [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2012verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](//cve.mitre.org) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same **CVE#** in all risk matrices. *Italics* indicate vulnerabilities in code included from other product areas.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 2.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS 2.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. As a matter of policy, Oracle does not disclose detailed information about an exploit condition or results that can be used to conduct a successful exploit. Oracle will not provide additional information about the specifics of vulnerabilities beyond what is provided in the CPU or Security Alert notification, the Patch Availability Matrix, the readme files, and FAQs. Oracle does not provide advance notification on CPUs or Security Alerts to individual customers. Finally, Oracle does not distribute exploit code or proof of concept code for product vulnerabilities. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update July 2012 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1455387.1](//support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=70267263072071&id=1455387.1 ).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Critical Patch Update patches are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that Critical Patch Update patches are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, customers are recommended to upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=70335995559268&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Critical Patch Update patches are available to customers who have purchased Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download Critical Patch Update patches for products in the Extended Support Phase.

### *On Request* Model

Oracle proactively creates patches only for platform/version combinations that, based on historical data, customers are likely to download for the next Critical Patch Update. Patches for historically inactive platform/version combinations of the Oracle Database, Oracle Application Server and Enterprise Manager will be created only if requested by customers.

Refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update July 2012 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1455387.1](//support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=70267263072071&id=1455387.1 ) for further details regarding the On Request patches.

### Appendix - Oracle Database Server

#### Oracle Database Server Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 7 new security fixes for the Oracle Database Server divided as follows:

* 4 new security fixes for the Oracle Database Server.  3 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password.  None of these fixes are applicable to client-only installations, i.e., installations that do not have the Oracle Database Server installed. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2012verbose.html#Oracle-Database-Server).
* 1 new security fix for Oracle Application Express Listener.  This vulnerability is remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password.  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2012verbose.html#Oracle Application Express Listener).
* 2 new security fixes for Oracle Secure Backup.  Both of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password.  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2012verbose.html#Oracle Secure Backup).

Please note that on April 30, 2012, Oracle released [Security Alert CVE-2012-1675](/security-alerts/alert-cve-2012-1675.html). This Security Alert provides mitigation instructions against the publicly disclosed "TNS Listener Poison Attack." Because of the nature of this issue (amount of code change required, potential for significant regression issues, and inability to automate the application of a fix), Oracle does not plan to backport a permanent fix for this vulnerability in any upcoming Critical Patch Update. Customers are therefore strongly advised to implement the recommendations set forth in the [Security Alert](/security-alerts/alert-cve-2012-1675.html).

#### Oracle E-Business Suite Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 4 new security fixes for the Oracle E-Business Suite.  2 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password.  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2012verbose.html#Oracle E-Business Suite).

Oracle E-Business Suite products include Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the [Oracle Database](#AppendixDB) and [Oracle Fusion Middleware](#AppendixFMW) sections. The exposure of Oracle E-Business Suite products is dependent on the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions being used. Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware security fixes are not listed in the Oracle E-Business Suite risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions may affect Oracle E-Business Suite products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the July 2012 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components of Oracle E-Business Suite. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Oracle E-Business Suite Critical Patch Update for July 2012, [My Oracle Support Note 1459818.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=68194172145935&id=1459818.1).
