    "summary": "The provided content contains information about CVE-2011-4317. This vulnerability relates to an incomplete fix for CVE-2011-3368, where attackers can bypass reverse proxy restrictions in Apache HTTP server using specially crafted URIs. This allows attackers to redirect proxy requests to unauthorized servers.",

        "type": "Root cause of vulnerability",
        "detail": "The root cause is an incomplete fix for CVE-2011-3368 in the Apache HTTP Server. The original fix did not properly handle specially crafted URIs, particularly those with a scheme followed by characters other than '//' such as  `@` or `:` in the request URI. These characters are not properly validated, causing a bypass of the reverse proxy restrictions."

      {
        "type": "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present",
        "detail": "The vulnerability lies in the improper validation of the request URI when processing proxied requests. Specifically, when using ProxyPassMatch directive or RewriteRule with the [P] flag, the vulnerability allows the proxy to connect to arbitrary servers by bypassing the URI validation. It also stems from the logic in apr_uri_parse where certain URI formats with a scheme and characters such as `@` or `:` are incorrectly handled."

        "type": "Impact of exploitation",
        "detail": "Exploitation could lead to attackers redirecting the proxy to connect to arbitrary, internal or external servers. This allows the attacker to access internal servers that are not otherwise accessible from the outside."

        "type": "Attack vectors",
        "detail": "Attackers can exploit the vulnerability by sending specially crafted HTTP requests to the Apache HTTP server, targeting reverse proxy configurations with ProxyPassMatch or RewriteRule.

          "The content explains how different versions of apr-util parse URIs, with newer versions being more susceptible to the exploit due to the change in parsing scheme and URI paths.",
        "Mitigation for this issue includes updating to Apache version 2.2.22 (or later), or carefully configuring the reverse proxy rules, while disabling mod_setenvif can reduce the risk but may break existing functionality."
