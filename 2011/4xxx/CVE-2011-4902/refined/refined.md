  "cve": "CVE-2011-4902",
  "description": "TYPO3 before 4.3.12, 4.4.x before 4.4.9, and 4.5.x before 4.5.4 allows remote attackers to delete arbitrary files on the webserver.",
  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from insecure deserialization of user input by TYPO3. Specifically, data submitted by backend (BE) editors is treated as serialized data and then deserialized. This allows an attacker to inject malicious serialized objects into the data, which when deserialized can lead to arbitrary file deletion. The vulnerability exists in the TYPO3 core.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Unsafe deserialization of untrusted data",
         "Missing access controls",
        "Cross-site scripting",
        "Information disclosure",
         "Authentication bypass"
      ],
      "impact": "Remote attackers can delete arbitrary files on the webserver. Additionally, it can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, Information Disclosure, Authentication Delay Bypass, and missing Access Control.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Exploiting backend editor interface",
        "Crafted requests to bypass authentication delays",
        "Manipulation of URL parameters in frontend",
          "Manipulation of content elements",
          "Manipulation of page titles"
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need to be a TYPO3 backend user (editor), be able to craft malicious serialized data, or manipulate page titles and content elements. For XSS, they may need to trick a victim into interacting with a prepared page or content element or browser",
          "additional_details": "Multiple vulnerabilities are grouped together in this advisory which include Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Frontend, Information Disclosure in Backend and authentication delay bypass, XSS in backend, Unserialize() vulnerability and Missing Access Control. "
