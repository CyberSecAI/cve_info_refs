  "CVE-2011-4924": {
    "description": "A cross site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the way Zope2 and Zope3 performed error messages sanitization. If a remote attacker could trick a user, who was logged into Zope2, into visiting a specially-crafted URL, it would lead to arbitrary web script execution in the context of user's Zope2 session. If a remote attacker could trick a user, who was logged into Zope3, into examining error entries for particular Zope3 instance, it would lead to arbitrary web script execution in the context of user's Zope3 session.",
    "root_cause": "Incomplete fix for CVE-2010-1104 in Zope 2 and a lack of a fix in Zope 3 related to error message sanitization.",
