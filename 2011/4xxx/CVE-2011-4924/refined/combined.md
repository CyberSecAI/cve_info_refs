| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=771920#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-01-05 11:53:04 UTC  ``` Originally, Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures assigned an identifier [CVE-2010-1104](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-1104) to the following vulnerability:  Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Zope 2.8.x before 2.8.12, 2.9.x before 2.9.12, 2.10.x before 2.10.11, 2.11.x before 2.11.6, and 2.12.x before 2.12.3 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via vectors related to error messages.  Later the applied upstream patch was found to be incomplete. The CVE identifier of [CVE-2011-4924](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-4924) has been assigned to this incomplete fix with the issue description as follows:  A cross site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the way Zope2 and Zope3 performed error messages sanitization. If a remote attacker could trick a user, who was logged into Zope2, into visiting a specially-crafted URL, it would lead to arbitrary web script execution in the context of user's Zope2 session. If a remote attacker could trick a user, who was logged into Zope3, into examining error entries for particular Zope3 instance, it would lead to arbitrary web script execution in the context of user's Zope3 session.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=771920#c4)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-01-05 12:04:07 UTC  ``` This issue affects the version of the conga package as shipped with Red Hat Cluster Suite for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

To my knowledge there was no patch applied to Zope 3 for
CVE-2010-1104. Mind you though: I only think so because I could not
find evidence of changes in zope.error related to this issue from
before the zope.error 3.7.3 release.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

Subject: CVE-2011-4924 assignment notification -- Zope2, Zope3: Incomplete
 upstream fix for CVE-2010-1104 issue

Hello vendors,

   originally, Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures assigned an identifier
CVE-2010-1104 to the following vulnerability:

Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Zope 2.8.x before 2.8.12, 2.9.x
before 2.9.12, 2.10.x before 2.10.11, 2.11.x before 2.11.6, and 2.12.x before
2.12.3 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via
vectors related to error messages.

Later the applied upstream patch was found to be incomplete. The CVE identifier
of CVE-2011-4924 has been assigned to this incomplete fix with the issue
description as follows:

A cross site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the way Zope2 and Zope3
performed error messages sanitization. If a remote attacker could trick a user,
who was logged into Zope2, into visiting a specially-crafted URL, it would lead
to arbitrary web script execution in the context of user's Zope2 session. If a
remote attacker could trick a user, who was logged into Zope3, into examining
error entries for particular Zope3 instance, it would lead to arbitrary web
script execution in the context of user's Zope3 session.

Credit: Issue has been discovered by Radek Steiger of Red Hat.

The former. The CVE-2010-1104 issue was applicable to Zope3 too (just wasn't
described in the description). The reason probably being the CVE-2010-1104
to had been reported against Zope2 version only (according to particular
LaunchPad bug).

Zope2 patch for CVE-2010-1104 was incomplete (still allowing XSS). Not sure,
if there was some Zope3 patch for CVE-2010-1104 applied.

Jan-Wijbrand Kolman could you clarify and help us to understand original
CVE-2010-1104 situation in Zope3?

Thank you && Regards, Jan.

Overview
========

In response to the cross-site scripting vulnerability in Zope2 reported as
'CVE 2010-1104'[1], the Zope security response team announces the
availablility of a hotfix product (for Zope < 2.12), and new releases for
the Zope 2.12 and 2.13 lines:

Hotfix:  <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Products.Zope_Hotfix_CVE_2010_1104>

Zope 2.12.22:  <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Zope2/2.12.22>

Zope 2.13.12:  <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Zope2/2.13.12>

WARNING: Zope < 2.12 is no longer officially supported, and may have
         other unpatched vulnerabilities. You are encouraged to
         upgrade to a supported Zope 2.

Installing the Hotfix
=====================

The hotfix has been tested with Zope instances using Zope 2.8.x - 2.11.x.
Users of Zope 2.12.x and 2.13.x should instead update to the latest
corresponding minor revision, which already includes this fix.

Download the tarball from the PyPI page:

 <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Products.Zope_Hotfix_CVE_2010_1104>

Unpack the tarball and add a 'products' key to the 'etc/zope.conf' of
your instance.  E.g.::

  products /path/to/Products.Zope_Hotfix_CVE_2010_1104/Products

and restart.  Alternatively, you may copy or symlink the 'Products'
directory into the 'Products' subdirectory of your Zope instance.  E.g.::

  $ cp -r /path/to/Products.Zope_Hotfix_CVE_2010_1104/Products \
    /path/to/instance/Products/

Verifying the Installation
- --------------------------

After restarting the Zope instance, check the
'Control_Panel/Products' folder in the Zope Management Interface,
e.g.:

  <http://localhost:8080/Control_Panel/Products/manage_main>

You should see the 'Zope_Hotfix_CVE_2010_1104' product folder there.

### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.
