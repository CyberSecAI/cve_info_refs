Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-4901:

**Vulnerability:** Information Disclosure

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from an insecure configuration within the `css_styled_content` system extension of TYPO3. Specifically, the "getText" feature used on content element headlines allows for the retrieval of arbitrary data from the TYPO3 database. This is due to the insecure way in which headline rendering is handled, specifically via the `fontTag` property which could lead to unexpected rendering and exposure of data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Insecure configuration:** The default configuration of the `css_styled_content` extension was insecure.
*   **Improper data handling:** The `getText` feature and `fontTag` property, when used on content element headlines, allowed direct access to database information without proper sanitization or access controls.
*  **Missing access control:** The vulnerability could be exploited by any TYPO3 backend user (editor), regardless of access privileges on particular languages.
*   **Configuration dependency:** The presence of adjusted `fontTag` properties could lead to unexpected rendering results, suggesting a lack of proper input validation and output encoding.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Information Disclosure:** Attackers could extract sensitive data directly from the TYPO3 database. This could potentially include passwords, user information, or other confidential data.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network-based:** A remote attacker could exploit this by crafting specific requests using the `getText` feature within the `css_styled_content` system extension.
*   **Authenticated user:** Exploitation requires a valid TYPO3 backend user account which would need to be compromised first.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have a valid TYPO3 backend user account.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the TYPO3 instance.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is present in TYPO3 versions 4.3.11 and below, 4.4.8 and below, and 4.5.3 and below.
*   The fix involves updating to TYPO3 versions 4.3.12, 4.4.9, or 4.5.4 which changes how headline rendering is handled through `dataWrap` instead of `fontTag`.
*   This vulnerability is addressed in TYPO3-CORE-SA-2011-001 Security Advisory.
