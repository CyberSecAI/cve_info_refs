Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the SQL injection vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw in the `view.php` file of the jara 1.6 application. The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: Specifically, the `id` parameter in the `view.php` script is vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code into the application's database queries. This could allow the attacker to:
    -  Read sensitive data from the database.
    - Modify or delete data in the database.
    - Potentially gain further access to the system or server the database is running on.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is accessible through a crafted URL targeting the `view.php` file.
- The attacker injects SQL code into the `id` parameter of the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- The attacker must have knowledge of the vulnerable parameter and how to inject SQL.
- No authentication or other special privileges are mentioned as being required.

**Additional Notes**
- The provided content includes the following exploit example: `<http://localhost/jara/view.php?id=[SQL> Injection]>` which demonstrates how the `id` parameter is used to inject the SQL code.
- The vulnerability is located in the `view.php` file and is related to the handling of the `id` parameter.
