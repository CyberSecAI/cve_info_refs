The provided content describes a vulnerability in the ASUS RT-N56U router, which is tracked as VU#200814, and is NOT related to CVE-2011-4497.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by an insecure web page (`/QIS_wizard.htm?flag=detect`) that exposes the device's configuration, including the administrator password, without requiring any authentication.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Lack of Authentication:** The web page displaying the configuration data does not require any login credentials.
- **Sensitive Information Exposure:** The administrator password is revealed in plain text on the vulnerable web page.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated attacker with network access (typically on the LAN) can retrieve the administrator password.
- Once the attacker gains access to the router's administration interface, they can modify configurations, intercept traffic, and potentially further compromise the network.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker on the local network can navigate to the specific vulnerable URL (`/QIS_wizard.htm?flag=detect`) via a web browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be on the same LAN as the vulnerable ASUS RT-N56U router.
- No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was present in ASUS RT-N56U firmware version 1.0.1.4.
- The issue was fixed in firmware version 1.0.1.4o.
