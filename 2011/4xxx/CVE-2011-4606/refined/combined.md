Package: rocksndiamonds
Version: 3.3.0.1+dfsg1-1
Severity: grave
Tags: security
Justification: user security hole

The ~/.rocksndiamonds directory and its subdirectories are created as
writable to anybody. This allows an attacker to overwrite arbitrary
files by doing this:
1) Delete the /home/victim/.rocksndiamonds/cache/artworkinfo.cache file.
2) Create new /home/victim/.rocksndiamonds/cache/artworkinfo.cache as a
symlink to a file you want to overwrite.
3) Wait until the victim runs the game.

Hi

I guess at least below needs changing. Probably there also needs to be
some existing modes be changed (in the postinst?).

Cheers

Dear maintainer,

Recently you fixed one or more security problems and as a result you closed
this bug. These problems were not serious enough for a Debian Security
Advisory, so they are now on my radar for fixing in the following suites
through point releases:

squeeze (6.0.6) - use target "stable"

Please prepare a minimal-changes upload targetting each of these suites,
and submit a debdiff to the Release Team [0] for consideration. They will
offer additional guidance or instruct you to upload your package.

I will happily assist you at any stage if the patch is straightforward and
you need help. Please keep me in CC at all times so I can
track [1] the progress of this request.

For details of this process and the rationale, please see the original
announcement [2] and my blog post [3].

Subject: CVE request: rocksndiamonds world-writable working/config directory

rocksndiamonds creates its ~/.rocksndiamonds/ directory as
world-writable.  This could allow a local attacker to replace a cache
file with a symbolic link to a file they would not otherwise have access
to, and the next time the victim loaded the game, it would be
overwritten.

Could a CVE be assigned to this please?

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=766805#c0)  Vincent Danen    2011-12-12 16:20:30 UTC  ``` It was reported [1] that the rocksndiamonds game would create it's configuration/cache directory (~/.rocksndiamonds/) as world-writable.  If a user's home directory was mode 0755 (the default is 0700), a local attacker could delete one of the cache files and replace it with a symbolic link to some other file they did not have access to.  When the victim loaded the game again, that file would be overwritten.  [1] <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=651620>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=766805#c1)  Vincent Danen    2011-12-12 16:25:41 UTC  ``` Created rocksndiamonds tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 766810](show_bug.cgi?id=766810 "CLOSED WONTFIX - rocksndiamonds: creates ~/.rocksndiamonds/ directory as world-writable [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=766805#c2)  Kurt Seifried    2011-12-12 17:42:03 UTC  ``` this issue has been assigned [CVE-2011-4606](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-4606) <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2011/q4/498>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=766805#c3)  Tom "spot" Callaway    2011-12-12 19:39:06 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 545893](attachment.cgi?id=545893&action=diff "Patch to resolve directory security issue") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=545893&action=edit "Patch to resolve directory security issue") Patch to resolve directory security issue  I believe this patch will resolve the security concern, although, I'd like for someone on the Red Hat Security team to double-check my work before I send it upstream and kick off Fedora builds.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=766805#c4)  Vincent Danen    2011-12-12 22:09:24 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=766805#c3)) > Created [attachment 545893](attachment.cgi?id=545893&action=diff "Patch to resolve directory security issue") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=545893&action=edit "Patch to resolve directory security issue") > Patch to resolve directory security issue  At a quick glance, I'm not sure it will.  Shouldn't there be another else in there?  If we're not running setgid, then we're testing for permissions_class (no idea what it's set to), but what if that fails?  There's no "else" there if that test fails.  I don't have time at the moment to look at the patch in context; I suppose sending it upstream for peer review might be best and if they have something better/different, we can use what they have (this is a pretty low-impact issue, so I don't think we need to rush it -- I'd rather upstream review the whole thing first (I don't even know if they've been made aware of it)).   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=766805#c5)  Tom "spot" Callaway    2011-12-12 22:40:24 UTC  ``` So, the context for that code is this (in english):  If the code is running setgid,   then, be sure to set the umask appropriately. Else (it is not setgid)   then, force world writeable permissions (+w) in addition to DIR_PERMS_PRIVATE    (0700)  I changed it to this:  If the code is running setgid,   then, be sure to set the umask appropriately. Else (it is not setgid)   If the directory is explicitly supposed to be created as a public directory     then and only then, force world writeable permissions (+w) in addition to      DIR_PERMS_PUBLIC(0755) (because that is set whenever a directory is created      as a public directory)  When the directory is explicitly supposed to be created as a private directory (which the user ~/.rocksndiamonds directory is already set as), it passes through  createDirectory() with DIR_PERMS_PRIVATE.  It is possible that there is still a security concern in the setgid case, but since we don't run that way for obvious reasons, I don't lose sleep here.  I'll send it upstream for more feedback.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=766805#c6)  Vincent Danen    2011-12-12 22:58:08 UTC  ``` Oh, so the default then is for the directories to be created 0700?  In that case, I think the patch looks fine.  Thanks for taking the time to explain the context.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=766805#c7)  Tom "spot" Callaway    2011-12-12 23:13:32 UTC  ``` Yes, unless you tell createDirectory() that you're making a "Public Directory" (permission_class == PERMS_PUBLIC). Which it never does for the ~/.rocksndiamonds dir.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=766805#c8)  Vincent Danen    2011-12-13 19:13:57 UTC  ``` Makes sense.  Thanks!   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=766805#c9)  Fedora Update System    2012-02-21 01:27:27 UTC  ``` rocksndiamonds-3.3.0.1-5.fc16 has been pushed to the Fedora 16 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=766805#c10)  Fedora Update System    2012-02-21 01:32:11 UTC  ``` rocksndiamonds-3.3.0.1-5.fc15 has been pushed to the Fedora 15 stable repository.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).
