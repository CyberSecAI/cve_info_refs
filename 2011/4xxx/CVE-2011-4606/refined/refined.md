Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-4606:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is that the `rocksndiamonds` game creates its configuration directory (`~/.rocksndiamonds/`) with world-writable permissions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insecure Permissions:** The directory and its subdirectories are created with permissions that allow any user on the system to write to them.
- **Symlink Vulnerability:** An attacker can exploit the world-writable directory by replacing a cache file with a symbolic link to another file on the system, allowing them to overwrite the linked file when the victim runs the game.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** A local attacker can overwrite any file on the system that the victim's user account has write access to. This could lead to various forms of compromise, including data loss, system instability, or potentially privilege escalation if a critical system file is targeted.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system where the `rocksndiamonds` game is installed.
- **File System Manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the file system in the victim's home directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local User Account:** The attacker requires a user account on the target system.
- **Ability to Create/Modify Files/Directories:** The attacker needs to be able to create files and directories in the victim's home directory and delete them.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable directory:** The attacker needs to know the path of the vulnerable configuration directory (~/.rocksndiamonds/) and how the game uses it.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability occurs because the game's code uses a function (likely `posix_mkdir`) to create directories without properly setting the permissions using `umask`.
- The original code would make the directory world writable by default when not running setgid
- A patch was created which fixes the permissions by using the umask and not trying to apply world writeable permissions.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability is classified as "grave" by Debian.
- Red Hat assigned CVE-2011-4606 to this issue and also created a bugzilla entry for it.
- The vulnerability was fixed in `rocksndiamonds` version `3.3.0.1+dfsg1-2.2` in Debian and also patched in Fedora.
