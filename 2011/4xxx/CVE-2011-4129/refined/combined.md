| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=752022#c0)  Sandu Adrian    2011-11-08 11:13:37 UTC  ``` Description of problem: Whenever I boot I see a connection to twitter servers even though I didn't add any online accounts ( and I don't have twitter ). I don't like nor want the web services.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): 16  How reproducible: ALL THE TIME  Steps to Reproduce: 1.boot up 2.look at the connections 3.grep for "socialweb"    Actual results: 1 connection to some twitter server tcp       28      0 10.10.18.71:48311           199.59.149.232:443          CLOSE_WAIT  1529/libsocialweb-c    Expected results: NO CONNECTIONS  Additional info: It might be great for people who use those services, but I don't want my system to have anything related to twitter/facebook or other crap, even more when it tries to make connections without my approval. It's also weird that gnome-shell depends on this stuff !   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=752022#c1)  Henrik Nordström    2011-11-08 12:36:35 UTC  ``` I would rate this as a security issue by two aspects:  * It's a hidden Twitter "bug" that gives Twitter information on every successful Fedora 16 user login to gnome shell in default installation. Without any consent given by the user or any indication that any such notification is taking place.  * no verification of the SSL connection is attempted, leaving the exchange wide-open to mitm attacks which I suspect may open up for possible twitter session theft if there is an twitter network account.   In addition there is a separate minor bug where the twitter client apparently forgets to close the connection, leaving it in CLOSE_WAIT state until logout.   Example data sent to api.twitter.com, extracted by a trivial mitm attack using openssl s_server with a dummy self-signed certificate for a completely different service and iptables nat to redirect the traffic there:   GET /friends/ids.xml?screen%5Fname= HTTP/1.1 Host: api.twitter.com Authorization: OAuth realm="", oauth_nonce="3721916599", oauth_consumer_key="7MXEzcmLr0ro5buVLd37Dw", oauth_signature="nEWrwNMAnzn8OqtBw5L5ZbKXyXY%3D", oauth_version="1.0", oauth_timestamp="1320754869", oauth_signature_method="HMAC-SHA1" Connection: Keep-Alive   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=752022#c2)  Henrik Nordström    2011-11-08 12:44:39 UTC  ``` A temporary workaround is to    chmod 0 /usr/lib64/libsocialweb/services/libtwitter.so  to prevent the twitter client from loading.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=752022#c3)  Peter Robinson    2011-11-08 13:18:46 UTC  ``` libsocialweb doesn't run on its own, it gets started by something else via dbus on request. Looking through the deps on a standard gnome-desktop I suspect this is folks as its the only thing that links against it directly. Whether this is then requested by something that then uses folks such as gnome-contacts, gnome-online-accounts or empathy one of the gnome team would need to confirm   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=752022#c4)  Henrik Nordström    2011-11-08 16:30:30 UTC  ``` fact remains that the twitter service is doing a unasked and silent transaction with twitter each time it gets started with no obvious way to disable.   looking at the code it seems it tries to avoid this by cheking for a NULL API key, but for some reason it still tries even when there is no twitter account configured. (empty but not NULL? or is there some default public api key?)   service/twitter/twitter.c line 512   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=752022#c5)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-11-09 15:03:57 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=752022#c1)) > I would rate this as a security issue by two aspects: >  > * It's a hidden Twitter "bug" that gives Twitter information on every > successful Fedora 16 user login to gnome shell in default installation.

This truly is a security issue. It's a very bad programming custom to open untrusted remote connection without user's approval by default (upon service start).  I have stolen this bug to be a 'Security Response' product one. Thank you for notifying us about this.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=752022#c6)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-11-09 15:05:10 UTC  ``` This issue affects the version of the libsocialweb package, as shipped with Fedora release of 14, 15, and 16.

I fixed this for twitter in:  <http://git.gnome.org/browse/libsocialweb/commit/?id=8982cf504cf3767761fe85d9558beab3d9da5bec>  and  <http://git.gnome.org/browse/libsocialweb/commit/?id=0086bfbfc07345438123a87957e0bc12226e2b94>  Many of the backends were derived from twitter so also need an audit to check if they have correct behavior - i'll do that and fix those today and make a new release.  * Secondly we should enforce that the SSL certificate is valid - i've done that by fixing librest:  <https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=663783>  I'll be making a new librest release today too.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=752022#c11)  Rob Bradford    2011-11-10 18:39:45 UTC  ``` There is a new librest release that forces trusted certificates - <http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/rest/0.7/rest-0.7.12.tar.xz>   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=752022#c12)  Peter Robinson    2011-11-11 09:15:49 UTC  ``` > Many of the backends were derived from twitter so also need an audit to check > if they have correct behavior - i'll do that and fix those today and make a new > release.

Subject: CVE Request -- libsocialweb -- Untrusted connection opened to Twitter
 social service without user's approval upon service start via dbus

Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,

   a security flaw was found in the way the libsocialweb,
a social network data aggregator, performed its initialization
when this service start was initiated by the dbus daemon.
Due to a deficiency in a way the libsocialweb service was
initialized, an untrusted (non-SSL) network connection has
been opened to remote Twitter service servers without explicit
approval of the user, running the libsocialweb service on the
local host. A remote attacker could use this flaw to conduct
various MITM attacks and potentially alter integrity of the user
account in question.

Could you allocate a CVE id for this?

Thank you && Regards, Jan.

P.S.: This one being on the border a bit (since clear security
       consequences of this deficiency not completely investigated),
       but in any case it's a bad programming practice to open
       untrusted connection to remote servers by default without
       particular users' approval (trust boundary crossing).

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).
