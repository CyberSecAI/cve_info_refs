Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2011-4273 (though this is not explicitly stated in the text, the vulnerability described in the text is associated with CVE-2011-4273 according to other sources.)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The GoAhead Webserver fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in POST requests to various functions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Multiple stored and reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. Specifically, the webserver is vulnerable to XSS attacks through the `group` parameter in `addgroup.asp`, the `url` parameter in `addlimit.asp`, and the User ID parameter in `adduser.asp`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code that would be executed when a user accesses the affected webpage.
- This could lead to information leakage, privilege escalation, or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through crafted POST requests to the vulnerable web server.
- The attacker sends a request to specific endpoints (`/goform/AddGroup`, `/goform/AddAccessLimit`, `/goform/AddUser`) with malicious JavaScript code within the parameters `group`, `url`, or `user`.
-  The injected javascript can be stored and reflected depending on the endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs access to the GoAhead Webserver.
- This could be either through a direct connection or, more likely, by tricking a legitimate user to interact with a malicious URL crafted for this vulnerability.

**Specific Vulnerable Locations and Parameters:**
- **Stored XSS:**
    - `addgroup.asp`: vulnerable through the `group` parameter
    - `addlimit.asp`: vulnerable through the `url` parameter.
    - `adduser.asp`: vulnerable through the `user` parameter
- **Reflected XSS:**
    - `addgroup.asp`: Reflected in the response of a malicious request.
    - `adduser.asp`: Reflected in the response of a malicious request

**Additional Notes:**
- The CERT advisory notes that restricting access to the webserver does not prevent XSS attacks.
- The vulnerability is present in GoAhead Webserver version 2.18 and possibly other versions.
- No known practical solution was available at the time of the advisory.

**Summary of extracted information**

The identified vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability affecting the GoAhead Webserver. User supplied data is not sanitized when handled by the webserver, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts via specific parameters, potentially leading to data exfiltration, privilege escalation, and denial of service.
