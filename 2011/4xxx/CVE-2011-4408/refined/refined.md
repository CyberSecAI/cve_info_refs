Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2011-4408:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The Ubuntu Single Sign On Client incorrectly validated server certificates when using HTTPS connections.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper certificate validation. Specifically, the client did not verify the authenticity of the server's SSL/TLS certificate.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacker could exploit this flaw to:
    - Alter or compromise confidential information being transmitted.
    - Potentially gain access to user credentials or other sensitive data.

**Attack vectors:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.
    - An attacker needs to be positioned in the network path between the client and the server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network proximity: The attacker must be able to intercept network traffic between the client and the server.
- Ability to forge certificates: The attacker must have the capability to create a fraudulent certificate that appears to be valid to the vulnerable client.

**Additional details:**
- The fix involved replacing the use of `urllib2` with `pycurl` which provides better certificate validation capabilities.
- The affected package is `ubuntu-sso-client`.
- The vulnerability affected Ubuntu 11.04 (Natty) and 11.10 (Oneiric).
- The patched versions are `1.2.1-0ubuntu2.1` for Ubuntu 11.04 and `1.4.1-0ubuntu1.1` for Ubuntu 11.10.
