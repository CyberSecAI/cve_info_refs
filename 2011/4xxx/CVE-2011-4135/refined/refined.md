      "details": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Flexnet License Server. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within the license server manager which listens on TCP port 27000. There are multiple problems that allow an attacker to influence the saving and loading of log files on the server. By utilizing a directory traversal issue and some file renaming bugs, an attacker can leverage these vulnerabilities would allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code under the user context running the license server manager/vendor daemon.",
