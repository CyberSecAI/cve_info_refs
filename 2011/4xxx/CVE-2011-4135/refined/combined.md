| AFFECTED VENDORS | [Flexera Software](http://www.flexerasoftware.com/) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | [FlexNet License Server Manager](http://www.globes.com/support/fnp_utilities_download.htm) |
| TREND MICRO CUSTOMER PROTECTION | Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID ['11583']. For further product information on the TippingPoint IPS: <http://www.tippingpoint.com> |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Flexnet License Server. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within the license server manager which listens on TCP port 27000. There are multiple problems that allow an attacker to influence the saving and loading of log files on the server. By utilizing a directory traversal issue and some file renaming bugs, an attacker can leverage these vulnerabilities would allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code under the user context running the license server manager/vendor daemon. |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Disclaimer

Review the [IBM security bulletin disclaimer and definitions](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/6610583#disclaimer) regarding your responsibilities for assessing potential impact of security vulnerabilities to your environment.

## Internal Use Only

A possible security vulnerability has been reported in the FlexNet Publisher lmgrd license server manager as well as vendor daemons. There have been no reported exploits of this possible vulnerability and to date it has not been reported by FlexNetSoftware users. This vulnerability impacts the following license server:

IBM Rational License Key Server 8.1.2

IBM Rational License Key Server 8.1.1

IBM Rational License Key Server 8.0

Rational License Server v7.x

Telelogic License Server 2.0

**VULNERABILITY DETAILS:**

This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of FlexNet Publisher license server. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the license server manager which listens on TCP port 27000. There are multiple problems that allow an attacker to influence the saving and loading of log files on the server. By utilizing a directory traversal issue and some file renaming bugs, an attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the user context running the license server manager/vendor daemon.

**CVSS:**

*CVSS Base Score:* ***10*** *CVSS Temporal Score:* See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/71739> for the current score *CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

**REMEDIATION:**

The recommended solution is to apply the iFixes provided by IBM as outlined here.

***Vendor Fix(es):***

**For IBM RLKS 812 or RLKS 8.1.1 Users**

An iFix is available to address this vulnerability. Links for downloading the fixes and the installation instructions are listed below.

[RLKS 8.1.2 iFixes Download Link](http://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=ibm/Rational&product=ibm/Rational/Rational+Common+Licensing&release=8.1.2&platform=All&function=fixId&fixids=Rational-RLKS-8.1.2-Ifix-01&includeSupersedes=0)

[RLKS 8.1.1 iFixes Download Link](http://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=ibm/Rational&product=ibm/Rational/Rational+Common+Licensing&release=8.1.1&platform=All&function=fixId&fixids=Rational-RLKS-8.1.1-Ifix-05&includeSupersedes=0)

How to install the iFixes

To install the Rational License Key Server fix on Windows platforms:

1. Download the Windows iFix.zip file.

2. Extract the compressed files to an appropriate directory.

3. Add the fix pack repository location in Installation Manager as follows:

a) Launch IBM Installation Manager.

b) Click *File->Preferences->Repositories*.

c) Click *Add Repository.*

d) Browse to or enter the file path to the *repository.config* file. The repository.config file is located in the sub-directory "ifix" where you extracted the compressed files.

4. Stop the Rational License Key Server before installing the iFix. Make sure the following processes are not running - lmgrd, lmutil, lmtools and ibmratl.

5. On the main page of Installation Manager, click *Update*.

6. Follow the instructions to install the Fix Pack.

7. Start the Rational License Key Server.

To install the Rational License Key Server fix on Unix platforms:

1. Download the Windows iFix.zip file.

2. Extract the iFix.tar: tar -xvf <iFix>.tar

3. Go to the installation location of the license server.

4. Navigate to the *config* sub-folder.

5. Run the start\_lmgrd\_on\_this\_host script file with the stop option: ./start\_lmgrd\_on\_this\_host stop

6. The license server stops. To verify, run the command: ps -ef | grep lmgrd

7. Navigate to sub-directory <installation\_directory>/base/cots/flexlm.11.8/<Platform>

8. Overwrite files in this directory with all the files from the iFix.

9. Go to the <installation\_directory>/config/ directory.

10. Start the license server using the command: ./start\_lmgrd\_on\_this\_host start

For IBM RLS 8.x, RLS 7.x and IBM Telelogic License Server 2.0 Users

There are no plans to release fixes for Rational License Server v8.x, v7.x and Telelogic License Server 2.0. IBM recommends all customers using these versions of license servers migrate to IBM Rational License Key server 8.1.2 and update the IBM Rational License Key server 8.1.2 with the fix for the security vulnerability described in this Technote.

Instructions on migrating to RLKS 8.1.2 are available through this Info Center Link.

[Migration to RLKS 8.1.2](http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/rational/v0r0m0/topic/com.ibm.rational.license.doc/topics/t_migrate_rational.html)

RLKS 8.1.2 can be downloaded from your Passport Advantage account or here

[812 Download Link](https://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/iwm/web/reg/pick.do?lang=en_US&source=RATL-RATIONAL)

***Workaround(s):***

None

***Mitigation(s):***

Users, who do not wish to migrate to the IBM RLKS 8.1.2, can use one of the possible mitigations as mentioned in [TechNote 1573825](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=0&uid=swg21573825).
