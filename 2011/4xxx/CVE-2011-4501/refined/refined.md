Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in VU#357851:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from some internet router devices incorrectly accepting UPnP requests over their WAN interface. Specifically, the "AddPortMapping" and "DeletePortMapping" actions are accepted. This allows external actors to manipulate the router's port forwarding settings.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **Improper Access Control:** The routers fail to properly restrict UPnP requests to the local network, allowing them to be received and processed from the internet/WAN side.
* **Abuse of UPnP Functionality:** The acceptance of "AddPortMapping" and "DeletePortMapping" requests from the WAN interface allows an attacker to control the router's NAT (Network Address Translation) settings.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Internal Host Scanning:** Attackers can scan internal hosts behind the router by manipulating the port mappings.
* **Traffic Proxying:**  Attackers can proxy internet traffic through the device, potentially for malicious purposes. This would make it seem the traffic was originating from the router's IP address.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **Remote Exploitation:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability remotely over the internet via the router's WAN interface.
* **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability does not require any authentication from the attacker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the router's WAN interface. This would typically be achieved via an internet connection.
* **Knowledge of UPnP Protocol:** The attacker needs to be familiar with the UPnP protocol and the specific actions that can be abused.

**Additional Notes**
* The vulnerability note lists several vendors and their affected devices.
* Workarounds include disabling UPnP on the device.
* The provided CVSS score indicates a high severity level (9.4 Base Score).
* The vulnerability was reported by Daniel Garcia.
* The content includes links to related whitepapers and lists of affected devices.

**CVE Relevance:** While the provided content does not directly contain a CVE ID, it describes a vulnerability that is closely related to the issues described in CVE-2011-4501. This is an issue where UPnP services are exposed to the internet on vulnerable routers.
