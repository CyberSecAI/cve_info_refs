Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities described, which are related to Siemens Automation License Manager:

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **A] Service *_licensekey serialid code execution:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Buffer overflow in the handling of the `serialid` field within the parsing function for `*_licensekey` commands.
    *   **Weakness:** Insufficient bounds checking when copying the serialid into a buffer.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution. The attacker can control the address from which code is executed.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending a specially crafted `*_licensekey` command with an oversized `serialid`.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to send commands to the service.

*   **B] Service exceptions:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Use of `wcscpy_s` to copy data from client into stack buffers without proper size validation.
    *   **Weakness:** Stack buffer overflow due to uncontrolled copy operations.
    *   **Impact:** Potential denial of service via unhandled exceptions.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending requests with overly long fields such as `open_session->workstation->NAME` or `grant->VERSION`.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to send commands to the service.

*  **C] Service NULL pointer:**
    *   **Root Cause:** NULL pointer dereference during the handling of the `get_target_ocx_param` and `send_target_ocx_param` commands.
    *   **Weakness:**  Potential NULL pointer dereference.
    *   **Impact:** Potential denial of service via unhandled exceptions.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending malformed `get_target_ocx_param` or `send_target_ocx_param` commands.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to send commands to the service.

*   **D] almaxcx.dll files overwriting:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `almaxcx.dll` ActiveX component (ALMListView.ALMListCtrl) has a `Save` method that permits saving to an arbitrary filename.
    *   **Weakness:** Arbitrary file overwrite.
    *   **Impact:** Overwriting of any file with 2 bytes "\r\n". Potential for further exploitation, but not confirmed.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Using the `Save` method of the ActiveX component with a target filename.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to interact with the ActiveX component.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerable software is Siemens Automation License Manager versions 500.0.122.1 and earlier.
*   The vulnerabilities are remotely exploitable.
*   The author provides Proof-of-Concept code to exploit the vulnerabilities A, B, C and a html file for D.
*   There is no fix available at the time of the report.
