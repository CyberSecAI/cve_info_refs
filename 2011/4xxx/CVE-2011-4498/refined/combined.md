## Zenprise Device Manager CSRF vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#584363

Original Release Date: 2011-11-18 | Last Revised: 2012-08-03

---

### Overview

The [Zenprise Device Manager](http://www.zenprise.com/products/zenprise_device_manager/) software is susceptible to a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability that may result in the compromise of the fleet of mobile devices managed by the product.

### Description

| Zenprise Device Manager is a mobile device management (MDM) software package that can be used to manage an enterprise's mobile device fleet. The Zenprise Device manager web interface is vulnerable to cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks. A successful CSRF attack against an admin user will allow a remote attacker to run commands as the admin user on any device managed by Zenprise Device Manager. |
| --- |

### Impact

| By tricking a logged in admin user to visit a specially crafted URL, a remote attacker may be able to access any managed device as the admin. The attacker can then perform any action an admin can, including remotely wiping the device. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**  Zenprise has released a [patch to address this issue](http://www.zenpriseportal.com/patches/ZP_SecPatch_618_9995.zip). Current customers can find more information about this vulnerability and patch on the [Zenprise customer center](http://www.zenprise.com/services/customer-center/). |
