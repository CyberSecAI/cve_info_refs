  "CVE-2011-4109": {
    "description": "A double-free vulnerability exists in the policy checking code of OpenSSL. If the `X509_V_FLAG_POLICY_CHECK` flag is set, a policy check failure can lead to a double-free. This vulnerability affects OpenSSL versions prior to 1.0.0. OpenSSL 1.0.0 is not affected. The issue can be triggered by a remote attacker providing an X.509 certificate with specially crafted policy extension data.",

    "impact": "Application crash or potentially arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote attacker sending a specially crafted X.509 certificate with malicious policy extension data."
