# fbsd-uipcsock-heap.sh, by Shaun Colley <scolley@ioactive.com>, 29/09/11
#
# proof-of-concept crash for the freebsd unix domain sockets heap
# overflow.  this was tested on freebsd 8.2-RELEASE.  just a PoC for now.
#
# see advisory & patches for details:
# http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/519864/30/0/threaded
#
# this PoC will usually result in a kernel panic with a read access
# violation at 0x616161XX but sometimes the kernel will not crash straight
# away (particularly if you shorten the length of 'sun_path' -- try 140 bytes),
# and your uid (see output of `id`) may have been modified to the
# decimal equivalent of 0x61616161 during the heap smash

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : kfreebsd-8
Vulnerability  : privilege escalation/denial of service
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-4062

Buffer overflow in the "linux emulation" support in FreeBSD kernel
allows local users to cause a denial of service (panic) and possibly
execute arbitrary code by calling the bind system call with a long path
for a UNIX-domain socket, which is not properly handled when the
address is used by other unspecified system calls.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 8.1+dfsg-8+squeeze2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 8.2-9.

We recommend that you upgrade your kfreebsd-8 packages.

For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit .
0. Revision History
v1.0 2011-09-28 Initial release.
v1.1 2011-10-04 Updated patch to add linux emulation bug fix.
I. Background
UNIX-domain sockets, also known as "local" sockets, are a mechanism for
interprocess communication. They are similar to Internet sockets (and
utilize the same system calls) but instead of relying on IP addresses
and port numbers, UNIX-domain sockets have addresses in the local file
system address space.
FreeBSD contains "linux emulation" support via system call translation
in order to make it possible to use certain linux applications without
recompilation.
II. Problem Description
When a UNIX-domain socket is attached to a location using the bind(2)
system call, the length of the provided path is not validated. Later,
when this address was returned via other system calls, it is copied into
a fixed-length buffer.
Linux uses a larger socket address structure for UNIX-domain sockets
than FreeBSD, and the FreeBSD's linux emulation code did not translate
UNIX-domain socket addresses into the correct size of structure.
III. Impact
A local user can cause the FreeBSD kernel to panic. It may also be
possible to execute code with elevated privileges ("gain root"), escape
from a jail, or to bypass security mechanisms in other ways.
The patch provided with the initial version of this advisory exposed
the pre-existing bug in FreeBSD's linux emulation code, resulting in
attempts to use UNIX sockets from linux applications failing. The most
common instance where UNIX sockets were used by linux applications is
in the context of the X windowing system, including the widely used
linux "flash" web browser plugin.
IV. Workaround
No workaround is available, but systems without untrusted local users
are not vulnerable.
V. Solution
Perform one of the following:
1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to 7-STABLE or 8-STABLE, or to
the RELENG\_8\_2, RELENG\_8\_1, RELENG\_7\_4, or RELENG\_7\_3 security
branch dated after the correction date.
2) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:
The following patch has been verified to apply to FreeBSD 7.4, 7.3,
8.2 and 8.1 systems.
a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-11:05/unix2.patch
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-11:05/unix2.patch.asc
NOTE: The patch distributed at the time of the original advisory fixed
the security vulnerability but exposed the pre-existing bug in the linux
emulation subsystem. Systems to which the original patch was applied
should be patched with the following corrective patch, which contains
only the additional changes required to fix the newly-exposed linux
emulation bug:
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-11:05/unix-linux.patch
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-11:05/unix-linux.patch.asc
b) Apply the patch.
# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch
c) Recompile your kernel as described in
 and reboot the
system.
3) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:
Systems running 7.4-RELEASE, 7.3-RELEASE, 8.2-RELEASE, or 8.1-RELEASE on
the i386 or amd64 platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8)
utility:
# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install
