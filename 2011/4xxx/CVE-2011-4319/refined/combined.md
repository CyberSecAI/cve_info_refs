# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

# XSS vulnerability in the translate helper method in Ruby on Rails

an attacker to insert arbitrary code into a page. This vulnerability
has been disclosed to the public so no a CVE identifier has yet to be
assigned.

Versions Affected: 3.0.0 and later, 2.3.X in combination with the
rails\_xss plugin
Not Affected: Pre-3.0.0 releases, without the rails\_xss plugin,
did no automatic XSS escaping, so are not considered vulnerable
Fixed Versions: 3.0.11, 3.1.2

Impact
------

Ruby on Rails has a helper method for i18n translations. This function
has a convention whereby translations strings with a name ending in
'html' are considered HTML safe. There is also a mechanism for
interpolation. It has been discovered that these 'html' strings allow
arbitrary values to be contained in the interpolated input, and these
values are not escaped.

All users using the translate helper method with 'html safe'
translations which use variable interpolation should either upgrade or
use one of the workarounds immediately.

Workarounds
-----------

Escape all interpolated input manually. For example:

translate('some\_html', :some => '<input>')

should be changed to:

translate('some\_html', :some => h('<input>'))

Patches
-------

To aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided
patches for the two supported release series. They are in git-am format
and consist of a single changeset.

\* 3-0-translate.patch - Patch for 3.0 series
\* 3-1-translate.patch - Patch for 3.1 series

Credits
-------

Thanks to Sergey Nartimov for finding the vulnerability and submitting
the initial patch.
