Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-4319:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the `translate` helper method within the Ruby on Rails ActionPack module. This method, used for internationalization (i18n) translations, incorrectly handles HTML escaping when interpolating user-provided input into HTML-safe translation strings. Specifically, when a translation string's name ends in 'html', it's treated as HTML-safe. However, the interpolated values within such strings were not being escaped, allowing for arbitrary HTML or web script injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core issue is an XSS vulnerability. The `translate` helper does not properly sanitize interpolated user input when used with HTML-safe translation strings.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize user-provided input before including it in the translated output.
*   **Implicit Trust of 'html' Suffix:** The system implicitly trusts translation strings ending in 'html' to be safe, even when they contain interpolated values.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A remote attacker can inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code into the web page.
*   **Client-Side Attacks:** The injected code executes within the user's browser session, potentially leading to:
    *   Data theft (e.g., stealing cookies, session tokens)
    *   Page redirection to malicious sites
    *   Defacement of the web page
    *   Other malicious actions on behalf of the victim
    *   Full compromise of user session

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Specially Crafted Input:** An attacker provides malicious input via any user-controllable parameter that's later interpolated in a translation string marked as "html safe".
*   **Targeting the `translate` Helper:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability in the `translate` helper method.
*   **Interpolation:** The vulnerability requires the use of variable interpolation within the translated string.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to provide input:** The attacker must be able to provide input to the application that will be processed by the vulnerable `translate` method. This could be through form fields, URL parameters, or any other means that allows user-controlled input to reach the vulnerable code path.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware that the `translate` method with HTML-safe translations is vulnerable and how to exploit it.
*   **Remote access:**  The attack is conducted remotely.

**Versions Affected:**

*   Ruby on Rails 3.0.0 and later
*   Ruby on Rails 2.3.X when used in combination with the `rails_xss` plugin.

**Fixed Versions:**

*   Ruby on Rails 3.0.11
*  Ruby on Rails 3.1.2

**Workarounds (Prior to Patching):**

*   Manually escape all interpolated input using the `h()` function before passing it to the `translate` method, as recommended.

```ruby
translate('some_html', :some => h('<input>'))
```
