Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2011-4728:

**Summary:**

The provided text discusses multiple vulnerabilities (XSS, SQL injection, and others) found in Plesk Parallels Panel version psa v10.2.0\_build1011110331.18 on RedHat el6. While it lists CVE-2011-4728 as part of a series of CVEs, it doesn't provide specific details about this particular CVE. However, it confirms that CVE-2011-4728 is related to XSS vulnerabilities in Plesk. The information suggests that the listed CVEs are part of a larger set of vulnerabilities affecting the Plesk control panel that can be exploited with least-privilege user accounts and can result in various attacks including XSS and DoS.

**Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability highlighted is XSS (CWE-79). The text specifies that this can be exploited by least-privileged users, meaning an attacker doesn't need admin access to launch an XSS attack. The report confirms that reflected XSS is present.

*   **SQL Injection:**  The report also indicates the presence of SQL injection vulnerabilities (CWE-89).

*   **Other Injection Vulnerabilities**: The report mentions "other injection vulnerabilities" along with XSS and SQL injection, but doesn't specify them.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is attributed to insufficient input sanitization and improper handling of user-supplied data within the Plesk Parallels Panel. Specifically, the panel fails to adequately sanitize user input, allowing malicious scripts to be injected and executed in the context of other users' browsers via XSS or allow malformed SQL commands to be executed through SQL injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **XSS:** The impact of XSS includes potentially stealing user session cookies, performing actions on behalf of users, defacing the panel, and redirecting users to malicious websites.
*   **SQL Injection**: SQL injection could allow unauthorized access to data, modification of data, or even complete database takeover.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The report also states that DoS attacks are possible.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves exploiting vulnerable input fields or parameters within the Plesk Control Panel accessible to least-privileged users. This indicates a web-based attack vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker requires a valid, albeit low-privileged, account on the Plesk control panel.
*   The attacker must be able to inject malicious scripts or SQL commands into vulnerable parameters or fields in the web interface.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerabilities were initially reported to Plesk in 2010 and CERT in April 2011, but remained unpatched at the time of this report (September 2011).
*   The report refers to several detailed reports providing specific proof of concept (PoC) information. These reports are provided as hyperlinks, though the content of these are not directly included in the document.
*   The report strongly emphasizes the need for regular security testing of websites.

**Additional Detail over CVE Description**:
This content provides more detail than a standard CVE description by outlining the types of vulnerabilities (XSS, SQLi), their causes (lack of input sanitization), the impact (data theft, DoS, etc) and the access levels needed for exploitation (low priv), as well as the fact that there are other unreported injection issues.
