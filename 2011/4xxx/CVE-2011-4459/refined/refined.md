Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of CVE-2011-4459:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- RT versions 3.0 and above might, under certain circumstances, still respect user rights that are only granted through a currently disabled group.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Authorization Bypass:** The system fails to correctly revoke permissions when a user's group is disabled. This leads to a situation where a user might retain privileges they should no longer possess.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Privilege Escalation:** A user with temporary group rights could retain these rights even after the group is disabled, potentially allowing them to perform actions they are not authorized to do. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information or system resources.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector involves users who previously had rights by virtue of group membership. Disabling the group does not fully revoke the permissions in all circumstances.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker would need to be a user who was previously a member of a now disabled group. The attacker leverages the system's failure to properly revoke privileges upon disabling a group.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is present in RT versions 3.0 and above.
- Patches are included in RT versions 3.8.12 and 4.0.6.
