Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2011-4947:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability exists due to the failure of the `/e107_admin/users_extended.php` script to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `user_include` variable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): This vulnerability allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the vulnerable web application.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Compromise of the application**: Successful exploitation could lead to complete compromise of the web application.
*   **Theft of cookie-based authentication credentials**: An attacker could steal session cookies, leading to unauthorized access to user accounts.
*   **Disclosure or modification of sensitive data**: The injected JavaScript could potentially expose sensitive information or alter data within the application.
*   **CSRF attack**: The XSS vulnerability can be exploited through a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack targeting a logged-in administrator. This allows an attacker to steal administrator credentials and/or perform authorized actions with administrator privileges.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector is through the `user_include` parameter in the `/e107_admin/users_extended.php` script.
*   An attacker crafts a malicious webpage (e.g., poc.html, form.html) containing injected JavaScript code within the `user_include` field.
*   The attacker uses CSRF, tricking a logged-in administrator into visiting the malicious web page. The form.html auto submits to the vulnerable script, injecting the payload.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to lure a logged-in administrator to visit a malicious web page.
*   No prior authentication is needed to send the crafted request, since it is a CSRF attack.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability was fixed in revision 12306 of `/e107_admin/users_extended.php`.
*   The fix is described as "User extended fields administration improvements and cleanup" in the changelog, without specific mention of security problems.
