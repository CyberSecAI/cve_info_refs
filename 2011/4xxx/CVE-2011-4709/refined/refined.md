Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is the lack of sanitization of user-supplied input within the Hotaru CMS application. Specifically, the `SITE_NAME` POST parameter (stored), `return` POST parameter (reflected) and `search` GET parameter (reflected) are not properly sanitized, allowing for the injection of malicious HTML code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The `SITE_NAME` parameter allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that is stored within the application and executed when other users view the affected content.
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The `return` and `search` parameters allow an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that is reflected back to the user's browser, executing the script.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser. This can lead to:
    - Session hijacking (stealing cookies/session tokens)
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Defacing the website
    - Accessing sensitive information
    - Performing actions on behalf of the victim
    - Other malicious activities

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vectors include:
    - HTTP POST requests with malicious code in the `SITE_NAME` parameter
    - HTTP POST requests with malicious code in the `return` parameter
    - HTTP GET requests with malicious code in the `search` parameter

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Hotaru CMS installation.
- For the stored XSS, the attacker needs to be able to send a POST request containing malicious script through the `SITE_NAME` parameter.
- For the reflected XSS, the attacker can craft malicious links and trick victims into visiting the link or use a similar method for injecting code into the POST parameter.

**Additional details:**
The advisory explicitly mentions the affected version (1.4.2) and includes a proof-of-concept (PoC) link. It also references several external resources that provide additional information, including the CVE entry itself. The content provides more detail than a simple CVE description by specifying the vulnerable parameters.
