Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the security fixes included in One Click Orgs version 1.2.3:

**Vulnerabilities Addressed:**

*   **HTML Injection:**
    *   **Root Cause:**  HTML was not properly escaped in proposal descriptions and comments.
    *   **Weakness:** Improper output sanitization.
    *   **Impact:** Allows attackers to inject malicious HTML code, potentially leading to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Malicious HTML code injected within proposal descriptions or comments.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker with the ability to submit or modify proposals/comments.

*   **Open Redirection:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The URL used for registering a vote was vulnerable to manipulation, allowing redirects to external sites. Additionally, special characters in the organization's subdomain could also trigger redirects to external sites.
    *   **Weakness:** Insufficient validation of user-supplied URLs or data used in redirect operations.
    *   **Impact:** Users could be tricked into visiting malicious sites, potentially leading to phishing or malware infections.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Manipulating the URL for voting or organization's subdomain.
    *  **Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker with the ability to interact with the voting functionality or manipulate subdomain.

*   **Email Address Duplication:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Members could set their email to that of an existing member, and new members could be added with the same email as an existing member.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of unique email address constraints within the application.
    *   **Impact:** Could lead to confusion and unauthorized access or modification of other member's accounts.
    *   **Attack Vector:** User manipulation during profile update or new user registration.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** A logged-in user or someone registering a new account.

*   **Browser Caching of Credentials:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Browsers were permitted to cache login credentials.
    *   **Weakness:** Inadequate control over caching mechanisms of browser.
    *   **Impact:** Sensitive information could be accessed by unauthorized users using the same device.
    *  **Attack Vector:**  A user having physical access to a device with cached credentials.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Physical access to a device with a saved session.

*   **Password Reset Information Disclosure:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The password reset system allowed a non-member to determine whether or not an email address corresponded to a valid user.
    *  **Weakness:** Improper design of the password reset functionality.
    *   **Impact:** Information Disclosure: an attacker can enumerate registered users.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Using the password reset functionality to check email addresses.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** None, simply needing the password reset form.

*   **Email Header Injection:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The organization's name was not properly escaped for the 'From' field of emails.
    *   **Weakness:** Improper output sanitization of organization name.
    *  **Impact:** Email header manipulation leading to potential email spoofing or spam.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Manipulation of the organization name.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** A user with the ability to modify the organization name.

*   **Invalid Characters in Email Addresses:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Some invalid characters were allowed in members' email addresses.
    *  **Weakness:** Lack of proper validation of email address fields.
    *   **Impact:** Could potentially lead to application errors or bypass of input sanitization functions.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Submitting email addresses with invalid characters during registration or update.
     *  **Attacker Capabilities:** User during new account creation or profile update.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The release also includes feature improvements and non-security bug fixes.
