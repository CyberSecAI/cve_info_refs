Apache2 Ubuntu Default Page

It works!

This is the default welcome page used to test the correct
operation of the Apache2 server after installation on Ubuntu systems.
It is based on the equivalent page on Debian, from which the Ubuntu Apache
packaging is derived.
If you can read this page, it means that the Apache HTTP server installed at
this site is working properly. You should **replace this file** (located at
/var/www/html/index.html) before continuing to operate your HTTP server.

If you are a normal user of this web site and don't know what this page is
about, this probably means that the site is currently unavailable due to
maintenance.
If the problem persists, please contact the site's administrator.

Configuration Overview

Ubuntu's Apache2 default configuration is different from the
upstream default configuration, and split into several files optimized for
interaction with Ubuntu tools. The configuration system is
**fully documented in
/usr/share/doc/apache2/README.Debian.gz**. Refer to this for the full
documentation. Documentation for the web server itself can be
found by accessing the [manual](/manual) if the apache2-doc
package was installed on this server.

The configuration layout for an Apache2 web server installation on Ubuntu systems is as follows:

```

/etc/apache2/
|-- apache2.conf
|       `--  ports.conf
|-- mods-enabled
|       |-- *.load
|       `-- *.conf
|-- conf-enabled
|       `-- *.conf
|-- sites-enabled
|       `-- *.conf

```

* apache2.conf is the main configuration
  file. It puts the pieces together by including all remaining configuration
  files when starting up the web server.
* ports.conf is always included from the
  main configuration file. It is used to determine the listening ports for
  incoming connections, and this file can be customized anytime.
* Configuration files in the mods-enabled/,
  conf-enabled/ and sites-enabled/ directories contain
  particular configuration snippets which manage modules, global configuration
  fragments, or virtual host configurations, respectively.
* They are activated by symlinking available
  configuration files from their respective
  \*-available/ counterparts. These should be managed
  by using our helpers
  a2enmod,
  a2dismod,

  a2ensite,
  a2dissite,

  and
  a2enconf,
  a2disconf
  . See their respective man pages for detailed information.
* The binary is called apache2. Due to the use of
  environment variables, in the default configuration, apache2 needs to be
  started/stopped with /etc/init.d/apache2 or apache2ctl.
  **Calling /usr/bin/apache2 directly will not work** with the
  default configuration.

Document Roots

By default, Ubuntu does not allow access through the web browser to
*any* file apart of those located in /var/www,
[public\_html](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_userdir.html)
directories (when enabled) and /usr/share (for web
applications). If your site is using a web document root
located elsewhere (such as in /srv) you may need to whitelist your
document root directory in /etc/apache2/apache2.conf.

The default Ubuntu document root is /var/www/html. You
can make your own virtual hosts under /var/www. This is different
to previous releases which provides better security out of the box.

Reporting Problems

Please use the ubuntu-bug tool to report bugs in the
Apache2 package with Ubuntu. However, check [existing bug reports](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/apache2) before reporting a new bug.

Please report bugs specific to modules (such as PHP and others)
to respective packages, not to the web server itself.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=750631#c0)  Vincent Danen    2011-11-01 20:21:21 UTC  ``` Vasiliy Kulikov reported [1] that libnet6 did not check the basic_server::id_counter for integer overflows.  This number is used to distinguish different users, so an attacker that was able to open UINT_MAX successive connections could get an identifier of an already existing connection, allowing them to hijack that user's connection.  Note that, as reported, on i686 uint is a 32 bit counter, so an attacker would need to open 4,000,000,000 connections in order to complete the attack.  This has been corrected in git [2].
