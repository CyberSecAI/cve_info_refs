Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2011-4075:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the improper sanitization of the `orderby` parameter within the `cmd.php` file of phpldapadmin. Specifically, when the `cmd` parameter is set to `query_engine`, `query` is set to `none`, and `search` is set to a value (e.g., `1`), the `orderby` parameter's input is passed unsanitized to the `masort` function in `lib/functions.php`.
*   The `masort` function then uses the unsanitized input from the `orderby` parameter within a `create_function()` call, leading to PHP code injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **PHP Code Injection:**  The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject and execute arbitrary PHP code due to the lack of sanitization before using user-provided input in the `create_function()` call.
*   **Unsanitized Input:** The core issue is the failure to properly sanitize the input received through the `orderby` parameter before it is used within a potentially dangerous function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server. This can lead to a range of malicious outcomes, including:
    *   **Complete System Compromise:** Full control over the web server.
    *   **Data Breaches:** Access to sensitive data stored within the application or on the server.
    *   **Malware Installation:**  Deployment of malicious software on the server.
    *   **Denial of Service:** Disrupting the availability of the application or server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:**  The attack vector involves crafting a malicious HTTP POST request to the `cmd.php` file. The attacker manipulates the `orderby` parameter with malicious PHP code.
*   **Specific Parameter Values:** The exploit requires setting the `cmd`, `query`, and `search` parameters to specific values (`query_engine`, `none`, and a value like `1`, respectively) to reach the vulnerable code path.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable phpldapadmin instance.
*   **Understanding of HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to construct HTTP requests and manipulate parameters.
*  **No Authentication Required:** The exploit can be carried out without prior authentication

**Additional Information:**

*   The exploit is triggered when handling the 'query_engine' command.
*   The vulnerability is present in phpLDAPadmin versions up to and including 1.2.1.1.
*   The provided exploit code demonstrates how to achieve arbitrary command execution by injecting code into the `orderby` parameter.
*   The fix was committed on 05/10/2011.
