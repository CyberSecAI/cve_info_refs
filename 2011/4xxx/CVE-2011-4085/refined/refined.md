{
  "CVE-2011-4085": {
    "description": "By using a specially crafted HTTP request, the first layer of authentication for the invoker servlets deployed by httpha-invoker can be bypassed, as the access restrictions only apply for GET and POST.",
    "root_cause": "The invoker servlets only performed access control on the HTTP GET and POST methods, allowing remote attackers to make unauthenticated requests by using different HTTP methods.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Authentication bypass",
      "Improper access control based on HTTP verb."
    ],
    "impact": "Bypass of the first layer of authentication for invoker servlets. If a user misconfigured the security interceptor or inadvertently disabled it, this flaw would be exploitable.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending a crafted HTTP request with an HTTP method other than GET or POST"
    ],
     "required_capabilities": "Attacker must be able to send a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable servlet"
  }
