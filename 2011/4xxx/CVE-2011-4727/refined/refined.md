Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2011-4727, although the content groups multiple CVEs together:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the presence of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and other injection vulnerabilities within the Plesk Parallels Control Panel. Specifically, the content mentions "XSS and other injection vulnerabilities"

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability highlighted is XSS (CWE-79), where user-supplied input is not properly sanitized, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages.
*   **SQL Injection (SQLi):**  The report also mentions SQL injection (CWE-89), which is a separate injection vulnerability.
*   **JavaScript injection:** The report mentions a javascript injection vulnerability, which is very likely related to the XSS vulnerability.
*   **Other Injection vulnerabilities:** The text also mentions "other injection vulnerabilities" besides XSS and SQL injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The content mentions various exploits are possible from XSS to DoS (Denial of Service).
*   XSS can be leveraged to perform actions on behalf of a logged-in user, potentially leading to data theft, manipulation, or privilege escalation.
*   SQL injection, if exploited, can allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to or modify the database.
*   DoS, as mentioned, can render the service unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the Plesk Parallels Control Panel interface.
*   Specifically, the vulnerability can be exploited by a user with "least-privs" when logged into the control panel.
*   The XSS vulnerability is triggered via user-supplied input that isn't correctly sanitized.
*   The specific nature of the injected input, or the parameters where the injection occurs are not detailed in this summary.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs a valid user account with "least-privs" on the Plesk Control Panel.
*   The attacker does not need to be an administrator.
*   The attacker must be able to inject malicious code/input via the control panel interface.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerabilities were initially reported to Plesk in October 2010 and to CERT in April 2011.
*   The content references several reports including those generated using Acunetix and Paros scanners.
*   The vulnerabilities were present in Plesk Parallels Control Panel Version psa v10.2.0\_build1011110331.18 on RedHat el6 and also on Windows Server (20110407.20 version).
