**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would likely need to have some form of access to the Moodle platform, possibly as a regular user, to be able to access the vulnerable `mod/forum/user.php` page. No special privileges seem to be required, as the problem is that the user details are exposed to non-authorized users.

**Affected Versions:**
