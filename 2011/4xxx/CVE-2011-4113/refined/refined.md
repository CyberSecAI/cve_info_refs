Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-4113:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw.
- The Drupal Views module (version 6.x based) did not properly sanitize database parameters for certain filters or arguments.
- This improper sanitization occurred on specific types of views with particular argument configurations.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The primary weakness is the failure to properly escape or sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary SQL command execution: A successful exploit allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands on the vulnerable Drupal system's database. This could lead to:
    - Data Breaches: Accessing, modifying, or deleting sensitive data stored in the database.
    - System takeover: Potentially gaining control over the Drupal system or the underlying server by injecting malicious code or stored procedures
    - Denial of service: Causing database errors and making the application unstable

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote attack: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, meaning an attacker does not require local access to the server.
- Specially crafted SQL queries: The attacker provides a malicious SQL query as input through filters/arguments of the Views module.
- Specific view configurations: The vulnerability is triggered with specific configurations of arguments in certain views.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Remote attacker
- Ability to craft malicious SQL queries
- Knowledge of the target system, particularly its use of Drupal and the Views module (version 6.x)
- Ability to interact with the vulnerable Drupal instance through its web interface

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is specific to the Drupal Views module version 6.x.
- The issue is identified as "SA-CONTRIB-2011-052".
- Patches were released for Fedora and Fedora EPEL distributions.
