CVE-2011-4954:
- Root cause of vulnerability: Cobbler uses an insecure location for PYTHON_EGG_CACHE, which can be manipulated by a local attacker.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Local privilege escalation due to insecure use of PYTHON_EGG_CACHE.
- Impact of exploitation: A local attacker can escalate their privileges to root and potentially execute arbitrary code.
- Attack vectors: Local attacker needs to trick an administrator into running cobbler with a specially-crafted PYTHON_EGG_CACHE.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: Local user access and the ability to manipulate the PYTHON_EGG_CACHE environment variable.
