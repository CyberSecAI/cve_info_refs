Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-4962:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the use of PHP's `serialize()` function to store user-submitted data in a cookie related to page comments. This allowed for the potential of exploiting PHP object injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Deserialization:** The primary vulnerability is the usage of `unserialize()` on user-controlled data stored in a cookie. This function can be exploited to execute arbitrary code if the serialized data contains malicious object structures.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** By crafting a malicious serialized object containing exploitable PHP code, an attacker could potentially achieve remote code execution on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
*   **Data Manipulation:** An attacker might also be able to modify data by manipulating object properties during deserialization, leading to other forms of attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Page Comments:** The vulnerability is specifically tied to user comments functionality, where user-supplied data was being serialized for later retrieval via a cookie.
*   **Malicious Cookie:** An attacker would craft a special cookie containing a malicious serialized payload and send it to the server, triggering the `unserialize()` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Send HTTP Requests:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the server, including setting cookies.
*   **Knowledge of PHP Object Injection:** The attacker needs knowledge of PHP object injection techniques and the specific class structure of the target application in order to generate the malicious payload.

**Additional Details:**

*   The commit `d15e850` addresses this issue by replacing `serialize()` with `Convert::raw2json()` and `unserialize()` with `Convert::json2array()`. This change switches from PHP serialization to a more secure JSON format for data handling in cookies, mitigating the remote code execution vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was present in SilverStripe CMS before version 2.4.7
