- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Some Lexmark Multifunction Devices include sensitive configuration values, specifically authentication credentials (including passwords used for email delivery), in exported settings files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Inclusion of sensitive data (passwords) in exported settings files. This constitutes an information leakage vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unauthorized disclosure of device configuration information, including email delivery authentication credentials, which can lead to unauthorized access and potentially further malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Requesting the printer to export its settings.
    - Accessing previously exported settings files.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to either request the export of printer settings or have access to previously exported settings files. This can be achieved through network access or physical access to the files.
