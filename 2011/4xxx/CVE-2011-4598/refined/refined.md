**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A NULL pointer dereference flaw exists in Asterisk when processing INFO requests with the 'automon' feature enabled.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  NULL pointer dereference: The code attempts to access a memory location using a pointer that is NULL (pointing to no valid memory).

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): A remote attacker can cause Asterisk to crash by sending a specially crafted INFO request.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote attack: The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely by sending malformed SIP packets.
- Specific scenario: The vulnerability is triggered when the 'automon' feature is enabled, and an INFO request is received before a channel has been created.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Remote, unauthenticated attacker: The attacker does not need any prior authentication or privileges on the Asterisk server.
- Ability to send SIP INFO requests: The attacker needs to be able to send SIP packets to the Asterisk server.
- Knowledge of enabled automon feature: The attacker needs to know that the 'automon' feature is enabled on the target Asterisk server.

**Additional notes:**

- The vulnerability is present in Asterisk versions 1.6.2.x and 1.8.x and is fixed in versions 1.6.2.21 and 1.8.7.2.
- The 'automon' feature is disabled by default.
