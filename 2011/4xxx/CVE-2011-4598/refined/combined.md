Subject: CVE Request -- Asterisk -- AST-2011-013 and AST-2011-014

Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,

   the following two security flaws have been recently fixed:
   <http://www.asterisk.org/node/51693>

in Asterisk:

1) AST-2011-013 Possible to enumerate SIP usernames when general and user/peer NAT settings differed

    An information disclosure flaw was found in the way Asterisk handled UDP
    requests in configurations using network address translation (NAT) for the SIP
    protocol. When the general configuration file section and user / peer
    configuration file section NAT settings differed, it was possible to enumerate
    SIP usernames if the request was sent to different port as that, specified in
    the Via header.

    [4] <https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=394095>
    [5] <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=765773>

    Upstream bug report:
    [6] <https://issues.asterisk.org/jira/browse/ASTERISK-18862>

    Upstream review board request:
    [7] <https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/1591/>

    Upstream patch (for 1.8 branch):
    [8] <http://svnview.digium.com/svn/asterisk?view=revision&sortby=date&revision=345828>

2) AST-2011-014 NULL pointer dereference (crash) when processing INFO automon message
    with no channel

    A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way Asterisk handled INFO
    requests, when the 'automon' feature was enabled. If no channel had been
    created yet, a remote attacker could use this flaw to cause a denial of service
    (asterisk crash) by sending an INFO request.

    Upstream patch (for 1.8 branch):
    [13] <http://svnview.digium.com/svn/asterisk?view=revision&sortby=date&revision=347533>

Could you allocate CVE ids for these?

Thank you && Regards, Jan.

Asterisk
Project Security Advisory - AST-2011-014

| **Product** | Asterisk |
| **Summary** | Remote crash possibility with SIP and the âautomonâ feature enabled |
| **Nature of Advisory** | Remote crash vulnerability in a feature that is disabled by default |
| **Susceptibility** | Remote unauthenticated sessions |
| **Severity** | Moderate |
| **Exploits Known** | Yes |
| **Reported On** | November 2, 2011 |
| **Reported By** | Kristijan Vrban |
| **Posted On** | 2011-11-03 |

| **Advisory Contact** | Terry Wilson <twilson@digium.com> |
| **CVE Name** |  |

| **Description** | When the âautomonâ feature is enabled in features.conf, it is possible to send a sequence of SIP requests that cause Asterisk to dereference a NULL pointer and crash. |

| **Resolution** | Applying the referenced patches that check that the pointer is not NULL before accessing it will resolve the issue. The âautomonâ feature can be disabled in features.conf as a workaround. |

| **Affected Versions** | | |
| **Product** | **Release Series** |  |
| Asterisk Open Source | 1.6.2.x | All versions |
| Asterisk Open Source | 1.8.x | All versions |

CVE ID         : CVE-2011-4597 CVE-2011-4598
Debian Bug     :

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Asterisk, an Open
Source PBX and telephony toolkit:

CVE-2011-4597

   Ben Williams discovered that it was possible to enumerate SIP
   user names in some configurations. Please see the upstream
   advisory for details:
   <http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/security/AST-2011-013.html>

   This update only modifies the sample sip.conf configuration
   file. Please see README.Debian for more information on how
   to update your installation.

CVE-2011-4598

   Kristijan Vrban discovered that Asterisk can be crashed with
   malformed SIP packets if the "automon" feature is enabled.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:1.4.21.2~dfsg-3+lenny6.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:1.6.2.9-2+squeeze4.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:1.8.8.0~dfsg-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your asterisk packages.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=765776#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-12-09 11:53:33 UTC  ``` A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way Asterisk handled INFO requests, when the 'automon' feature was enabled. If no channel had been created yet, a remote attacker could use this flaw to cause a denial of service (asterisk crash) by sending an INFO request.
