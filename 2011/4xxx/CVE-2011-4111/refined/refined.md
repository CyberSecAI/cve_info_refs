  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2011-4111",
    "description": "A flaw was found in the way qemu-kvm handled VSC_ATR messages when a guest was configured for a CCID (Chip/Smart Card Interface Devices) USB smart card reader in passthrough mode. An attacker able to connect to the port on the host being used for such a device could use this flaw to crash the qemu-kvm process on the host or, possibly, escalate their privileges on the host.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a buffer overflow in the way qemu-kvm handled VSC_ATR messages when a guest was configured for a CCID USB smart card reader in passthrough mode.",
     "weaknesses": [
        "Buffer Overflow"
      ],
    "impact": "An attacker could crash the qemu-kvm process on the host or potentially escalate their privileges on the host.",
    "attack_vector": "An attacker needs to be able to connect to the port on the host being used for a CCID USB smart card reader in passthrough mode.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have network access to the host's port used for the CCID passthrough device."
