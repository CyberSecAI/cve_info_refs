# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

### [No! It’s just a buggy “Pay please”-Plugin](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/no-its-just-a-buggy-pay-please-plugin/)

[Michael Ritsch](https://profiles.wordpress.org/michaelritsch/ "Posts by Michael Ritsch")
October 12, 2021

The free version is a useless “pay please” plugin…. you are limited to 3 gallerys…. they want you to pay if you want to use it on a normal way. I decided to telete it instant – but the plugin is so buggy that you are not able to delete it. Just an error appears.
i’m not able to uninstall that plugin without an ftp connection.

### [Great! -but maybe easily affected?..](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/other-plugins-are-killing-this-one/)

This plugin in itself are excellent. Beautiful galleries and easy to use albums.
I’ve experienced though that other plugins -or themes -too easily mess with functions in this plugin. But who am I to actually know who / what to blame ;)..
4 stars for a lovely plugin -1 for maybe more updates? and maybe not so easily affected by other plugins etc..

This is the only gallery plugin that allowed me to customise it as per my needs. Most are looking fancy but they are somehow limited in customisation. This one has it all(almost). Thank you.

I’ve installed following the instructions and the gallery doesn’t work.
Creating a Gallery creates a folder but not showing in the list.

You can download and try every other existing photo gallery (paid and free ones) in the whole wordpress repository, but you won’t find another system complete and reliable like this one. FLAGALLERY WORKS perfectly with ELEMENTOR and every other page builder you can think of. You can use a ton of different “SKIN” to meet any design need. The authors keep updating and improving the plugin on regular frequent basis. FAST AND RELIABLE, RESPONSIVE WITH A PIXEL PERFECT DESIGN. The Galleries / Albums / Upload management system is just WONDERFUL. Believe me, don’t search further, the photogallery system you’ve always dreamed about is HERE.
