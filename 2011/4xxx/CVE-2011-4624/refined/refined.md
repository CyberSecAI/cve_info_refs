Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-4624:

**CVE Description:**

The provided data includes a CVE request and confirmation for a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the `facebook.php` file of the WordPress flash-album-gallery plugin.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of user-supplied input within the `facebook.php` file of the Flash Album Gallery plugin. Specifically, the code uses `$_GET` parameters without sufficient sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the generated web pages.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS. The code directly uses `$_GET` parameters such as `f`, `h`, `v`, and `mv` to set variables, which are then used in the output. This allows a malicious user to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the web page, which can then be executed in the browsers of other users who access the page.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The code uses `intval()` to sanitize the 'h' parameter, but does not sanitize the 'f', 'v', and 'mv' parameters. This is insufficient to prevent XSS attacks since the code then places these unsanitized values directly into the HTML output.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code, which can be used to:
    *   Steal cookies and session tokens
    *   Redirect users to malicious websites
    *   Deface the website
    *   Perform actions on behalf of the user
    *   Potentially gain further access depending on the website's setup.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **URL Manipulation:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL that includes the payload within the vulnerable `$_GET` parameters, such as:
    * `http://vulnerable-site.com/wp-content/plugins/flash-album-gallery/facebook.php?f=<script>alert('XSS')</script>`
    *   `http://vulnerable-site.com/wp-content/plugins/flash-album-gallery/facebook.php?h=<script>alert('XSS')</script>`
    *  `http://vulnerable-site.com/wp-content/plugins/flash-album-gallery/facebook.php?v=<script>alert('XSS')</script>`
    *  `http://vulnerable-site.com/wp-content/plugins/flash-album-gallery/facebook.php?mv=<script>alert('XSS')</script>`
*   The victim then visits the malicious link, resulting in the execution of the attacker's script.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Ability to craft malicious URLs:** The attacker needs to be able to create URLs with the malicious JavaScript code embedded in the query parameters.
*   **Ability to trick or lure victim:** The attacker needs a way to get a victim to click the crafted malicious URL. This can be through social engineering, link embedding on other sites or by injecting links via other vulnerabilities.

**Additional Details:**

* The fix (changeset 469785) involves changing how the `$h` parameter is handled, using `intval()` for the `$h` parameter, instead of just `~~$_GET['h']~~`  , and `intval()` for the `mv` parameter.
* The plugin was closed due to a security issue.

This analysis provides more detail than the initial CVE description, which just labels it as an XSS vulnerability.
