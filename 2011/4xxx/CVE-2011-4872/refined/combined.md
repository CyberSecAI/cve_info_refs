## 802.1X password exploit on many HTC Android devices

#### Vulnerability Note VU#763355

Original Release Date: 2012-02-01 | Last Revised: 2012-02-01

---

### Overview

A user's 802.1X WiFi credentials and SSID information may be exposed to any application with basic WiFi permissions on certain HTC builds of Android.

### Description

| Any Android application on an affected HTC build with the android.permission.ACCESS\_WIFI\_STATE permission can use the .toString() member of the WifiConfiguration class to view all 802.1X credentials and SSID information. If the same application also has the android.permission.INTERNET permission then that application can harvest the credentials and exfiltrate them to a server on the Internet.  The following devices have been reported as affected:     + Desire HD (both "ace" and "spade" board revisions) - Versions FRG83D, GRI40 + Glacier - Version FRG83 + Droid Incredible - Version FRF91 + Thunderbolt 4G - Version FRG83D + Sensation Z710e - Version GRI40 + Sensation 4G - Version GRI40 + Desire S - Version GRI40 + EVO 3D - Version GRI40 + EVO 4G - Version GRI40  The following devices have been reported as not affected:    + myTouch3g + Nexus One  Additional details can be found in [Bret Jordan's blog post](http://blog.mywarwithentropy.com/2012/02/8021x-password-exploit-on-many-htc.html). |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker may be able to view and exfiltrate WiFi SSID information and credentials. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an Update**Users with an affected HTC phone should visit the [HTC support site](http://www.htc.com/www/help/) for instructions on how to update their phone. In some cases, the update will be automatically delivered to the phone. |

Affected

### Vendor Statement

We have not received a statement from the vendor.

### Vendor Information

31 January 2012

HTC has developed a fix for a small WiFi issue affecting some HTC phones. Most phones have received this fix already through regular updates and upgrades. However, some phones will need to have the fix manually loaded. Please [check back](http://www.htc.com/www/help/) next week for more information about this fix and a manual download if you need to update your phone.

### 802.1X password exploit on many HTC Android devices

February 1, 2012

**Subject**

802.1X password exploit on many HTC Android devices

**Abstract**

There is an issue in certain HTC builds of Android that can expose the user's 802.1X Wi-Fi credentials to any program with basic WI-FI permissions.  When this is paired with the Internet access permissions, which most applications have, an application could easily send all stored Wi-Fi network credentials (user names, passwords, and SSID information) to a remote server.  This exploit exposes enterprise-privileged credentials in a manner that allows targeted exploitation.

**Affected Vendors**

HTC

**Affected Versions**

We have verified the following devices as having this issue (there may be others including some non-HTC phones):

Desire HD  (both "ace" and "spade" board revisions) - Versions FRG83D, GRI40

Glacier - Version FRG83

Droid Incredible - Version FRF91

Thunderbolt 4G - Version FRG83D

Sensation Z710e - Version GRI40

Sensation 4G - Version GRI40

Desire S - Version GRI40

EVO 3D - Version GRI40

EVO 4G - Version GRI40

**Non-Affected Versions**

myTouch3g  (Appears to run either unmodified, or only lightly modified

Android build)

Nexus One  (Runs unmodified Android build)

**Severity**

Critical

**Vulnerability Details**

There is an issue in certain HTC builds of Android that can expose the user's 802.1X password to any program with the "android.permission.ACCESS\_WIFI\_STATE" permission. When paired with the "android.permission.INTERNET" permission, an app could easily send user names and passwords to a remote server for collection. In addition, if the SSID is an identifiable SSID ("Sample University" or "Enterprise XYZ"), this issue exposes enterprise-privileged credentials in a manner that allows targeted exploitation.

Although the published Android APIs don't provide access to the 802.1X settings, it is possible to view the settings with the .toString() member of the WifiConfiguration class. The resulting output will look something like this:

\* ID: 2 SSID: "ct" BSSID: null PRIO: 16

KeyMgmt: WPA\_EAP IEEE8021X Protocols: WPA RSN

AuthAlgorithms:

PairwiseCiphers: CCMP

GroupCiphers: WEP40 WEP104 TKIP CCMP

PSK:

eap: PEAP

phase2: auth=MSCHAPV2

identity: [Your User Name]

anonymous\_identity:

password:

client\_cert:

private\_key:

ca\_cert: keystore://CACERT\_ct

On most Android devices, the password field is either left blank, or simply populated with a "\*" to indicate that a password is present. However, on affected HTC devices, the password field contains the actual user password in clear text.

This is sample output from a Sprint EVO running Android 2.3.3:

\* ID: 0 SSID: "wpa2eap" BSSID: null PRIO: 21

KeyMgmt: WPA\_EAP IEEE8021X Protocols: WPA RSN

AuthAlgorithms:

PairwiseCiphers: CCMP

GroupCiphers: WEP40 WEP104 TKIP CCMP

PSK:

eap: TTLS

phase2: auth=PAP

identity: test

anonymous\_identity:

password: test

client\_cert:

private\_key:

ca\_cert: keystore://CACERT\_wpa2eap

**Vendor Response**

Google and HTC have been very responsive and good to work with on this issue.  Google has made changes to the Android code to help better protect the credential store and HTC has released updates for all currently supported phone and side-loads for all non-supported phone.

Customer with affected versions can find information from HTC about updating their phone at: http://www.htc.com/www/help/

Google has also done a code scan of every application currently in the Android Market and there are no applications currently exploiting this vulnerability.

   I notice that my HTC Aria, Android 2.2, Version FRG83G also has the same issue.

   Interesting. Could this be related to the issue below I reported last June?

   Turn Wi-Fi on -> Dial \*#\*#4636#\*#\* -> Wi-Fi Information -> Wi-Fi Status -> this exposes 802.1x credentials.

   http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=18139&q=802.1x&colspec=ID%20Type%20Status%20Owner%20Summary%20Stars

   Incidentally this now appears to be fixed on my Desire S which had a couple of updates around December.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
