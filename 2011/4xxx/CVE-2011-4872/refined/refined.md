{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from how certain HTC builds of Android handle 802.1X Wi-Fi credentials. Instead of masking the password field, the .toString() method of the WifiConfiguration class exposes the user's actual 802.1X password in clear text.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cleartext storage of sensitive information",
      "Insecure use of .toString() method on WifiConfiguration class",
      "Insufficient access control for WiFi configuration data"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially view and exfiltrate a user's 802.1X Wi-Fi credentials (including usernames, passwords, and SSID information). This could allow unauthorized access to secured networks. In the case of enterprise networks, this vulnerability could lead to targeted attacks that compromise sensitive systems and data.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Malicious Android applications installed on the affected HTC device",
	  "The malicious app needs the android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE permission and optionally android.permission.INTERNET to exfiltrate the data remotely."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a malicious Android application with the 'android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE' permission. If the attacker wants to exfiltrate the data remotely, the 'android.permission.INTERNET' permission is also required. The attacker must be able to convince the user to install this application on a vulnerable HTC device."
