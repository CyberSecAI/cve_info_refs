Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2011-4613:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the incorrect permission check within the X.Org X wrapper (`xserver-wrapper.c`). This wrapper is intended to ensure that the X server is only started from a console (TTY) by authorized users. The check involved inspecting the properties of the file connected to the standard input (stdin). However, the check was flawed, as it only verified that the file was a character device with specific major and minor numbers associated with TTYs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate TTY Verification:** The vulnerability stems from relying on a simple check of file type and device numbers. This allowed a malicious user to bypass the TTY check by redirecting standard input to a file that had similar properties (character device, specific major/minor numbers), despite not being an actual console.
*   **Bypass of Access Control:** The incorrect check allowed users who weren't actually on a console to start the X server with elevated (root) privileges, a privilege that should only be given to console users.
*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability could be exploited remotely via tools such as SSH because the vulnerability allowed an attacker to use any readable character device that matched the criteria of a TTY. The files `/dev/tty` and `/dev/ptmx` are readable by all users and matched the criteria, making them ideal for exploitation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** By bypassing the console check, an unprivileged user can start the X server with root privileges, gaining a higher level of access than intended.
*   **Security Restriction Bypass:** The vulnerability bypasses the intended security restriction that the X server can only be started from a console by authorized users.
*   **Potential for further attacks:** The vulnerability could be combined with other vulnerabilities (like CVE-2011-4029 which allowed to set read permissions to any file) to launch further attacks from remote sessions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Exploitation:** An attacker could execute code locally while redirecting standard input. This vector is more useful in combination with other vulnerabilities to elevate privileges.
*   **Remote Exploitation:** The attack can be carried out remotely via SSH or other remote access tools by redirecting stdin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Basic user privileges:** The attacker needs to have a basic user account on the system.
*   **Ability to execute commands:** The attacker needs to be able to execute commands on the system.
*   **Access to a suitable device:** The attacker needs access to a readable character device that can be used to mimic a console, such as `/dev/tty` or `/dev/ptmx`.
*   **Remote access (optional):** The attacker does not need local console access, because the vulnerability can be exploited remotely.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was introduced by a change to allow devices with major number 5 to be considered consoles which allowed files like `/dev/tty` and `/dev/ptmx` to pass the checks.
*   The fix involved reverting this change and also included resetting the effective group id when dropping privileges.

The provided documents from Ubuntu and Debian detail the vulnerability, its impact, and the fixes released to address it. The fix involved modifying the `xserver-wrapper.c` to remove the problematic check.
