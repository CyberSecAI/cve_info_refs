**Credits:** Credits go to Sebastian Schinzel who discovered and reported the issue.

**Vulnerability Type:** Authentication Delay Bypass

**Severity:** Low

**Suggested CVSS v2.0:** [AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N/E:U/RL:OF/RC:C](http://jvnrss.ise.chuo-u.ac.jp/jtg/cvss/cvss2.cgi?vector=%28AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N/E:U/RL:OF/RC:C%29&g=2&lang=en "CVSS calculator") ([What's that?](http://buzz.typo3.org/teams/security/article/use-of-common-vulnerability-scoring-system-in-typo3-security-advisories/ "Blog post on CVSS usage"))

**Credits:** Credits go to TYPO3 Security Team member Georg Ringer who discovered and reported the issue.

**Vulnerability Type:** Information Disclosure

**Severity:** Medium

**Suggested CVSS v2.0:** [AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:N/A:N/E:U/RL:OF/RC:C](http://jvnrss.ise.chuo-u.ac.jp/jtg/cvss/cvss2.cgi?vector=%28AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:N/A:N/E:U/RL:OF/RC:C%29&g=2&lang=en "CVSS calculator") ([What's that?](http://buzz.typo3.org/teams/security/article/use-of-common-vulnerability-scoring-system-in-typo3-security-advisories/ "Blog post on CVSS usage"))

**Problem Description:** A TYPO3 Backend user (editor) is able to see workspace changes of records in any languages - even for those he hasn't got granted access to.

**Credits:** Credits go to TYPO3 Workspaces Team member Michael Klapperer who discovered and reported the issue.

**Vulnerability Type:** Information Disclosure

**Severity:** High

**Suggested CVSS v2.0:** [AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:P/A:N/E:U/RL:OF/RC:C](http://jvnrss.ise.chuo-u.ac.jp/jtg/cvss/cvss2.cgi?vector=%28AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:P/A:N/E:U/RL:OF/RC:C%29&g=2&lang=en "CVSS calculator") ([What's that?](http://buzz.typo3.org/teams/security/article/use-of-common-vulnerability-scoring-system-in-typo3-security-advisories/ "Blog post on CVSS usage"))

**Problem Description:** Using "getText" feature on headlines of content elements it is possible to retrieve arbitrary data from TYPO3 database. The vulnerability results from an insecure configuration in css\_styled\_content system extension.

**Solution:** Update to the TYPO3 versions 4.3.12, 4.4.9 or 4.5.4 that fix the problem described.

**Important Note:** Having an adjusted fontTag property in the provided TypoScript (e.g. lib.stdheader.10.1.fontTag) or depending on headlines passed through fontTag might result in unexpected rendering results. Headline rendering is now handled through dataWrap (e.g. lib.stdheader.10.1.dataWrap). Make sure to check your TypoScript before the update and check the wesite rendering after it!

**Credits:** Credits go to Mads Chr. Olesen who discovered and reported the issue.

**Vulnerability Type:** Unserialize() vulnerability

**Severity:** High

**Suggested CVSS v2.0:** [AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:P/I:C/A:N/E:U/RL:OF/RC:C](http://jvnrss.ise.chuo-u.ac.jp/jtg/cvss/cvss2.cgi?vector=%28AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:P/I:C/A:N/E:U/RL:OF/RC:C%29&g=2&lang=en "CVSS calculator") ([What's that?](http://buzz.typo3.org/teams/security/article/use-of-common-vulnerability-scoring-system-in-typo3-security-advisories/ "Blog post on CVSS usage"))

**Solution:** Update to the TYPO3 versions 4.3.12, 4.4.9 or 4.5.4 that fix the problem described.

**Credits:** Credits go to TYPO3 Security Team member Marcus Krause who discovered and reported the issue.

## Vulnerable subcomponent #3: Exposed API

**Vulnerability Type:** Cross-Site Scripting

**Severity:** Medium

**Suggested CVSS v2.0:** [AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N/E:U/RL:OF/RC:C](http://jvnrss.ise.chuo-u.ac.jp/jtg/cvss/cvss2.cgi?vector=%28AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N/E:U/RL:OF/RC:C%29&g=2&lang=en "CVSS calculator") ([What's that?](http://buzz.typo3.org/teams/security/article/use-of-common-vulnerability-scoring-system-in-typo3-security-advisories/ "Blog post on CVSS usage"))

**Problem Description:** The RemoveXSS function fails to sanitize an attack vector that works in Internet Explorer version 6.

**Solution:** Update to the TYPO3 versions 4.3.12, 4.4.9 or 4.5.4 that fix the problem described.

**Credits:** Credits go to Vladimir Podkovanov who discovered and reported the issue.

**Vulnerability Type:** Missing Access Control

**Severity:** High

**Suggested CVSS v2.0:** [AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:N/E:U/RL:OF/RC:C](http://jvnrss.ise.chuo-u.ac.jp/jtg/cvss/cvss2.cgi?vector=%28AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:N/E:U/RL:OF/RC:C%29&g=2&lang=en "CVSS calculator") ([What's that?](http://buzz.typo3.org/teams/security/article/use-of-common-vulnerability-scoring-system-in-typo3-security-advisories/ "Blog post on CVSS usage"))

**Problem Description:** ExtDirect endpoints are not associated with TYPO3 backend modules and such TYPO3 access control is not applied on ExtDirect calls. This allows arbitrary BE users to consume any available ExtDirect endpoint service.

**Solution:** Update to the TYPO3 versions 4.4.9 or 4.5.4 that fix the problem described.

**Note:** From now on ExtDirect components need to be registered through t3lib\_extMgm::registerExtDirectComponent() function call.

**Credits:** Credits go to TYPO3 Security Team member Helmut Hummel who discovered and reported the issue.

**General advice:** Follow the recommendations that are given in the [TYPO3 Security Cookbook](http://typo3.org/teams/security/security-bulletins/typo3-core/fileadmin/security-team/typo3_security_cookbook_v-0.5.pdf "Initiates file download").

### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.
