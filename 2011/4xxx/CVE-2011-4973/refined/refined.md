{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "mod_nss, when using FakeBasicAuth, only used the Common Name (CN) from the client certificate's subject instead of the full subject Distinguished Name (DN). This deviates from mod_ssl's behavior.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Authentication bypass due to insufficient verification of client certificate information.",
      "Incorrect handling of client certificate data within mod_nss's FakeBasicAuth implementation."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could bypass authentication by crafting a client certificate with a specific Common Name (CN) that matches a user in the htpasswd file, without possessing a valid certificate that is tied to the full DN.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack is performed by sending a crafted client certificate during an SSL/TLS handshake.",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to generate a client certificate with a Common Name that matches a user in the htpasswd file used by mod_nss. The attacker does not need the actual user's certificate. The attacker also needs to send the crafted certificate during the authentication process."
