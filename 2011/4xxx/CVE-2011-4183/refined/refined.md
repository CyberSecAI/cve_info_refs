Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-4183:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A bug introduced in commit `0ff279bd` allowed unauthenticated remote users to submit arbitrary build job results, such as binary RPMs, into any project. This indicates a missing authentication or authorization check in the build process.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Missing Authentication/Authorization:** The primary weakness was the lack of proper authentication and authorization checks for uploading build results. This allowed anyone to post data to the build system.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary code execution:**  An attacker could upload malicious binary packages (RPMs) into any project, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on systems that install these compromised packages.
- **Data corruption:** An attacker could overwrite existing legitimate packages with malicious versions, leading to unpredictable and potentially harmful behavior.
- **System compromise:** The ability to submit malicious binaries into build jobs could lead to a full system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Remote network access:** The vulnerability could be exploited by any remote user over the network.
- **HTTP POST request:** The vulnerability was triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/build` endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network access to the OBS instance:** The attacker must have network connectivity to the vulnerable openSUSE Build Service instance.
- **No prior authentication required:** The attacker did not need to authenticate or have an existing user account on the build service.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in commit `5281e4bff9df31f1f91e22a0d1e9086b93b23d7e` and was addressed in version 2.1.16 of the openSUSE Build Service.
- The commit log indicates that the fix involved adding a check to verify if the user uploading binaries is an administrator. This indicates that the fix likely focused on adding an authorization check.
- The `build_controller.rb` diff shows the addition of a check `if @http_user.is_admin?` to restrict binary uploads to administrators only.
