Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2011-4585:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The change password form was being sent over plain HTTP, even when the `httpslogin` setting was enabled. This means that the password change process was not secure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insecure transmission of sensitive data (password).
- Failure to enforce HTTPS when configured.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Man-in-the-middle attacks:** An attacker could intercept the HTTP request containing the new password, potentially gaining access to the user's account.
- **Credentials compromise:** The attacker could then use the stolen password to impersonate the user and access their account.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network interception: Attacker would need to be in a position to intercept the network traffic between the user and the Moodle server. This could be on the same local network or through a compromised network device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to intercept network traffic between the user and the Moodle server.
- No specific user-level privileges are required, just the ability to eavesdrop on network communications.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability affected Moodle versions 1.9 up to 1.9.14+.
- Moodle versions 2.x and later were not affected.
- The fix involved ensuring the password change form is transmitted over HTTPS when required.
