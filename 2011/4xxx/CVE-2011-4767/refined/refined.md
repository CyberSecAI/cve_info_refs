## Issue background

The presence of email addresses within application responses does not necessarily constitute a security vulnerability. Email addresses may appear intentionally within contact information, and many applications (such as web mail) include arbitrary third-party email addresses within their core content.

However, email addresses of developers and other individuals (whether appearing on-screen or hidden within page source) may disclose information that is useful to an attacker; for example, they may represent usernames that can be used at the application's login, and they may be used in social engineering attacks against the organisation's personnel. Unnecessary or excessive disclosure of email addresses may also lead to an increase in the volume of spam email received.
## Issue remediation

You should review the email addresses being disclosed by the application, and consider removing any that are unnecessary, or replacing personal addresses with anonymous mailbox addresses (such as helpdesk@example.com).

### Extracted Information

- **Root cause of vulnerability**:  Email addresses are directly present in the source code files and responses.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Email disclosure.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  Attackers can gather email addresses of developers and other individuals. These email addresses can be used in social engineering attacks against the organization's personnel. Unnecessary disclosure of email addresses may also increase the volume of spam received by personnel.
- **Attack vectors**: Direct access to the vulnerable URLs hosting the source code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to send requests to the web application to view the identified resources.
