# Advisory Details

December 22nd, 2011
## HP Managed Printing Administration MPAUploader.dll Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-11-353ZDI-CAN-1065

| CVE ID | [CVE-2011-4167](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-4167) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 9.0, [AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:C](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=2.0&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:C) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [Hewlett-Packard](http://www.hp.com/) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | [Managed Printing Administration](http://www.hp.com/united-states/campaigns/printforward/?jumpID=ex_r11400_us/en/large/IPG/entpf_ps_g_hpmanagedprinting/ManagedPrintingBroad/&s_kwcid=TC|17982|HP%20managed%20printing||S|b|6060627265#/ENTERPRISE/ENT_OPTIMIZE_YOUR_INFRASTRUCTURE/MANAGED_PRINT) |
| TREND MICRO CUSTOMER PROTECTION | Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID ['11697']. For further product information on the TippingPoint IPS: <http://www.tippingpoint.com> |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of HP Managed Printing Administration. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within the MPAUploader.dll file. An extended length string can be passed into scripts within the management website on port 80 (the 'uploadfile' multipart form data 'filename' parameter in Default.asp) and ultimately to MPAUploader.dll. As a static stack allocation is used to store the buffer and the string length is not handled properly, a remote attacker may overwrite the stack and ultimately execute remote code. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | Hewlett-Packard has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at: |
