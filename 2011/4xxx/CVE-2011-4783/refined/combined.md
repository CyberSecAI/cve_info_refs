## Vulnerability in Hex-Rays IDA Pro, IDAPython Plugin Could Allow Arbitrary Script Execution

Published: December 20, 2011 | Updated: December 21, 2011

**Version:** 2.0

### Overview

#### Executive Summary

Microsoft is providing notification of the discovery and remediation of a vulnerability affecting IDA Pro running the IDAPython plugin. By default, the IDAPython plugin is installed with all versions of IDA Pro. Microsoft discovered and disclosed the vulnerability under coordinated vulnerability disclosure to the affected vendor, Hex-Rays. Hex-Rays has remediated the vulnerability in their software.

A vulnerability exists in the way that IDA Pro running the IDAPython plugin parses IDB files that could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary script. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute a script with the same user rights as the logged-on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

Microsoft Vulnerability Research reported this issue to and coordinated with Hex-Rays to ensure remediation of this issue. The vulnerability has been assigned the entry CVE-2011-4783, in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list. For more information about updates from Hex-Rays, visit the [Hex-Rays IDA Pro website](https://hex-rays.com/products/ida/index.shtml).

#### Mitigating Factors

* The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through email. For an attack to be successful, a user must open an attachment that is sent in an email message.
* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that contains a specially crafted file that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these websites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attackerâs website, and then convince them to open the specially crafted file.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

### Advisory Details

#### Purpose and Recommendation

**Purpose of Advisory:** To notify users of a vulnerability and its remediation.

**Advisory Status:** Advisory published.

**Recommendation:** Review the **Suggested Actions** section and configure as appropriate.

#### Issue References

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What is the scope of this advisory?**

This advisory is part of a coordinated release with affected vendors to inform customers of a security issue that may affect their systems.

**Is this a security vulnerability that requires Microsoft to issue a security update?**

No. This vulnerability has been fixed via an update from the affected third-party vendors. The update remediates the software listed in the table, **Affected Software**.

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is an arbitrary script execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute a script with the same user rights as the logged-on user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability exists in the way that IDA Pro, specifically the IDAPython Plugin which is installed by default, handles parsing IDB files.

**What might an attacker use this vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as a logged-on user. If the user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by tricking a user into opening a specially crafted file with an affected version of IDA Pro. Typically these specially crafted files are delivered via social engineering techniques in email, instant messaging, or via download links on websites. This vulnerability cannot be exploited without user interaction.

![pseudocode-1](https://hex-rays.com/hs-fs/hubfs/pseudocode-1.jpg?width=1372&name=pseudocode-1.jpg "pseudocode-1")

### High-quality, readable, and maintainable pseudocode.

IDA decompilers focus on delivering code that is readable, maintainable, and semantically similar to the original source code thanks to high-level abstractions, semantic preservation, readability, type inference, structure recovery and more.

[Explore IDA Decompilers](https://hex-rays.com/decompiler)

### Metadata about well-known functions. At your fingertips.

The Public Lumina server, maintained by Hex-Rays, tracks metadata for well-known functions, such as names, or operand types. Your IDA instance exchanges only hash values and metadata with the Public Lumina server, avoiding the transfer of sensitive byte patterns through the network.

If you prefer to keep control over your metadata, enable our Private Lumina add-on to use your own self-hosted Lumina server.

## Deobfuscation ⏎

### Make sense of obfuscated binaries with gooMBA

IDA Pro greatly simplifies the workflow of reverse-engineers dealing with obfuscated binaries, especially those involving Mixed Boolean-Arithmetic (MBA) expressions. The gooMBA plug-in ships with IDA Pro and combines algebraic and program synthesis techniques with smart heuristics for best-in-class deobfuscation performance. It integrates directly into the Hex-Rays decompilers and provides a bridge to an SMT-solver that can prove the correctness of simplifications.

FAQs
## Frequently asked questions

You’ve got questions. We have answers!

### Can I change the selected decompilers after the license activation?

No. Once the decompilers are assigned to your license before activation, they cannot be changed during your subscription period. If you upgrade to a higher plan during your subscription period, you will be then prompted to select additional decompilers according to the chosen plan.

Check more details about the decompilers assignment in our [FAQ](/faqs/can-i-change-the-decompilers-assigned-to-mylicense-during-subscription-period).

#####

### Is there a free trial version of IDA Pro?

Although we currently do not offer the trial version of IDA Pro, we encourage you to try [IDA Free](/ida-free) to check the basic IDA capabilities.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
