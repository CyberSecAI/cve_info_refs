**Vulnerabilities and Fixes in One Click Orgs 1.2.3**

The release notes for One Click Orgs version 1.2.3 list several security fixes, indicating multiple vulnerabilities present in prior versions. Here's a breakdown of the identified issues:

*   **HTML Injection:**
    *   **Root Cause:** HTML was not properly escaped in proposal descriptions and comments.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of proper input sanitization and output encoding.
    *  **Impact:** This could allow attackers to inject malicious HTML into the application, potentially leading to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, which could steal user cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or deface pages.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious HTML code via proposal descriptions and comments.

*   **Open Redirect:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Users could be redirected to an external site by abusing the URL used for registering a vote. Additionally, special characters in the organization's subdomain could lead to redirects.
    *   **Weakness:** Inadequate validation of redirect URLs and subdomain inputs.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers could potentially use this to create phishing attacks, tricking users into visiting malicious websites that appear legitimate.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Manipulating vote registration URLs or the organization's subdomain.

*   **User Enumeration/Account Takeover:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Members could set their email to that of an existing member, and new members could be added with the same email as an existing member. Also, the password reset system allowed a non-member to determine if an email address corresponded to a valid user.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of unique email constraint when setting email addresses and vulnerable password reset system.
    *   **Impact:** This could allow attackers to potentially take over accounts or enumerate valid user emails, which could aid further attacks.
    *  **Attack Vector:** Exploiting account creation or modification to insert existing member's emails, or using the password reset system.

*   **Credential Caching:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Browsers were permitted to cache login credentials.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of proper directives to prevent caching of sensitive information.
    *   **Impact:** If an attacker gains access to a user's machine or browser, it could enable them to gain access to the user's account due to cached credentials.
    *  **Attack Vector:** Access to browser cache of user machines.

*   **Email Header Injection:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The organization's name was not properly escaped for the 'From' field of emails.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of proper encoding of the organization's name when used in the email's 'From' field
     *   **Impact:** This could allow attackers to inject arbitrary headers, potentially leading to email spoofing or other attacks related to email manipulation.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Modifying the organization name to inject malicious headers.

*  **Email validation bypass:**
    *  **Root Cause:** Some invalid characters were allowed in members' email addresses.
    *  **Weakness:** Inadequate email address validation.
    *  **Impact:** This could lead to unexpected behavior or potential vulnerabilities if the application doesn't handle invalid characters correctly.
    *  **Attack Vector:** Providing crafted email addresses during account creation or modification.

**Additional Information:**

*   The security fixes were the result of a security review by Darren McDonald.
*   The release also included bug fixes and feature improvements.
*   The underlying Rails framework was upgraded to version 3.0.10.
