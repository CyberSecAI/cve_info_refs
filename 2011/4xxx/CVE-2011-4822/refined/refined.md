Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-4822:

**Verification:**

The content directly references "XSS Vulnerabilities" in "FishEye user profile - snippets in a user's comment" and links to the Jira issue FE-3798, which is related to the identified XSS vulnerability. The advisory also mentions "stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities" which is a relevant description of the issue. This content is therefore related to CVE-2011-4822.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the FishEye user profile comments section. Specifically, the application fails to properly encode or sanitize user-provided snippets within comments, allowing the injection of malicious JavaScript.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application stores user-provided data without proper sanitization, leading to XSS when the data is later displayed to other users.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can embed malicious JavaScript into a FishEye page. This can lead to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement of the page
    - Redirection to malicious websites
    - Stealing of user credentials
    - Other malicious actions within the user's browser session, depending on the attacker's payload.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through user-submitted comments in the FishEye user profile. An attacker would need to create or edit a user profile comment, injecting malicious JavaScript code. This malicious code will then be stored and executed whenever other users view the profile and comment.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be a user with the ability to create or edit comments in the affected FishEye/Crucible instance.
- No special privileges are needed beyond the ability to add/edit user profile comments.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in FishEye and Crucible versions 2.5.4 and earlier.
- The vulnerability was fixed in FishEye and Crucible version 2.5.5.
- The vulnerability is rated as "high" severity by Atlassian.
- The provided documents references external sources describing XSS attacks such as cgisecurity.com and The Web Application Security Consortium.
- The advisory recommends upgrading the FishEye/Crucible instance to the fixed version.
- A temporary mitigation is suggested if an upgrade can not be performed immediately by disabling public signups.
