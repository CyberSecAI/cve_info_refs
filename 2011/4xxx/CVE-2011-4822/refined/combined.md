How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

This advisory discloses a number of security vulnerabilities that we have found and fixed in versions of FishEye/Crucible earlier than 2.5.7. You need to upgrade your existing FishEye and Crucible installations to fix these vulnerabilities. Enterprise Hosted customers should request an upgrade by raising a support request at [http://support.atlassian.com](http://support.atlassian.com/) in the "Enterprise Hosting Support" project. Neither JIRA Studio nor Atlassian OnDemand are vulnerable to any of the issues described in this advisory.

Atlassian is committed to improving product security. The vulnerabilities listed in this advisory have been discovered by Atlassian, unless noted otherwise. The reporter may also have requested that we do not credit them.

If you have questions or concerns regarding this advisory, please raise a support request at <http://support.atlassian.com/>.

**In this advisory:**

## XSS Vulnerabilities

### Severity

Atlassian rates the severity level of these vulnerabilities as **high**, according to the scale published in [Severity Levels for Security Issues](http://confluence.stg.internal.atlassian.com/display/FISHEYE/Severity%2BLevels%2Bfor%2BSecurity%2BIssues). The scale allows us to rank the severity as critical, high, medium or low. These vulnerabilities are **not** critical.

### Risk Assessment

We have identified and fixed a number of stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities which affect FishEye/Crucible instances, including publicly available instances (that is, internet-facing servers). XSS vulnerabilities allow an attacker to embed their own JavaScript into a FishEye/Crucible page. You can read more about XSS attacks on [Wikipedia](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Cross-site_scripting), at [The Web Application Security Consortium](http://projects.webappsec.org/Cross-Site%2BScripting) and other places on the web.

### Vulnerabilities

The table below describes the FishEye/Crucible versions and the specific functionality affected by the XSS vulnerabilities.

| FishEye/Crucible Feature | Affected FishEye/Crucible Versions | Fixed Version | Issue Tracking |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FishEye user profile - display name | 2.5.4 and earlier | 2.5.5 | [FE-3797](https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/FE-3797) |
| FishEye user profile - snippets in a user's comment | 2.5.4 and earlier | 2.5.5 | [FE-3798](https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/FE-3798) |

### Risk Mitigation

We recommend that you upgrade your FishEye/Crucible installation to fix these vulnerabilities.

Alternatively, if you are not in a position to upgrade immediately and you judge it necessary, you can disable [public signup](http://confluence.stg.internal.atlassian.com/display/FISHEYE/Configuring%2BPublic%2BSignup) to your instance as a temporary mitigation until you have applied the upgrade. For tighter access control, you can restrict access to trusted [groups](http://confluence.stg.internal.atlassian.com/display/FISHEYE/Associating%2Ba%2BGroup%2Bwith%2Ba%2BRepository).

### Fix

FishEye and Crucible 2.5.5 and later versions fix two these issues. View the issues linked above for information on fix versions. You can download the latest versions of FishEye and Crucible from the download centres ([FishEye download centre](http://www.atlassian.com/software/fisheye/FishEyeDownloadCenter.jspa), [Crucible download centre](http://www.atlassian.com/software/crucible/CrucibleDownloadCenter.jspa)).

There are no patches available to fix these vulnerabilities. You must upgrade your FishEye/Crucible installation.

## Permission Verification Vulnerabilities

### Severity

Atlassian rates the severity level of these vulnerabilities as **medium**, according to the scale published in [Severity Levels for Security Issues](http://confluence.stg.internal.atlassian.com/display/FISHEYE/Severity%2BLevels%2Bfor%2BSecurity%2BIssues). The scale allows us to rank the severity as critical, high, medium or low. These vulnerabilities are **not** critical.

### Risk Assessment

We have identified and fixed two permission verification bugs which affect FishEye/Crucible instances, including publicly available instances (that is, internet-facing servers). These vulnerabilities allow users to view metadata for changesets and reviews, from repositories/projects that they do not have access to, via tooltips.

### Vulnerability

The table below describes the FishEye/Crucible versions and the specific functionality affected by the vulnerabilities.

| FishEye/Crucible Feature | Affected FishEye/Crucible Versions | Fixed Version | Issue Tracking |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FishEye changeset tooltips | FishEye 2.4.6 to 2.5.6 | FishEye 2.5.7 | [FE-3811](https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/FE-3811) |
| Crucible review tooltips | Crucible 2.4.6 to 2.5.6 | Crucible 2.5.7 | [CRUC-5811](https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CRUC-5811) |

### Risk Mitigation

We recommend that you upgrade your FishEye/Crucible installation to fix these vulnerabilities.

Alternatively, if you are not in a position to upgrade immediately and you judge it necessary, you can [disable anonymous access](http://confluence.stg.internal.atlassian.com/display/FISHEYE/Configuring%2BAnonymous%2BAccess) to your instance. Logged-in users will still be able to view metadata that they do not have permission to view, but anonymous users will be prevented from accessing this information.

### Fix

FishEye and Crucible 2.5.7 and later versions fix these two issues. View the issues linked above for information on earlier fix versions for each issue. For a full description of this release, see the [FishEye 2.5 changelog](http://confluence.stg.internal.atlassian.com/display/FISHEYE/Fisheye%2B2.5%2BChangelog) and [Crucible 2.5 Changelog](http://confluence.stg.internal.atlassian.com/display/CRUCIBLE/Crucible%2B2.5%2BChangelog).You can download the latest version of FishEye and Crucible from the download centres ([FishEye download centre](http://www.atlassian.com/software/fisheye/FishEyeDownloadCenter.jspa), [Crucible download centre](http://www.atlassian.com/software/crucible/CrucibleDownloadCenter.jspa)).

There are no patches available to fix these vulnerabilities. You must upgrade your FishEye/Crucible installation.
