Findings for CVE-2011-4406:
```

- **Vulnerability:** The Ubuntu AccountsService package before 0.6.14-1git1ubuntu1.1 does not properly drop privileges when changing language settings.
- **Root Cause:** Incorrect privilege handling in AccountsService when modifying language settings. Specifically, the issue lies in the language-tools scripts not dropping privileges before writing to `$HOME` and the `chown()` call in `/usr/share/language-tools/save-to-profile`.
- **Attack Vector:** A local attacker can exploit this issue.
- **Impact:** The vulnerability allows local users to modify arbitrary files, potentially leading to a denial of service or privilege escalation.
- **Affected Versions:** Ubuntu AccountsService package before 0.6.14-1git1ubuntu1.1. Ubuntu 11.10 (oneiric) is affected.
- **Mitigation:** Update the `accountsservice` package to version 0.6.14-1git1ubuntu1.1 or later. The fix involves dropping privileges before letting help scripts in `/usr/share/language-tools` write to `$HOME` and removing the `chown()` call in `/usr/share/language-tools/save-to-profile`.
