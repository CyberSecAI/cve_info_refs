Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in the phpMyAdmin security advisory PMASA-2011-18, which is associated with CVE-2011-4634:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization and output encoding within phpMyAdmin, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS, which occurs in multiple areas of the phpMyAdmin application:
    *   **Database Synchronize and Rename Panels:** Crafted database names could be used to inject malicious scripts.
    *   **Table Overview Panel and View Creation Dialog:** Invalid and crafted SQL queries could lead to XSS when editing a query or creating a view.
    *   **Table Search and Create Index Dialogs:** Crafted column types could be used to inject malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation would allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a logged-in phpMyAdmin user's browser.
*   **Session Hijacking:** An attacker could potentially steal cookies and session tokens, allowing them to impersonate the user.
*   **Data Theft/Manipulation:** An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive data or manipulate database contents.
*   **Malware Distribution:** The attacker could redirect the user to malicious sites or download malware.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted Input:** The attack vectors involve crafting malicious input specifically designed to trigger XSS vulnerabilities. This can include:
    *   Specially crafted database names.
    *   Malicious SQL queries.
    *   Crafted column types.
*   **User Interaction:** The victim needs to be a logged-in user of phpMyAdmin. The malicious scripts would be executed within the user's session.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to phpMyAdmin:** The attacker needs to have some access to a phpMyAdmin instance.
*   **Knowledge of phpMyAdmin:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerable input areas (database names, SQL queries, column types).
*   **Logged-in User:** The attack requires a logged-in user to execute the malicious script within their active session.
*   **Valid Token:**  A valid CSRF token needs to be part of the request, which limits the ability to directly exploit this issue from a different origin.

**Mitigation Note:**
The advisory states that the attacks are "unlikely to succeed on a victim" due to the requirement of the user being logged in and having a valid token. This mitigates the impact of the vulnerability, but does not remove it.

**More Detail than CVE:**

The provided content gives more detail than a typical CVE description by:

*   **Specifying the exact locations where the XSS occurs** (database synchronize/rename panels, table overview, view creation, search, index dialogs).
*   **Providing details on how to trigger the vulnerabilities** (crafted database names, invalid SQL, crafted column types).
*   **Outlining the mitigation factors** (logged-in user requirement, valid token requirement).
*   **Including references and links to the code patches.**

In summary, the advisory describes multiple XSS vulnerabilities in phpMyAdmin that could be exploited by crafting malicious input, requiring a logged-in user and valid token for exploitation, and could lead to arbitrary script execution and potential data compromise.
