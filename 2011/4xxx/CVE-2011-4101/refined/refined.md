Subject: Re: CVE request for wireshark flaws

For the record: this is a *perfect* CVE request =). It's descriptive, it
has versions, it has all the links to verify it with the original
sources, all that good stuff.

## wnpa-sec-2011-18 · Wireshark Infiniband dissector vulnerability

## Summary

**Name:** Wireshark Infiniband dissector vulnerability

**Docid:** wnpa-sec-2011-18

**Date:** November 1, 2011

**Affected versions:** 1.4.0 to 1.4.9, 1.6.0 to 1.6.2

**Fixed versions:** 1.6.3

**References:**

Wireshark
bug 6476

## Details

### Description

Huzaifa Sidhpurwala of Red Hat Security Response Team discovered
that the Infiniband dissector could dereference a NULL pointer.

## Impact

It may be possible to make Wireshark crash by injecting a malformed packet onto
the wire or by convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace file.

## Resolution

Upgrade to Wireshark 1.6.3 or later.
```

```
```
[Description](show_bug.cgi?id=750645#c0)  Vincent Danen    2011-11-01 21:08:23 UTC  ``` A flaw in the Infiniband dissector could cause Wireshark 1.4.0 through 1.4.9 and 1.6.0 through 1.6.3 to crash by dereferencing a NULL pointer by reading a malformed packet trace file or if someone were to inject a malformed packet onto the wire.  This is corrected in wireshark 1.6.3
```
```
Statement:  Not vulnerable. This issue did not affect the versions of wireshark as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5 and 6.
```

Based on the provided information:

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A NULL pointer dereference in the Infiniband dissector of Wireshark.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The Infiniband dissector attempts to dereference a NULL pointer under certain conditions
- **Impact of exploitation**:  A crash of the Wireshark application.
- **Attack vectors**: By injecting a malformed packet onto the network or by convincing a user to read a malformed packet trace file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to either inject malformed network packets or provide a malformed capture file to a Wireshark user.
