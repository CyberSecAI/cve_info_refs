The provided content indicates that CVE-2011-4733 is related to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities found in Parallels Plesk Control Panel Version 20110407.20 for Windows and RHEL6 Linux versions.

Here's a breakdown of the information:

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The root cause is the presence of XSS vulnerabilities within the Plesk Control Panel application. These vulnerabilities allow for the injection of malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
*  **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The primary weakness is XSS (CWE-79). The report also mentions other injection vulnerabilities and SQL injection (CWE-89) might be present, though not directly confirmed.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to various impacts, including:
    *   Execution of malicious JavaScript within the control panel.
    *   Potential for DoS (Denial of Service) attacks.
    *   Further unspecified exploits are possible via XSS.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the web interface of the Plesk control panel. A logged-in user with least privileges can inject malicious scripts that would be executed in the browsers of other users accessing the panel.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker requires a valid login to the Plesk Control Panel, but they do not need to be an administrator. They can have the least privileged user role.

The content also indicates the vulnerabilities were reported privately to Plesk in October 2010 and to CERT in April 2011, and the issues remained unpatched as of September 2011. The report includes links to more detailed reports generated via other vulnerability scanning tools.
