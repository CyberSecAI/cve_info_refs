{
  "CVE-2011-4328": {
    "description": "plugin/npapi/plugin.cpp in Gnash before 0.8.10 uses weak permissions (world readable) for cookie files with predictable names in /tmp, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information.",
    "root_cause": "The Gnash plugin creates HTTP cookie files in /tmp with world-readable permissions and predictable names based on the process ID (PID).",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Insecure file permissions",
      "Predictable file names",
      "Information Leakage"
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker can read the cookie files and obtain sensitive information, such as session identifiers or other data stored in cookies. Additionally, a race condition exists which could allow an attacker to symlink the cookie file to an arbitrary file before Gnash sets the permissions, allowing arbitrary file overwriting and privilege escalation.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access to the filesystem",
	  "Race condition"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must have local access to the system where Gnash is running. For the race condition attack, a user with write access to /tmp is needed."
