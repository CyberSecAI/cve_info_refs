How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via

```
```
Package: gnash
Version: 0.8.10~git20111001-1
Tags: security
Severity: critical
Justification: Introduces a new security hole

Hi,

after watching videos on YouTube I found this in /tmp:

	$ ls -l /tmp/gnash*
	-rw-r--r-- 1 alexander alexander 329 Nov 20 15:22 /tmp/gnash-cookies.31032
	$

Please note that the file is world-readable. This enables things like:

	$ sudo -u nobody cat /tmp/gnash-cookies.31032
	Set-Cookie: use_hitbox=72c46ff6cbcdb7c5585c36411b6b334edAEAAAAw
	Set-Cookie:  VISITOR_INFO1_LIVE=WEbeevRfDNo
	Set-Cookie:  recently_watched_video_id_list=885d7cf2658d586fc1bef37a995ce29cWwEAAABzCwAAAHV3SFIwM1pHd1k4
	Set-Cookie:  GEO=0bf89ff87b12d82d91e10ddf1da36d95cwsAAAAzREVUmagnTskNGQ==
	Set-Cookie:  PREF=f1=40000000&fv=10.1.999
	$

Since gnash is installed per default and also starts playing as soon as
flash content is detected, this can be a serious security/privacy issue
on multi-user systems. Gnash should either use $HOME for storing cookies
or create them with sane permissions (0600).

I don't think this fixes the underlying problem: An attacker would still
be able to read the cookie if he managed to win the race-condition and
opens the file before the chmod(). If you agree, please remove the
"fixed-upstream" tag.

Furthermore, I took a quick look at the code and noticed this:

	1105     gnash::log_debug("The Cookie for %s is %s", url, ncookie);
	1106     std::ofstream cookiefile;
	1107     std::stringstream ss;
	1108     ss << "/tmp/gnash-cookies." << getpid();
	1109
	1110     cookiefile.open(ss.str().c_str(), std::ios::out | std::ios::trunc);
	1111     chmod (ss.str().c_str(), 0600);

I might be wrong, but I very strongly suspect a possible symlink attack
here which would enable an attacker to overwrite arbitrary files and
(with your patch) change their permissions.

Best regards

Hi!
I am a user of the gnash package and I am experiencing the same issue.

I would add the following consideration: why does gnash create cookies
at all?

I thought I managed to disable flash cookies long time ago with the
following setting:

  $ grep SOLSafeDir /etc/gnashrc
  set SOLSafeDir /dev/null

but it seems that this option is not (or no longer?) enough to prevent
gnash from creating/storing cookies.

Could someone please tell me where is the option to disable cookies?
I think there should be one, but I seem to be unable to find it...

Thanks for your time!

Good question.

> I think there should be one, but I seem to be unable to find it...

I configured this via the gnash GUI:

	$ grep -i sol ~/.gnashpluginrc
	set solReadOnly true
	set solLocalDomain false
	set SOLSafeDir /home/alexander/.gnash/SharedObjects
	$

Hope this helps!

And did gnash stop creating cookies in /tmp after that configuration
change?
Also, does it refrain from creating cookies in your
~/.gnash/SharedObjects directory?

Maybe, but thanks for your prompt reply anyway!   :-)

Yes. It still created some subdirectories, but no actual cookies.

So, it seems that so-called Flash shared objects and gnash-cookies (the
ones created by Gnash in /tmp) are different things.

The former may be disabled via the gnash GUI, as you did, or,
equivalently, by editing (user-specific or system-wide) configuration
files, as I did.

What about the latter?
We still have to figure out whether they can be disabled...

IIRC they contain essential info to make yt working. So we can't move
them under SOLSafeDir because if you set it to /dev/null or make it
read-only, it'll break yt.
I'd move them under ~/.gnash [0], although I don't know what could
remove them at the end without introducing new rc options.

Any developers alive?

  Correct. The /tmp/gnash-cookies* are standard HTTP cookies, which are
required to make many sites work, including YouTube. SharedObjects are
often called Flash Cookies, and a potential privacy issue. Gnash has a
utility called soldumper that'll dump all the SharedObject data to the
terminal so you can see what's being stored.

  YouTube needs the HTTP cookies, so it can get the redirect to a
geographically closer server. It should work without the SharedObjects,
if not, it's a bug. Here's what's in the three SharedObjects used by
YouTube:

Dumping SOL file
The file name is: ./videostats.sol
The size of the file is: 199
The name of the object is: videostats
perf:

Dumping SOL file
The file name is: ./soundData.sol
The size of the file is: 49
The name of the object is: soundData
volume: 1.01501e-319

Dumping SOL file
The file name is: ./hdTooltipClue2.sol
The size of the file is: 53
The name of the object is: hdTooltipClue2
count: 4.33197e-320

There's a little more info on SharedObjects on our web site:

We want to keep cookies alive when we requested to create a launcher.
This is because the launcher will reference the cookie file.

I don't think we implement that but libcurl also supports
reading cookies back in, which would allow us to send cookies
obtained by Gnash http requests back to the browser if the plugin
code takes care of doing that part.

In any case, the plugin should know if we want or not a launcher
(only way to it is an env variable, and is the plugin itself creating
the launcher) so you could cleanup the cookies if no launcher was
requested...

A safe way to put them in /tmp/ is still preferrable to me.
They are not really meant to survive a single instance of the
standalone player (except for the launcher case).

Dear maintainer,

Recently you fixed one or more security problems and as a result you closed
this bug. These problems were not serious enough for a Debian Security
Advisory, so they are now on my radar for fixing in the following suites
through point releases:

squeeze (6.0.6) - use target "stable"

Please prepare a minimal-changes upload targetting each of these suites,
and submit a debdiff to the Release Team [0] for consideration. They will
offer additional guidance or instruct you to upload your package.

I will happily assist you at any stage if the patch is straightforward and
you need help. Please keep me in CC at all times so I can
track [1] the progress of this request.

For details of this process and the rationale, please see the original
announcement [2] and my blog post [3].

False positive, your radar didn't detect DSA-2435 [[CVE-2011-4328](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4328)] has
been created for such issue and fixed through security updates first,
then shipped with 6.0.5.

Thanks, tracker updated. In fact the bug was already closed (this
triggers
the notification) but the BTS doesn't have correct version information.

Subject: CVE Request (minor) -- gnash -- Unsafe management of HTTP cookies

Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,

   a security flaw was found in the way Shockwave Flash plug-in of the
gnash, a GNU flash movie player, performed management of HTTP cookies
(they were stored under /tmp directory with predictable name and world-
readable permissions). A local attacker could use this flaw to obtain
sensitive information.

Could you allocate a CVE id for this?

Thank you && Regards, Jan.

Package        : gnash
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : local / local (remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2010-4337 CVE-2011-4328 CVE-2012-1175
Debian Bug     : 605419 649384 664023

Several vulnerabilities have been identified in Gnash, the GNU Flash
player.

CVE-2012-1175

  Tielei Wang from Georgia Tech Information Security Center discovered a
  vulnerability in GNU Gnash which is caused due to an integer overflow
  error and can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow by
  tricking a user into opening a specially crafted SWF file.

CVE-2011-4328

  Alexander Kurtz discovered an unsafe management of HTTP cookies. Cookie
  files are stored under /tmp and have predictable names, vulnerability
  that allows a local attacker to overwrite arbitrary files the users has
  write permissions for, and are also world-readable which may cause
  information leak.

CVE-2010-4337

  Jakub Wilk discovered an unsafe management of temporary files during the
  build process. Files are stored under /tmp and have predictable names,
  vulnerability that allows a local attacker to overwrite arbitrary files
  the users has write permissions for.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.8.8-5+squeeze1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.8.10-5.

We recommend that you upgrade your gnash packages.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
