Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-4287:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a failure to enforce the "force password change" setting for new users added via CSV upload.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Authentication bypass: New users added via CSV import are not forced to change their password upon first login, even when the "force password change" setting is enabled.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthorized access: Newly added users through CSV can potentially gain access to the system with default or known passwords, bypassing the intended security measure of forcing a password change on their first login.

**Attack Vectors:**
- CSV User Upload: The vulnerability is triggered by uploading new users via a CSV file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Administrative access to upload users through a CSV file.
- The attacker would need to know the default or assigned passwords in the CSV.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Moodle versions prior to 2.0.3.
- The Moodle security advisory (MSA-11-0012) categorizes this as a "minor" severity issue.
- The issue is tracked as MDL-26803 in the Moodle tracker.
- A workaround involves using bulk user actions to force a password change after uploading users via CSV. The solution is to upgrade to Moodle version 2.0.3 or higher.
