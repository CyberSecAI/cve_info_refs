Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2011-4604:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the `bat_socket_read` function within the Batman-adv (Better Approach To Mobile Ad-hoc Networking) module of the Linux kernel.  The function copies an ICMP packet from the kernel to a user-space buffer. It was discovered that the function would copy more bytes than requested by the user, potentially overwriting unrelated user-space memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow/Memory Corruption:** The `copy_to_user` function was used incorrectly, where the length of the data being copied from kernel to user-space was not properly validated against the requested buffer size `count`. This caused the kernel to write past the end of the user provided buffer, overwriting adjacent user space memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Memory Corruption:**  A malicious user or process could overwrite user-space memory. This could potentially lead to various impacts like denial of service, privilege escalation or arbitrary code execution, depending on what memory is overwritten.
*   **Unspecified Consequences:** The full extent of impact due to memory corruption is not detailed, but it could be a critical vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local User Access:** A local user with the ability to read from a specific Batman-adv socket could trigger this vulnerability via a specially crafted ICMP packet from the network.
*   **Network-based (Indirect):** An attacker could send an ICMP packet to a system running Batman-adv, that could then cause a malicious user on the system to trigger the vulnerability by reading from a specifically crafted socket.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** The attacker needs to be able to open and read from a specific batman-adv socket.
*   **Network Access (Indirect):** In order to exploit remotely, an attacker would need to be able to send a specially crafted ICMP packet to a vulnerable machine running batman-adv.
*   **Root or elevated privileges:**  The `read()` operation on the specified socket requires root or elevated privileges.
*   **Batman-adv Module:** The system must have the batman-adv kernel module loaded.

**Additional Details:**

*   The fix involved introducing `min(count, socket_packet->icmp_len)` to correctly limit the amount of data copied to the user buffer.
*   The vulnerability is present in the Linux kernel when using the batman-adv module.
*   Red Hat stated that their products weren't vulnerable because they did not ship the Batman module.
*   The issue was reported by Paul Kot and fixed by Sven Eckelmann and Marek Lindner.
