## Dell KACE K2000 Appliance contains multiple reflected cross-site scripting vulnerabilities

#### Vulnerability Note VU#193529

Original Release Date: 2011-11-08 | Last Revised: 2011-11-08

---

### Overview

The administrative web interface for the Dell KACE K2000 System Deployment Appliance contains multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.

### Description

| The Dell KACE K2000 Deployment Appliance is an integrated systems provisioning product for large-scale operating systems deployment. Several components that support the administrative web interface supplied with the system are vulnerable to reflected (i.e., *non-persistent*) script injection.  A malicious link supplied by the attacker (e.g., in email or another web page) can cause the vulnerable web server to reflect injected code back to the user's browser, where it is executed in the context of the affected site. The vulnerable components require the victim user to be authenticated to the affected system in order for the attacker's script to be executed. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker may be able to access the cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information of a user authenticated to the affected system. |
| --- |

### Solution

| We are currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem. |
