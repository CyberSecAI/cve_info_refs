  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in multiple components of the administrative web interface.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker can potentially access cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information of an authenticated user.",
  "Attack vectors": "A malicious link provided by the attacker, such as in an email or web page, can inject malicious code. The code is then reflected back to the user's browser when the user accesses the vulnerable component.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious link and entice a user who is already authenticated to the affected system to click it. The victim user must be authenticated to the affected system in order for the attacker's script to be executed."
