FFmpeg has always been a very experimental and developer-driven project. It
is a key component in many multimedia projects and has new features added
constantly.
Development branch snapshots work really well 99% of the
time so people are not afraid to use them.

[Git Repositories](#repositories)

#### Git Repositories

Since FFmpeg is developed with [Git](https://git-scm.com/),
multiple repositories from developers and groups of developers are available.

| Clone URL | Description |

| <https://git.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-web> | Main ffmpeg.org website repository |
| <https://git.ffmpeg.org/fateserver> | [fate.ffmpeg.org](http://fate.ffmpeg.org) server software repository |
| Mirrors | |

#### Release Verification

All FFmpeg releases are cryptographically signed with
[our public PGP key](ffmpeg-devel.asc) and should be verified for
authenticity.

```
pub   rsa2048 2011-04-26 [SC]
    FCF986EA15E6E293A5644F10B4322F04D67658D8
uid           [  full  ] FFmpeg release signing key <ffmpeg-devel@ffmpeg.org>
sub   rsa2048 2011-04-26 [E]
```

To verify a release:

1. Import our public key into your local keyring:
   ```
   $ curl https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-devel.asc | gpg --import
   ```
2. Download a release tarball and its corresponding signature.
3. Verify the signature:
   ```
   $ gpg --verify ffmpeg-4.3.2.tar.xz.asc ffmpeg-4.3.2.tar.xz
   gpg: Signature made Sun 21 Feb 2021 06:35:15 AEST
   gpg:                using RSA key FCF986EA15E6E293A5644F10B4322F04D67658D8
   gpg:                issuer "ffmpeg-devel@ffmpeg.org"
   gpg: Good signature from "FFmpeg release signing key <ffmpeg-devel@ffmpeg.org>" [full]
   ```

Optionally, you can verify that git and tarball match, the only differences should be the absence of .git\* files in the tarball and a VERSION file in the tarball containing the version.
The git tags should be signed with [EDDSA key DD1EC9E8DE085C629B3E1846B18E8928B3948D64](git-tag-key.asc)

#### Releases

Approximately every 6 months the FFmpeg project makes a new major release.
Between major releases point releases
will appear that add important bug fixes but no new features.
Note that these releases are intended for distributors and system integrators.
Users that wish to compile from source themselves are strongly encouraged to
consider using the development branch (see above), this is the only version on
which FFmpeg developers actively work. The release branches only cherry pick
selected changes from the development branch, which therefore receives much more
and much faster bug fixes such as additional features and security patches.

## Vulnerability in FFmpeg Could Allow Remote Code Execution

Published: October 18, 2011

**Version:** 1.0

### Overview

#### Executive Summary

Microsoft is providing notification of the discovery and remediation of a vulnerability affecting FFmpeg version 0.8.0 and earlier. Microsoft discovered and disclosed the vulnerability under coordinated vulnerability disclosure to the affected vendor, FFmpeg. FFmpeg has remediated the vulnerability in their software.

A vulnerability exists in the way that FFmpeg handles ASF packets, causing an integer overflow allowing for remote code execution. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

Microsoft Vulnerability Research reported this issue to and coordinated with FFmpeg to ensure remediation of this issue. The vulnerability has been assigned the entry, CVE-2011-4031, in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list. For more information, including information about updates from FFmpeg, see the [FFmpeg download page.](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html)

#### Mitigating Factors

* The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful, a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message.
* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a specially crafted file that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attackerâs Web site, and then convince them to open the specially crafted file.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

### Advisory Details

#### Purpose and Recommendation

**Purpose of Advisory:** To notify users of a vulnerability and its remediation.

**Advisory Status:** Advisory published.

**Recommendation:** Review the **Suggested Actions** section and configure as appropriate.

#### Issue References

For more information about this issue, see the following references:

| Reference | Identification |
| --- | --- |
| **Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures** | [CVE-2011-4031](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2011-4031) |

#### Affected and Non-Affected Software

This advisory discusses the following software:

| Affected Software |
| --- |
| FFmpeg 0.8.0 |
| **Non-Affected Software** |
| FFmpeg 0.8.3 |

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What is the scope of this advisory?**

This advisory is part of a coordinated release with affected vendors to inform customers of a security issue that may affect their systems.

**Is this a security vulnerability that requires Microsoft to issue a security update?**

No. This vulnerability has been fixed via an update from the affected third-party vendors. The update remediates the software listed in the table, **Affected Software**.

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability exists in the way that FFmpeg handles specially crafted ASF packets.

**What might an attacker use this vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as a logged-on user. If the user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by tricking a user into opening a specially crafted file with an affected version of FFmpeg. Typically these specially crafted files are delivered via social engineering techniques in e-mail, instant messaging, or via download links on Web sites. This vulnerability cannot be exploited without user interaction.

## Suggested Actions

Download and use FFmpeg version 0.8.5 from [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html).
