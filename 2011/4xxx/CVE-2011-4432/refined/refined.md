```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Centreon monitoring tool allows remote code execution through the command help web page. Additionally, user passwords are stored as one-way hashes (MD5 or SHA1) without a salt.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Remote Command Execution",
    "One-Way Hash Without a Salt"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server in the context of the web server user. The combination of remote code execution and unsalted hashes allows the attacker to recover user passwords using techniques like rainbow tables.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker sends a crafted HTTP request to the 'command help' page to execute OS commands. The remote code execution is combined with a password hash extraction attack using a server-side PHP script.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs access to a Centreon account with privileges to the Configuration > Nagios > Checks section. No prior access is required if the attacker can exploit the vulnerability to create new accounts."
