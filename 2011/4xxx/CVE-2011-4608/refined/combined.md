| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=767020#c0)  David Jorm    2011-12-13 01:24:21 UTC  ``` It was found that mod_cluster allowed worker nodes to register on any vhost, regardless of the security constraints applied to other vhosts. In a typical environment there will be one vhost configured internally for worker nodes, and another configured externally for serving content. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw by registering a worker node via an external vhost that is not configured to apply security constraints, then use this worker node to serve malicious content, intercept credentials and hijack user sessions.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=767020#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-01-18 19:25:09 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    JBoss Enterprise Web Platform 5.1.2  Via RHSA-2012:0040 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0040.html>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=767020#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-01-18 19:25:13 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    JBEWP 5 for RHEL 4   JBEWP 5 for RHEL 5   JBEWP 5 for RHEL 6  Via RHSA-2012:0039 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0039.html>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=767020#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-01-18 19:25:17 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.1.2  Via RHSA-2012:0038 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0038.html>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=767020#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-01-18 19:25:21 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    JBEAP 5 for RHEL 4   JBEAP 5 for RHEL 5   JBEAP 5 for RHEL 6  Via RHSA-2012:0037 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0037.html>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=767020#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-01-18 19:25:24 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    JBoss Enterprise Web Server 1.0.2  Via RHSA-2012:0036 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0036.html>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=767020#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-01-18 19:25:30 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    JBEWS 1.0 for RHEL 4   JBEWS 1.0 for RHEL 5   JBEWS 1.0 for RHEL 6  Via RHSA-2012:0035 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0035.html>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=767020#c11)  JBoss JIRA Server    2012-01-25 14:51:06 UTC  ``` Michal Babacek <mbabacek> made a comment on jira [JBPAPP-7708](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBPAPP-7708)  I am going to verify and close as soon as the patch is commited to Mod_cluster 1.2.0.Beta4 source.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=767020#c12)  JBoss JIRA Server    2012-02-27 14:40:05 UTC  ``` Michal Babacek <mbabacek> updated the status of jira [JBPAPP-7708](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBPAPP-7708) to Resolved   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=767020#c13)  JBoss JIRA Server    2012-02-27 14:40:05 UTC  ``` Michal Babacek <mbabacek> made a comment on jira [JBPAPP-7708](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBPAPP-7708)  [~jfclere] has fixed it.

> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.
