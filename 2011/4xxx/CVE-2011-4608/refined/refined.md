{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "Root cause": "mod_cluster allowed worker nodes to register on any vhost, regardless of the security constraints applied to other vhosts.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insecure vhost registration process."
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker could register a malicious worker node via an external vhost that is not configured to apply security constraints, then use this worker node to serve malicious content, intercept credentials and hijack user sessions.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Registering a worker node via an external vhost."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to register a worker node and network access to the vulnerable server."
