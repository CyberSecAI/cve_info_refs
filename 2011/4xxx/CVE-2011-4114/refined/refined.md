Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2011-4114:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `par_mktmpdir()` function in `PAR::Packer` creates temporary directories under `/tmp/par-[username]` insecurely.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1.  **Insecure Directory Creation:** `PAR::Packer` does not verify if the user owns the created directory, nor does it set secure permissions on the directory.
2.  **Predictable Directory Location:** The temporary directories are created in a predictable location `/tmp/par-[username]`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A local attacker could potentially:
1.  **Modify the Cache Directory:** Make changes to the temporary cache directory used by `PAR::Packer`.
2.  **Alter PAR-Packaged Programs:**  Modify the contents of the cache directory, which could lead to the attacker altering how PAR-packaged programs function.

**Attack Vectors:**
Local access is required. An attacker needs to be able to interact with the system to exploit the insecure directory creation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
1.  **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system.
2.  **Ability to Create Files/Directories:** The attacker needs privileges to create files and directories within the `/tmp` directory, potentially impersonating the user which executes the PAR::Packer application.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability was also found in the `PAR` module which is related but different code from `PAR::Packer`. The fix for `PAR` was also to use per-user temporary directories, and verify ownership, permissions, and ensure it's not a symlink.
*   Upstream fixes in PAR 1.003 and PAR-Packer 1.011 address the vulnerability by creating the parent directory of the cache directory (i.e. /tmp/par-USER) with mode 0700 and also checking that if the directory already exists it is owned by the user, has mode 0700 and it is not a symbolic link.
*   The bug report in Red Hat bugzilla refers to both CVE-2011-4114 (specific to PAR::Packer) and CVE-2011-5060 (assigned to PAR).
