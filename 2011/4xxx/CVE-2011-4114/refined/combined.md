| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=753955#c0)  Vincent Danen    2011-11-14 22:54:07 UTC  ``` It was reported [1] that PAR::Packer's par_mktmpdir() function would create /tmp/par-[username] directories insecurely, which could allow a local attacker to make changes to the cache directory and possibly the PAR-packged program.  PAR::Packer does not verify that the user owns the directory, nor does it create it with secure permissions.  Upstream's response is to use per-user temporary directories, so there is currently no upstream patch.  [1] <https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=69560>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=753955#c1)  Vincent Danen    2011-11-14 22:55:44 UTC  ``` Created perl-PAR-Packer tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 753957](show_bug.cgi?id=753957 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2011-4114 perl-PAR-Packer: insecure temporary directory handling [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=753955#c2)  Petr Pisar    2011-12-01 14:18:18 UTC  ``` `PAR' (<<http://search.cpan.org/~rschupp/PAR/>>, packaged as perl-PAR in Fedora) author recognized this vulnerability in PAR too (this is related but different piece of code from PAR::Packer) and fixed it in version 1.003:  [Changes for 1.003 - Nov 28, 2011]   -  RT #69560/CVE-2011-4114: PAR packed files are extracted to unsafe      and predictable temporary directories      (Note: this bug was originally reported against PAR::Packer, but      it applies to PAR as well)      - create parent of cache directory (i.e. /tmp/par-USER) with mode 0700      - if it already exists, make sure that (and bail out if not)        - it's not a symlink        - it's mode 0700        - it's owned by USER  Fixed perl-PAR version is available in F17 only at this moment.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=753955#c3)  Petr Pisar    2011-12-01 14:52:57 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 539232](attachment.cgi?id=539232&action=diff "Fix for perl-PAR") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=539232&action=edit "Fix for perl-PAR") Fix for perl-PAR  This is fix for this issue extracted from PAR upstream development tree (as can be seen in PAR-1.004).   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=753955#c4)  Petr Pisar    2011-12-02 14:48:55 UTC  ``` Upstream has released PAR-Packer-1.011 with respect to this vulnerability. It states in change log this version fixes this issue:  [Changes for 1.011 - Dec 1, 2011] * Bug fixes, etc.    -  RT #69560/CVE-2011-4114: PAR packed files are extracted to unsafe      and predictable temporary directories      - create parent of cache directory (i.e. /tmp/par-USER) with mode 0700      - if it already exists, make sure that (and bail out if not)        - it's not a symlink        - it's mode 0700        - it's owned by USER    - depend on PAR 1.004 (which contains the other half of the     fix for [CVE-2011-4114](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-4114))  and that complete fix requires PAR-1.004 (advertised here in commet #2).  As you can see upstream does not check path components. Is this fix sufficient? In my opinion, it is. I think any code needs a safe entry point and assumptions parent directory is safe is one of this.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=753955#c6)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-12-05 13:59:21 UTC  ``` Created perl-PAR tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 760132](show_bug.cgi?id=760132 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2011-5060 perl-PAR: insecure temporary directory handling [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=753955#c8)  Petr Pisar    2011-12-06 14:05:44 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 541406](attachment.cgi?id=541406&action=diff "Fix for perl-PAR-Packer ported to 1.010 version") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=541406&action=edit "Fix for perl-PAR-Packer ported to 1.010 version") Fix for perl-PAR-Packer ported to 1.010 version   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=753955#c9)  Petr Pisar    2011-12-06 14:23:39 UTC  ``` How to test:  Create /tmp/par-$(USER) directory with 0777 mode (or owned by different user, or create an other user's symlink). Create a PAR archive from a perl script (pp --par SCRIPT).  Test perl-PAR by running `perl -MPAR=./a.par SCRIPT'. Test perl-PAR-Packer by running `parl ./a.par'.  For unknown reason, you might need perl-PAR-Packer to get running SCRIPT from ./a.par by -MPAR=.  For unknown reason, old parl might not work because of perl version mismatch. (This becomes fixed after rebuilding old perl-PAR-Packer against current perl.)   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=753955#c10)  Fedora Update System    2011-12-21 16:56:51 UTC  ``` perl-PAR-1.002-4.fc15, perl-PAR-Packer-1.008-4.fc15 has been pushed to the Fedora 15 stable repository.
