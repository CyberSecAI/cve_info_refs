Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A PHP file within the TYPO3 workspaces system extension fails to properly validate passed arguments.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The lack of input validation allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary PHP code.
- **Unvalidated Input:** The core issue is the failure to sanitize or validate arguments passed to a specific PHP file within the workspaces extension.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code on the vulnerable TYPO3 server. This can lead to:
   - Complete compromise of the web server and the application
   - Data theft, modification, or destruction
   - Installation of backdoors or malware
   - Further attacks against other systems on the network.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted HTTP Request:** An attacker crafts a malicious HTTP request to a vulnerable TYPO3 installation. This request includes the malicious PHP code or a reference to external location containing it

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the targeted TYPO3 server.
- **Specific PHP Configuration:** The vulnerability is exploitable if the following PHP settings are enabled on the server:
    - `register_globals`: This setting needs to be "on" (though it's off by default)
    - `allow_url_include`:  This setting needs to be "on" (though it's off by default).
    - `allow_url_fopen`: This setting needs to be "on" (on by default).
- **Suhosin Configuration (Conditional):** If the Suhosin PHP extension is installed, the attacker also needs URL schemes to be present in the `suhosin.executor.include.whitelist` configuration variable.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is located in the workspaces extension.
- The workspaces extension does not need to be enabled for the vulnerability to be present.
- The vulnerability was actively being exploited in the wild at the time of its discovery.

**Affected Versions:**
- TYPO3 versions 4.5.0 up to 4.5.8, 4.6.0 and 4.6.1
- Development releases of the 4.7 branch are also affected.

**Mitigation:**
- Update to TYPO3 versions 4.5.9 or 4.6.2.
- Disable at least one of the following PHP options: `register_globals`, `allow_url_include` or `allow_url_fopen`.
- Apply the provided patch
- Implement a `mod_security` rule to block requests with `BACK_PATH` arguments containing URLs.
