  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE": "CVE-2011-4120",
    "description": "Yubico PAM Module before 2.10 performed user authentication when 'use_first_pass' PAM configuration option was not used and the module was configured as 'sufficient' in the PAM configuration. A remote attacker could use this flaw to circumvent common authentication process and obtain access to the account in question by providing a NULL value (pressing Ctrl-D keyboard sequence) as the password string.",
    "root_cause": "The Yubico PAM module incorrectly handled NULL password inputs when the 'use_first_pass' option was not used and the module was set to 'sufficient'.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of NULL input",
      "Insufficient validation of user input"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to a user account.",
    "attack_vector": "The vulnerability can be triggered during the authentication process by supplying a NULL input.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to interact with the login prompt and supply the NULL value (Ctrl-D)."
