  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2011-4029",
    "description": "A time-of-check, time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition was found in the way X.Org X11 X server performed management of temporary lock files. After opening the temporary lock file for writing, the X.Org X11 X server did not recheck if the originally opened file still refers to the same file on disc prior relaxing permissions on the file. A local attacker could use this flaw to conduct symlink attacks (involving the X.Org X11 X server temporary lock file instance) and set the read permissions for all users on any file or directory, leading to disclosure of sensitive information.",
    "affected_component": "xorg-x11-server",
    "root_cause": "TOCTOU race condition in the management of temporary lock files. The X server does not recheck if the opened lock file is still the same file before changing its permissions.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) vulnerability",
      "Insecure file handling"
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker can conduct symlink attacks, setting read permissions for all users on arbitrary files/directories, leading to sensitive information disclosure.",
    "attack_vector": "Local access",
     "required_capabilities": "Local attacker needs to be able to run the X.Org X11 X server."
