- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The CA Siteminder software fails to sanitize POST requests sent to the `login.fcc` form. Specifically, the `postpreservationdata` parameter is vulnerable.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflective Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed each time the affected webpage is accessed. This could result in information leakage, privilege escalation, and/or denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is a crafted HTTP POST request to the `login.fcc` form including malicious JavaScript in the `postpreservationdata` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have access to the CA Siteminder application.
