Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2011-4289:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Moodle handles user email display settings. Specifically, email addresses were being displayed on a user's full profile page even when the user had configured their settings to only display their email address to course members. This means users' emails could be seen by individuals who should not have had access to them according to the user's preferences.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Information disclosure vulnerability. The system failed to properly enforce the configured privacy settings for email visibility, leading to the exposure of user email addresses to unauthorized users.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- Unauthorized disclosure of personal information, specifically user email addresses. This could potentially lead to privacy breaches, phishing attacks, or other forms of malicious activity targeting the exposed email addresses.

**Attack vectors:**
- Attackers could potentially access a user's full profile page on Moodle and view the email addresses of users who had configured their email to only be visible to course members. This is not an attack vector that requires a user to do anything other than view the profile page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to access user profile pages in Moodle which requires a basic authenticated user account, the attacker does not need a higher level of privilege. The attacker does not need to be a member of the same course as the victim.

**Additional Information**

-   The vulnerability affects Moodle versions prior to 2.0.3.
-   Moodle versions 1.9.x were not affected by this issue
-   The severity of the issue was classified as "Major."
-   The vulnerability is identified in Moodle's issue tracker as MDL-26621.
-   The recommended solution is to upgrade to Moodle version 2.0.3 or later
-   A workaround for users is to disable email display in their profiles.
