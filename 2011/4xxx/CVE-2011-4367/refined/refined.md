    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Path Traversal",
      "Information Disclosure"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server that they should not have access to, potentially exposing sensitive information like configuration files or source code.",
    "attack_vectors": "By crafting a malicious HTTP request, an attacker can include relative paths (e.g., '..') in the 'ln' parameter or the resource name of the javax.faces.resource URL.",
