How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Description

### Usage

1. Open `wp-content/themes/<YOUR THEME NAME>/index.php`
2. You may place it in archive.php, single.php, post.php or page.php also.
3. Find: `<?php while (have_posts()) : the_post(); ?>`
4. Add Anywhere Below It (The Place You Want The Ratings To Show): `<?php if(function_exists('the_ratings')) { the_ratings(); } ?>`

* If you DO NOT want the ratings to appear in every post/page, DO NOT use the code above. Just type in `[ratings]` into the selected post/page content and it will embed ratings into that post/page only.
* If you want to embed other post ratings use `[ratings id="1"]`, where 1 is the ID of the post/page ratings that you want to display.
* If you want to embed other post ratings results, use `[ratings id="1" results="true"]`, where 1 is the ID of the post/page ratings results that you want to display.

### [No Support!](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/no-support-615/)

Seems that Lester Chan is not supporting this plugin. I am currently unable to update the plugin in WordPress without issues. He is not responsive. The plugin was also supposed to report the ratings to Google which is does not. Why does WP allow abandoned plugins to remain on their site? If the plugins are not supported by the developers they should be removed.

Very great plugin, so far it works very well and meets expectations. The only thing I have a problem with is getting comfortable with adding custom icons, preferably as a path to the icon directory in the site theme instead of in the plugin.
