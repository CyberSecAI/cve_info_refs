{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The GNU Debugger (GDB) would load untrusted files (GDB scripts, Python scripts, and thread debugging library) from the current working directory when .debug_gdb_scripts was defined.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Unsafe default behavior"
    ],
    "impact": "Execution of arbitrary code with the user's privileges when GDB was run in a directory with untrusted content.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Malicious object files with a crafted .debug_gdb_scripts section.",
      "Running GDB in a directory containing malicious GDB or Python scripts"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious object file or place malicious scripts in a directory where the victim uses GDB."
  },
  "additional_details": {
        "description": "The vulnerability is due to GDB's auto-loading feature. GDB would attempt to load files from the current directory. This behavior was considered insecure and could lead to arbitrary code execution if a user debugged a program in an untrusted directory.",
        "affected_versions": "gdb versions prior to the fix (gdb-7.2-60.el6)",
        "fixed_versions": "gdb-7.2-60.el6 and later",
        "mitigation": "GDB was modified to no longer auto-load files from the current directory by default, only trusted system directories. A safe-path was introduced which can be viewed and modified via GDB commands."
