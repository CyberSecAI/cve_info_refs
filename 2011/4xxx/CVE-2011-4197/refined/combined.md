How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Leaders in Cyber Security

[HIRE US](#contact-us)

## Welcome to MATTA.

Since we set up in 2001, our objective has been clear - to provide the very best cyber security consultancy for our clients, enabling them to operate more efficiently and safely; to help them grow and prosper.

We do this by being recognised for thought leadership, and delivering on that promise - with the highest quality information security services and solutions - and thereby being seen and respected as a trusted advisor.

And we are proud that, according to our clients and other partners, the following attributes apply to our company, our talented staff, and our brandâ¦ we always aspire to be:

*Agile | Approachable | Responsive | Innovative | Responsible*

## SERVICES

[![image](img2/deepphishing.png)
### safepass.me](https://safepass.me)

safepass.me was created specifically to address the new password guidelines from NIST and NCSC that recommend checking user passwords against public database breaches. safepass.me does this in the most efficient way, using a probabilistic data structure and AI to minimise the query time and the size of the overall memory footprint on the system. We check for over 501 million passwords in a fraction of a second.

The *Human Element* is always the weakest link in an organisationâs chain of safety. With safepass.me we help you both achieve and exceed your security goals AND say goodbye to frustrating and complex password policies.

Deploying safepass.me will help your security team to sleep at night, reduce the frustration of your users and lower the number of helpdesk tickets related to password resets.

Once you install safepass.me you can say goodbye to compromised passwords !

![image](img2/vulnerability+assessment.png)
### VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT

**Cost-effective Security Assessments Managed by our senior security consultants.**

External Vulnerability Scanning is a crucial part of every security programme. However, budgets do not always allow for the cost of an extensive consultancy-based Penetration Test.

Cost-effective automated scanners go some way to resolving this issue, but the limitations of automated systems are well-documented and understood. The reports produced contain multiple false positives, and it becomes the responsibility of the client to work through the issues to determine the real issues from the false ones. On a typical external network of 64 IP addresses, this can take between one and three full-time days for someone will the skills and up-to-date knowledge to perform.

![image](img2/penetration+testing.png)
### Penetration TESTING

Which Penetration Test is Right for You? Penetration Testing can include so many different elements, that the first challenge is first deciding what tests should be commissioned.

Matta has advisors, which can help you scope the requirements based on your objectives, budget and timescale. In a perfect world all the requirements can be met with the existing budget you had in mind. If this is not possible, however, we can suggest ways to gain the most benefit, and prioritise activities.

External Penetration Test Conducting a penetration test on the public facing network is something most companies should consider doing at least annually. Apart from the obvious reasons of good compliance, it is important to supplement any VA work you may be doing with a full consultant based Penetration Test to ensure that your network is truly as robust as you think it may be from an attacker.

![image](img2/emergency+response.png)
### Emergency response

**A security breach can have cause a hugely detrimental impact on your company, including reputation damage, loss of business, and unplanned downtime.**

Mattaâs incident response service comprises of a multi-disciplined and experienced incident response team that use their experience, so that you can get your business back up and running as quickly as possible.

Getting early notification of an incident helps Matta in working with you to determine an appropriate response.

Matta can help you determine the steps you need to take to preserve any audit trail and, if required, preserve and prepare the environment for evidences to be admissible in court.

If you are currently experiencing a security incident, you can call +44 (0) 20 3051 3420, then dial extension â8â.

pfSense x509 Insecure Certificate Creation
Advisory ID: MATTA-2011-001
CVE reference: CVE-2011-4197
Affected platforms: pfSense
Version: 2.0
Date: 2011-October-09
Security risk: High
Vulnerability: x509 Insecure Certificate Creation
Researcher: Florent Daigniere
Vendor Status: Notified / Patch available
Vulnerability Disclosure Policy:
https://www.trustmatta.com/advisories/matta-disclosure-policy-01.txt
Permanent URL:
https://www.trustmatta.com/advisories/MATTA-2011-001.txt
=====================================================================
Description:
Certificates issued by the builtin PKI mechanism of pfSense prior
to version 2.0.1 set the basic constraint CA:true to all
certificates issued.
=====================================================================
Impact
Any user in possession of a certificate issued by the builtin PKI can
issue sub-certificates with arbitrary CNs, bypassing potential access
controls. Specifics depend on what the certificates are being
used for.
=====================================================================
Versions affected:
Firmware version 2.0 tested.
=====================================================================
Threat mitigation
Revoke existing certificates and re-issue them without the basic
constraint set.
To verify the purpose of your certificates, you can use the
following command:
$openssl x509 -in test.crt -noout -purpose|grep CA
SSL client CA : Yes
SSL server CA : Yes
Netscape SSL server CA : Yes
S/MIME signing CA : Yes
S/MIME encryption CA : Yes
CRL signing CA : Yes
Any Purpose CA : Yes
OCSP helper CA : Yes
Time Stamp signing CA : Yes
