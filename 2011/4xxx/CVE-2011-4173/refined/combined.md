How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

"Critical security issues have been identified and fixed with this
patch, therefore it is highly recommended to make sure you update your
forums immediately."

That probably qualifies as "unknown security issue in simple machines
forum" ;-)

Indeed. If someone has more details, please speak up. We can assign more

Yeah, I already upgraded when I went into my admin cp earlier and found that [1.1.15](http://www.simplemachines.org/community/../) was ready with a one click upgrade so I upgraded both of my forums in seconds! Great work guys and gals. ![;D](https://smf-smileys.simplemachinesweb.com/default/grin.gif "Grin")

I'll second this.  Would like to see the changelog for 1.1.15.

That and what changes are made to the files and if any changes are made to the "theme" files so I can see if I need to do any manual changes for the custom themes that are run at a forum I admin.

How long does it take to get the notification in your admin control panel. I was editing my private board when I saw it and it installed just like a mod which is amaaaazzing compared to upgrades I have done before. For some reason my public forum does not have this notification thing yet. And the downloads section does not have the mod type upgrade with individual edits.

live627, tragidy,

There was a problem with the 2.0.1 patch that I fixed, and updated it just about half an hour ago. It should all work normally now.

I don't know where did the changelog disappear. ![:)](https://smf-smileys.simplemachinesweb.com/default/smiley.gif "Smiley") Will look into it.

To-do lists are for deferral. The more things you write down the later they're done... until you have 100s of lists of things you don't do.

Thanks for this! But one quick question. This Update info is showing up in the Admin center at just one of my two forums. Any reason it's not showing up in the other forum?

Is there some setting that's not right?

ForumGuy,
You may need to run the scheduled task to fetch Simple Machines files. Probably on the other forums, it didn't get to run yet (by default it's set at once per 24 hours if I remember correctly.)

To-do lists are for deferral. The more things you write down the later they're done... until you have 100s of lists of things you don't do.
