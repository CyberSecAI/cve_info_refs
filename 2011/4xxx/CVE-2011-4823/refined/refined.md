Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2011-4823:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization within the Vik Real Estate component for Joomla, leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Blind SQL Injection:** The component is vulnerable to both boolean-based time-based blind SQL injection and standard blind SQL injection.
*   The specific parameters affected are `contract` and `imm`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation of these SQL injection flaws could allow an attacker to:
    *   Extract sensitive data from the database.
    *   Modify data within the database.
    *   Potentially gain further access to the system, depending on database privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vectors are through HTTP GET requests to the Joomla site, specifically targeting the `com_vikrealestate` component.
*   The vulnerable parameters are `contract` when the `act=results` and `imm` when `act=show`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Joomla site where the vulnerable Vik Real Estate component is installed.
*   No authentication is explicitly mentioned as required, suggesting the attack is possible for unauthenticated users.
*   The attacker needs knowledge of SQL injection techniques to exploit this vulnerability, specifically blind injection.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit-db entry provides specific examples of how to exploit the `contract` and `imm` parameters using `1' AND 1=1 AND '666'='666`. These are boolean-based tests to determine if the application is vulnerable to SQLi.
*   The Joomla Vulnerable Extensions List also confirms the presence of "Vik Real Estate 1.0 Multiple Blind SqlI" on the list, it references the same 2011-10-29 date.
