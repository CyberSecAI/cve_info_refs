Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2011-4361:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the way MediaWiki handles `action=ajax` requests. These requests were being dispatched to the relevant internal functions without performing any checks on read permissions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Access Control:** The primary weakness is the absence of read permission checks before dispatching `action=ajax` requests. This allows unauthorized access to data intended for private wikis.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Leakage:** Exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information on private wikis. This information could include page titles, file existence, or even full page content, depending on the specific `action=ajax` request.
*   **Enumeration:** Attackers can potentially enumerate page titles on private wikis.
*   **Dictionary Attack:** In the core of MediaWiki, the `SpecialUpload::ajaxGetExistsWarning` endpoint allows confirmation of the existence of a given file upload. This could be leveraged for a dictionary attack, leading to further data leakage.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct `action=ajax` Requests:** Attackers can directly send `action=ajax` requests to the vulnerable MediaWiki instance.
*   **Exploitation of Vulnerable Extensions:** Some extensions using `action=ajax` may also expose sensitive information if vulnerable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** Attackers need to have network access to the MediaWiki instance.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users, as read permission checks are missing before dispatching the request to the relevant function.
*   **Knowledge of `action=ajax` Parameters:** Attackers need to know the specific `action=ajax` parameters to send to obtain sensitive information.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The issue was found by Tim Starling.
*   Many extensions utilizing `action=ajax` may also be vulnerable.
*   The `CategoryTree`, `ExtTab`, and `InlineEditor` extensions are mentioned as examples of extensions that could be used to disclose sensitive information.
*   The fix involves denying all access to `action=ajax` for users without read permissions.
*   The vulnerability was addressed in MediaWiki version 1.17.1.
