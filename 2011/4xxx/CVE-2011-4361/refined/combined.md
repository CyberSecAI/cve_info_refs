Subject: CVE request: mediawiki before 1.17.1

<http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/mediawiki-announce/2011-November/000104.html>

From announce mail:

-------------
I would like to announce the release of MediaWiki 1.17.1. Two security
issues were discovered.

Alexandre Emsenhuber discovered an issue where page titles on private
wikis could be exposed bypassing different page ids to index.php. In the
case of the user not having correct permissions, they will now be
redirected to Special:BadTitle.

For more details, see
<https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=32276>

The second issue was found by Tim Starling, who discovered that
action=ajax requests were dispatched to the relevant function without
any read permission checks being done. This could have led to data
leakage on private wikis.

For more details, see
<https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=32616>

------------------------

Please assign two CVEs.

Debian Bug     : 650434

Several problems have been discovered in mediawiki, a website engine for
collaborative work.

CVE-2011-1578 CVE-2011-1587

   Masato Kinugawa discovered a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue, which
   affects Internet Explorer clients only, and only version 6 and
   earlier. Web server configuration changes are required to fix this
   issue. Upgrading MediaWiki will only be sufficient for people who use
   Apache with AllowOverride enabled.

   For details of the required configuration changes, see the upstream
   announcements:
  <http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/mediawiki-announce/2011-April/000096.html>
  <http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/mediawiki-announce/2011-April/000097.html>

CVE-2011-1579

   Wikipedia user Suffusion of Yellow discovered a CSS validation error
   in the wikitext parser. This is an XSS issue for Internet Explorer
   clients, and a privacy loss issue for other clients since it allows
   the embedding of arbitrary remote images.

CVE-2011-1580

   MediaWiki developer Happy-Melon discovered that the transwiki import
   feature neglected to perform access control checks on form submission.
   The transwiki import feature is disabled by default. If it is enabled,
   it allows wiki pages to be copied from a remote wiki listed in
   $wgImportSources. The issue means that any user can trigger such an
   import to occur.

CVE-2011-4360

   Alexandre Emsenhuber discovered an issue where page titles on private
   wikis could be exposed bypassing different page ids to index.php. In the
   case of the user not having correct permissions, they will now be redirected
   to Special:BadTitle.

CVE-2011-4361

   Tim Starling discovered that action=ajax requests were dispatched to the
   relevant function without any read permission checks being done. This could
   have led to data leakage on private wikis.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:1.12.0-2lenny9.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:1.15.5-2squeeze2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:1.15.5-5.

We recommend that you upgrade your mediawiki packages.

# Description

action=ajax requests are dispatched to the relevant function without any read permission checks being done. This can lead to data leakage on private wikis.

A quick survey of the many extensions which use action=ajax suggests that few, if any, have anticipated this security issue. This includes the popular CategoryTree extension, which can be used to obtain lists of page titles. The ExtTab and InlineEditor extensions appear to allow disclosure of the full text of the page.

In the core, most former action=ajax uses have been migrated to api.php, however SpecialUpload::ajaxGetExistsWarning still remains, which allows confirmation of the existence of a given file upload, given the name. A dictionary attack could lead to significant data leakage. Previous versions of MediaWiki may have more severe vulnerabilities.

I suggest denying all access to action=ajax for users without read permissions. If there are any extensions that really need to provide data from a private wiki to logged-out users, api.php can be used instead. It provides an opt-in model for bypassing read permissions.

Is the "!in\_array( 'read', User::getGroupPermissions( array( '\*' ) )" a necessary logical component or an optimization to skip over the User::isAllowed() call in the common case of non-restricted sites?

Might want to indicate if it's a shortcut in a comment so it doesn't get removed by some clever refactorer later. :)

The code was copied from ApiMain. It was introduced there in r62544 based on code from ApiOpenSearch r62540. It was described as an optimisation in the commit message on r62540.

The patch has been reviewed and sent to Sam Reed to prepare the new release.

I think we agreed to release the new version on monday or tuesday because of thanksgiving in the US.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.
