Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-4587:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability arises from a flaw in Moodle's password policy configuration. When password policy length values (such as the required length of the password, digits, lowercase letters, etc.) are set to zero, it allows users to enter an empty password.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Insecure Password Policy Configuration:** The core issue is that the system permits password policies with zero-length requirements.
-   **Password Reset Failure:** Once an empty password is set, users cannot change it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Password Loss:** If an administrator sets the password policy to allow zero-length, users can end up with empty passwords which they can't change, effectively locking them out of their accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Configuration Error:** An administrator misconfigures the password policy by setting length parameters to zero. This is not an exploit per-se, but rather an insecure setting that leads to the vulnerability.
-   **User Action:** A user performs a password reset and is allowed to enter an empty password due to the misconfiguration.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Administrator Access:** To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker needs to be an administrator who can set the password policy.
-   **User Interaction:** A user needs to perform a password reset.

**Summary:**

CVE-2011-4587 in Moodle allows users to set blank passwords when the password policy is misconfigured to have zero-length requirements. This is not a direct exploit, but rather a misconfiguration that enables the vulnerability.
