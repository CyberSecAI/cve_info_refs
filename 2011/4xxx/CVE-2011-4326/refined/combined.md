* [WIND00319165](https://support.windriver.com/olsPortal/faces/maintenance/defectDetails.jspx?defectId=WIND00319165)
* [WIND00319166](https://support.windriver.com/olsPortal/faces/maintenance/defectDetails.jspx?defectId=WIND00319166)

## 2. Avaya System Products using Wind River Linux with affected components/packages installed: | Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | Avaya 96x1 IP Deskphones | 6.0.x thru 6.6.0 | Low | For SIP, upgrade to 7.0 or later. For H.323 and B189, upgrade to 6.6.1 or later. |

**Recommended Actions for System Products:**
Avaya strongly recommends that customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place, risk to Avaya
products and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as an Avaya provided
product update or the recommended Avaya action is applied.
Further restrictions as deemed necessary based on the
customer's security policies may be required during this
interim period, but customers should not modify the System Product
operating system or application unless the change is approved by Avaya.
Making changes that are not approved may void the Avaya product service contract.

### Mitigating Factors:

When determining risk, Avaya takes into account many factors as
outlined by Avaya's
[Security Vulnerability Classification Policy](https://support.avaya.com/css/P8/documents/100066674).
The following table describes factors that mitigate the risk of specific
vulnerabilities for affected Avaya products:

| Vulnerability | Mitigating Factors |
| --- | --- |
| CVE-2011-4112 | This is rated a Low as the affected kenel is installed but does not use the affected device drivers. |
| CVE-2011-4326 | This is rated a Low as the bridge device functionality is not used or configured by default. |

## 3. Additional Information:

Additional information may also be available via the Avaya support
[website](http://support.avaya.com) and through your Avaya
account representative. Please contact your Avaya product support
representative, or dial 1-800-242-2121, with any questions.

ipv6: udp: fix the wrong headroom check

```
At this point, skb->data points to skb_transport_header.
So, headroom check is wrong.

For some case:bridge(UFO is on) + eth device(UFO is off),
there is no enough headroom for IPv6 frag head.
But headroom check is always false.

This will bring about data be moved to there prior to skb->head,
when adding IPv6 frag header to skb.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=682066#c0)  Masahiro Matsuya    2011-03-04 02:10:41 UTC  ``` Description of problem: The kernel panic occurs if a bridge device is connected with physical NIC and UDP packets are transmitted via the bridge device.  The kernel panic occurs when all the following conditions consist: - The kernel version is RHEL6(2.6.32-71.xx.el6). - The NETIF_F_HW_CSUM of the physical device connected with the bridge device is available. - The udp-fragmentation-offload function of the bridge device is available(ON). - The udp-fragmentation-offload function of the physical NIC is unavailable(OFF). - IPv6 protocol - The size of the UDP datagram exceeds MTU. (fragmentation is necessary)  The system configuration: Test_program ---> UDP/IP ---> bridge(br0) ---> NIC(eth0) ---> network  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): kernel-2.6.32-71.el6   How reproducible: Always with the reproducer  Steps to Reproduce: 1. gcc -o udp6_send udp6_send.c  2. run reproducer.sh (put udp6_send in the same directory).    Actual results: Kernel Panic occurs.  Expected results: Kernel Panic doesn't occur.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=755584#c0)  Petr Matousek    2011-11-21 14:36:26 UTC  ``` A bug was found in the way headroom check was performed in udp6_ufo_fragment() function. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash the system.  Upstream patch: a9cf73ea7ff78f52662c8658d93c226effbbedde   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=755584#c1)  Petr Matousek    2011-11-21 14:37:24 UTC  ``` Details (copied from 682066[#c0](show_bug.cgi?id=755584#c0)):  The kernel panic occurs if a bridge device is connected with physical NIC and UDP packets are transmitted via the bridge device.  The kernel panic occurs when all the following conditions consist: - The kernel version is RHEL6(2.6.32-71.xx.el6). - The NETIF_F_HW_CSUM of the physical device connected with the bridge device is available. - The udp-fragmentation-offload function of the bridge device is available(ON). - The udp-fragmentation-offload function of the physical NIC is unavailable(OFF). - IPv6 protocol - The size of the UDP datagram exceeds MTU. (fragmentation is necessary)   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=755584#c3)  Petr Matousek    2011-11-21 14:41:30 UTC  ``` Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 755590](show_bug.cgi?id=755590 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2011-4326 kernel: wrong headroom check in udp6_ufo_fragment() [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=755584#c5)  Petr Matousek    2011-11-21 14:50:22 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect the versions of Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5 as they did not provide support for UDP Fragmentation Offload (UFO) functionality. This has been addressed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG via <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-1465.html>, and <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0010.html>.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=755584#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-11-22 16:53:44 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2011:1465 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-1465.html>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=755584#c7)  Fedora Update System    2011-11-29 00:21:53 UTC  ``` kernel-2.6.35.14-106.fc14 has been pushed to the Fedora 14 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=755584#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-01-10 20:17:12 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    MRG for RHEL-6 v.2  Via RHSA-2012:0010 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0010.html>   ``` |  |
