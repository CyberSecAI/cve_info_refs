Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-4923:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to BackupPC not properly sanitizing input when processing log file viewer error messages. Specifically, the `num` parameter in the URLs `index.cgi?action=view&type=XferLOG&num=<XSS here>&host=<some host>` and `index.cgi?action=view&type=XferErr&num=<XSS here>&host=<some host>` was not being sanitized.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The lack of input sanitization allows for the injection of malicious scripts into the web page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to modify the contents of the web page or steal confidential data within the same domain if a user were tricked into viewing server output during a crafted server request.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through crafted URLs that include malicious scripts in the `num` parameter when viewing log files through the BackupPC web interface. The vulnerable URLs are:
    - `index.cgi?action=view&type=XferLOG&num=<XSS here>&host=<some host>`
    - `index.cgi?action=view&type=XferErr&num=<XSS here>&host=<some host>`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs that, when accessed by a user logged into the BackupPC interface, execute the injected scripts.
- The attacker needs to trick a user into accessing the malicious URL (e.g., via phishing, malicious links, or by compromising a website the victim trusts).

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is related to CVE-2011-3361, which was a similar XSS issue in `CGI/Browse.pm`. CVE-2011-4923 addresses the same issue in `CGI/View.pm`.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Jamie Strandboge while preparing updates for CVE-2011-3361.
- Patches were made available for versions 3.0.0, 3.1.0, 3.2.0, and 3.2.1.
- The issue affects multiple Ubuntu versions (8.04, 10.04, 10.10, 11.04) but not 11.10 as it's fixed in the provided version
