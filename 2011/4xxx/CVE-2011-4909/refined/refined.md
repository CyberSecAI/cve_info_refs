Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2011-4909:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the improper sanitization of the `HTTP_REFERER` input before it is returned to the user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The lack of proper sanitization allows for the injection of arbitrary HTML and script code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- Execution of arbitrary HTML and script code within a user's browser session. This code is executed in the context of the affected website, potentially allowing attackers to:
   - Steal session cookies.
   - Perform actions on behalf of the user.
   - Redirect users to malicious websites.
   - Modify the content of the webpage.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is through the `HTTP_REFERER` header, which an attacker can manipulate.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs the ability to control the `HTTP_REFERER` header. This could be achieved via:
   - Creating a malicious website that links to the vulnerable site, setting the referrer.
   - If the vulnerable site has a form or action that returns to itself, a specially crafted link with the malicious referrer could be used.
