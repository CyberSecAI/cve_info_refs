    "summary": "The provided document details a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the psa v10.3.1_build1013110726.09 software, specifically within the `/plesk-billing/admin/index.php/default` page. The vulnerability is triggered when the `message_id` POST parameter is set to a malicious string containing Javascript.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization or validation of the `message_id` POST parameter on the `/plesk-billing/admin/index.php/default` page.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists because the application does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input before using it to generate dynamic content within the web page."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the page, which, when executed by a user, can steal cookies/session tokens and take over accounts, modify page content, or perform other malicious actions on behalf of the victim.",
      "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/plesk-billing/admin/index.php/default` page, where the `message_id` parameter contains malicious JavaScript.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target server, and have knowledge of the vulnerable parameter. No other special capabilities or positioning is required, except that the application is vulnerable to XSS in the context of an authenticated user (Admin, Reseller or User). The attacker also needs to know the correct value for other parameters like `ctr`, `sso_api_path`, etc in order for the request not to result in a `400 Bad Request` response from the server."
