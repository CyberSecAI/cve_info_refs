Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2011-4519:

**Vulnerability:** ActiveX Stack Overflow

**Root Cause:** A stack overflow vulnerability exists in an ActiveX component used by the PROMOTIC software. This vulnerability is triggered when a specially crafted HTML document is opened on a client machine.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Stack Overflow:** A buffer overflow condition on the stack memory region due to insufficient bounds checking when processing data from a specially crafted HTML document.
*   **ActiveX Component Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is located within an ActiveX component, which is an older technology that can be a source of security issues if not handled carefully.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can cause the application to crash, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious HTML Document:** The primary attack vector involves delivering a malicious HTML document to a client machine running the vulnerable PROMOTIC software. This could be done via email, malicious websites, or other means of delivering web content.
*   **Client-Side Attack:** The attack is client-side, meaning it targets the user's machine when they open the malicious HTML file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Low Skill Level:** The content indicates that an attacker with a low skill level would be able to exploit this vulnerability because public exploits are available.
*   **Ability to Deliver Malicious HTML:** The attacker needs to be able to deliver the malicious HTML document to a user of the vulnerable software, which requires some form of access to the client system or the ability to trick the user into opening the malicious file.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability was discovered by an independent researcher, Luigi Auriemma.
*   A patch has been released by MICROSYS to address this vulnerability, along with other vulnerabilities (CVE-2011-4518 and CVE-2011-4520).
