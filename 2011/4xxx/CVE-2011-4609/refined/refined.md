Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2011-4609:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies within the `svc_run()` function in glibc's RPC implementation.
- When a process using `svc_run()` exceeds the open file limit, the `accept()` call within `rendezvous_request()` or `svcudp_recv()` fails with the `EMFILE` error.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Infinite Loop:** The code enters a loop between `poll()`, `accept()`, and `for` loops when `accept()` fails with `EMFILE`. This loop consumes excessive CPU resources.
- **Lack of Proper Error Handling:** The `svc_run()` function does not handle `EMFILE` errors appropriately. Instead of backing off or handling the condition, it repeatedly retries, leading to the CPU consumption issue.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause a service using glibc's RPC implementation to consume excessive CPU time, rendering the service unresponsive.
- **System Unresponsiveness:** The high CPU usage can lead to an unresponsive system, potentially requiring manual intervention like service or system restarts.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Remote Attack:** A remote attacker can trigger this vulnerability by opening a large number of connections to an RPC service that utilizes the vulnerable glibc implementation.
- **File Descriptor Exhaustion:** The attacker causes the service to exceed its open file descriptor limit. This can be done by repeatedly establishing new connections to the RPC service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker must be able to establish network connections to an RPC service using the vulnerable glibc implementation.
- The attacker needs to be able to open a number of connections sufficient to cause the service to exceed its file descriptor limits, triggering the `EMFILE` error.

**Additional Notes:**
- A patch was created to correct the flaw
- The issue was addressed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4,5 and 6 via errata.
