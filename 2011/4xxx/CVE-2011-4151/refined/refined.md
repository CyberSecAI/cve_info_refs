Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-4151:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by an assertion failure in the `krb5_db2_lockout_audit()` function within the KDC's Berkeley DB ("db2") back end. The assertion `!locked_check_p(context, stamp, max_fail, lockout_duration, entry)` can fail under certain, yet unidentified, conditions, leading to a crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Assertion failure in `krb5_db2_lockout_audit()` within the db2 back end.
- The `locked_check_p` condition can be false under certain circumstances, leading to the assertion failure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The primary impact is a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
- An attacker can remotely crash the KDC daemon. This will prevent users from authenticating via Kerberos until the service is restarted.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attacks. An attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- The specific trigger conditions for the assertion failure are not clearly identified.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the KDC.
- The KDC must be configured to use the Berkeley DB ("db2") back end.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in krb5 versions 1.8 through 1.8.4 when using the db2 back end.
- Versions 1.9 and later do not have the vulnerable code in the db2 back end.
- This vulnerability is related to CVE-2011-1528, which affects the LDAP back end. Both vulnerabilities involve the `lockout_audit` functionality.
- The specific condition that causes the assertion to fail is not fully understood. It is likely related to password lockout policies and the way they are handled by the KDC.
