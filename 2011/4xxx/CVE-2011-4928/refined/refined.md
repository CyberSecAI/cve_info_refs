Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-4928:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the Textile formatter used by Redmine. The formatter did not properly sanitize user-supplied input when rendering formatted text.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The core weakness is a persistent XSS vulnerability. This means that malicious scripts could be injected through the Textile formatter and stored within the application's database or file system. When a user subsequently views the content containing the injected script, the script is executed in their browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The impact is significant as it allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' browsers.
- This could lead to:
  - Stealing session cookies and hijacking user accounts.
  - Defacing the application.
  - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
  - Potentially gaining further access to the system or network.
  - Exposing sensitive information to the attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through user-supplied content. An attacker could craft malicious input containing JavaScript and inject it into fields that use the Textile formatter. This could include fields in issues, forum posts, wiki pages, or any other place where the Textile formatter is used to render content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to inject text into fields that are rendered using the Textile formatter. This could mean:
  - The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of Redmine and be able to create or edit content.
  - Depending on the application's configuration, an unauthenticated attacker might also be able to inject malicious content if public access is allowed for certain areas using the textile formatter.
