## Redmine 1.0.5 bug/security fix released

Added by [Jean-Philippe Lang](/users/1) [about 14 years](/projects/redmine/activity?from=2010-12-23 "2010-12-23 11:45") ago

Among 11 bug fixes, Redmine [1.0.5](/versions/28) solves the incompatibility with the i18n 0.5.0 gem. The appropriate i18n gem version (0.4.2) is now required, you can install it using:

```

gem install i18n -v=0.4.2

```
This release also fixes 3 security issues reported by joernchen of Phenoelit:

* logged in users may be able to access private data (affected versions: 1.0.x)
* persistent XSS vulnerability in textile formatter (affected versions: all previous releases)
* remote command execution in bazaar repository adapter (affected versions: 0.9.x, 1.0.x)

All Redmine users are highly recommended to upgrade to this latest release.

Package        : redmine
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
Debian Bug     : 608397

Joernchen of Phenoelit discovered several vulnerabilities in Redmine,
a project management web application:

  Logged in users may be able to access private data.

  The Textile formatter allowed for cross site scripting, exposing
  sensitive data to an attacker.

  The Bazaar repository adapter could be used to remotely execute
  commands on the host running Redmine.

The oldstable distribution (lenny) does not contain redmine packages.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.1-2.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and unstable distribution (sid),
this problem has been fixed in version 1.0.5-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your redmine packages.

Subject: CVE request: redmine issues

Hi,
please assign three CVE IDs for the following issues in Redmine:

These need to be CVE-2011-* IDs:

The announcement can be found here: <http://www.redmine.org/news/49>

--------
This release also fixes 3 security issues reported by joernchen of
Phenoelit:

* logged in users may be able to access private data (affected
versions: 1.0.x)

* persistent XSS vulnerability in textile formatter (affected
versions: all previous releases)

* remote command execution in bazaar repository adapter (affected
versions: 0.9.x, 1.0.x)
--------

This was already fixed in a Debian security update some time ago,
but never received a CVE ID:
<http://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/2011/msg00131.html>

Patches can be found in the Debian patch tracker:
<http://patch-tracker.debian.org/package/redmine/1.0.1-2>

Cheers,
        Moritz
