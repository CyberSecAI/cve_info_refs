Root cause of vulnerability:
The `currentPageId` parameter in the `/Wizard/Edit/Html` endpoint is vulnerable to SQL injection because user-supplied data is not properly sanitized before being used in a database query. The application attempts to block SQL injection but this can be circumvented by double URL-encoding the blocked characters.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- SQL injection via the `currentPageId` parameter.
- Inadequate input validation and sanitization.
- Bypass of basic SQL injection protection mechanisms.
- Vulnerability to double URL encoding

Impact of exploitation:
- An attacker can craft malicious SQL queries that could be used to read, modify, or delete arbitrary data from the database.
- An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or execute arbitrary commands on the database server.
- An attacker can interfere with application logic.

Attack vectors:
- The attacker sends a crafted GET request to the vulnerable endpoint `/Wizard/Edit/Html` containing double URL-encoded SQL injection payload in the `currentPageId` parameter.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- The attacker does not need any prior authentication or access to the application.
