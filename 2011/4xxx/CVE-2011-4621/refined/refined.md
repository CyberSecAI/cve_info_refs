Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-4621:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the Linux kernel's scheduler. Specifically, a race condition exists where the `TIF_NEED_RESCHED` flag of a task can be set after the task has been scheduled out (blocked). This can occur when an idle load balancer marks a task with `set_tsk_need_resched()` while the task is already in the process of being descheduled. When this task resumes on another CPU, the `check_preempt_curr()` function incorrectly sets the `rq->skip_clock_update` flag on the original CPU. This flag prevents the scheduler's reference time from advancing on that CPU, leading to incorrect scheduling decisions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Race condition:** The core vulnerability is a race condition in the scheduler related to the `TIF_NEED_RESCHED` flag and the `skip_clock_update` mechanism.
*   **Incorrect flag setting:** The `check_preempt_curr()` function incorrectly sets `rq->skip_clock_update` on a CPU that may not even be aware of the task resuming on another CPU.
*   **Scheduler time not advancing:** The `skip_clock_update` flag prevents the scheduler's reference time from updating on the affected CPU.
*  **Inconsistent task state:** The assumption that a resuming task cannot have TIF_NEED_RESCHED already set is violated.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An unprivileged local user can exploit this flaw to cause a system stall. Due to the scheduler's reference time not updating, a process can be scheduled indefinitely, blocking other important kernel threads (e.g., `events/*`, `kblockd/*`) and effectively freezing the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system.
*   **Unprivileged User:** The vulnerability can be triggered by an unprivileged user.
*   **Tight Loop:** The attacker needs to execute a tight loop in a user-level process. This causes the process to be constantly scheduled, and when the described race condition occurs, the scheduler is affected.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to execute code:** The attacker needs to be able to execute arbitrary code on the target system.
*   **Local user:** The attacker can be an unprivileged user.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was addressed by commit `f26f9aff6aaf67e9a430d16c266f91b13a5bff64` in the Linux kernel.
*   The fix involves clearing `TIF_NEED_RESCHED` after returning from balancing (idle\_balance), and within setup\_thread\_stack(). The optimization was made robust by checking if the current task has been dequeued before setting the flag, and clearing the flag unconditionally within the `schedule()` function rather than conditionally in `put_prev_task()`.
*   The issue was reported by Bjoern B. Brandenburg and fixed by Mike Galbraith, with additional contributions from Peter Zijlstra and Ingo Molnar.
*   The bug was also tracked in Red Hat Bugzilla as bug 769711.
