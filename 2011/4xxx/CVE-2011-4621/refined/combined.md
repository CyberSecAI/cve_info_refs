| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=769711#c0)  Petr Matousek    2011-12-21 20:29:32 UTC  ``` A tight loop in user level process isn't preempted unless a realtime process is woken up on the cpu.  Some important kernel threads such as events/*, kblockd/* can be blocked by the process, and the machine stalls.  Unprivileged local user could use this flaw to DoS the system.  Upstream commit: <http://git.kernel.org/linus/f26f9aff6aaf67e9a430d16c266f91b13a5bff64>  Reference: <https://lkml.org/lkml/2010/11/20/212>  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Masaki Tachibana for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=769711#c2)  Kurt Seifried    2011-12-21 22:23:00 UTC  ``` Added [CVE-2011-4621](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-4621) as per <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/12/21/6>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=769711#c3)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2012-04-13 01:40:31 UTC  ``` Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 812183](show_bug.cgi?id=812183 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2011-4621 kernel: tight loop and no preemption can cause system stall [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=769711#c6)  Petr Matousek    2013-08-24 12:48:31 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue does not affect Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.   ``` |  |

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Brandenburg" <> | | Subject | Scheduler bug related to rq->skip\_clock\_update? | |  | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |  ``` Hi Peter, hi Mike, hi Ingo,we have observed some strangeness regarding the runqueue clock updates whenporting the LITMUS^RT patches (<http://www.cs.unc.edu/~anderson/litmus-rt>)from .34 to .36. Specifically, it seems that the flag rq->skip_clock_updateremains set for prolonged times in some circumstances. Not updating therunqueue clock while a task is scheduled obviously causes the scheduler tomake badly misguided decisions.I was also able to reproduce this on the latest pre-.37 _without_ LITMUS^RTpatches (see below), so I don't think that the problem was introduced by us.First, here's a debug trace that illustrates the problem. (The trace is fromLITMUS^RT applied to .36 on a four-CPU host with copious amounts of extradebug info. The first number in the trace is a sequence number and can beignored.)> 613953 P3: SCHED_STATE [P3] 0x1 (TASK_SCHEDULED) -> 0x4 (WILL_SCHEDULE)> 613954 P3: (kworker/u:0/5) clear_tsk_need_reschedThe workload consisted of tmux, a couple of top instances, and compiling alibrary (liblitmus). On CPU 3, kworker invoked schedule() because it blocks.Its TIF_NEED_RESCHED is cleared. The idle load balancer is activated becausekworker blocks and there is nothing else pending.> 613955 P3: (kworker/u:0/5) XXXX calling resched_task() during schedule()> from ret:0xc0045400 [rt:0 nr_running:1]> 613957 P3: (kworker/u:0/5) set_tsk_need_resched() ret:c004495c task_cpu:3The idle load balancer marked kworker with set_tsk_need_resched(), eventhough kworker was on its way out anyway. CPU 3 continues to schedule andpicks 'ld'. So far so good.> 613960 P3: SCHED_STATE [P3] 0x4 (WILL_SCHEDULE) -> 0x8 (TASK_PICKED)> 613961 P3: SCHED_STATE [P3] 0x8 (TASK_PICKED) -> 0x1 (TASK_SCHEDULED)> 613962 P3: SCHED_STATE [P3] 0x1 (TASK_SCHEDULED) -> 0x4 (WILL_SCHEDULE)> 613963 P3: (ld/1107) set_tsk_need_resched() ret:c004495c task_cpu:3> 613964 P3: SCHED_STATE [P3] 0x4 (WILL_SCHEDULE) -> 0x4 (WILL_SCHEDULE)> 613965 P3: (ld/1107) clear_tsk_need_resched> 613966 P3: SCHED_STATE [P3] 0x4 (WILL_SCHEDULE) -> 0x8 (TASK_PICKED)> 613967 P3: SCHED_STATE [P3] 0x8 (TASK_PICKED) -> 0x1 (TASK_SCHEDULED)> 613968 P3: SCHED_STATE [P3] 0x1 (TASK_SCHEDULED) -> 0x4 (WILL_SCHEDULE)> 613969 P3: (kworker/3:1/411) clear_tsk_need_resched> 613970 P3: SCHED_STATE [P3] 0x4 (WILL_SCHEDULE) -> 0x8 (TASK_PICKED)> 613971 P3: SCHED_STATE [P3] 0x8 (TASK_PICKED) -> 0x1 (TASK_SCHEDULED)Some time passed and CPU 3 was active servicing ld and a different kworker.Now something bad happens.> 613972 P0: (kworker/u:0/5) already need_resched when resuming> 613973 P0: (kworker/u:0/5) rq->skip_clock_update <- 1 (flags=0; cpu=3;> is-cur?=0)The kworker that was marked with set_tsk_need_resched() resumes on CPU 0.Because the flag was already set, check_preempt_curr() setsrq->skip_clock_update() *on CPU 3*.CPU 3 never knows that anything happened and continues to schedule itscurrently assigned task (ld). Because skip_clock_update is set, the referencetime for the scheduler does not advance anymore. Hence ld seems to beconsuming no execution time and CFS schedules it until it blocks by itself(or until a SCHED_FIFO or SCHED_RT task becomes active).The scheduler tick on P3 reports for some time after that nothing changes.> 613974 P3: (ld/1107) rq->skip_clock_update [CFS] =>> sum_exec_runtime=569265250  delta=0> 613975 P3: (ld/1107) rq->skip_clock_update [CFS] =>> sum_exec_runtime=569265250  delta=0> 613976 P3: (ld/1107) rq->skip_clock_update [CFS] =>> sum_exec_runtime=569265250  delta=0> 613977 P3: (ld/1107) rq->skip_clock_update [CFS] =>> sum_exec_runtime=569265250  delta=0> 613992 P3: (ld/1107) rq->skip_clock_update [CFS] =>> sum_exec_runtime=569265250  delta=0> 613993 P3: (ld/1107) rq->skip_clock_update [CFS] =>> sum_exec_runtime=569265250  delta=0> 613994 P3: (ld/1107) rq->skip_clock_update [CFS] =>> sum_exec_runtime=569265250  delta=0> 614002 P3: (ld/1107) rq->skip_clock_update [CFS] =>> sum_exec_runtime=569265250  delta=0> 614005 P2: (ld/1107) rq->skip_clock_update [CFS] =>> sum_exec_runtime=569265250  delta=0> 614025 P3: (ld/1107) rq->skip_clock_update [CFS] =>> sum_exec_runtime=569265250  delta=0> 614080 P3: (ld/1107) rq->skip_clock_update [CFS] =>> sum_exec_runtime=569265250  delta=0> 614117 P3: (ld/1107) rq->skip_clock_update [CFS] =>> sum_exec_runtime=569265250  delta=0> 614146 P3: (ld/1107) rq->skip_clock_update [CFS] =>> sum_exec_runtime=569265250  delta=0> 614186 P3: (ld/1107) rq->skip_clock_update [CFS] =>> sum_exec_runtime=569265250  delta=0> 614233 P3: (ld/1107) rq->skip_clock_update [CFS] =>> sum_exec_runtime=569265250  delta=0> 614235 P3: (ld/1107) rq->skip_clock_update [CFS] =>> sum_exec_runtime=569265250  delta=0And so on...This seems very wrong and it causes massive problems for LITMUS^RT. As aworkaround, never setting skip_clock_update in check_preempt_curr() gets ridof all symptoms.I was under the impression that, as an invariant, tasks should not haveTIF_NEED_RESCHED set after they've blocked. In this case, the idle loadbalancer should not mark the task that's on its way out withset_tsk_need_resched().In any case, check_preempt_curr() seems to assume that a resuming task cannothave TIF_NEED_RESCHED already set. Setting skip_clock_update on a remote CPUthat hasn't even been notified via IPI seems wrong.Since AFAIK printk() can't be called while holding a runqueue lock, I am notsure what the best way is to reproduce a trace like the above on a vanillakernel. As a first approximation, the patch below simply tracks how much timepasses between setting and clearing skip_clock_update.With the patch applied on top of b86db4744230c94e480de56f1b7f31117edbf193(the current master), I got the following numbers on a four-CPU ARM11 MPCore.> bbb@district10:/proc$ egrep 'cpu#|skip' /proc/sched_debug> cpu#0>   .skip_clock_max                : 139310500> cpu#1>   .skip_clock_max                : 1831250> cpu#2>   .skip_clock_max                : 1112750> cpu#3>   .skip_clock_max                : 1243375On CPU 0, the flag was set at some point for over 139 milliseconds! Even onCPU 2, the flag was set for over one millisecond.I believe this shows that the problem persists in the latest kernel and thatit is not LITMUS^RT-related. It seems the load balancer should not mark thecurrently-scheduled task with set_tsk_need_resched() when invoked from withinschedule().Comments?

Sched: fix skip\_clock\_update optimization

```
idle_balance() drops/retakes rq->lock, leaving the previous task
vulnerable to set_tsk_need_resched().  Clear it after we return
from balancing instead, and in setup_thread_stack() as well, so
no successfully descheduled or never scheduled task has it set.

Need resched confused the skip_clock_update logic, which assumes
that the next call to update_rq_clock() will come nearly immediately
after being set.  Make the optimization robust against the waking
a sleeper before it sucessfully deschedules case by checking that
the current task has not been dequeued before setting the flag,
since it is that useless clock update we're trying to save, and
clear unconditionally in schedule() proper instead of conditionally
in put_prev_task().
