Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2011-4539:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of specially crafted DHCP packets when the DHCP server is configured to use regular expressions for matching.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Improper Input Handling:** The DHCP server does not correctly process malformed packets, specifically when regular expressions are involved in evaluating DHCP requests.
*   **Null Pointer Dereference:** A null pointer dereference in `common/tree.c` was identified as a point of failure, although the details of how the malformed packet triggers this weren't in the provided content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to crash the DHCP server. This crash results in a denial of service, as the server becomes unavailable and unable to assign IP addresses to clients.
*   **Resource Exhaustion (Memory Leaks):** In some configurations (DHCPv6, possibly DHCPv4), memory leaks can occur during the processing of malformed packets.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Traffic:** The attack vector is remote, exploiting the vulnerability through crafted DHCP request packets sent over the network.
*   **Malformed DHCP Packets:** The attacker needs to send specifically crafted, malformed DHCP packets to the vulnerable server. These packets trigger the vulnerability when the server is using regular expressions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable DHCP server.
*   **Knowledge of DHCP:** The attacker needs knowledge of the DHCP protocol to craft the malformed packets that trigger the vulnerability.
*   **DHCP Server with Regex Config:** The attack is effective against DHCP servers configured to use regular expressions for matching DHCP requests.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was addressed by adding a check for a null pointer in `common/tree.c`.
*   Multiple Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, Debian, and openSUSE, released security updates to fix this issue.
*   The issue is present in ISC DHCP versions prior to the patched versions.
*   The vulnerability is exploitable remotely and rated as a "moderate" or "normal" severity in most contexts.
*   Some of the provided documents show that this CVE was fixed alongside other DHCP related CVEs.
