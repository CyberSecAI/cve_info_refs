- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the way AppLocker rules are enforced, specifically how macro or scripting features in certain applications (like Microsoft Office) can bypass these rules. The vulnerability leverages the ability of applications to execute code via macros/scripts, thus bypassing the AppLocker restrictions on executable files.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary weakness is a design flaw in AppLocker that does not properly restrict the execution of code within application environments (macros/scripts), even if the application itself is allowed. This allows for the execution of unauthorized code by using features such as macros in Office, which circumvents the intention of the configured AppLocker rules and flags, especially related to the %TEMP% or %system drive%:\Users directory.

- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to run malware or malicious code within the context of a permitted application, even if the location where the malware resides is restricted by AppLocker rules. This could lead to a complete system compromise, data exfiltration, or other malicious activities.
  
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through applications that support macros/scripts (e.g., Microsoft Office). An attacker can embed malicious code in a document (e.g., a Word document), and when opened by a user, the macros will execute, circumventing AppLocker policies and executing the malicious payload.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to deliver a specially crafted document or file containing malicious macros/scripts to a user. This typically requires the ability to socially engineer the user or have a way to deliver the malicious file to the victim. They do not need any specific position within the system, but they need to have the ability to have the user execute the malicious payload via a supported application.
