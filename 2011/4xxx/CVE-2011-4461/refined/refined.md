Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2011-4461:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The core issue stems from a weakness in hash table implementations used in various programming languages, including Java's Jetty. Specifically, the hashing algorithms used did not sufficiently randomize their functions or have adequate limits to prevent key collision attacks. This predictable collision behavior allows an attacker to generate numerous requests with key values that map to the same hash value. In the case of Jetty, this occurs during the parsing of POST requests.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Predictable Hash Collisions:** The vulnerability is triggered by the ability of an attacker to exploit predictable hash collisions within Jetty's hash table implementation used to store key-value pairs from POST requests.
- **Lack of Input Limits:** Insufficient limits on the number of parameters in POST requests allow for excessive collisions to be created, further exacerbating the DoS condition.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By sending specially crafted HTTP requests with many colliding key values, an attacker can cause excessive CPU usage and effectively freeze or crash the server.
- **Resource Exhaustion:**  The server wastes resources repeatedly processing hash collisions, leading to CPU exhaustion and the inability to service legitimate requests.

**4. Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Exploitation:**  The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network using specially crafted HTTP requests.
- **HTTP POST Requests:** The attack specifically targets web server applications by sending POST requests with many parameters designed to cause hash collisions.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attack can be performed by an unauthenticated attacker.
- **Minimal Resources:** The attack does not require significant bandwidth or time to execute effectively.

**Additional Details from the provided content**
*   The vulnerability affects HP P6000 Command View Software running Jetty v10.3.5 and earlier.
*   NetApp also identifies the vulnerability in multiple products that incorporate Eclipse Jetty server, versions through 8.1.0.RC2
*   The Netapp advisory (NTAP-20190307-0004) provides the CVSS v3 score as 5.3 (MEDIUM) with a vector of AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L.
*   The oCERT advisory notes the issue in multiple language implementations, but points to Jetty <= 7.5.4 being vulnerable, and Jetty >= 7.6.0.RC3 containing the fix.
*   The CERT/CC vulnerability note also confirms the hash table collision DoS with affected products including Apache Tomcat, Microsoft .NET Framework, Oracle Corporation, Ruby, and The PHP Group.
*   The Ubuntu Security Notice (USN-1429-1) states a fix for this issue was released in libjetty-java version 6.1.24-6ubuntu0.11.04.1 for Ubuntu 11.04, and 6.1.22-1ubuntu1.1 for Ubuntu 10.04, using a patch to limit the number of form parameters.

**Summary:**

CVE-2011-4461 is a remote denial-of-service vulnerability found in various language implementations, including Jetty. It's caused by predictable hash collisions and a lack of input parameter limits, allowing attackers to send HTTP POST requests that exhaust server resources and cause denial-of-service conditions. Several vendors, including NetApp and HP, confirmed that some of their products are affected by this vulnerability and recommended updates to resolve it. The vulnerability can be exploited remotely without authentication.
