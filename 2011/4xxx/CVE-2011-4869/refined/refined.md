```
- Root cause of vulnerability: Unbound does not properly handle malformed DNS responses, specifically those missing expected NSEC3 records during DNSSEC validation.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Improper handling of missing NSEC3 records, leading to an assertion failure or dereferencing of an invalid memory address.
- Impact of exploitation: A remote, unauthenticated attacker can cause the Unbound daemon to crash, leading to a denial-of-service condition.
- Attack vectors: Sending crafted DNS queries that, when resolved by an authoritative server, results in responses lacking expected NSEC3 records.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker must be able to send crafted DNS queries to a vulnerable Unbound resolver. This can be achieved by controlling the authoritative server for a domain or by intercepting and modifying responses.
