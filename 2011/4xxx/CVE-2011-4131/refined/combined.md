SHM\_UNLOCK: fix Unevictable pages stranded after swap
commit 245132643e1cfcd145bbc86a716c1818371fcb93 upstream.
Commit cc39c6a9bbde ("mm: account skipped entries to avoid looping in
find\_get\_pages") correctly fixed an infinite loop; but left a problem
that find\_get\_pages() on shmem would return 0 (appearing to callers to
mean end of tree) when it meets a run of nr\_pages swap entries.
The only uses of find\_get\_pages() on shmem are via pagevec\_lookup(),
called from invalidate\_mapping\_pages(), and from shmctl SHM\_UNLOCK's
scan\_mapping\_unevictable\_pages(). The first is already commented, and
not worth worrying about; but the second can leave pages on the
Unevictable list after an unusual sequence of swapping and locking.
Fix that by using shmem\_find\_get\_pages\_and\_swap() (then ignoring the
swap) instead of pagevec\_lookup().
But I don't want to contaminate vmscan.c with shmem internals, nor
shmem.c with LRU locking. So move scan\_mapping\_unevictable\_pages() into
shmem.c, renaming it shmem\_unlock\_mapping(); and rename
check\_move\_unevictable\_page() to check\_move\_unevictable\_pages(), looping
down an array of pages, oftentimes under the same lock.
Leave out the "rotate unevictable list" block: that's a leftover from
when this was used for /proc/sys/vm/scan\_unevictable\_pages, whose flawed
handling involved looking at pages at tail of LRU.
Was there significance to the sequence first ClearPageUnevictable, then
test page\_evictable, then SetPageUnevictable here? I think not, we're
under LRU lock, and have no barriers between those.

SHM\_UNLOCK: fix long unpreemptible section
commit 85046579bde15e532983438f86b36856e358f417 upstream.
scan\_mapping\_unevictable\_pages() is used to make SysV SHM\_LOCKed pages
evictable again once the shared memory is unlocked. It does this with
pagevec\_lookup()s across the whole object (which might occupy most of
memory), and takes 300ms to unlock 7GB here. A cond\_resched() every
PAGEVEC\_SIZE pages would be good.
However, KOSAKI-san points out that this is called under shmem.c's
info->lock, and it's also under shm.c's shm\_lock(), both spinlocks.
There is no strong reason for that: we need to take these pages off the
unevictable list soonish, but those locks are not required for it.
So move the call to scan\_mapping\_unevictable\_pages() from shmem.c's
unlock handling up to shm.c's unlock handling. Remove the recently
added barrier, not needed now we have spin\_unlock() before the scan.
Use get\_file(), with subsequent fput(), to make sure we have a reference
to mapping throughout scan\_mapping\_unevictable\_pages(): that's something
that was previously guaranteed by the shm\_lock().
Remove shmctl's lru\_add\_drain\_all(): we don't fault in pages at SHM\_LOCK
time, and we lazily discover them to be Unevictable later, so it serves
no purpose for SHM\_LOCK; and serves no purpose for SHM\_UNLOCK, since
pages still on pagevec are not marked Unevictable.
The original code avoided redundant rescans by checking VM\_LOCKED flag
at its level: now avoid them by checking shp's SHM\_LOCKED.
The original code called scan\_mapping\_unevictable\_pages() on a locked
area at shm\_destroy() time: perhaps we once had accounting cross-checks
which required that, but not now, so skip the overhead and just let
inode eviction deal with them.
Put check\_move\_unevictable\_page() and scan\_mapping\_unevictable\_pages()
under CONFIG\_SHMEM (with stub for the TINY case when ramfs is used),
more as comment than to save space; comment them used for SHM\_UNLOCK.

mm: fix NULL ptr dereference in \_\_count\_immobile\_pages
commit 687875fb7de4a95223af20ee024282fa9099f860 upstream.

cat /sys/devices/system/memory/memory0/removable

Process sed (pid: 13979, threadinfo ffff880221c36000, task ffff88022e788480)
Call Trace:

vfs\_read+0xc7/0x130
sys\_read+0x53/0xa0
system\_call\_fastpath+0x16/0x1b
We are crashing because we are trying to dereference NULL zone which
came from pfn=0 (struct page ffffea0000000000). According to the boot
log this page is marked reserved:
e820 update range: 0000000000000000 - 0000000000010000 (usable) ==> (reserved)
and early\_node\_map confirms that:
early\_node\_map[3] active PFN ranges
1: 0x00000010 -> 0x0000009c
1: 0x00000100 -> 0x000bffa3
1: 0x00100000 -> 0x00240000
The problem is that memory\_present works in PAGE\_SECTION\_MASK aligned
blocks so the reserved range sneaks into the the section as well. This
also means that free\_area\_init\_node will not take care of those reserved
pages and they stay uninitialized.
When we try to read the removable status we walk through all available
sections and hope that the zone is valid for all pages in the section.
But this is not true in this case as the zone and nid are not initialized.
We have only one node in this particular case and it is marked as node=1
(rather than 0) and that made the problem visible because page\_to\_nid will
return 0 and there are no zones on the node.
Let's check that the zone is valid and that the given pfn falls into its
boundaries and mark the section not removable. This might cause some
false positives, probably, but we do not have any sane way to find out
whether the page is reserved by the platform or it is just not used for
whatever other reasons.

proc: clear\_refs: do not clear reserved pages
commit 85e72aa5384b1a614563ad63257ded0e91d1a620 upstream.
/proc/pid/clear\_refs is used to clear the Referenced and YOUNG bits for
pages and corresponding page table entries of the task with PID pid, which
includes any special mappings inserted into the page tables in order to
provide things like vDSOs and user helper functions.
On ARM this causes a problem because the vectors page is mapped as a
global mapping and since ec706dab ("ARM: add a vma entry for the user
accessible vector page"), a VMA is also inserted into each task for this
page to aid unwinding through signals and syscall restarts. Since the
vectors page is required for handling faults, clearing the YOUNG bit (and
subsequently writing a faulting pte) means that we lose the vectors page
\*globally\* and cannot fault it back in. This results in a system deadlock
on the next exception.
To see this problem in action, just run:
$ echo 1 > /proc/self/clear\_refs
on an ARM platform (as any user) and watch your system hang. I think this
has been the case since 2.6.37
This patch avoids clearing the aforementioned bits for reserved pages,
therefore leaving the vectors page intact on ARM. Since reserved pages
are not candidates for swap, this change should not have any impact on the
usefulness of clear\_refs.

score: fix off-by-one index into syscall table
commit c25a785d6647984505fa165b5cd84cfc9a95970b upstream.
If the provided system call number is equal to \_\_NR\_syscalls, the
current check will pass and a function pointer just after the system
call table may be called, since sys\_call\_table is an array with total
size \_\_NR\_syscalls.
Whether or not this is a security bug depends on what the compiler puts
immediately after the system call table. It's likely that this won't do
anything bad because there is an additional NULL check on the syscall
entry, but if there happens to be a non-NULL value immediately after the
system call table, this may result in local privilege escalation.

rt2800pci: fix spurious interrupts generation
commit dfd00c4c8f3dfa1fd7cec45f83d98b2a49743dcd upstream.
Same devices can generate interrupt without properly setting bit in
INT\_SOURCE\_CSR register (spurious interrupt), what will cause IRQ line
will be disabled by interrupts controller driver.
We discovered that clearing INT\_MASK\_CSR stops such behaviour. We
previously first read that register, and then clear all know interrupt
sources bits and do not touch reserved bits. After this patch, we write
to all register content (I believe writing to reserved bits on that
register will not cause any problems, I tested that on my rt2800pci
device).
This fix very bad performance problem, practically making device
unusable (since worked without interrupts), reported in:
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show\_bug.cgi?id=658451
We previously tried to workaround that issue in commit
4ba7d9997869d25bd223dea7536fc1ce9fab3b3b "rt2800pci: handle spurious
interrupts", but it was reverted in commit
82e5fc2a34fa9ffea38f00c4066b7e600a0ca5e6

Documentation states that the KeyMiss flag is only valid if RxFrameOK is

When KeyMiss is set (and RxFrameOK is 1), the hardware passes a valid frame
which has not been decrypted. The driver then falsely marks the frame
as decrypted, and when using CCMP this corrupts the rx CCMP PN, leading
to connection hangs.

x86/UV2: Work around BAU bug
commit c5d35d399e685acccc85a675e8765c26b2a9813a upstream.
This patch implements a workaround for a UV2 hardware bug.
The bug is a non-atomic update of a memory-mapped register. When
hardware message delivery and software message acknowledge occur
simultaneously the pending message acknowledge for the arriving
message may be lost. This causes the sender's message status to
stay busy.
Part of the workaround is to not acknowledge a completed message
until it is verified that no other message is actually using the
resource that is mistakenly recorded in the completed message.
Part of the workaround is to test for long elapsed time in such
a busy condition, then handle it by using a spare sending
descriptor. The stay-busy condition is eventually timed out by
hardware, and then the original sending descriptor can be
re-used. Most of that logic change is in keeping track of the
current descriptor and the state of the spares.
The occurrences of the workaround are added to the BAU
statistics.

commit c10076c4304083af15a41f6bc5e657e781c1f9a6 upstream.
Tracepoints are disabled for tainted modules, which is usually because the
module is either proprietary or was forced, and we don't want either of them
using kernel tracepoints.
But, a module can also be tainted by being in the staging directory or
compiled out of tree. Either is fine for use with tracepoints, no need
to punish them. I found this out when I noticed that my sample trace event
module, when done out of tree, stopped working.

commit 28e7d218da975f6ae1751e293aed938952c55c98 upstream.
This clears the currently mapped core when suspending, to force
re-mapping after resume. Without that we were touching default core
registers believing some other core is mapped. Such a behaviour
resulted in lockups on some machines.

target: Set additional sense length field in sense data
commit 895f3022523361e9b383cf48f51feb1f7d5e7e53 upstream.
The target code was not setting the additional sense length field in the
sense data it returned, which meant that at least the Linux stack
ignored the ASC/ASCQ fields. For example, without this patch, on a
tcm\_loop device:
# sg\_raw -v /dev/sda 2 0 0 0 0 0
gives
cdb to send: 02 00 00 00 00 00

Sense Information:

Raw sense data (in hex):
70 00 05 00 00 00 00 00
while after the patch we correctly get the following (which matches what
a regular disk returns):

SCSI Status: Check Condition
Sense Information:
Fixed format, current; Sense key: Illegal Request

ACPI: processor: fix acpi\_get\_cpuid for UP processor
commit d640113fe80e45ebd4a5b420b220d3f6bf37f682 upstream.
For UP processor, it is likely that no \_MAT method or MADT table defined.
So currently acpi\_get\_cpuid(...) always return -1 for UP processor.
This is wrong. It should return valid value for CPU0.
In the other hand, BIOS may define multiple CPU handles even for UP
processor, for example
Scope (\_PR)
{
Processor (CPU0, 0x00, 0x00000410, 0x06) {}
Processor (CPU1, 0x01, 0x00000410, 0x06) {}
Processor (CPU2, 0x02, 0x00000410, 0x06) {}
Processor (CPU3, 0x03, 0x00000410, 0x06) {}
}
We should only return valid value for CPU0's acpi handle.
And return invalid value for others.

ACPI, ia64: Use SRAT table rev to use 8bit or 16/32bit PXM fields (ia64)
commit 9f10f6a520deb3639fac78d81151a3ade88b4e7f upstream.
In SRAT v1, we had 8bit proximity domain (PXM) fields; SRAT v2 provides
32bits for these. The new fields were reserved before.
According to the ACPI spec, the OS must disregrard reserved fields.
ia64 did handle the PXM fields almost consistently, but depending on
sgi's sn2 platform. This patch leaves the sn2 logic in, but does also
use 16/32 bits for PXM if the SRAT has rev 2 or higher.
The patch also adds \_\_init to the two pxm accessor functions, as they
access \_\_initdata now and are called from an \_\_init function only anyway.
Note that the code only uses 16 bits for the PXM field in the processor
proximity field; the patch does not address this as 16 bits are more than
enough.

smp\_call\_function() only lets all other CPUs execute a specific function,
while we expect all CPUs do in intel\_idle. Without the fix, we could have
one cpu which has auto\_demotion enabled or has no broadcast timer setup.
Usually we don't see impact because auto demotion just harms power and the
intel\_idle init is called in CPU 0, where boradcast timer delivers
interrupt, but this still could be a problem.

intel idle: Make idle driver more robust
commit 5c2a9f06a9cd7194f884cdc88144866235dec07d upstream.
kvm -cpu host passes the original cpuid info to the guest.
Latest kvm version seem to return true for mwait\_leaf cpuid
function on recent Intel CPUs. But it does not return mwait
C-states (mwait\_substates), instead zero is returned.
While real CPUs seem to always return non-zero values, the intel
idle driver should not get active in kvm (mwait\_substates == 0)
case and bail out.
Otherwise a Null pointer exception will happen later when the
cpuidle subsystem tries to get active:

proc: clean up and fix /proc//mem handling
commit e268337dfe26dfc7efd422a804dbb27977a3cccc upstream.
Jüri Aedla reported that the /proc//mem handling really isn't very
robust, and it also doesn't match the permission checking of any of the
other related files.
This changes it to do the permission checks at open time, and instead of
tracking the process, it tracks the VM at the time of the open. That
simplifies the code a lot, but does mean that if you hold the file
descriptor open over an execve(), you'll continue to read from the \_old\_
VM.
That is different from our previous behavior, but much simpler. If
somebody actually finds a load where this matters, we'll need to revert
this commit.
I suspect that nobody will ever notice - because the process mapping
addresses will also have changed as part of the execve. So you cannot
actually usefully access the fd across a VM change simply because all
the offsets for IO would have changed too.

block: fail SCSI passthrough ioctls on partition devices
commit 0bfc96cb77224736dfa35c3c555d37b3646ef35e upstream.
[ Changes with respect to 3.3: return -ENOTTY from scsi\_verify\_blk\_ioctl
and -ENOIOCTLCMD from sd\_compat\_ioctl. ]
Linux allows executing the SG\_IO ioctl on a partition or LVM volume, and
will pass the command to the underlying block device. This is
well-known, but it is also a large security problem when (via Unix
permissions, ACLs, SELinux or a combination thereof) a program or user
needs to be granted access only to part of the disk.
This patch lets partitions forward a small set of harmless ioctls;
others are logged with printk so that we can see which ioctls are
actually sent. In my tests only CDROM\_GET\_CAPABILITY actually occurred.
Of course it was being sent to a (partition on a) hard disk, so it would
have failed with ENOTTY and the patch isn't changing anything in
practice. Still, I'm treating it specially to avoid spamming the logs.
In principle, this restriction should include programs running with
CAP\_SYS\_RAWIO. If for example I let a program access /dev/sda2 and
/dev/sdb, it still should not be able to read/write outside the
boundaries of /dev/sda2 independent of the capabilities. However, for
now programs with CAP\_SYS\_RAWIO will still be allowed to send the
ioctls. Their actions will still be logged.
This patch does not affect the non-libata IDE driver. That driver
however already tests for bd != bd->bd\_contains before issuing some
ioctl; it could be restricted further to forbid these ioctls even for
programs running with CAP\_SYS\_ADMIN/CAP\_SYS\_RAWIO.

mac80211: revert on-channel work optimisations
commit e76aadc572288a158ae18ae1c10fe395c7bca066 upstream.
Backport note:
This patch it's a full revert of commit b23b025f "mac80211: Optimize
scans on current operating channel.". On upstrem revert e76aadc5 we
keep some bits from that commit, which are needed for upstream version
of mac80211.
The on-channel work optimisations have caused a
number of issues, and the code is unfortunately
very complex and almost impossible to follow.
Instead of attempting to put in more workarounds
let's just remove those optimisations, we can
work on them again later, after we change the
whole auth/assoc design.
This should fix rate\_control\_send\_low() warnings,

fix shrink\_dcache\_parent() livelock
commit eaf5f9073533cde21c7121c136f1c3f072d9cf59 upstream.
Two (or more) concurrent calls of shrink\_dcache\_parent() on the same dentry may
cause shrink\_dcache\_parent() to loop forever.
Here's what appears to happen:
1 - CPU0: select\_parent(P) finds C and puts it on dispose list, returns 1
2 - CPU1: select\_parent(P) locks P->d\_lock
3 - CPU0: shrink\_dentry\_list() locks C->d\_lock
dentry\_kill(C) tries to lock P->d\_lock but fails, unlocks C->d\_lock
4 - CPU1: select\_parent(P) locks C->d\_lock,
moves C from dispose list being processed on CPU0 to the new
dispose list, returns 1
5 - CPU0: shrink\_dentry\_list() finds dispose list empty, returns
6 - Goto 2 with CPU0 and CPU1 switched
Basically select\_parent() steals the dentry from shrink\_dentry\_list() and thinks
it found a new one, causing shrink\_dentry\_list() to think it's making progress
and loop over and over.
One way to trigger this is to make udev calls stat() on the sysfs file while it
is going away.
Having a file in /lib/udev/rules.d/ with only this one rule seems to the trick:
ATTR{vendor}=="0x8086", ATTR{device}=="0x10ca", ENV{PCI\_SLOT\_NAME}="%k", ENV{MATCHADDR}="$attr{address}", RUN+="/bin/true"
Then execute the following loop:
while true; do
echo -bond0 > /sys/class/net/bonding\_masters
echo +bond0 > /sys/class/net/bonding\_masters
echo -bond1 > /sys/class/net/bonding\_masters
echo +bond1 > /sys/class/net/bonding\_masters
done
One fix would be to check all callers and prevent concurrent calls to
shrink\_dcache\_parent(). But I think a better solution is to stop the
stealing behavior.
This patch adds a new dentry flag that is set when the dentry is added to the
dispose list. The flag is cleared in dentry\_lru\_del() in case the dentry gets a
new reference just before being pruned.
If the dentry has this flag, select\_parent() will skip it and let
shrink\_dentry\_list() retry pruning it. With select\_parent() skipping those
dentries there will not be the appearance of progress (new dentries found) when
there is none, hence shrink\_dcache\_parent() will not loop forever.
Set the flag is also set in prune\_dcache\_sb() for consistency as suggested by
Linus.

dcache: use a dispose list in select\_parent
commit b48f03b319ba78f3abf9a7044d1f436d8d90f4f9 upstream.
select\_parent currently abuses the dentry cache LRU to provide
cleanup features for child dentries that need to be freed. It moves
them to the tail of the LRU, then tells shrink\_dcache\_parent() to
calls \_\_shrink\_dcache\_sb to unconditionally move them to a dispose
list (as DCACHE\_REFERENCED is ignored). \_\_shrink\_dcache\_sb() has to
relock the dentries to move them off the LRU onto the dispose list,
but otherwise does not touch the dentries that select\_parent() moved
to the tail of the LRU. It then passses the dispose list to
shrink\_dentry\_list() which tries to free the dentries.
IOWs, the use of \_\_shrink\_dcache\_sb() is superfluous - we can build
exactly the same list of dentries for disposal directly in
select\_parent() and call shrink\_dentry\_list() instead of calling
\_\_shrink\_dcache\_sb() to do that. This means that we avoid long holds
on the lru lock walking the LRU moving dentries to the dispose list
We also avoid the need to relock each dentry just to move it off the
LRU, reducing the numebr of times we lock each dentry to dispose of
them in shrink\_dcache\_parent() from 3 to 2 times.
Further, we remove one of the two callers of \_\_shrink\_dcache\_sb().
This also means that \_\_shrink\_dcache\_sb can be moved into back into
prune\_dcache\_sb() and we no longer have to handle referenced
dentries conditionally, simplifying the code.

uvcvideo: Fix integer overflow in uvc\_ioctl\_ctrl\_map()
commit 806e23e95f94a27ee445022d724060b9b45cb64a upstream.
There is a potential integer overflow in uvc\_ioctl\_ctrl\_map(). When a
large xmap->menu\_count is passed from the userspace, the subsequent call
to kmalloc() will allocate a buffer smaller than expected.
map->menu\_count and map->menu\_info would later be used in a loop (e.g.
in uvc\_query\_v4l2\_ctrl), which leads to out-of-bound access.
The patch checks the ioctl argument and returns -EINVAL for zero or too
large values in xmap->menu\_count.

recordmcount: Fix handling of elf64 big-endian objects.
commit 2e885057b7f75035f0b85e02f737891482815a81 upstream.
In ELF64, the sh\_flags field is 64-bits wide. recordmcount was
erroneously treating it as a 32-bit wide field. For little endian
objects this works because the flags of interest (SHF\_EXECINSTR)
reside in the lower 32 bits of the word, and you get the same result
with either a 32-bit or 64-bit read. Big endian objects on the
other hand do not work at all with this error.
The fix: Correctly treat sh\_flags as 64-bits wide in elf64 objects.
The symptom I observed was that my
\_\_start\_mcount\_loc..\_\_stop\_mcount\_loc was empty even though ftrace
function tracing was enabled.

svcrpc: avoid memory-corruption on pool shutdown
commit b4f36f88b3ee7cf26bf0be84e6c7fc15f84dcb71 upstream.
Socket callbacks use svc\_xprt\_enqueue() to add an xprt to a
pool->sp\_sockets list. In normal operation a server thread will later
come along and take the xprt off that list. On shutdown, after all the
threads have exited, we instead manually walk the sv\_tempsocks and
sv\_permsocks lists to find all the xprt's and delete them.
So the sp\_sockets lists don't really matter any more. As a result,
we've mostly just ignored them and hoped they would go away.
Which has gotten us into trouble; witness for example ebc63e531cc6
"svcrpc: fix list-corrupting race on nfsd shutdown", the result of Ben
Greear noticing that a still-running svc\_xprt\_enqueue() could re-add an
xprt to an sp\_sockets list just before it was deleted. The fix was to
remove it from the list at the end of svc\_delete\_xprt(). But that only
made corruption less likely--I can see nothing that prevents a
svc\_xprt\_enqueue() from adding another xprt to the list at the same
moment that we're removing this xprt from the list. In fact, despite
the earlier xpo\_detach(), I don't even see what guarantees that
svc\_xprt\_enqueue() couldn't still be running on this xprt.
So, instead, note that svc\_xprt\_enqueue() essentially does:
lock sp\_lock
if XPT\_BUSY unset
add to sp\_sockets
unlock sp\_lock
So, if we do:
set XPT\_BUSY on every xprt.
Empty every sp\_sockets list, under the sp\_socks locks.
Then we're left knowing that the sp\_sockets lists are all empty and will
stay that way, since any svc\_xprt\_enqueue() will check XPT\_BUSY under
the sp\_lock and see it set.
And \*then\* we can continue deleting the xprt's.
(Thanks to Jeff Layton for being correctly suspicious of this code....)

svcrpc: fix double-free on shutdown of nfsd after changing pool mode
commit 61c8504c428edcebf23b97775a129c5b393a302b upstream.
The pool\_to and to\_pool fields of the global svc\_pool\_map are freed on
shutdown, but are initialized in nfsd startup only in the
SVC\_POOL\_PERCPU and SVC\_POOL\_PERNODE cases.
They \*are\* initialized to zero on kernel startup. So as long as you use
only SVC\_POOL\_GLOBAL (the default), this will never be a problem.
You're also OK if you only ever use SVC\_POOL\_PERCPU or SVC\_POOL\_PERNODE.
However, the following sequence events leads to a double-free:
1. set SVC\_POOL\_PERCPU or SVC\_POOL\_PERNODE
2. start nfsd: both fields are initialized.
3. shutdown nfsd: both fields are freed.
4. set SVC\_POOL\_GLOBAL
5. start nfsd: the fields are left untouched.
6. shutdown nfsd: now we try to free them again.
Step 4 is actually unnecessary, since (for some bizarre reason), nfsd
automatically resets the pool mode to SVC\_POOL\_GLOBAL on shutdown.

kconfig/streamline-config.pl: Fix parsing Makefile with variables
commit 364212fddaaa60c5a64f67a0f5624ad996ecc8a0 upstream.
Thomas Lange reported that when he did a 'make localmodconfig', his
config was missing the brcmsmac driver, even though he had the module
loaded.
Looking into this, I found the file:
drivers/net/wireless/brcm80211/brcmsmac/Makefile
had the following in the Makefile:
MODULEPFX := brcmsmac
obj-$(CONFIG\_BRCMSMAC) += $(MODULEPFX).o
The way streamline-config.pl works, is parsing all the
obj-$(CONFIG\_FOO) += foo.o
lines to find that CONFIG\_FOO belongs to the module foo.ko.
But in this case, the brcmsmac.o was not used, but a variable in its place.
By changing streamline-config.pl to remember defined variables in Makefiles
and substituting them when they are used in the obj-X lines, allows
Thomas (and others) to have their brcmsmac module stay configured
when it is loaded and running "make localmodconfig".

ftrace: Fix unregister ftrace\_ops accounting
commit 30fb6aa74011dcf595f306ca2727254d708b786e upstream.
Multiple users of the function tracer can register their functions
with the ftrace\_ops structure. The accounting within ftrace will
update the counter on each function record that is being traced.
When the ftrace\_ops filtering adds or removes functions, the
function records will be updated accordingly if the ftrace\_ops is
still registered.
When a ftrace\_ops is removed, the counter of the function records,
that the ftrace\_ops traces, are decremented. When they reach zero
the functions that they represent are modified to stop calling the
mcount code.
When changes are made, the code is updated via stop\_machine() with
a command passed to the function to tell it what to do. There is an
ENABLE and DISABLE command that tells the called function to enable
or disable the functions. But the ENABLE is really a misnomer as it
should just update the records, as records that have been enabled
and now have a count of zero should be disabled.
The DISABLE command is used to disable all functions regardless of
their counter values. This is the big off switch and is not the
complement of the ENABLE command.
To make matters worse, when a ftrace\_ops is unregistered and there
is another ftrace\_ops registered, neither the DISABLE nor the
ENABLE command are set when calling into the stop\_machine() function
and the records will not be updated to match their counter. A command
is passed to that function that will update the mcount code to call
the registered callback directly if it is the only one left. This
means that the ftrace\_ops that is still registered will have its callback
called by all functions that have been set for it as well as the ftrace\_ops
that was just unregistered.
Here's a way to trigger this bug. Compile the kernel with
CONFIG\_FUNCTION\_PROFILER set and with CONFIG\_FUNCTION\_GRAPH not set:
CONFIG\_FUNCTION\_PROFILER=y
# CONFIG\_FUNCTION\_GRAPH is not set
This will force the function profiler to use the function tracer instead
of the function graph tracer.

The same problem could have happened with the trace\_probe\_ops,
but they are modified with the set\_frace\_filter file which does the
update at closure of the file.
The simple solution is to change ENABLE to UPDATE and call it every
time an ftrace\_ops is unregistered.

Unused iocbs in a batch should not be accounted as active.
commit 69e4747ee9727d660b88d7e1efe0f4afcb35db1b upstream.
Since commit 080d676de095 ("aio: allocate kiocbs in batches") iocbs are
allocated in a batch during processing of first iocbs. All iocbs in a
batch are automatically added to ctx->active\_reqs list and accounted in
ctx->reqs\_active.
If one (not the last one) of iocbs submitted by an user fails, further
iocbs are not processed, but they are still present in ctx->active\_reqs
and accounted in ctx->reqs\_active. This causes process to stuck in a D
state in wait\_for\_all\_aios() on exit since ctx->reqs\_active will never
go down to zero. Furthermore since kiocb\_batch\_free() frees iocb
without removing it from active\_reqs list the list become corrupted
which may cause oops.
Fix this by removing iocb from ctx->active\_reqs and updating
ctx->reqs\_active in kiocb\_batch\_free().

UBIFS: make debugging messages light again

We switch to dynamic debugging in commit
56e46742e846e4de167dde0e1e1071ace1c882a5 but did not take into account that
now we do not control anymore whether a specific message is enabled or not.
So now we lock the "dbg\_lock" and release it in every debugging macro, which
make them not so light-weight.
This commit removes the "dbg\_lock" protection from the debugging macros to
fix the issue.
The downside is that now our DBGKEY() stuff is broken, but this is not
critical at all and will be fixed later.

On x86\_32 casting the unsigned int result of get\_random\_int() to

used 0 to 255 as intended.
The bug was introduced by 675a081 ("x86: unify mmap\_{32|64}.c")

memcg: add mem\_cgroup\_replace\_page\_cache() to fix LRU issue
commit ab936cbcd02072a34b60d268f94440fd5cf1970b upstream.
Commit ef6a3c6311 ("mm: add replace\_page\_cache\_page() function") added a
function replace\_page\_cache\_page(). This function replaces a page in the
radix-tree with a new page. WHen doing this, memory cgroup needs to fix
up the accounting information. memcg need to check PCG\_USED bit etc.
In some(many?) cases, 'newpage' is on LRU before calling
replace\_page\_cache(). So, memcg's LRU accounting information should be
fixed, too.
This patch adds mem\_cgroup\_replace\_page\_cache() and removes the old hooks.
In that function, old pages will be unaccounted without touching
res\_counter and new page will be accounted to the memcg (of old page).
WHen overwriting pc->mem\_cgroup of newpage, take zone->lru\_lock and avoid
races with LRU handling.
Background:
replace\_page\_cache\_page() is called by FUSE code in its splice() handling.
Here, 'newpage' is replacing oldpage but this newpage is not a newly allocated
page and may be on LRU. LRU mis-accounting will be critical for memory cgroup
because rmdir() checks the whole LRU is empty and there is no account leak.
If a page is on the other LRU than it should be, rmdir() will fail.
This bug was added in March 2011, but no bug report yet. I guess there
are not many people who use memcg and FUSE at the same time with upstream
kernels.
The result of this bug is that admin cannot destroy a memcg because of
account leak. So, no panic, no deadlock. And, even if an active cgroup
exist, umount can succseed. So no problem at shutdown.

The commit "ath9k: Fix invalid noisefloor reading due to channel update"
preserves the current channel noisefloor readings before updating
channel type at the same channel index. It is also updating the curchan
pointer. As survey updation is also referring curchan pointer to fetch
the appropriate index, which might leads to invalid memory access. This
patch partially reverts the change and stores the noise floor history
buffer before updating channel type w/o updating curchan.

Before the commit we always check rx->key against NULL, so I assume

Quoting Russell King:
"linux/crash\_dump.h makes no attempt to include asm/elf.h, but it depends
on stuff in asm/elf.h to determine how stuff inside this file is defined
at parse time.
So, if asm/elf.h is included after linux/crash\_dump.h or not at all, you
get a different result from the situation where asm/elf.h is included
before."
So add elf.h header to crash\_dump.h to avoid this problem.

PNP: work around Dell 1536/1546 BIOS MMCONFIG bug that breaks USB
commit eb31aae8cb5eb54e234ed2d857ddac868195d911 upstream.
Some Dell BIOSes have MCFG tables that don't report the entire
MMCONFIG area claimed by the chipset. If we move PCI devices into
that claimed-but-unreported area, they don't work.
This quirk reads the AMD MMCONFIG MSRs and adds PNP0C01 resources as
needed to cover the entire area.
Example problem scenario:
BIOS-e820: 00000000cfec5400 - 00000000d4000000 (reserved)

It is possible current thread migrates right before disabling irqs in

allocation instead of scratching c->freelist.
Many thanks to Zhihua Che for spotting this bug, introduced in 2.6.39

ima: free duplicate measurement memory
commit 45fae7493970d7c45626ccd96d4a74f5f1eea5a9 upstream.
Info about new measurements are cached in the iint for performance. When
the inode is flushed from cache, the associated iint is flushed as well.
Subsequent access to the inode will cause the inode to be re-measured and
will attempt to add a duplicate entry to the measurement list.
This patch frees the duplicate measurement memory, fixing a memory leak.

md/raid1: perform bad-block tests for WriteMostly devices too.
commit 307729c8bc5b5a41361af8af95906eee7552acb1 upstream.
We normally try to avoid reading from write-mostly devices, but when
we do we really have to check for bad blocks and be sure not to
try reading them.
With the current code, best\_good\_sectors might not get set and that
causes zero-length read requests to be send down which is very
confusing.
This bug was introduced in commit d2eb35acfdccbe2 and so the patch
is suitable for 3.1.x and 3.2.x

xen/xenbus: Reject replies with payload > XENSTORE\_PAYLOAD\_MAX.
commit 9e7860cee18241633eddb36a4c34c7b61d8cecbc upstream.
Haogang Chen found out that:
There is a potential integer overflow in process\_msg() that could result
in cross-domain attack.
body = kmalloc(msg->hdr.len + 1, GFP\_NOIO | \_\_GFP\_HIGH);
When a malicious guest passes 0xffffffff in msg->hdr.len, the subsequent
call to xb\_read() would write to a zero-length buffer.
The other end of this connection is always the xenstore backend daemon
so there is no guest (malicious or otherwise) which can do this. The
xenstore daemon is a trusted component in the system.
However this seem like a reasonable robustness improvement so we should
have it.
And Ian when read the API docs found that:
The payload length (len field of the header) is limited to 4096
(XENSTORE\_PAYLOAD\_MAX) in both directions. If a client exceeds the
limit, its xenstored connection will be immediately killed by
xenstored, which is usually catastrophic from the client's point of
view. Clients (particularly domains, which cannot just reconnect)
should avoid this.
so this patch checks against that instead.
This also avoids a potential integer overflow pointed out by Haogang Chen.

SCSI: mpt2sas : Fix for memory allocation error for large host credits
commit aff132d95ffe14eca96cab90597cdd010b457af7 upstream.
The amount of memory required for tracking chain buffers is rather
large, and when the host credit count is big, memory allocation
failure occurs inside \_\_get\_free\_pages.
The fix is to limit the number of chains to 100,000. In addition,
the number of host credits is limited to 30,000 IOs. However this
limitation can be overridden this using the command line option
max\_queue\_depth. The algorithm for calculating the
reply\_post\_queue\_depth is changed so that it is equal to
(reply\_free\_queue\_depth + 16), previously it was (reply\_free\_queue\_depth \* 2).

PCI: msi: Disable msi interrupts when we initialize a pci device
commit a776c491ca5e38c26d9f66923ff574d041e747f4 upstream.
I traced a nasty kexec on panic boot failure to the fact that we had
screaming msi interrupts and we were not disabling the msi messages at
kernel startup. The booting kernel had not enabled those interupts so
was not prepared to handle them.
I can see no reason why we would ever want to leave the msi interrupts
enabled at boot if something else has enabled those interrupts. The pci
spec specifies that msi interrupts should be off by default. Drivers
are expected to enable the msi interrupts if they want to use them. Our
interrupt handling code reprograms the interrupt handlers at boot and
will not be be able to do anything useful with an unexpected interrupt.
This patch applies cleanly all of the way back to 2.6.32 where I noticed
the problem.

nfs: fix regression in handling of context= option in NFSv4
commit 8a0d551a59ac92d8ff048d6cb29d3a02073e81e8 upstream.
Setting the security context of a NFSv4 mount via the context= mount
option is currently broken. The NFSv4 codepath allocates a parsed
options struct, and then parses the mount options to fill it. It
eventually calls nfs4\_remote\_mount which calls security\_init\_mnt\_opts.
That clobbers the lsm\_opts struct that was populated earlier. This bug
also looks like it causes a small memory leak on each v4 mount where
context= is used.
Fix this by moving the initialization of the lsm\_opts into
nfs\_alloc\_parsed\_mount\_data. Also, add a destructor for
nfs\_parsed\_mount\_data to make it easier to free all of the allocations
hanging off of it, and to ensure that the security\_free\_mnt\_opts is
called whenever security\_init\_mnt\_opts is.
I believe this regression was introduced quite some time ago, probably
by commit c02d7adf.

NFSv4: include bitmap in nfsv4 get acl data

Subject: NFS - fix recent breakage to NFS error handling.
commit 02c24a82187d5a628c68edfe71ae60dc135cd178 made a small and
presumably unintended change to write error handling in NFS.
Previously an error from filemap\_write\_and\_wait\_range would only be of
interest if nfs\_file\_fsync did not return an error. After this commit,
an error from filemap\_write\_and\_wait\_range would mean that (the rest of)
nfs\_file\_fsync would not even be called.
This means that:
1/ you are more likely to see EIO than e.g. EDQUOT or ENOSPC.
2/ NFS\_CONTEXT\_ERROR\_WRITE remains set for longer so more writes are
synchronous.
This patch restores previous behaviour.

NFS: Retry mounting NFSROOT
commit 43717c7daebf10b43f12e68512484b3095bb1ba5 upstream.
Lukas Razik  reports that on his SPARC system,
booting with an NFS root file system stopped working after commit
56463e50 "NFS: Use super.c for NFSROOT mount option parsing."
We found that the network switch to which Lukas' client was attached
was delaying access to the LAN after the client's NIC driver reported
that its link was up. The delay was longer than the timeouts used in
the NFS client during mounting.
NFSROOT worked for Lukas before commit 56463e50 because in those
kernels, the client's first operation was an rpcbind request to
determine which port the NFS server was listening on. When that
request failed after a long timeout, the client simply selected the
default NFS port (2049). By that time the switch was allowing access
to the LAN, and the mount succeeded.
Neither of these client behaviors is desirable, so reverting 56463e50
is really not a choice. Instead, introduce a mechanism that retries
the NFSROOT mount request several times. This is the same tactic that
normal user space NFS mounts employ to overcome server and network
delays.

pnfs-obj: Must return layout on IO error
commit fe0fe83585f88346557868a803a479dfaaa0688a upstream.
As mandated by the standard. In case of an IO error, a pNFS
objects layout driver must return it's layout. This is because
all device errors are reported to the server as part of the
layout return buffer.
This is implemented the same way PNFS\_LAYOUTRET\_ON\_SETATTR
is done, through a bit flag on the pnfs\_layoutdriver\_type->flags
member. The flag is set by the layout driver that wants a
layout\_return preformed at pnfs\_ld\_{write,read}\_done in case
of an error.
(Though I have not defined a wrapper like pnfs\_ld\_layoutret\_on\_setattr
because this code is never called outside of pnfs.c and pnfs IO
paths)
Without this patch 3.[0-2] Kernels leak memory and have an annoying
WARN\_ON after every IO error utilizing the pnfs-obj driver.

ALSA: usb-audio - Avoid flood of frame-active debug messages
commit 80c8a2a372599e604b04a9c568952fe39cd1851d upstream.
With some buggy devices, the usb-audio driver may give "frame xxx active"
kernel messages too often. Better to keep it as debug-only using
snd\_printdd(), and also add the rate-limit for avoiding floods.

ext4: fix undefined behavior in ext4\_fill\_flex\_info()
commit d50f2ab6f050311dbf7b8f5501b25f0bf64a439b upstream.
Commit 503358ae01b70ce6909d19dd01287093f6b6271c ("ext4: avoid divide by
zero when trying to mount a corrupted file system") fixes CVE-2009-4307
by performing a sanity check on s\_log\_groups\_per\_flex, since it can be
set to a bogus value by an attacker.
sbi->s\_log\_groups\_per\_flex = sbi->s\_es->s\_log\_groups\_per\_flex;
groups\_per\_flex = 1 << sbi->s\_log\_groups\_per\_flex;
if (groups\_per\_flex < 2) { ... }
This patch fixes two potential issues in the previous commit.
1) The sanity check might only work on architectures like PowerPC.
On x86, 5 bits are used for the shifting amount. That means, given a
large s\_log\_groups\_per\_flex value like 36, groups\_per\_flex = 1 << 36
is essentially 1 << 4 = 16, rather than 0. This will bypass the check,
leaving s\_log\_groups\_per\_flex and groups\_per\_flex inconsistent.
2) The sanity check relies on undefined behavior, i.e., oversized shift.
A standard-confirming C compiler could rewrite the check in unexpected
ways. Consider the following equivalent form, assuming groups\_per\_flex
is unsigned for simplicity.
groups\_per\_flex = 1 << sbi->s\_log\_groups\_per\_flex;
if (groups\_per\_flex == 0 || groups\_per\_flex == 1) {
We compile the code snippet using Clang 3.0 and GCC 4.6. Clang will
completely optimize away the check groups\_per\_flex == 0, leaving the
patched code as vulnerable as the original. GCC keeps the check, but
there is no guarantee that future versions will do the same.

ext4: add missing ext4\_resize\_end on error paths
commit 014a1770371a028d22f364718c805f4216911ecd upstream.
Online resize ioctls 'EXT4\_IOC\_GROUP\_EXTEND' and 'EXT4\_IOC\_GROUP\_ADD'
call ext4\_resize\_begin() to check permissions and to set the
EXT4\_RESIZING bit lock, they do their work and they must finish with
ext4\_resize\_end() which calls clear\_bit\_unlock() to unlock and to
avoid -EBUSY errors for the next resize operations.
This patch adds the missing ext4\_resize\_end() calls on error paths.

commit e74a8f2edb92cb690b467cea0ab652c509e9f624 upstream.
Commit f44f7f96a20a ("RTC: Initialize kernel state from RTC") introduced a
potential infinite loop. If an alarm time contains a wildcard month and
an invalid day (> 31), or a wildcard year and an invalid month (>= 12),
the loop searching for the next matching date will never terminate. Treat
the invalid values as wildcards.

mtd: mtd\_blkdevs: don't increase 'open' count on error path
commit 342ff28f5a2e5aa3236617bd2bddf6c749677ef2 upstream.
Some error paths in mtd\_blkdevs were fixed in the following commit:
commit 94735ec4044a6d318b83ad3c5794e931ed168d10
mtd: mtd\_blkdevs: fix error path in blktrans\_open
But on these error paths, the block device's `dev->open' count is
already incremented before we check for errors. This meant that, while
the error path was handled correctly on the first time through
blktrans\_open(), the device is erroneously considered already open on
the second time through.
This problem can be seen, for instance, when a UBI volume is
simultaneously mounted as a UBIFS partition and read through its
corresponding gluebi mtdblockX device. This results in blktrans\_open()
passing its error checks (with `dev->open > 0') without actually having
a handle on the device. Here's a summarized log of the actions and
results with nandsim:
# modprobe nandsim
# modprobe mtdblock
# modprobe gluebi
# modprobe ubifs
# ubiattach /dev/ubi\_ctrl -m 0
...
# ubimkvol /dev/ubi0 -N test -s 16MiB

mtdoops: fix the oops\_page\_used array size
commit 556f063580db2953a7e53cd46b47724246320f60 upstream.
The array of unsigned long pointed by oops\_page\_used is allocated
by vmalloc which requires the size to be in bytes.
BITS\_PER\_LONG is equal to 32.
If we want to allocate memory for 32 pages with one bit per page then
32 / BITS\_PER\_LONG is equal to 1 byte that is 8 bits.
To fix it we need to multiply the result by sizeof(unsigned long) equal to 4.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

Product Management has  requested further review of this request by Red Hat Engineering, for potential inclusion in a Red Hat Enterprise Linux Update release for currently deployed  products. This request is not yet committed for inclusion in an Update release.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=749117#c8)  Aristeu Rozanski    2012-02-10 19:33:49 UTC  ``` Patch(es) available on kernel-2.6.32-229.el6   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=749117#c12)  Petr Beňas    2012-02-23 09:41:04 UTC  ``` Reproduced in 2.6.32-221.el6.x86_64 and verified in 2.6.32-229.el6.x86_64.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=749117#c14)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-06-20 08:00:14 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.

An update that solves 9 vulnerabilities and has 82 fixes is
now available. It includes one version update.
Description:
The SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 SP2 kernel has been updated to
3.0.26, which fixes a lot of bugs and security issues.
The following security issues have been fixed:
\* CVE-2012-1179: A locking problem in transparent
hugepage support could be used by local attackers to
potentially crash the host, or via kvm a privileged guest
user could crash the kvm host system.
\* CVE-2011-4127: A potential hypervisor escape by
issuing SG\_IO commands to partitiondevices was fixed by
restricting access to these commands.
\* CVE-2012-1146: A local attacker could oops the kernel
using memory control groups and eventfds.
\* CVE-2011-1083: Limit the path length users can build
using epoll() to avoid local attackers consuming lots of
kernel CPU time.
\* CVE-2012-1097: The regset common infrastructure
assumed that regsets would always have .get and .set
methods, but necessarily .active methods. Unfortunately
people have since written regsets without .set method, so
NULL pointer dereference attacks were possible.
\* CVE-2011-2494: Access to the /proc/pid/taskstats file
requires root access to avoid side channel (timing
keypresses etc.) attacks on other users.
\* CVE-2011-4086: Fixed a oops in jbd/jbd2 that could be
caused by specific filesystem access patterns.
\* CVE-2011-4131: A malicious NFSv4 server could have
caused a oops in the nfsv4 acl handling.
\* CVE-2011-4132: Fixed a oops in jbd/jbd2 that could be
caused by mounting a malicious prepared filesystem.
(Also included are all fixes from the 3.0.14 -> 3.0.25
stable kernel updates.)

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=818820#c0)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2012-05-04 05:38:15 UTC  ``` The dl2k driver's rio_ioctl call has a few issues: - No permissions checking - Implements SIOCGMIIREG and SIOCGMIIREG using the SIOCDEVPRIVATE numbers - Has a few ioctls that may have been used for debugging at one point but have no place in the kernel proper.      This patch removes all but the MII ioctls, renumbers them to use the standard ones, and adds the proper permission check for SIOCSMIIREG.      We can also get rid of the dl2k-specific struct mii_data in favor of the generic struct mii_ioctl_data.      Since we have the phyid on hand, we can add the SIOCGMIIPHY ioctl too.    Most of the MII code for the driver could probably be converted to use the generic MII library but I don't have a device to test the results.

## Synopsis

Moderate: kernel security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A1541)

## Topic

Updated kernel packages that fix two security issues and several bugs are
now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.2 Extended Update Support.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

These packages contain the Linux kernel.

Security fixes:

* A malicious NFSv4 server could return a crafted reply to a GETACL

request, causing a denial of service on the client. (CVE-2011-4131,
Moderate)

* A flaw in the dl2k driver could allow a local, unprivileged user to issue

potentially harmful IOCTLs, possibly causing Ethernet adapters using the
driver to malfunction (such as losing network connectivity).
(CVE-2012-2313, Low)

Red Hat would like to thank Andy Adamson for reporting CVE-2011-4131, and
Stephan Mueller for reporting CVE-2012-2313.

Bug fixes:

* A kernel oops occurred in the nf\_nat code when a bogus pointer was

dereferenced in the nf\_conn\_nat structure. Consequently, if Source Network
Address Translation (SNAT) was performed, incorrect information could be
received by other CTS (Clear to Send) signals. A conntrack entry is now
placed in the source hash after SNAT has been completed, which prevents the
described problems. (BZ#865715)

* Previously, the ixgbe\_setup\_tc() function was called recursively when the

set\_state() CEE (Convergence Enhanced Ethernet) API routine was called in
IEEE DCBX (Data Center Bridging eXchange) mode. This is considered unsafe
according to the IEEE standards. With this update, the ixgbe driver has
been modified to no longer call the set\_state() routine in IEEE DCBX mode.
The driver now calls routines of the PFC (Priority-based Flow Control) and
ETS (Enhanced Transmission Selection) extensions instead of the CEE
extension routines in IEEE DCBX mode. (BZ#867859)

* A Symmetric Multi Processing (SMP) race condition between the munmap()

and exit() function could lead to false-positive triggering of the BUG\_ON()
macro if Transparent Huge Pages (THP) were enabled. This update fixes the
race condition, which avoids false-positive triggering of the BUG\_ON()
macro in this scenario. (BZ#875121)

* The kernel allows high priority real time tasks, such as tasks scheduled

with the SCHED\_FIFO policy, to be throttled. Previously, the CPU stop tasks
were scheduled as high priority real time tasks and could be thus throttled
accordingly. However, the replenishment timer, which is responsible for
clearing a throttle flag on tasks, could be pending on the just disabled
CPU. This could lead to the situation that the throttled tasks were never
scheduled to run. Consequently, if any of such tasks was needed to complete
the CPU disabling, the system became unresponsive. This update introduces a
new scheduler class, which gives a task the highest possible system
priority and such a task cannot be throttled. The stop-task scheduling
class is now used for the CPU stop tasks, and the system shutdown completes
as expected in the scenario described. (BZ#876078)

* Previously, XFS log buffers were handled incorrectly so that XFS could,

in certain circumstances, incorrectly read metadata from the journal during
XFS log recovery. As a consequence, XFS log recovery terminated with an
error message and prevented the file system from being mounted. This
problem could result in a loss of data if the user forcibly emptied the log
to allow the file system to be mounted. This update ensures that metadata
is read correctly from the log and journal recovery thus completes
successfully, and the file system mounts as expected. (BZ#876498)

* Previously, kernel was allowed to reduce the number of unnecessary commit

calls by skipping the commit when there was a large number of outstanding
pages being written. However, a test on the number of commits (ncommit) did
not properly handle the edge case when ncommit was zero. Consequently,
inodes sometimes remained on the sb->s\_dirty list and could not be freed by
the inode cache shrinker. As a result, the nfs\_inode\_cache structure grew
very large over time. With this update, the call to the nfs\_write\_inode()
function is immediately returned when commit == 0, thus fixing this bug.
(BZ#877394)

## Solution

Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported
patches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for this
update to take effect.

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>

To install kernel packages manually, use "rpm -ivh [package]". Do not
use "rpm -Uvh" as that will remove the running kernel binaries from
your system. You may use "rpm -e" to remove old kernels after
determining that the new kernel functions properly on your system.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

## Synopsis

Moderate: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 kernel security, bug fix and enhancement update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A0862)

## Topic

Updated kernel packages that fix two security issues, address several
hundred bugs and add numerous enhancements are now available as part of the
ongoing support and maintenance of Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 6. This
is the third regular update.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

This update fixes the following security issues:

* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's Event Poll (epoll)

subsystem handled large, nested epoll structures. A local, unprivileged
user could use this flaw to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2011-1083,
Moderate)

* A malicious Network File System version 4 (NFSv4) server could return a

crafted reply to a GETACL request, causing a denial of service on the
client. (CVE-2011-4131, Moderate)

Red Hat would like to thank Nelson Elhage for reporting CVE-2011-1083, and
Andy Adamson for reporting CVE-2011-4131.

This update also fixes several hundred bugs and adds enhancements. Refer to
the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.3 Release Notes for information on the most
significant of these changes, and the Technical Notes for further
information, both linked to in the References.

All Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 users are advised to install these updated
packages, which correct these issues, and fix the bugs and add the
enhancements noted in the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.3 Release Notes and
Technical Notes. The system must be rebooted for this update to take
effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>

To install kernel packages manually, use "rpm -ivh [package]". Do not
use "rpm -Uvh" as that will remove the running kernel binaries from
your system. You may use "rpm -e" to remove old kernels after
determining that the new kernel functions properly on your system.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=747106#c0)  Petr Matousek    2011-10-18 20:18:37 UTC  ``` nfs4_getfacl decoding causes a kernel Oops when a server returns more than 2 GETATTR bitmap words in response to the FATTR4_ACL attribute request.  While the NFS client only asks for one attribute (FATTR4_ACL) in the first bitmap word, the NFSv4 protocol allows for the server to return unbounded bitmaps.  Upstream commit: e5012d1f3861d18c7f3814e757c1c3ab3741dbcd - incomplete, handles only the case when 2 words are expected and 3 are returned  Proposed complete upstream patch: <http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-nfs/msg25288.html>  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Andy Adamson for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=747106#c7)  Petr Matousek    2011-11-11 16:37:42 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue does not affect the Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 as it does not provide support for NFS ACLs. This issue does not affect the Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5. This has been addressed in Red Hat Enterprise MRG via <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0333.html>. Future kernel updates in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 may address this issue.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=747106#c8)  Petr Matousek    2011-11-11 16:57:58 UTC  ``` Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 753236](show_bug.cgi?id=753236 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2011-4131 kernel: nfs4_getfacl decoding kernel oops [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=747106#c9)  Jeff Layton    2011-11-22 15:16:28 UTC  ``` At this point, I'm waiting to see if Trond plans to take the patch.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

NFSv4: include bitmap in nfsv4 get acl data

```
The NFSv4 bitmap size is unbounded: a server can return an arbitrary
sized bitmap in an FATTR4_WORD0_ACL request.  Replace using the
nfs4_fattr_bitmap_maxsz as a guess to the maximum bitmask returned by a server
with the inclusion of the bitmap (xdr length plus bitmasks) and the acl data
xdr length to the (cached) acl page data.

This is a general solution to commit [e5012d1](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/e5012d1f3861d18c7f3814e757c1c3ab3741dbcd) "NFSv4.1: update
nfs4_fattr_bitmap_maxsz" and fixes hitting a BUG_ON in xdr_shrink_bufhead
when getting ACLs.

Fix a bug in decode_getacl that returned -EINVAL on ACLs > page when getxattr
was called with a NULL buffer, preventing ACL > PAGE_SIZE from being retrieved.
