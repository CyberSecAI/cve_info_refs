Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-4957:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `make_clickable()` function in `wp-includes/formatting.php` does not properly check the URL length in comments before passing it to the PCRE (Perl Compatible Regular Expressions) library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unbounded URL Length:** The function fails to limit the length of URLs it processes.
- **PCRE Crash:** By providing an extremely long URL, the regex processing within the PCRE library can be triggered to crash due to excessive backtracking or recursion. This can lead to a denial-of-service condition.
- **Regex complexity:** The regex used by `make_clickable` is complex and can lead to performance issues, especially when handling long or complex strings.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  A successful exploit leads to a crash of the PHP process handling the request. This will make the WordPress site unresponsive to users, resulting in a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Comment Input:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing a comment containing an extremely long URL.
- **User Controlled Input:** The attacker can craft a malicious comment with a very long URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to post comments or input that is processed by the `make_clickable()` function. This could be via comments on a blog post or other areas where user-provided text is automatically converted into clickable links by WordPress.
- No special privilege is needed to exploit the vulnerability, just the ability to submit user-controlled input.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue was resolved by a combination of:
   - Limiting the length of the URL that the function tries to make clickable.
   - Improving the efficiency of the regular expression.
   - Simplifying the regular expression used in the `make_clickable()` function.
   - Introducing a workaround to prevent PHP from crashing by reducing the PCRE's recursion limit and falling back to the original string when the regex fails.
   - Breaking long inputs into chunks by splitting at whitespace characters and skipping the chunks that can't be split
- Patches to address this vulnerability were included in WordPress version 3.1.1, 3.3.2.
- The original regex was identified as the cause of the issue:
 `preg_replace_callback('#(?<!=[\'"])(?<=[*\')+.,;:!&$\s>])(\()?([\w]+?://(?:[\w\\x80-\\xff\#%~/?@\[\]-]|[\'*(+.,;:!=&$](?![\b\)]|(\))?([\s]|$))|(?(1)\)(?![\s<.,;:]|$)|\)))+)#is', '_make_url_clickable_cb', $ret);`
