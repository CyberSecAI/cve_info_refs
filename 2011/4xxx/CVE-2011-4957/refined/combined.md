Please check if you have the required php module available, e.g. pcre.

FYI: I've tested your snippet on php 5.3.5 an this works w/o any segfault for me.

Yes I do have PCRE enabled :)

WordPress wouldn't work very well otherwise

I asked because of this message:

```
/usr/local/src/php-5.3.5/ext/pcre/pcrelib/pcre_exec.c: No such file or directory.

```

Looks like your PHP version is missing the PCRE library.

As it does not segfault for me with the same PHP version of which mine is officially distributed by PHP.net I assume that you're facing a configuration issue on your server.

I tend to close this ticket as worksforme.

Pleae ensure that you've properly compiled PHP with all needed libraries, especially with the ones needed for the PCRE extension.

Does the following script segfaults on that said system?

```
<?php
// The "i" after the pattern delimiter indicates a case-insensitive search
if (preg_match("/php/i", "PHP is the web scripting language of choice.")) {
    echo "A match was found.";
} else {
    echo "A match was not found.";
}
?>

```

Nope - that is just GDB mentioning that I don't have the source code on this box.

No segfault - works fine and finds a match.

The segfault only occurs when you have enough of the urls in the comment for it to trigger - reduce the number of urls and the segfault goes away.

> The segfault only occurs when you have enough of the urls in the comment for it to trigger - reduce the number of urls and the segfault goes away.

Then you're triggering some boundary on your system most probably. PHP should do an error instead I think.

I don't have this problem with your script, when I `make_clickable($comment.$comment);` (double the comment), I get a internal server error.

Looks like that this is PHP error (triggered by an error in libpcre).

Have you reported this upstream for PHP pcre / libpcre?

As I can now reproduce the problem, I could further drill it down to the following line:

`preg_replace_callback('#(?<!=[\'"])(?<=[*\')+.,;:!&$\s>])(\()?([\w]+?://(?:[\w\\x80-\\xff\#%~/?@\[\]-]|[\'*(+.,;:!=&$](?![\b\)]|(\))?([\s]|$))|(?(1)\)(?![\s<.,;:]|$)|\)))+)#is', '_make_url_clickable_cb', $ret);`

I did modify the testscript now. This version enables a tester to modify the number of URL repetitions to deal with.

On my testbed, I have this properly running until 255 repetitions. With 256 (as uploaded), the script dies.

Help the Regex Compiler

### [#11](#comment:11) [@hakre](https://profiles.wordpress.org/hakre) [14 years](/timeline?from=2011-03-19T14%3A51%3A41Z&precision=second "See timeline at 03/19/2011 02:51:41 PM") ago

I think you've found a bug here, but I smell it not being a WordPress bug because it's just using the preg\_replace\_callback() as documented.

So instead of segfaulting, PHP should give some error.

But it is segfaulting, I assume that this is related to the pcre library code, so this should be reported upstream.

Obviously this is triggering an edge case. It contains a link that will be larger than 10 000 characters, which would not violate HTTP but is very uncommon (see [​#10483](http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/10483#comment:15)).

There is a usefull limit of 255 characters for URLs, the next usefull limit is 2000 characters.

I could extend from 255 to 2 090 (!) by the changes in the patch. This allows me to pass a string of about 85 690 chars into `make_clickable()`. 2 091 will again let the script die.

It does not make much of a difference btw to change to `{1,255}`, so I opted for the longer limit.

Spaces between URLs will prevent the dying. This is really an edge-case.

pcre.recursion\_limit settings workaround

I found out that you can prevent PHP from segfaulting by reducing the PCRE's recursion limit, e.g. `ini_set('pcre.recursion_limit', 1000);` (default is 100 000, for me the highest non-crashing is 20 903 with the patch applied and an URL repetition count of 2 091). This will prevent PHP from segfaulting and `make make_clickable()` return an empty string.

> PCRE's recursion limit. Please note that if you set this value to a high number you may consume all the available process stack and eventually crash PHP (due to reaching the stack size limit imposed by the Operating System).

from: [​PCRE Configuration Options](http://php.net/manual/en/pcre.configuration.php)

The provided patch just reduces the limit to 10 000 (a tenth of the default value), executes the regex. If it fails, it falls back to the original string, on success will take over the one with the replacements.

The latest patch did extend the amount of text that is made clickable by improving the regex as previously.

It's an increase from 122 repetitions / 5 002 character long string up to 999 repetitions / 40 959 characters.

Anyway, the callback should probably not create links from URLs that exceed a certain size (e.g. 2000 characters).

With the current code, an input of sufficient length can still cause segfaults. Increasing the length required before an input will cause a segfault doesn't solve the problem.

Attached:

1. Fixes the ~2000 character limit for auto linking URLs.
2. Improves the efficiency of the regex.
3. Simplifies the regex.
4. Passes all tests in `php wp-test.php -t TestMakeClickable`
5. Is 10-20% faster on "typical" inputs with no or sparse links.
6. Is 10-20% faster on "atypical" inputs with very dense links.
7. Is ~80% faster on malicious inputs that the current code can handle.
8. Does not segfault on malicious inputs on which the current code segfaults.

The ~2000 character limit is imposed in two parts. First, if the input is larger than 10000 characters (~1500 english words), the input is broken up into chunks by splitting it at whitespace characters. Chunks that can't be split (i.e. chunks with no whitespace) are skipped so that the regex doesn't have to process them. Second, the URL's total length is limited by the regex.

I'm sure there are some edge cases that this patch treats differently than the current code. I'm not sure if those edge case come up "naturally". If they do, I'm not sure if they have well defined expected behaviors.

Needs testing, especially with non-ASCII and multibyte inputs.

A URL following punctuation without a space (likely due to a typo) is one situation that the current function allows for, but the patch does not.

```
Comma, no space, URL,http://example.com/.

```

We might want to add some more punctuation to the character class in the first subgroup to accommodate for this.

Sounds like a good idea.

I think the lack of space in this test case is probably a quite common occurrence in comments typed in haste.

```

```

in `_make_url_clickable_cb()` looks wrong, as a "(" as the first character (i.e. position 0) would be returned as falsy.

If this is by design, `strpos( $url, '(' ) > 0` would be clearer, or if we want to recognize "(" as the first character, this needs to be `false === strpos( $url, '(' )`.

Since "(" cannot be the first character of `$url` I don't think this matters. However, I'm not against `false !== strpos( $url, '(' )` to be explicit.

Any objection to including a closing bracket `>` in the the "# 1: Leading whitespace, or punctuation" check at the beginning of the lookup?

This change breaks themes like P2 that filter post content late, after wpautop runs, so it needs to match strings like `<p>http://wordpress.org/</p>`.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Two issues in 3.1.1 are without 2011 CVE-identifiers, which are announced in here: <http://wordpress.org/news/2011/04/wordpress-3-1-1/> (April 5, 2011).

Issue #1:

<http://osvdb.org/show/osvdb/72141>
<http://secunia.com/advisories/44038/>

"Certain unspecified input is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site."

Issue #2:

<http://osvdb.org/show/osvdb/72142>
<http://secunia.com/advisories/44038/>

"The "make_clickable()" function in wp-includes/formatting.php does not properly check the URL length in comments before passing it to the PCRE library, which can be exploited to cause a crash."

Both vulnerabilities are reported in versions prior to 3.1.1.

Debian Bug     : 670124

Several vulnerabilities were identified in Wordpress, a web blogging
tool.  As the CVEs were allocated from releases announcements and
specific fixes are usually not identified, it has been decided to
upgrade the Wordpress package to the latest upstream version instead
of backporting the patches.

This means extra care should be taken when upgrading, especially when
using third-party plugins or themes, since compatibility may have been
impacted along the way.  We recommend that users check their install
before doing the upgrade.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), those problems have been fixed in
version 3.3.2+dfsg-1~squeeze1.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), those problems have been fixed in version 3.3.2+dfsg-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your wordpress packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

# WordPress 3.1.1

---

[WordPress 3.1.1](https://wordpress.org/download/) is now available. This maintenance and security release fixes [almost thirty issues](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&resolution=fixed&milestone=3.1.1&group=resolution&order=priority "Bugs fixed in 3.1.1") in 3.1, including:

* Some security hardening to media uploads
* Performance improvements
* Fixes for IIS6 support
* Fixes for taxonomy and PATHINFO (/index.php/) permalinks
* Fixes for various query and taxonomy edge cases that caused some plugin compatibility issues

Version 3.1.1 also addresses three security issues discovered by WordPress core developers [Jon Cave](http://joncave.co.uk/) and [Peter Westwood](http://blog.ftwr.co.uk/), of our security team. The first hardens CSRF prevention in the media uploader. The second avoids a PHP crash in certain environments when handling devilishly devised links in comments, and the third addresses an XSS flaw.

We suggest you update to 3.1.1 promptly. [Download 3.1.1](https://wordpress.org/download/) or update automatically from the Dashboard → Updates menu in your site’s admin area.

Our release haiku:

Only the geeks know

What half this stuff even means
