Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2011-4807:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The PHP Photo Album application has multiple vulnerabilities due to insecure handling of user-supplied input in the `main.php` file.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to XSS attacks via the `imageview` and `albumnew` commands when processing the `var1` and `keyword` parameters.
    *   **Local File Disclosure (LFD):** The application is susceptible to local file disclosure via the `image` and `themeimage` commands using the `var1` parameter. This allows an attacker to view the source code of PHP files.
    *   **PHP Code Injection:** The application is vulnerable to PHP code injection via `cmd=phpinfo` and `cmd=setquality` using the `var1` parameter.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **XSS:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, or phishing attacks.
    *   **LFD:** An attacker can potentially gain sensitive information by reading arbitrary files on the server, including application source code and configuration files.
    *    **PHP Code Injection:** An attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   XSS: By crafting malicious URLs with specific parameters (`cmd=imageview&var1=[XSS]` and `cmd=albumnew&keyword=[XSS]`) and tricking users into clicking on them.
    *   LFD: By crafting malicious URLs with specific parameters (`cmd=image&var1=[LFD]` and `cmd=themeimage&var1=[LFD]`).
    *   PHP Code Injection: By crafting malicious URLs with specific parameters (`cmd=phpinfo` and `cmd=setquality&var1=[PHP Code Injection]`).
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server. No special access or privileges are needed.

**Additional Details:**

*   The exploit details provide specific vulnerable parameters and example URLs, allowing for more precise exploitation.
*   The document lists multiple security researchers credited with discovering the vulnerabilities.
*   The timeline shows the discovery and disclosure process.
*   The vulnerability affects PHP Photo Album version 0.4.1.16 and possibly earlier versions.
