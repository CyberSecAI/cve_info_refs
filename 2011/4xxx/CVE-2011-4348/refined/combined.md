sctp: Fix another socket race during accept/peeloff

```
There is a race between sctp_rcv() and sctp_accept() where we
have moved the association from the listening socket to the
accepted socket, but sctp_rcv() processing cached the old
socket and continues to use it.

The easy solution is to check for the socket mismatch once we've
grabed the socket lock.  If we hit a mis-match, that means
that were are currently holding the lock on the listening socket,
but the association is refrencing a newly accepted socket.  We need
to drop the lock on the old socket and grab the lock on the new one.

A more proper solution might be to create accepted sockets when
the new association is established, similar to TCP.  That would
eliminate the race for 1-to-1 style sockets, but it would still
existing for 1-to-many sockets where a user wished to peeloff an
association.  For now, we'll live with this easy solution as
it addresses the problem.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via

Subject: CVE-2011-4348 kernel: incomplete fix for CVE-2011-2482

When testing [CVE-2011-2482] with SELinux disabled (haven't triggered
panic on patched kernel with selinux on), the reproducer run after
regular user causes soft lookups and the machine becomes completely
unresponsive on patched kernel. Target machine was unresponsive after
remote part of reproducer (con) killed. Target with patched kernel
needed to be rebooted to start working regularly.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=757143#c0)  Petr Matousek    2011-11-25 15:14:02 UTC  ``` When testing [[CVE-2011-2482](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-2482)] with SELinux disabled (haven't triggered panic on patched kernel with selinux on), the reproducer run after regular user causes soft lookups and the machine becomes completely unresponsive on patched kernel. Target machine was unresponsive after remote part of reproducer (con) killed. Target with patched kernel needed to be rebooted to start working regularly.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=757143#c0)  Petr Matousek    2011-11-25 15:14:02 UTC  ``` When testing [[CVE-2011-2482](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-2482)] with SELinux disabled (haven't triggered panic on patched kernel with selinux on), the reproducer run after regular user causes soft lookups and the machine becomes completely unresponsive on patched kernel. Target machine was unresponsive after remote part of reproducer (con) killed. Target with patched kernel needed to be rebooted to start working regularly.
