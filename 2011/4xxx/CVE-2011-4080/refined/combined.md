sysctl: restrict write access to dmesg\_restrict

[Browse files](/torvalds/linux/tree/bfdc0b497faa82a0ba2f9dddcf109231dd519fcc)
Browse the repository at this point in the history

```
When dmesg_restrict is set to 1 CAP_SYS_ADMIN is needed to read the kernel
ring buffer.  But a root user without CAP_SYS_ADMIN is able to reset
dmesg_restrict to 0.

This is an issue when e.g.  LXC (Linux Containers) are used and complete
user space is running without CAP_SYS_ADMIN.  A unprivileged and jailed
root user can bypass the dmesg_restrict protection.

With this patch writing to dmesg_restrict is only allowed when root has
CAP_SYS_ADMIN.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).
