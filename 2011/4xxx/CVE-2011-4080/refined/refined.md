Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2011-4080:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the insufficient restrictions on writing to the `dmesg_restrict` sysctl. When `dmesg_restrict` is set to 1, reading the kernel ring buffer requires `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` capability. However, a root user without `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` was able to reset `dmesg_restrict` to 0.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Access Control:**  The core issue is that the ability to modify `dmesg_restrict` was not properly restricted, allowing a root user without the `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` capability to bypass intended security restrictions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** By resetting `dmesg_restrict` to 0, a non-privileged root user can access the kernel ring buffer (dmesg). This buffer may contain sensitive information, potentially leading to information disclosure.
*   **Bypassing Intended Security:** The `dmesg_restrict` setting was designed to protect the kernel ring buffer from unauthorized access, especially in containerized environments. This vulnerability allowed a containerized root user to bypass this protection.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack vector is local, requiring the attacker to have root access on the system.
*   **Sysctl Modification:** The vulnerability is exploited by writing to the `dmesg_restrict` sysctl.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Root Privileges (without CAP_SYS_ADMIN):** The attacker must be logged in as a root user, but crucially, *not* have the `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` capability.  This would typically be the case in a containerized environment where root privileges are confined.
*   **Access to Sysctl Interface:** The attacker requires the ability to interact with the Linux sysctl interface.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided commit message (`bfdc0b497faa82a0ba2f9dddcf109231dd519fcc`) from the Linux kernel repository is a patch that addresses the issue by restricting write access to `dmesg_restrict` to only those root users that have the `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` capability.
*   The vulnerability was introduced by commit `eaf06b241b091357e72b76863ba16e89610d31bd`.
*   The context mentions that this is an issue in container environments, such as LXC.
