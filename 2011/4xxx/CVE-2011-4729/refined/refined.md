The provided content indicates that CVE-2011-4729 is one of several vulnerabilities (along with CVE-2011-4725, CVE-2011-4726, CVE-2011-4727, CVE-2011-4728, CVE-2011-4730, CVE-2011-4731, CVE-2011-4732, and CVE-2011-4733) found in Plesk Parallels Panel version psa v10.2.0_build1011110331.18 on RedHat el6.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability**: The root cause is not specified beyond a general classification of XSS and other injection vulnerabilities. The content mentions CWE-79 (Cross-Site Scripting) and CWE-89 (SQL Injection), but does not tie them to specific CVEs.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**: The content identifies Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL Injection vulnerabilities. It also mentions "other injection vulnerabilities" and the possibility of a DoS (Denial of Service) attack.
*   **Impact of Exploitation**: Exploitation can lead to various attacks, including XSS, and potentially DoS. The text also suggests other types of exploits are possible given the "other injection vulnerabilities."
*   **Attack Vectors**: The attack vectors are through the Plesk Parallels Control Panel itself, specifically through the web interface. A user with "least-privs" can be used to exploit the vulnerabilities.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**: The attacker needs to be a logged-in user of the Plesk Control Panel, even with minimal privileges.

The report mentions the vulnerabilities were initially reported to Plesk in October 2010 and to CERT in April 2011, and remained unpatched in the current release.

The content provides more detail than the basic CVE description placeholder, by identifying specific vulnerability types (XSS, SQLi) and impact.
