| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=771775#c0)  Vincent Danen    2012-01-04 22:38:53 UTC  ``` Uninitialized SSL 3.0 Padding ([CVE-2011-4576](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-4576)) =============================================  OpenSSL prior to 1.0.0f and 0.9.8s failed to clear the bytes used as block cipher padding in SSL 3.0 records. This affects both clients and servers that accept SSL 3.0 handshakes: those that call SSL_CTX_new with SSLv3_{server|client}_method or SSLv23_{server|client}_method. It does not affect TLS.  As a result, in each record, up to 15 bytes of uninitialized memory may be sent, encrypted, to the SSL peer. This could include sensitive contents of previously freed memory.  However, in practice, most deployments do not use SSL_MODE_RELEASE_BUFFERS and therefore have a single write buffer per connection. That write buffer is partially filled with non-sensitive, handshake data at the beginning of the connection and, thereafter, only records which are longer any any previously sent record leak any non-encrypted data. This, combined with the small number of bytes leaked per record, serves to limit to severity of this issue.  Thanks to Adam Langley <agl> for identifying and fixing this issue.  Affected users should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.0.0f or 0.9.8s.

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2013-0990 : Ward van Wanrooij

* **Note**: Starting with OS X v10.8.4, Java Web Start (i.e., JNLP) applications downloaded from the Internet need to be signed with a Developer ID certificate. Gatekeeper will check downloaded Java Web Start applications for a signature and block such applications from launching if they are not properly signed.

  You can use the codesign utility to sign the JNLP file, which will attach the code signature to the JNLP file as extended attributes. To preserve these attributes, package the JNLP file in a ZIP, XIP, or DMG file. Be careful using the ZIP format, as some third-party tools might not capture the required extended attributes correctly.

The bug does not occur  unless this flag is set. Users of OpenSSL 1.0.0 are not affected.  This flaw was discovered by Ben Laurie and a fix provided by Emilia Kasper <ekasper> of Google.  Affected users should upgrade to OpenSSL 0.9.8s.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

RHSA-2012:1306 - Security Advisory

Issued:
2012-09-24
Updated:
2012-09-24
# RHSA-2012:1306 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: openssl security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

An update for the OpenSSL component for JBoss Enterprise Web Server 1.0.2
for Solaris and Microsoft Windows that fixes multiple security issues is
now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3)
and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols, as well as a
full-strength, general purpose cryptography library.

Multiple numeric conversion errors, leading to a buffer overflow, were
found in the way OpenSSL parsed ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation One) data
from BIO (OpenSSL's I/O abstraction) inputs. Specially-crafted DER
(Distinguished Encoding Rules) encoded data read from a file or other BIO
input could cause an application using the OpenSSL library to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2012-2110)

A double free flaw was discovered in the policy checking code in OpenSSL.
A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash an application that uses
OpenSSL by providing an X.509 certificate that has specially-crafted
policy extension data. (CVE-2011-4109)

An information leak flaw was found in the SSL 3.0 protocol implementation
in OpenSSL. Incorrect initialization of SSL record padding bytes could
cause an SSL client or server to send a limited amount of possibly
sensitive data to its SSL peer via the encrypted connection.
(CVE-2011-4576)

It was discovered that OpenSSL did not limit the number of TLS/SSL
handshake restarts required to support Server Gated Cryptography. A remote
attacker could use this flaw to make a TLS/SSL server using OpenSSL consume
an excessive amount of CPU by continuously restarting the handshake.
(CVE-2011-4619)

This update also fixes additional security issues in OpenSSL that are not
exposed in JBoss Enterprise Web Server: CVE-2011-4108, CVE-2012-0884,
CVE-2012-1165, and CVE-2012-2333.

Warning: Before applying the update, back up your existing JBoss Enterprise
Web Server installation (including all applications and configuration
files).

All users of JBoss Enterprise Web Server 1.0.2 for Solaris and Microsoft
Windows as provided from the Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply
this update.

## Solution

The References section of this erratum contains a download link (you must
log in to download the update). Before applying the update, back up your
existing JBoss Enterprise Web Server installation (including all
applications and configuration files).

The Apache HTTP Server must be restarted for this update to take effect.

                 CVE-2011-4576 CVE-2011-4619

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in OpenSSL, an implementation
of TLS and related protocols.  The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following vulnerabilities:

CVE-2011-4108
	The DTLS implementation performs a MAC check only if certain
	padding is valid, which makes it easier for remote attackers
	to recover plaintext via a padding oracle attack.

CVE-2011-4109
	A double free vulnerability when X509_V_FLAG_POLICY_CHECK is
	enabled, allows remote attackers to cause applications crashes
	and potentially allow execution of arbitrary code by
	triggering failure of a policy check.

CVE-2011-4354
	On 32-bit systems, the operations on NIST elliptic curves
	P-256 and P-384 are not correctly implemented, potentially
	leaking the private ECC key of a TLS server.  (Regular
	RSA-based keys are not affected by this vulnerability.)

CVE-2011-4576
	The SSL 3.0 implementation does not properly initialize data
	structures for block cipher padding, which might allow remote
	attackers to obtain sensitive information by decrypting the
	padding data sent by an SSL peer.

CVE-2011-4619
	The Server Gated Cryptography (SGC) implementation in OpenSSL
	does not properly handle handshake restarts, unnecessarily
	simplifying CPU exhaustion attacks.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed
in version 0.9.8g-15+lenny15.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 0.9.8o-4squeeze5.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 1.0.0f-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your openssl packages.

# RHSA-2012:1307 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: openssl security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

An update for the OpenSSL component for JBoss Enterprise Application
Platform 5.1.2 for Solaris and Microsoft Windows that fixes multiple
security issues is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3)
and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols, as well as a
full-strength, general purpose cryptography library.

Multiple numeric conversion errors, leading to a buffer overflow, were
found in the way OpenSSL parsed ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation One) data
from BIO (OpenSSL's I/O abstraction) inputs. Specially-crafted DER
(Distinguished Encoding Rules) encoded data read from a file or other BIO
input could cause an application using the OpenSSL library to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2012-2110)

A double free flaw was discovered in the policy checking code in OpenSSL.
A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash an application that uses
OpenSSL by providing an X.509 certificate that has specially-crafted
policy extension data. (CVE-2011-4109)

An information leak flaw was found in the SSL 3.0 protocol implementation
in OpenSSL. Incorrect initialization of SSL record padding bytes could
cause an SSL client or server to send a limited amount of possibly
sensitive data to its SSL peer via the encrypted connection.
(CVE-2011-4576)

It was discovered that OpenSSL did not limit the number of TLS/SSL
handshake restarts required to support Server Gated Cryptography. A remote
attacker could use this flaw to make a TLS/SSL server using OpenSSL consume
an excessive amount of CPU by continuously restarting the handshake.
(CVE-2011-4619)

This update also fixes additional security issues in OpenSSL that are not
exposed in JBoss Enterprise Application Platform: CVE-2011-4108,
CVE-2012-0884, CVE-2012-1165, and CVE-2012-2333.

Warning: Before applying this update, back up your JBoss Enterprise
Application Platform's "server/[PROFILE]/deploy/" directory, along with all
other customized configuration files.

All users of JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.1.2 for Solaris and
Microsoft Windows as provided from the Red Hat Customer Portal are advised
to apply this update.

## Solution

The References section of this erratum contains a download link (you must
log in to download the update). Before applying the update, back up your
existing JBoss Enterprise Application Platform installation (including all
applications and configuration files).

JBoss server instances configured to use the Tomcat Native library must be
restarted for this update to take effect.

# RHSA-2012:1308 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: openssl security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

An update for the OpenSSL component for JBoss Enterprise Application
Platform 6.0.0 for Solaris and Microsoft Windows that fixes multiple
security issues is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3)
and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols, as well as a
full-strength, general purpose cryptography library.

Multiple numeric conversion errors, leading to a buffer overflow, were
found in the way OpenSSL parsed ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation One) data
from BIO (OpenSSL's I/O abstraction) inputs. Specially-crafted DER
(Distinguished Encoding Rules) encoded data read from a file or other BIO
input could cause an application using the OpenSSL library to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2012-2110)

A double free flaw was discovered in the policy checking code in OpenSSL.
A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash an application that uses
OpenSSL by providing an X.509 certificate that has specially-crafted
policy extension data. (CVE-2011-4109)

An information leak flaw was found in the SSL 3.0 protocol implementation
in OpenSSL. Incorrect initialization of SSL record padding bytes could
cause an SSL client or server to send a limited amount of possibly
sensitive data to its SSL peer via the encrypted connection.
(CVE-2011-4576)

It was discovered that OpenSSL did not limit the number of TLS/SSL
handshake restarts required to support Server Gated Cryptography. A remote
attacker could use this flaw to make a TLS/SSL server using OpenSSL consume
an excessive amount of CPU by continuously restarting the handshake.
(CVE-2011-4619)

This update also fixes additional security issues in OpenSSL that are not
exposed in JBoss Enterprise Application Platform: CVE-2011-4108,
CVE-2012-0884, CVE-2012-1165, and CVE-2012-2333.

Warning: Before applying this update, back up your existing JBoss
Enterprise Application Platform installation and deployed applications, and
also back up your existing Apache HTTP Server installation (including all
applications and configuration files).

All users of JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.0.0 for Solaris and
Microsoft Windows as provided from the Red Hat Customer Portal are advised
to apply this update.

## Solution

The References section of this erratum contains a download link (you must
log in to download the update). Before applying the update, back up your
existing JBoss Enterprise Application Platform installation and deployed
applications, and also back up your existing Apache HTTP Server
installation (including all applications and configuration files).

The Apache HTTP Server, as well as JBoss server instances configured to use
the Tomcat Native library, must be restarted for this update to take
effect.
