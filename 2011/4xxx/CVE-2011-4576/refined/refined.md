{
  "cve": "CVE-2011-4576",
  "description": "OpenSSL prior to 1.0.0f and 0.9.8s failed to clear the bytes used as block cipher padding in SSL 3.0 records. This affects both clients and servers that accept SSL 3.0 handshakes: those that call SSL_CTX_new with SSLv3_{server|client}_method or SSLv23_{server|client}_method. It does not affect TLS. As a result, in each record, up to 15 bytes of uninitialized memory may be sent, encrypted, to the SSL peer. This could include sensitive contents of previously freed memory.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises from the failure to clear the padding bytes used in SSL 3.0 records before encryption.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uninitialized memory usage",
      "Information disclosure"
    ],
    "impact": "Up to 15 bytes of uninitialized memory could be sent, encrypted, to the SSL peer in each SSL 3.0 record. This could potentially leak sensitive information contained in previously freed memory. However, the severity is limited due to most deployments having a single write buffer per connection, which is partially filled with non-sensitive handshake data at the beginning, and the small number of bytes leaked per record.",
    "attack_vectors": "A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability during SSL 3.0 handshakes by initiating connections with a vulnerable client or server. The uninitialized memory is transmitted within the encrypted session.",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to establish an SSL 3.0 connection with a vulnerable server or client. No special position or additional capabilities are needed."

  "additional_notes": "The vulnerability is specific to SSL 3.0 and does not affect TLS. The amount of leaked information is limited and its severity is somewhat mitigated by common deployment practices. The issue is resolved in OpenSSL 1.0.0f and 0.9.8s, which clear the padding bytes before encryption."
