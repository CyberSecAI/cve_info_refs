Debian Security Advisory DSA-2375-1                   security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                            Florian Weimer
December 26, 2011                      <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : krb5, krb5-appl
Vulnerability  : buffer overflow
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-4862

It was discovered that the encryption support for BSD telnetd contains
a pre-authentication buffer overflow, which may enable remote
attackers who can connect to the Telnet port to execute arbitrary code
with root privileges.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6.dfsg.4~beta1-5lenny7 of the krb5 package.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:1.0.1-1.2 of the krb5-appl package.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your krb5 and krb5-appl packages.

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : inetutils
Vulnerability  : buffer overflow
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-4862

It was discovered that the Kerberos support for telnetd contains a
pre-authentication buffer overflow, which may enable remote attackers
who can connect to the Telnet to execute arbitrary code with root
privileges.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:1.5.dfsg.1-9+lenny1.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:1.6-3.1+squeeze1.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your inetutils packages.

As of version krb5-1.8 MIT Kerberos stripped all the applications out into
a separate krb5-appl bundle.  Current version is krb5-appl-1.0.2 and it
ships with an apparently vulnerable telnetd.  There is a FreeBSD package
security/krb5-appl of this maintained by cy.

Is there any test code available that could be run against a telnetd to
determine if it might be vulnerable or if it is patched against this
issue?

Thanks,

  - Tim

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

It probably applies to everyone shipping BSD telnetd -- I notified the projects
I could think of, but I'm sure I missed a few.

Heimdal is definitely affected.  I don't think MIT Kerberos ships telnetd any
more... at least, I looked in their SVN tree and didn't find it.

Is there any reason this does would not apply to telnetd from most other
vendors?  In particular MIT Kerberos & heimdal?

Thanks,

FreeBSD-SA-11:08.telnetd Security Advisory
The FreeBSD Project
Topic: telnetd code execution vulnerability
Category: core
Module: contrib
Announced: 2011-12-23
Affects: All supported versions of FreeBSD.
Corrected: 2011-12-23 15:00:37 UTC (RELENG\_7, 7.4-STABLE)
2011-12-23 15:00:37 UTC (RELENG\_7\_4, 7.4-RELEASE-p5)
2011-12-23 15:00:37 UTC (RELENG\_7\_3, 7.3-RELEASE-p9)

2011-12-23 15:00:37 UTC (RELENG\_9\_0, 9.0-RELEASE)
CVE Name: CVE-2011-4862
For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit .
I. Background
The FreeBSD telnet daemon, telnetd(8), implements the server side of the
TELNET virtual terminal protocol. It has been disabled by default in
FreeBSD since August 2001, and due to the lack of cryptographic security
in the TELNET protocol, it is strongly recommended that the SSH protocol
be used instead. The FreeBSD telnet daemon can be enabled via the
/etc/inetd.conf configuration file and the inetd(8) daemon.
The TELNET protocol has a mechanism for encryption of the data stream
(but it is not cryptographically strong and should not be relied upon
in any security-critical applications).
II. Problem Description
When an encryption key is supplied via the TELNET protocol, its length
is not validated before the key is copied into a fixed-size buffer.
III. Impact
An attacker who can connect to the telnetd daemon can execute arbitrary
code with the privileges of the daemon (which is usually the "root"
superuser).
IV. Workaround
No workaround is available, but systems not running the telnet daemon
are not vulnerable.
Note that the telnet daemon is usually run via inetd, and consequently
will not show up in a process listing unless a connection is currently
active; to determine if it is enabled, run
$ ps ax | grep telnetd | grep -v grep
$ grep telnetd /etc/inetd.conf | grep -vE '^#'
If any output is produced, your system may be vulnerable.
V. Solution
Perform one of the following:
1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to 7-STABLE or 8-STABLE, or to the
RELENG\_8\_2, RELENG\_8\_1, RELENG\_7\_4, or RELENG\_7\_3 security branch dated
after the correction date.
2) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:
The following patches have been verified to apply to FreeBSD 7.4, 7.3,
8.2, and 8.1 systems.
a) Download the patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-11:08/telnetd.patch
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-11:08/telnetd.patch.asc
b) Execute the following commands as root:
# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch
# cd /usr/src/lib/libtelnet
# make obj && make depend && make && make install
# cd /usr/src/libexec/telnetd
# make obj && make depend && make && make install
3) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:
Systems running 7.4-RELEASE, 7.3-RELEASE, 8.2-RELEASE, or 8.1-RELEASE on
the i386 or amd64 platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8)
utility:
# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install
VI. Correction details
The following list contains the revision numbers of each file that was
corrected in FreeBSD.

Hi all,

No, the Grinch didn't steal the FreeBSD security officer GPG key, and your eyes
aren't deceiving you: We really did just send out 5 security advisories.

The timing, to put it bluntly, sucks.  We normally aim to release advisories on
Wednesdays in order to maximize the number of system administrators who will be
at work already; and we try very hard to avoid issuing advisories any time close
to holidays for the same reason.  The start of the Christmas weekend -- in some
parts of the world it's already Saturday -- is absolutely not when we want to be
releasing security advisories.

Unfortunately my hand was forced: One of the issues (FreeBSD-SA-11:08.telnetd)
is a remote root vulnerability which is being actively exploited in the wild;
bugs really don't come any worse than this.  On the positive side, most people
have moved past telnet and on to SSH by now; but this is still not an issue we
could postpone until a more convenient time.

While I'm writing, a note to freebsd-update users: FreeBSD-SA-11:07.chroot has a
rather messy fix involving adding a new interface to libc; this has the awkward
side effect of causing the sizes of some "symbols" (aka. functions) in libc to
change, resulting in cascading changes into many binaries.  The long list of
updated files is irritating, but isn't a sign that anything in freebsd-update
went wrong.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

MITKRB5-SA-2011-008
MIT krb5 Security Advisory 2011-008
Original release: 2011-12-26
Last update: 2012-01-03
Topic: buffer overflow in telnet daemon and client
CVE-2011-4862
CVSSv2 Vector: AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C
CVSSv2 Base Score: 10
Access Vector: Network
Access Complexity: Low
Authentication: None
Confidentiality Impact: Complete
Integrity Impact: Complete
Availability Impact: Complete
CVSSv2 Temporal Score: 8.3
Exploitability: Functional
Remediation Level: Official Fix
Report Confidence: Confirmed
SUMMARY
=======
The telnet daemon (telnetd) and telnet client in MIT krb5 (and in
krb5-appl after the applications were moved to a separate distribution
for krb5-1.8) are vulnerable to a buffer overflow. The flaw does not
require authentication to exploit. Exploit code is reported to be
actively used in the wild.
IMPACT
======
An unauthenticated remote attacker can cause a buffer overflow and
probably execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the telnet
daemon (normally root).
By operating a malicious telnet server, or by modifying network
traffic, an unauthenticated remote attacker can cause a buffer
overflow and probably execute arbitrary code with the privileges of a
user running a telnet client.
AFFECTED SOFTWARE
=================
\* The telnet daemon and client in all releases of MIT krb5 prior to
krb5-1.8 are vulnerable. Later releases of krb5 moved the telnet
code to the krb5-appl distribution.
\* The telnet daemon and client in releases of krb5-appl prior to
krb5-1.0.3 are vulnerable.
FIXES
=====
\* Workaround: Disable telnet and use a more secure remote login
solution, such as SSH. This does not address the client
vulnerability.
\* The krb5-appl-1.0.3 release contains a fix for this vulnerability.
\* If running an earlier release, apply the following patch:
diff --git a/telnet/libtelnet/encrypt.c b/telnet/libtelnet/encrypt.c
index f75317d..b8d6cdd 100644
- --- a/telnet/libtelnet/encrypt.c

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
===============
We became aware of this vulnerability through a FreeBSD security
advisory.
Dan Rosenberg publicly remarked that the client is also vulnerable.
CONTACT

please PGP-encrypt it using the following key:
pub 2048R/56CD8F76 2010-12-29 [expires: 2012-02-01]
uid MIT Kerberos Team Security Contact
DETAILS
=======
If the telnet daemon or client receives an ENCRYPT suboption that
includes a key ID, encrypt\_keyid() in libtelnet/encrypt.c copies the
suboption contents into a fixed-size static buffer without first
constraining the length, leading to a buffer overflow.

Package        : heimdal
Vulnerability  : buffer overflow
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-4862

It was discovered that the Kerberos support for telnetd contains a
pre-authentication buffer overflow, which may enable remote attackers
who can connect to the Telnet to execute arbitrary code with root
privileges.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.dfsg.1-2.1+lenny1.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.0~git20100726.dfsg.1-2+squeeze1.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your heimdal packages.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
