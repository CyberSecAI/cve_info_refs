Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown for CVE-2011-4095:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the `search.php` script of Jara 1.6. Specifically, it fails to sanitize the `term` parameter before reflecting it back in the HTML output.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the vulnerable `search.php` page. When a user visits this page, the injected script will execute within their browser session.
- The impact could range from benign actions (like displaying an alert box) to more serious actions like stealing cookies, session hijacking, or redirecting users to malicious sites.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted URL that contains malicious javascript in the `term` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with a malicious script in the `term` parameter. This URL must then be delivered to a user of the application via some channel (e.g., email, link in a forum, social media). The user must click this malicious URL to trigger the attack.
