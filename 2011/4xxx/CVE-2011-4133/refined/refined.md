Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-4133:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) issue found within the RSS block of Moodle.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): The RSS block lacked proper protection against CSRF attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could manipulate RSS feeds used in an RSS block. This could potentially be used to inject malicious content, redirect users to phishing sites, or otherwise alter the behavior of the RSS feeds as displayed in Moodle.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is a web-based attack. An attacker would craft a malicious request that, when triggered by a victim user (likely through social engineering), would manipulate the RSS feed settings.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious request targeting the vulnerable functionality in Moodle.
- The attacker needs to be able to trick a user into executing the crafted request (e.g., by embedding it in a malicious webpage or email).
- The attacker does not require any authentication to exploit this vulnerability, since it is a CSRF vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects Moodle versions prior to 1.9.11.
- Moodle version 2.0.x and later are not vulnerable.
- The reported vulnerability was tracked as MDL-18839
- A workaround to mitigate this vulnerability was to delete the RSS feed block until an upgrade to a fixed version of Moodle.
