Please use CVE-2011-4350 for this issue

Thoughts?

Yes, however this is a different version so new a CVE is warranted, had
these been released at the same time then they would have been merged
according to ADT4.

Date: Fri, 25 Nov 2011 16:04:43 +0100
```
Package: yaws
Version: 1.91-1
Severity: critical
Tags: security upstream sid

Hi,

A directory traversal vulnerability in yaws has been discovered and
disclosed at [1].

At least the version of yaws currently in sid (1.91) is affected. One
can reproduce the issue by running:

curl '[http://localhost:8080/..\\..\\..\\..\\/etc/passwd](http://localhost:8080/..%5C%5C..%5C%5C..%5C%5C..%5C%5C/etc/passwd)'

against a fresh install of the yaws package with default config.

This will return a copy of the /etc/passwd file. The default config
only binds yaws to the localhost ip, but the vulnerability is the same
if you run it on public addresses (as one would in many typical
installations, it is a webserver).

I was not able to reproduce the issue in the version of the package in
squeeze, with the above GET request, but I have not done a thorough
investigation.

Upstream has promised a fix in the linked bug report, but there is no
official patch yet.

The bug is reproducible... So, I'll try to look into it also.

Both 1.77 (in oldstable) and 1.88 (in stable) do not recognize \\ as a
path separator, so they aren't vulnerable.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=757181#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-11-25 17:36:21 UTC  ``` A directory traversal flaw was found in the way yaws, web server for dynamic content written in Erlang, processed certain URLs. A remote, authenticated yaws user could use this flaw to obtain content of arbitrary local file, available to the yaws server user via specially-crafted URL request.  References: [1] <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=650009> [2] <https://github.com/klacke/yaws/issues/69>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=757181#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-11-25 17:42:11 UTC  ``` Public PoC from [1]: ====================  curl '[http://localhost:8080/..\\..\\..\\..\\/etc/passwd](http://localhost:8080/..%5C%5C..%5C%5C..%5C%5C..%5C%5C/etc/passwd)'  I am not sure, versions of yaws, as shipped in Fedora release of 14, 15, and 16, and as shipped with Fedora EPEL 6, are affected by this issue. Have tried above PoC (and couple of its combinations), but was unsuccessful to reproduce the issue (even with 'auth' disabled).   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=757181#c2)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-11-25 17:42:46 UTC  ``` CVE request: [3] <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/11/25/5>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=757181#c3)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-11-25 17:43:46 UTC  ``` Created yaws tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 757183](show_bug.cgi?id=757183 "CLOSED WONTFIX - yaws: Directory traversal flaw [fedora-all]")] Affects: epel-6 [[bug 757184](show_bug.cgi?id=757184 "CLOSED CANTFIX - yaws: Directory traversal flaw [epel-6]")]   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=757181#c4)  Peter Lemenkov    2011-11-25 19:30:04 UTC  ``` I'll take a closer look tomorrow on this issue.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=757181#c5)  Kurt Seifried    2011-11-25 20:36:24 UTC  ``` We don't appear to have fixed [CVE-2010-4181](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-4181) (similar issue, directory traversal)?   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=757181#c6)  Vincent Danen    2011-11-28 18:29:56 UTC  ``` This was assigned CVE-2011-4350:  <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/11/25/7>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=757181#c7)  Product Security DevOps Team    2019-06-10 10:58:13 UTC  ``` This CVE Bugzilla entry is for community support informational purposes only as it does not affect a package in a commercially supported Red Hat product. Refer to the dependent bugs for status of those individual community products.   ``` |  |

### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.
Needs triage
