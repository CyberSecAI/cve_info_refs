How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

But segfault when handling DNS replies is a major vulnerability if it can be replicated and tracked to a particular packet sequence. Is there any way you are able to repeat and/or identify what the cause is please? ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=3237#c2)  M.A.Young    2011-06-20 03:28:07 UTC  ``` Isolating the cause would be difficult given how busy the caches are.

Seems to be when combining two no-IP result sets. I'll try and replicate that here. Meanwhile keep those cores, the packet(s) should be inside the GrokReply buffer details if we need to check anything. ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=3237#c4)  Andreas Kobara    2011-09-22 02:15:15 UTC  ``` The troublesome DNS-Records seem to be a CNAME poiting to another CNAME which is pointing to an empty A-Record.  $ dig l15.sphotos.l3.fbcdn.net  ; <<>> DiG 9.2.4 <<>> l15.sphotos.l3.fbcdn.net ;; global options:  printcmd ;; Got answer: ;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NXDOMAIN, id: 11625 ;; flags: qr rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 2, AUTHORITY: 1, ADDITIONAL: 0  ;; QUESTION SECTION: ;l15.sphotos.l3.fbcdn.net.

The first chunk is not needed and I think it may cause unexpected effects on other code. As Amos already explained xmalloc handles zero length allocations fine and always returns some memory.  The first part of the second chunk is wrong (free). If the rr is assigned then it needs to be freed even if the length is 0.  The second part of the second chunk (while loop) is correct but should not be needed unless other code is buggy (see below). I find n-- > 0 easier to read however. The original implicit != 0 is not a very good loop condition.   If n == 0 at start then the while loop does nothing. The change in while condiiton only makes a difference if n should ever start out < 0 due to some other bug. Perhaps there should even be an assertion that n >= 0 here to trap any such bugs.   For the second half of the patch dealing with ancount I am not sure what it really does or when it makes a difference but it do smell like you may be on to something there. The way n and ancount is managed is a little odd where n MAY be less than ancount under some conditions and n is the actual number of answers in populated in the array and ancount gives the total size of the answer array.  But ancount is originally assigned in rfc1035MessageUnpack() when decoding the DNS message. It should only be adjusted by idnsGrokReply if it changes the answer array size. ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=3237#c14)  Joerg Lehrke    2011-09-26 07:22:34 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 2513](attachment.cgi?id=2513 "Fix DNS answer handling") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=2513&action=edit "Fix DNS answer handling") Fix DNS answer handling  (In reply to [comment #13](show_bug.cgi?id=3237#c13))  Since you can't call xmalloc(0), you would need the first chunk of my patch, don't you?  The second chunk addresses cases where rr is allocated (!) but the data array length is not greater than zero. In these cases rr->data was never allocated (properly). You would need this for e.g. with my first chunk. idnsGrokReply() does call rfc1035RRDestroy() with negativ length, too.  But your are right, both these changes are not directly related to the issue. I stumbled over this stuff during my review.  The parts belonging to dns_intern.cc are fixing the issue, though. But you are right ancount should only by modified if the array was modified. I considered this with my new version of the patch.  I hope I could clarify my patch and I you see the benefit now. ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=3237#c15)  Henrik Nordstrom    2011-09-26 14:32:53 UTC  ``` +++ lib/rfc1035.c	2011-09-26 15:04:17.000000000 +0200 @@ -430,8 +430,10 @@          break;      case RFC1035_TYPE_A:      default: -        RR->rdata = (char*)xmalloc(rdlength); -        memcpy(RR->rdata, buf + (*off), rdlength); +	if (rdlength) { +            RR->rdata = (char*)xmalloc(rdlength); +            memcpy(RR->rdata, buf + (*off), rdlength); +	}          break;      }   this is not needed.

Subject: CVE Request -- Squid v3.1.16 -- Invalid free by processing CNAME
 DNS record pointing to another CNAME record pointing to an empty A-record

Hello Steve, vendors,

   an invalid free flaw was found in the way Squid proxy caching server
processed DNS requests, where one CNAME record pointed to another CNAME
record pointing to an empty A-record. A remote attacker could issue a
specially-crafted DNS request, leading to denial of service (squid
daemon abort).

Upstream bug report:
[1] <http://bugs.squid-cache.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3237>

Relevant upstream patch:
[2] <http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~squid/squid/3.1/revision/10384>

References:
[3] <http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.1/changesets/SQUID_3_1_16.html>
[4] <http://bugs.squid-cache.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3237#c4>
[5] <http://bugs.squid-cache.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3237#c5>
[6] <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=750316>

Could you allocate a CVE id for this? (cc-ed Henrik and Jiri
for their opinion / comments too, if this should be considered
a security issue or not)

Thank you && Regards, Jan.
