An update that solves 9 vulnerabilities and has 82 fixes is
now available. It includes one version update.
Description:
The SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 SP2 kernel has been updated to
3.0.26, which fixes a lot of bugs and security issues.
The following security issues have been fixed:
\* CVE-2012-1179: A locking problem in transparent
hugepage support could be used by local attackers to
potentially crash the host, or via kvm a privileged guest
user could crash the kvm host system.
\* CVE-2011-4127: A potential hypervisor escape by
issuing SG\_IO commands to partitiondevices was fixed by
restricting access to these commands.
\* CVE-2012-1146: A local attacker could oops the kernel
using memory control groups and eventfds.
\* CVE-2011-1083: Limit the path length users can build
using epoll() to avoid local attackers consuming lots of
kernel CPU time.
\* CVE-2012-1097: The regset common infrastructure
assumed that regsets would always have .get and .set
methods, but necessarily .active methods. Unfortunately
people have since written regsets without .set method, so
NULL pointer dereference attacks were possible.
\* CVE-2011-2494: Access to the /proc/pid/taskstats file
requires root access to avoid side channel (timing
keypresses etc.) attacks on other users.
\* CVE-2011-4086: Fixed a oops in jbd/jbd2 that could be
caused by specific filesystem access patterns.
\* CVE-2011-4131: A malicious NFSv4 server could have
caused a oops in the nfsv4 acl handling.
\* CVE-2011-4132: Fixed a oops in jbd/jbd2 that could be
caused by mounting a malicious prepared filesystem.
(Also included are all fixes from the 3.0.14 -> 3.0.25
stable kernel updates.)

# CVE-2011-4914

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2011-4913.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2011-4915.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2011-4914 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-4914)

#### Description

The ROSE protocol implementation in the Linux kernel before 2.6.39 does not verify that certain data-length values are consistent with the amount of data sent, which might allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory or cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) via crafted data to a ROSE socket.

SHM\_UNLOCK: fix Unevictable pages stranded after swap
commit 245132643e1cfcd145bbc86a716c1818371fcb93 upstream.
Commit cc39c6a9bbde ("mm: account skipped entries to avoid looping in
find\_get\_pages") correctly fixed an infinite loop; but left a problem
that find\_get\_pages() on shmem would return 0 (appearing to callers to
mean end of tree) when it meets a run of nr\_pages swap entries.
The only uses of find\_get\_pages() on shmem are via pagevec\_lookup(),
called from invalidate\_mapping\_pages(), and from shmctl SHM\_UNLOCK's
scan\_mapping\_unevictable\_pages(). The first is already commented, and
not worth worrying about; but the second can leave pages on the
Unevictable list after an unusual sequence of swapping and locking.
Fix that by using shmem\_find\_get\_pages\_and\_swap() (then ignoring the
swap) instead of pagevec\_lookup().
But I don't want to contaminate vmscan.c with shmem internals, nor
shmem.c with LRU locking. So move scan\_mapping\_unevictable\_pages() into
shmem.c, renaming it shmem\_unlock\_mapping(); and rename
check\_move\_unevictable\_page() to check\_move\_unevictable\_pages(), looping
down an array of pages, oftentimes under the same lock.
Leave out the "rotate unevictable list" block: that's a leftover from
when this was used for /proc/sys/vm/scan\_unevictable\_pages, whose flawed
handling involved looking at pages at tail of LRU.
Was there significance to the sequence first ClearPageUnevictable, then
test page\_evictable, then SetPageUnevictable here? I think not, we're
under LRU lock, and have no barriers between those.

SHM\_UNLOCK: fix long unpreemptible section
commit 85046579bde15e532983438f86b36856e358f417 upstream.
scan\_mapping\_unevictable\_pages() is used to make SysV SHM\_LOCKed pages
evictable again once the shared memory is unlocked. It does this with
pagevec\_lookup()s across the whole object (which might occupy most of
memory), and takes 300ms to unlock 7GB here. A cond\_resched() every
PAGEVEC\_SIZE pages would be good.
However, KOSAKI-san points out that this is called under shmem.c's
info->lock, and it's also under shm.c's shm\_lock(), both spinlocks.
There is no strong reason for that: we need to take these pages off the
unevictable list soonish, but those locks are not required for it.
So move the call to scan\_mapping\_unevictable\_pages() from shmem.c's
unlock handling up to shm.c's unlock handling. Remove the recently
added barrier, not needed now we have spin\_unlock() before the scan.
Use get\_file(), with subsequent fput(), to make sure we have a reference
to mapping throughout scan\_mapping\_unevictable\_pages(): that's something
that was previously guaranteed by the shm\_lock().
Remove shmctl's lru\_add\_drain\_all(): we don't fault in pages at SHM\_LOCK
time, and we lazily discover them to be Unevictable later, so it serves
no purpose for SHM\_LOCK; and serves no purpose for SHM\_UNLOCK, since
pages still on pagevec are not marked Unevictable.
The original code avoided redundant rescans by checking VM\_LOCKED flag
at its level: now avoid them by checking shp's SHM\_LOCKED.
The original code called scan\_mapping\_unevictable\_pages() on a locked
area at shm\_destroy() time: perhaps we once had accounting cross-checks
which required that, but not now, so skip the overhead and just let
inode eviction deal with them.
Put check\_move\_unevictable\_page() and scan\_mapping\_unevictable\_pages()
under CONFIG\_SHMEM (with stub for the TINY case when ramfs is used),
more as comment than to save space; comment them used for SHM\_UNLOCK.

mm: fix NULL ptr dereference in \_\_count\_immobile\_pages
commit 687875fb7de4a95223af20ee024282fa9099f860 upstream.
Fix the following NULL ptr dereference caused by
cat /sys/devices/system/memory/memory0/removable
Pid: 13979, comm: sed Not tainted 3.0.13-0.5-default #1 IBM BladeCenter LS21 -[7971PAM]-/Server Blade
RIP: \_\_count\_immobile\_pages+0x4/0x100
Process sed (pid: 13979, threadinfo ffff880221c36000, task ffff88022e788480)
Call Trace:

vfs\_read+0xc7/0x130
sys\_read+0x53/0xa0
system\_call\_fastpath+0x16/0x1b
We are crashing because we are trying to dereference NULL zone which
came from pfn=0 (struct page ffffea0000000000). According to the boot
log this page is marked reserved:
e820 update range: 0000000000000000 - 0000000000010000 (usable) ==> (reserved)
and early\_node\_map confirms that:
early\_node\_map[3] active PFN ranges
1: 0x00000010 -> 0x0000009c
1: 0x00000100 -> 0x000bffa3
1: 0x00100000 -> 0x00240000
The problem is that memory\_present works in PAGE\_SECTION\_MASK aligned
blocks so the reserved range sneaks into the the section as well. This
also means that free\_area\_init\_node will not take care of those reserved
pages and they stay uninitialized.
When we try to read the removable status we walk through all available
sections and hope that the zone is valid for all pages in the section.
But this is not true in this case as the zone and nid are not initialized.
We have only one node in this particular case and it is marked as node=1
(rather than 0) and that made the problem visible because page\_to\_nid will
return 0 and there are no zones on the node.
Let's check that the zone is valid and that the given pfn falls into its
boundaries and mark the section not removable. This might cause some
false positives, probably, but we do not have any sane way to find out
whether the page is reserved by the platform or it is just not used for
whatever other reasons.

proc: clear\_refs: do not clear reserved pages
commit 85e72aa5384b1a614563ad63257ded0e91d1a620 upstream.
/proc/pid/clear\_refs is used to clear the Referenced and YOUNG bits for
pages and corresponding page table entries of the task with PID pid, which
includes any special mappings inserted into the page tables in order to
provide things like vDSOs and user helper functions.
On ARM this causes a problem because the vectors page is mapped as a
global mapping and since ec706dab ("ARM: add a vma entry for the user
accessible vector page"), a VMA is also inserted into each task for this
page to aid unwinding through signals and syscall restarts. Since the
vectors page is required for handling faults, clearing the YOUNG bit (and
subsequently writing a faulting pte) means that we lose the vectors page
\*globally\* and cannot fault it back in. This results in a system deadlock
on the next exception.
To see this problem in action, just run:
$ echo 1 > /proc/self/clear\_refs
on an ARM platform (as any user) and watch your system hang. I think this
has been the case since 2.6.37
This patch avoids clearing the aforementioned bits for reserved pages,
therefore leaving the vectors page intact on ARM. Since reserved pages
are not candidates for swap, this change should not have any impact on the
usefulness of clear\_refs.

score: fix off-by-one index into syscall table
commit c25a785d6647984505fa165b5cd84cfc9a95970b upstream.
If the provided system call number is equal to \_\_NR\_syscalls, the
current check will pass and a function pointer just after the system
call table may be called, since sys\_call\_table is an array with total
size \_\_NR\_syscalls.
Whether or not this is a security bug depends on what the compiler puts
immediately after the system call table. It's likely that this won't do
anything bad because there is an additional NULL check on the syscall
entry, but if there happens to be a non-NULL value immediately after the
system call table, this may result in local privilege escalation.

rt2800pci: fix spurious interrupts generation
commit dfd00c4c8f3dfa1fd7cec45f83d98b2a49743dcd upstream.
Same devices can generate interrupt without properly setting bit in
INT\_SOURCE\_CSR register (spurious interrupt), what will cause IRQ line
will be disabled by interrupts controller driver.
We discovered that clearing INT\_MASK\_CSR stops such behaviour. We
previously first read that register, and then clear all know interrupt
sources bits and do not touch reserved bits. After this patch, we write
to all register content (I believe writing to reserved bits on that
register will not cause any problems, I tested that on my rt2800pci
device).
This fix very bad performance problem, practically making device
unusable (since worked without interrupts), reported in:
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show\_bug.cgi?id=658451
We previously tried to workaround that issue in commit
4ba7d9997869d25bd223dea7536fc1ce9fab3b3b "rt2800pci: handle spurious
interrupts", but it was reverted in commit
82e5fc2a34fa9ffea38f00c4066b7e600a0ca5e6

ath9k\_hw: fix interpretation of the rx KeyMiss flag
commit 7a532fe7131216a02c81a6c1b1f8632da1195a58 upstream.
Documentation states that the KeyMiss flag is only valid if RxFrameOK is
unset, however empirical evidence has shown that this is false.
When KeyMiss is set (and RxFrameOK is 1), the hardware passes a valid frame
which has not been decrypted. The driver then falsely marks the frame
as decrypted, and when using CCMP this corrupts the rx CCMP PN, leading
to connection hangs.

x86/UV2: Work around BAU bug
commit c5d35d399e685acccc85a675e8765c26b2a9813a upstream.
This patch implements a workaround for a UV2 hardware bug.
The bug is a non-atomic update of a memory-mapped register. When
hardware message delivery and software message acknowledge occur
simultaneously the pending message acknowledge for the arriving
message may be lost. This causes the sender's message status to
stay busy.
Part of the workaround is to not acknowledge a completed message
until it is verified that no other message is actually using the
resource that is mistakenly recorded in the completed message.
Part of the workaround is to test for long elapsed time in such
a busy condition, then handle it by using a spare sending
descriptor. The stay-busy condition is eventually timed out by
hardware, and then the original sending descriptor can be
re-used. Most of that logic change is in keeping track of the
current descriptor and the state of the spares.
The occurrences of the workaround are added to the BAU
statistics.

commit c10076c4304083af15a41f6bc5e657e781c1f9a6 upstream.
Tracepoints are disabled for tainted modules, which is usually because the
module is either proprietary or was forced, and we don't want either of them
using kernel tracepoints.
But, a module can also be tainted by being in the staging directory or
compiled out of tree. Either is fine for use with tracepoints, no need
to punish them. I found this out when I noticed that my sample trace event
module, when done out of tree, stopped working.

ACPI: processor: fix acpi\_get\_cpuid for UP processor
commit d640113fe80e45ebd4a5b420b220d3f6bf37f682 upstream.
For UP processor, it is likely that no \_MAT method or MADT table defined.
So currently acpi\_get\_cpuid(...) always return -1 for UP processor.
This is wrong. It should return valid value for CPU0.
In the other hand, BIOS may define multiple CPU handles even for UP
processor, for example
Scope (\_PR)
{
Processor (CPU0, 0x00, 0x00000410, 0x06) {}
Processor (CPU1, 0x01, 0x00000410, 0x06) {}
Processor (CPU2, 0x02, 0x00000410, 0x06) {}
Processor (CPU3, 0x03, 0x00000410, 0x06) {}
}
We should only return valid value for CPU0's acpi handle.
And return invalid value for others.

ACPI, ia64: Use SRAT table rev to use 8bit or 16/32bit PXM fields (ia64)
commit 9f10f6a520deb3639fac78d81151a3ade88b4e7f upstream.
In SRAT v1, we had 8bit proximity domain (PXM) fields; SRAT v2 provides
32bits for these. The new fields were reserved before.
According to the ACPI spec, the OS must disregrard reserved fields.
ia64 did handle the PXM fields almost consistently, but depending on
sgi's sn2 platform. This patch leaves the sn2 logic in, but does also
use 16/32 bits for PXM if the SRAT has rev 2 or higher.
The patch also adds \_\_init to the two pxm accessor functions, as they
access \_\_initdata now and are called from an \_\_init function only anyway.
Note that the code only uses 16 bits for the PXM field in the processor
proximity field; the patch does not address this as 16 bits are more than
enough.

one cpu which has auto\_demotion enabled or has no broadcast timer setup.
Usually we don't see impact because auto demotion just harms power and the
intel\_idle init is called in CPU 0, where boradcast timer delivers

Latest kvm version seem to return true for mwait\_leaf cpuid

While real CPUs seem to always return non-zero values, the intel
idle driver should not get active in kvm (mwait\_substates == 0)
case and bail out.
Otherwise a Null pointer exception will happen later when the
cpuidle subsystem tries to get active:

TOMOYO: Accept \000 as a valid character.
commit 25add8cf99c9ec8b8dc0acd8b9241e963fc0d29c upstream.
TOMOYO 2.5 in Linux 3.2 and later handles Unix domain socket's address.
Thus, tomoyo\_correct\_word2() needs to accept \000 as a valid character, or
TOMOYO 2.5 cannot handle Unix domain's abstract socket address.

ALSA: virtuoso: Xonar DS: fix polarity of front output
commit f0e48b6bd4e407459715240cd241ddb6b89bdf81 upstream.
The two DACs for the front output and the surround/center/LFE/back
outputs are wired up out of phase, so when channels are duplicated,
their sound can cancel out each other and result in a weaker bass
response. To fix this, reverse the polarity of the neutron flow to
the front output.

proc: clean up and fix /proc//mem handling
commit e268337dfe26dfc7efd422a804dbb27977a3cccc upstream.
Jüri Aedla reported that the /proc//mem handling really isn't very
robust, and it also doesn't match the permission checking of any of the
other related files.
This changes it to do the permission checks at open time, and instead of
tracking the process, it tracks the VM at the time of the open. That
simplifies the code a lot, but does mean that if you hold the file
descriptor open over an execve(), you'll continue to read from the \_old\_
VM.
That is different from our previous behavior, but much simpler. If
somebody actually finds a load where this matters, we'll need to revert
this commit.
I suspect that nobody will ever notice - because the process mapping
addresses will also have changed as part of the execve. So you cannot
actually usefully access the fd across a VM change simply because all
the offsets for IO would have changed too.

block: fail SCSI passthrough ioctls on partition devices
commit 0bfc96cb77224736dfa35c3c555d37b3646ef35e upstream.
[ Changes with respect to 3.3: return -ENOTTY from scsi\_verify\_blk\_ioctl
and -ENOIOCTLCMD from sd\_compat\_ioctl. ]
Linux allows executing the SG\_IO ioctl on a partition or LVM volume, and
will pass the command to the underlying block device. This is
well-known, but it is also a large security problem when (via Unix
permissions, ACLs, SELinux or a combination thereof) a program or user
needs to be granted access only to part of the disk.
This patch lets partitions forward a small set of harmless ioctls;
others are logged with printk so that we can see which ioctls are
actually sent. In my tests only CDROM\_GET\_CAPABILITY actually occurred.
Of course it was being sent to a (partition on a) hard disk, so it would
have failed with ENOTTY and the patch isn't changing anything in
practice. Still, I'm treating it specially to avoid spamming the logs.
In principle, this restriction should include programs running with
CAP\_SYS\_RAWIO. If for example I let a program access /dev/sda2 and
/dev/sdb, it still should not be able to read/write outside the
boundaries of /dev/sda2 independent of the capabilities. However, for
now programs with CAP\_SYS\_RAWIO will still be allowed to send the
ioctls. Their actions will still be logged.
This patch does not affect the non-libata IDE driver. That driver
however already tests for bd != bd->bd\_contains before issuing some
ioctl; it could be restricted further to forbid these ioctls even for
programs running with CAP\_SYS\_ADMIN/CAP\_SYS\_RAWIO.

mac80211: revert on-channel work optimisations
commit e76aadc572288a158ae18ae1c10fe395c7bca066 upstream.
Backport note:
This patch it's a full revert of commit b23b025f "mac80211: Optimize
scans on current operating channel.". On upstrem revert e76aadc5 we
keep some bits from that commit, which are needed for upstream version
of mac80211.
The on-channel work optimisations have caused a
number of issues, and the code is unfortunately
very complex and almost impossible to follow.
Instead of attempting to put in more workarounds
let's just remove those optimisations, we can
work on them again later, after we change the
whole auth/assoc design.

fix shrink\_dcache\_parent() livelock
commit eaf5f9073533cde21c7121c136f1c3f072d9cf59 upstream.
Two (or more) concurrent calls of shrink\_dcache\_parent() on the same dentry may
cause shrink\_dcache\_parent() to loop forever.
Here's what appears to happen:
1 - CPU0: select\_parent(P) finds C and puts it on dispose list, returns 1
2 - CPU1: select\_parent(P) locks P->d\_lock
3 - CPU0: shrink\_dentry\_list() locks C->d\_lock
dentry\_kill(C) tries to lock P->d\_lock but fails, unlocks C->d\_lock
4 - CPU1: select\_parent(P) locks C->d\_lock,
moves C from dispose list being processed on CPU0 to the new
dispose list, returns 1
5 - CPU0: shrink\_dentry\_list() finds dispose list empty, returns
6 - Goto 2 with CPU0 and CPU1 switched
Basically select\_parent() steals the dentry from shrink\_dentry\_list() and thinks
it found a new one, causing shrink\_dentry\_list() to think it's making progress
and loop over and over.
One way to trigger this is to make udev calls stat() on the sysfs file while it
is going away.
Having a file in /lib/udev/rules.d/ with only this one rule seems to the trick:
ATTR{vendor}=="0x8086", ATTR{device}=="0x10ca", ENV{PCI\_SLOT\_NAME}="%k", ENV{MATCHADDR}="$attr{address}", RUN+="/bin/true"
Then execute the following loop:
while true; do
echo -bond0 > /sys/class/net/bonding\_masters
echo +bond0 > /sys/class/net/bonding\_masters
echo -bond1 > /sys/class/net/bonding\_masters
echo +bond1 > /sys/class/net/bonding\_masters
done
One fix would be to check all callers and prevent concurrent calls to
shrink\_dcache\_parent(). But I think a better solution is to stop the
stealing behavior.
This patch adds a new dentry flag that is set when the dentry is added to the
dispose list. The flag is cleared in dentry\_lru\_del() in case the dentry gets a
new reference just before being pruned.
If the dentry has this flag, select\_parent() will skip it and let
shrink\_dentry\_list() retry pruning it. With select\_parent() skipping those
dentries there will not be the appearance of progress (new dentries found) when
there is none, hence shrink\_dcache\_parent() will not loop forever.
Set the flag is also set in prune\_dcache\_sb() for consistency as suggested by
Linus.

dcache: use a dispose list in select\_parent
commit b48f03b319ba78f3abf9a7044d1f436d8d90f4f9 upstream.
select\_parent currently abuses the dentry cache LRU to provide
cleanup features for child dentries that need to be freed. It moves
them to the tail of the LRU, then tells shrink\_dcache\_parent() to
calls \_\_shrink\_dcache\_sb to unconditionally move them to a dispose
list (as DCACHE\_REFERENCED is ignored). \_\_shrink\_dcache\_sb() has to
relock the dentries to move them off the LRU onto the dispose list,
but otherwise does not touch the dentries that select\_parent() moved
to the tail of the LRU. It then passses the dispose list to
shrink\_dentry\_list() which tries to free the dentries.
IOWs, the use of \_\_shrink\_dcache\_sb() is superfluous - we can build
exactly the same list of dentries for disposal directly in
select\_parent() and call shrink\_dentry\_list() instead of calling
\_\_shrink\_dcache\_sb() to do that. This means that we avoid long holds
on the lru lock walking the LRU moving dentries to the dispose list
We also avoid the need to relock each dentry just to move it off the
LRU, reducing the numebr of times we lock each dentry to dispose of
them in shrink\_dcache\_parent() from 3 to 2 times.
Further, we remove one of the two callers of \_\_shrink\_dcache\_sb().
This also means that \_\_shrink\_dcache\_sb can be moved into back into
prune\_dcache\_sb() and we no longer have to handle referenced
dentries conditionally, simplifying the code.

uvcvideo: Fix integer overflow in uvc\_ioctl\_ctrl\_map()
commit 806e23e95f94a27ee445022d724060b9b45cb64a upstream.
There is a potential integer overflow in uvc\_ioctl\_ctrl\_map(). When a
large xmap->menu\_count is passed from the userspace, the subsequent call
to kmalloc() will allocate a buffer smaller than expected.
map->menu\_count and map->menu\_info would later be used in a loop (e.g.
in uvc\_query\_v4l2\_ctrl), which leads to out-of-bound access.
The patch checks the ioctl argument and returns -EINVAL for zero or too
large values in xmap->menu\_count.

recordmcount: Fix handling of elf64 big-endian objects.
commit 2e885057b7f75035f0b85e02f737891482815a81 upstream.
In ELF64, the sh\_flags field is 64-bits wide. recordmcount was
erroneously treating it as a 32-bit wide field. For little endian
objects this works because the flags of interest (SHF\_EXECINSTR)
reside in the lower 32 bits of the word, and you get the same result
with either a 32-bit or 64-bit read. Big endian objects on the
other hand do not work at all with this error.
The fix: Correctly treat sh\_flags as 64-bits wide in elf64 objects.
The symptom I observed was that my
\_\_start\_mcount\_loc..\_\_stop\_mcount\_loc was empty even though ftrace
function tracing was enabled.

nfsd4: fix lockowner matching
commit b93d87c19821ba7d3ee11557403d782e541071ad upstream.
Lockowners are looked up by file as well as by owner, but we were
forgetting to do a comparison on the file. This could cause an
incorrect result from lockt.
(Note looking up the inode from the lockowner is pretty awkward here.
The data structures need fixing.)

svcrpc: avoid memory-corruption on pool shutdown
commit b4f36f88b3ee7cf26bf0be84e6c7fc15f84dcb71 upstream.
Socket callbacks use svc\_xprt\_enqueue() to add an xprt to a
pool->sp\_sockets list. In normal operation a server thread will later
come along and take the xprt off that list. On shutdown, after all the
threads have exited, we instead manually walk the sv\_tempsocks and
sv\_permsocks lists to find all the xprt's and delete them.
So the sp\_sockets lists don't really matter any more. As a result,
we've mostly just ignored them and hoped they would go away.
Which has gotten us into trouble; witness for example ebc63e531cc6
"svcrpc: fix list-corrupting race on nfsd shutdown", the result of Ben
Greear noticing that a still-running svc\_xprt\_enqueue() could re-add an
xprt to an sp\_sockets list just before it was deleted. The fix was to
remove it from the list at the end of svc\_delete\_xprt(). But that only
made corruption less likely--I can see nothing that prevents a
svc\_xprt\_enqueue() from adding another xprt to the list at the same
moment that we're removing this xprt from the list. In fact, despite
the earlier xpo\_detach(), I don't even see what guarantees that
svc\_xprt\_enqueue() couldn't still be running on this xprt.
So, instead, note that svc\_xprt\_enqueue() essentially does:
lock sp\_lock
if XPT\_BUSY unset
add to sp\_sockets
unlock sp\_lock
So, if we do:
set XPT\_BUSY on every xprt.
Empty every sp\_sockets list, under the sp\_socks locks.
Then we're left knowing that the sp\_sockets lists are all empty and will
stay that way, since any svc\_xprt\_enqueue() will check XPT\_BUSY under
the sp\_lock and see it set.
And \*then\* we can continue deleting the xprt's.
(Thanks to Jeff Layton for being correctly suspicious of this code....)

svcrpc: fix double-free on shutdown of nfsd after changing pool mode
commit 61c8504c428edcebf23b97775a129c5b393a302b upstream.
The pool\_to and to\_pool fields of the global svc\_pool\_map are freed on
shutdown, but are initialized in nfsd startup only in the
SVC\_POOL\_PERCPU and SVC\_POOL\_PERNODE cases.
They \*are\* initialized to zero on kernel startup. So as long as you use
only SVC\_POOL\_GLOBAL (the default), this will never be a problem.
You're also OK if you only ever use SVC\_POOL\_PERCPU or SVC\_POOL\_PERNODE.
However, the following sequence events leads to a double-free:
1. set SVC\_POOL\_PERCPU or SVC\_POOL\_PERNODE
2. start nfsd: both fields are initialized.
3. shutdown nfsd: both fields are freed.
4. set SVC\_POOL\_GLOBAL
5. start nfsd: the fields are left untouched.
6. shutdown nfsd: now we try to free them again.
Step 4 is actually unnecessary, since (for some bizarre reason), nfsd
automatically resets the pool mode to SVC\_POOL\_GLOBAL on shutdown.

kconfig/streamline-config.pl: Fix parsing Makefile with variables
commit 364212fddaaa60c5a64f67a0f5624ad996ecc8a0 upstream.
Thomas Lange reported that when he did a 'make localmodconfig', his
config was missing the brcmsmac driver, even though he had the module
loaded.
Looking into this, I found the file:
drivers/net/wireless/brcm80211/brcmsmac/Makefile
had the following in the Makefile:
MODULEPFX := brcmsmac
obj-$(CONFIG\_BRCMSMAC) += $(MODULEPFX).o
The way streamline-config.pl works, is parsing all the
obj-$(CONFIG\_FOO) += foo.o
lines to find that CONFIG\_FOO belongs to the module foo.ko.
But in this case, the brcmsmac.o was not used, but a variable in its place.
By changing streamline-config.pl to remember defined variables in Makefiles
and substituting them when they are used in the obj-X lines, allows
Thomas (and others) to have their brcmsmac module stay configured
when it is loaded and running "make localmodconfig".

ftrace: Fix unregister ftrace\_ops accounting
commit 30fb6aa74011dcf595f306ca2727254d708b786e upstream.
Multiple users of the function tracer can register their functions
with the ftrace\_ops structure. The accounting within ftrace will
update the counter on each function record that is being traced.
When the ftrace\_ops filtering adds or removes functions, the
function records will be updated accordingly if the ftrace\_ops is
still registered.
When a ftrace\_ops is removed, the counter of the function records,
that the ftrace\_ops traces, are decremented. When they reach zero
the functions that they represent are modified to stop calling the
mcount code.
When changes are made, the code is updated via stop\_machine() with
a command passed to the function to tell it what to do. There is an
ENABLE and DISABLE command that tells the called function to enable
or disable the functions. But the ENABLE is really a misnomer as it
should just update the records, as records that have been enabled
and now have a count of zero should be disabled.
The DISABLE command is used to disable all functions regardless of
their counter values. This is the big off switch and is not the
complement of the ENABLE command.
To make matters worse, when a ftrace\_ops is unregistered and there
is another ftrace\_ops registered, neither the DISABLE nor the
ENABLE command are set when calling into the stop\_machine() function
and the records will not be updated to match their counter. A command
is passed to that function that will update the mcount code to call
the registered callback directly if it is the only one left. This
means that the ftrace\_ops that is still registered will have its callback
called by all functions that have been set for it as well as the ftrace\_ops
that was just unregistered.
Here's a way to trigger this bug. Compile the kernel with
CONFIG\_FUNCTION\_PROFILER set and with CONFIG\_FUNCTION\_GRAPH not set:
CONFIG\_FUNCTION\_PROFILER=y
# CONFIG\_FUNCTION\_GRAPH is not set
This will force the function profiler to use the function tracer instead
of the function graph tracer.

The same problem could have happened with the trace\_probe\_ops,
but they are modified with the set\_frace\_filter file which does the
update at closure of the file.
The simple solution is to change ENABLE to UPDATE and call it every
time an ftrace\_ops is unregistered.

Unused iocbs in a batch should not be accounted as active.
commit 69e4747ee9727d660b88d7e1efe0f4afcb35db1b upstream.
Since commit 080d676de095 ("aio: allocate kiocbs in batches") iocbs are
allocated in a batch during processing of first iocbs. All iocbs in a
batch are automatically added to ctx->active\_reqs list and accounted in
ctx->reqs\_active.
If one (not the last one) of iocbs submitted by an user fails, further
iocbs are not processed, but they are still present in ctx->active\_reqs
and accounted in ctx->reqs\_active. This causes process to stuck in a D
state in wait\_for\_all\_aios() on exit since ctx->reqs\_active will never
go down to zero. Furthermore since kiocb\_batch\_free() frees iocb
without removing it from active\_reqs list the list become corrupted
which may cause oops.
Fix this by removing iocb from ctx->active\_reqs and updating
ctx->reqs\_active in kiocb\_batch\_free().

We switch to dynamic debugging in commit
56e46742e846e4de167dde0e1e1071ace1c882a5 but did not take into account that
now we do not control anymore whether a specific message is enabled or not.
So now we lock the "dbg\_lock" and release it in every debugging macro, which
make them not so light-weight.
This commit removes the "dbg\_lock" protection from the debugging macros to
fix the issue.
The downside is that now our DBGKEY() stuff is broken, but this is not
critical at all and will be fixed later.

Patch 56e46742e846e4de167dde0e1e1071ace1c882a5 broke UBIFS debugging messages:
before that commit when UBIFS debugging was enabled, users saw few useful

'pr\_debug()', so to enable the debugging messages users have to enable them
first via /sys/kernel/debug/dynamic\_debug/control, which is very impractical.
This commit makes 'dbg\_msg()' to use 'printk()' instead of 'pr\_debug()', just
as it was before the breakage.

commit 72f0d453d81d35087b1d3ad7c8285628c2be6e1d upstream.
Patch ab50ff684707031ed4bad2fdd313208ae392e5bb broke UBI debugging messages:
before that commit when UBI debugging was enabled, users saw few useful
debugging messages after attaching an MTD device. However, that patch turned
'dbg\_msg()' into 'pr\_debug()', so to enable the debugging messages users have
to enable them first via /sys/kernel/debug/dynamic\_debug/control, which is
very impractical.
This commit makes 'dbg\_msg()' to use 'printk()' instead of 'pr\_debug()', just
as it was before the breakage.

Currently it's possible to create a volume without a name. E.g:

After that vtbl\_check() will always fail because it does not permit

x86: Fix mmap random address range
commit 9af0c7a6fa860698d080481f24a342ba74b68982 upstream.
On x86\_32 casting the unsigned int result of get\_random\_int() to
long may result in a negative value. On x86\_32 the range of
mmap\_rnd() therefore was -255 to 255. The 32bit mode on x86\_64
used 0 to 255 as intended.
The bug was introduced by 675a081 ("x86: unify mmap\_{32|64}.c")
in January 2008.

memcg: add mem\_cgroup\_replace\_page\_cache() to fix LRU issue
commit ab936cbcd02072a34b60d268f94440fd5cf1970b upstream.
Commit ef6a3c6311 ("mm: add replace\_page\_cache\_page() function") added a
function replace\_page\_cache\_page(). This function replaces a page in the
radix-tree with a new page. WHen doing this, memory cgroup needs to fix
up the accounting information. memcg need to check PCG\_USED bit etc.
In some(many?) cases, 'newpage' is on LRU before calling
replace\_page\_cache(). So, memcg's LRU accounting information should be
fixed, too.
This patch adds mem\_cgroup\_replace\_page\_cache() and removes the old hooks.
In that function, old pages will be unaccounted without touching
res\_counter and new page will be accounted to the memcg (of old page).
WHen overwriting pc->mem\_cgroup of newpage, take zone->lru\_lock and avoid
races with LRU handling.
Background:
replace\_page\_cache\_page() is called by FUSE code in its splice() handling.
Here, 'newpage' is replacing oldpage but this newpage is not a newly allocated
page and may be on LRU. LRU mis-accounting will be critical for memory cgroup
because rmdir() checks the whole LRU is empty and there is no account leak.
If a page is on the other LRU than it should be, rmdir() will fail.
This bug was added in March 2011, but no bug report yet. I guess there
are not many people who use memcg and FUSE at the same time with upstream
kernels.
The result of this bug is that admin cannot destroy a memcg because of
account leak. So, no panic, no deadlock. And, even if an active cgroup
exist, umount can succseed. So no problem at shutdown.

ath9k: Fix regression in channelwidth switch at the same channel
commit 1a19f77f3642b8194ad9cf55548cc5d92e841766 upstream.
The commit "ath9k: Fix invalid noisefloor reading due to channel update"
preserves the current channel noisefloor readings before updating
channel type at the same channel index. It is also updating the curchan
pointer. As survey updation is also referring curchan pointer to fetch
the appropriate index, which might leads to invalid memory access. This
patch partially reverts the change and stores the noise floor history
buffer before updating channel type w/o updating curchan.

Quoting Russell King:
"linux/crash\_dump.h makes no attempt to include asm/elf.h, but it depends
on stuff in asm/elf.h to determine how stuff inside this file is defined
at parse time.
So, if asm/elf.h is included after linux/crash\_dump.h or not at all, you
get a different result from the situation where asm/elf.h is included
before."
So add elf.h header to crash\_dump.h to avoid this problem.

PNP: work around Dell 1536/1546 BIOS MMCONFIG bug that breaks USB
commit eb31aae8cb5eb54e234ed2d857ddac868195d911 upstream.
Some Dell BIOSes have MCFG tables that don't report the entire
MMCONFIG area claimed by the chipset. If we move PCI devices into
that claimed-but-unreported area, they don't work.
This quirk reads the AMD MMCONFIG MSRs and adds PNP0C01 resources as
needed to cover the entire area.
Example problem scenario:
BIOS-e820: 00000000cfec5400 - 00000000d4000000 (reserved)
Fam 10h mmconf [d0000000, dfffffff]

It is possible current thread migrates right before disabling irqs in

Many thanks to Zhihua Che for spotting this bug, introduced in 2.6.39

We normally try to avoid reading from write-mostly devices, but when

try reading them.
With the current code, best\_good\_sectors might not get set and that
causes zero-length read requests to be send down which is very
confusing.

is suitable for 3.1.x and 3.2.x

xen/xenbus: Reject replies with payload > XENSTORE\_PAYLOAD\_MAX.
commit 9e7860cee18241633eddb36a4c34c7b61d8cecbc upstream.
Haogang Chen found out that:
There is a potential integer overflow in process\_msg() that could result
in cross-domain attack.
body = kmalloc(msg->hdr.len + 1, GFP\_NOIO | \_\_GFP\_HIGH);
When a malicious guest passes 0xffffffff in msg->hdr.len, the subsequent
call to xb\_read() would write to a zero-length buffer.
The other end of this connection is always the xenstore backend daemon
so there is no guest (malicious or otherwise) which can do this. The
xenstore daemon is a trusted component in the system.
However this seem like a reasonable robustness improvement so we should
have it.
And Ian when read the API docs found that:
The payload length (len field of the header) is limited to 4096
(XENSTORE\_PAYLOAD\_MAX) in both directions. If a client exceeds the
limit, its xenstored connection will be immediately killed by
xenstored, which is usually catastrophic from the client's point of
view. Clients (particularly domains, which cannot just reconnect)
should avoid this.
so this patch checks against that instead.
This also avoids a potential integer overflow pointed out by Haogang Chen.

SCSI: mpt2sas : Fix for memory allocation error for large host credits
commit aff132d95ffe14eca96cab90597cdd010b457af7 upstream.
The amount of memory required for tracking chain buffers is rather
large, and when the host credit count is big, memory allocation
failure occurs inside \_\_get\_free\_pages.
The fix is to limit the number of chains to 100,000. In addition,
the number of host credits is limited to 30,000 IOs. However this
limitation can be overridden this using the command line option
max\_queue\_depth. The algorithm for calculating the
reply\_post\_queue\_depth is changed so that it is equal to
(reply\_free\_queue\_depth + 16), previously it was (reply\_free\_queue\_depth \* 2).

PCI: msi: Disable msi interrupts when we initialize a pci device
commit a776c491ca5e38c26d9f66923ff574d041e747f4 upstream.
I traced a nasty kexec on panic boot failure to the fact that we had
screaming msi interrupts and we were not disabling the msi messages at
kernel startup. The booting kernel had not enabled those interupts so
was not prepared to handle them.
I can see no reason why we would ever want to leave the msi interrupts
enabled at boot if something else has enabled those interrupts. The pci
spec specifies that msi interrupts should be off by default. Drivers
are expected to enable the msi interrupts if they want to use them. Our
interrupt handling code reprograms the interrupt handlers at boot and
will not be be able to do anything useful with an unexpected interrupt.
This patch applies cleanly all of the way back to 2.6.32 where I noticed
the problem.

nfs: fix regression in handling of context= option in NFSv4
commit 8a0d551a59ac92d8ff048d6cb29d3a02073e81e8 upstream.
Setting the security context of a NFSv4 mount via the context= mount
option is currently broken. The NFSv4 codepath allocates a parsed
options struct, and then parses the mount options to fill it. It
eventually calls nfs4\_remote\_mount which calls security\_init\_mnt\_opts.
That clobbers the lsm\_opts struct that was populated earlier. This bug
also looks like it causes a small memory leak on each v4 mount where
context= is used.
Fix this by moving the initialization of the lsm\_opts into
nfs\_alloc\_parsed\_mount\_data. Also, add a destructor for
nfs\_parsed\_mount\_data to make it easier to free all of the allocations
hanging off of it, and to ensure that the security\_free\_mnt\_opts is
called whenever security\_init\_mnt\_opts is.
I believe this regression was introduced quite some time ago, probably
by commit c02d7adf.

NFSv4: include bitmap in nfsv4 get acl data
commit bf118a342f10dafe44b14451a1392c3254629a1f upstream.
The NFSv4 bitmap size is unbounded: a server can return an arbitrary
sized bitmap in an FATTR4\_WORD0\_ACL request. Replace using the
nfs4\_fattr\_bitmap\_maxsz as a guess to the maximum bitmask returned by a server
with the inclusion of the bitmap (xdr length plus bitmasks) and the acl data
xdr length to the (cached) acl page data.
This is a general solution to commit e5012d1f "NFSv4.1: update
nfs4\_fattr\_bitmap\_maxsz" and fixes hitting a BUG\_ON in xdr\_shrink\_bufhead
when getting ACLs.
Fix a bug in decode\_getacl that returned -EINVAL on ACLs > page when getxattr
was called with a NULL buffer, preventing ACL > PAGE\_SIZE from being retrieved.

NFS - fix recent breakage to NFS error handling.
commit 2edb6bc3852c681c0d948245bd55108dc6407604 upstream.
From c6d615d2b97fe305cbf123a8751ced859dca1d5e Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 2001
From: NeilBrown

Subject: NFS - fix recent breakage to NFS error handling.
commit 02c24a82187d5a628c68edfe71ae60dc135cd178 made a small and
presumably unintended change to write error handling in NFS.
Previously an error from filemap\_write\_and\_wait\_range would only be of
interest if nfs\_file\_fsync did not return an error. After this commit,
an error from filemap\_write\_and\_wait\_range would mean that (the rest of)
nfs\_file\_fsync would not even be called.
This means that:
1/ you are more likely to see EIO than e.g. EDQUOT or ENOSPC.
2/ NFS\_CONTEXT\_ERROR\_WRITE remains set for longer so more writes are
synchronous.
This patch restores previous behaviour.

NFS: Retry mounting NFSROOT
commit 43717c7daebf10b43f12e68512484b3095bb1ba5 upstream.
Lukas Razik  reports that on his SPARC system,
booting with an NFS root file system stopped working after commit
56463e50 "NFS: Use super.c for NFSROOT mount option parsing."
We found that the network switch to which Lukas' client was attached
was delaying access to the LAN after the client's NIC driver reported
that its link was up. The delay was longer than the timeouts used in
the NFS client during mounting.
NFSROOT worked for Lukas before commit 56463e50 because in those
kernels, the client's first operation was an rpcbind request to
determine which port the NFS server was listening on. When that
request failed after a long timeout, the client simply selected the
default NFS port (2049). By that time the switch was allowing access
to the LAN, and the mount succeeded.
Neither of these client behaviors is desirable, so reverting 56463e50
is really not a choice. Instead, introduce a mechanism that retries
the NFSROOT mount request several times. This is the same tactic that
normal user space NFS mounts employ to overcome server and network
delays.

pnfs-obj: Must return layout on IO error
commit fe0fe83585f88346557868a803a479dfaaa0688a upstream.
As mandated by the standard. In case of an IO error, a pNFS
objects layout driver must return it's layout. This is because
all device errors are reported to the server as part of the
layout return buffer.
This is implemented the same way PNFS\_LAYOUTRET\_ON\_SETATTR
is done, through a bit flag on the pnfs\_layoutdriver\_type->flags
member. The flag is set by the layout driver that wants a
layout\_return preformed at pnfs\_ld\_{write,read}\_done in case
of an error.
(Though I have not defined a wrapper like pnfs\_ld\_layoutret\_on\_setattr
because this code is never called outside of pnfs.c and pnfs IO
paths)
Without this patch 3.[0-2] Kernels leak memory and have an annoying
WARN\_ON after every IO error utilizing the pnfs-obj driver.

of the regular RPC members. But objlayout was not switched
over.

Without this fix any IO error is hanged, because IO is not

ALSA: hda - Fix the lost power-setup of seconary pins after PM resume
commit f2cbba7602383cd9cdd21f0a5d0b8bd1aad47b33 upstream.
When multiple headphone or other detectable output pins are present,
the power-map has to be updated after resume appropriately, but the
current driver doesn't check all pins but only the first pin (since
it's enough to check it for the mute-behavior). This resulted in the
silent output from the secondary outputs after PM resume.
This patch fixes the problem by checking all pins at (re-)init time.

commit 4808d12d1dddb046ec86425e5f6766f02e950292 upstream.
Currently the driver checks only the out\_mix\_path[] for the primary
output route for judging whether to create the loopback-mixing control
or not. But, there are cases where aamix-routing is available only on
headphone or speaker paths but not on the primary output path. So, the

ext4: fix undefined behavior in ext4\_fill\_flex\_info()
commit d50f2ab6f050311dbf7b8f5501b25f0bf64a439b upstream.
Commit 503358ae01b70ce6909d19dd01287093f6b6271c ("ext4: avoid divide by
zero when trying to mount a corrupted file system") fixes CVE-2009-4307
by performing a sanity check on s\_log\_groups\_per\_flex, since it can be
set to a bogus value by an attacker.
sbi->s\_log\_groups\_per\_flex = sbi->s\_es->s\_log\_groups\_per\_flex;
groups\_per\_flex = 1 << sbi->s\_log\_groups\_per\_flex;
if (groups\_per\_flex < 2) { ... }
This patch fixes two potential issues in the previous commit.
1) The sanity check might only work on architectures like PowerPC.
On x86, 5 bits are used for the shifting amount. That means, given a
large s\_log\_groups\_per\_flex value like 36, groups\_per\_flex = 1 << 36
is essentially 1 << 4 = 16, rather than 0. This will bypass the check,
leaving s\_log\_groups\_per\_flex and groups\_per\_flex inconsistent.
2) The sanity check relies on undefined behavior, i.e., oversized shift.
A standard-confirming C compiler could rewrite the check in unexpected
ways. Consider the following equivalent form, assuming groups\_per\_flex
is unsigned for simplicity.
groups\_per\_flex = 1 << sbi->s\_log\_groups\_per\_flex;
if (groups\_per\_flex == 0 || groups\_per\_flex == 1) {
We compile the code snippet using Clang 3.0 and GCC 4.6. Clang will
completely optimize away the check groups\_per\_flex == 0, leaving the
patched code as vulnerable as the original. GCC keeps the check, but
there is no guarantee that future versions will do the same.

mtd: mtd\_blkdevs: don't increase 'open' count on error path
commit 342ff28f5a2e5aa3236617bd2bddf6c749677ef2 upstream.
Some error paths in mtd\_blkdevs were fixed in the following commit:
commit 94735ec4044a6d318b83ad3c5794e931ed168d10
mtd: mtd\_blkdevs: fix error path in blktrans\_open
But on these error paths, the block device's `dev->open' count is
already incremented before we check for errors. This meant that, while
the error path was handled correctly on the first time through
blktrans\_open(), the device is erroneously considered already open on
the second time through.
This problem can be seen, for instance, when a UBI volume is
simultaneously mounted as a UBIFS partition and read through its
corresponding gluebi mtdblockX device. This results in blktrans\_open()
passing its error checks (with `dev->open > 0') without actually having
a handle on the device. Here's a summarized log of the actions and

mtd: mtdoops: skip reading initially bad blocks
commit 3538c56329936c78f7d356889908790006d0124c upstream.
Use block\_isbad to check and skip the bad blocks reading.
This will allow to get rid of the read errors if bad blocks
are present initially.

mtdoops: fix the oops\_page\_used array size
commit 556f063580db2953a7e53cd46b47724246320f60 upstream.
The array of unsigned long pointed by oops\_page\_used is allocated
by vmalloc which requires the size to be in bytes.
BITS\_PER\_LONG is equal to 32.
If we want to allocate memory for 32 pages with one bit per page then
32 / BITS\_PER\_LONG is equal to 1 byte that is 8 bits.
To fix it we need to multiply the result by sizeof(unsigned long) equal to 4.

### Upstream information

[CVE-2011-4913 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-4913)

#### Description

The rose\_parse\_ccitt function in net/rose/rose\_subr.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.39 does not validate the FAC\_CCITT\_DEST\_NSAP and FAC\_CCITT\_SRC\_NSAP fields, which allows remote attackers to (1) cause a denial of service (integer underflow, heap memory corruption, and panic) via a small length value in data sent to a ROSE socket, or (2) conduct stack-based buffer overflow attacks via a large length value in data sent to a ROSE socket.

#### Note from the SUSE Security Team on the xen package

This issue likely only affects the XEN hypervisor itself, unless otherwise stated. The userland utilities in -tools and libraries in -libs are shipped together with the xen hypervisor as they are built from one source and do not contain hypervisor specific fixes.SUSE Bugzilla entry: [730118](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=730118) [RESOLVED / FIXED]

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# CVE-2011-4127

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2011-4121.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2011-4128.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2011-4127 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-4127)

#### Description

The Linux kernel before 3.2.2 does not properly restrict SG\_IO ioctl calls, which allows local users to bypass intended restrictions on disk read and write operations by sending a SCSI command to (1) a partition block device or (2) an LVM volume.

#### Note from the SUSE Security Team on the kernel-default package

SUSE will no longer fix all CVEs in the Linux Kernel anymore, but declare some bug classes as won't fix. Please refer to [TID 21496](https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=000021496) for more details.
#### Note from the SUSE Security Team on the xen package

This issue likely only affects the XEN hypervisor itself, unless otherwise stated. The userland utilities in -tools and libraries in -libs are shipped together with the xen hypervisor as they are built from one source and do not contain hypervisor specific fixes.SUSE Bugzilla entries: [738400](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=738400) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [758104](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=758104) [RESOLVED / FIXED]

in net/rose/rose\_subr.c in the Linux kernel allowed remote attackers
to cause a denial of service (heap memory corruption) or possibly
have unspecified other impact by composing FAC\_NATIONAL\_DIGIS data
that specifies a large number of digipeaters, and then sending this
data to a ROSE socket (bnc#681175).
\* CVE-2011-4913: The rose\_parse\_ccitt function in net/rose/rose\_subr.c
in the Linux kernel did not validate the FAC\_CCITT\_DEST\_NSAP and
FAC\_CCITT\_SRC\_NSAP fields, which allowed remote attackers to (1)
cause a denial of service (integer underflow, heap memory
corruption, and panic) via a small length value in data sent to a
ROSE socket, or (2) conduct stack-based buffer overflow attacks via
a large length value in data sent to a ROSE socket (bnc#681175).
\* CVE-2011-4914: The ROSE protocol implementation in the Linux kernel
did not verify that certain data-length values are consistent with
the amount of data sent, which might allow remote attackers to
obtain sensitive information from kernel memory or cause a denial of
service (out-of-bounds read) via crafted data to a ROSE socket
(bnc#681175).

block: fail SCSI passthrough ioctls on partition devices

```
Linux allows executing the SG_IO ioctl on a partition or LVM volume, and
will pass the command to the underlying block device.  This is
well-known, but it is also a large security problem when (via Unix
permissions, ACLs, SELinux or a combination thereof) a program or user
needs to be granted access only to part of the disk.

This patch lets partitions forward a small set of harmless ioctls;
others are logged with printk so that we can see which ioctls are
actually sent.  In my tests only CDROM_GET_CAPABILITY actually occurred.
Of course it was being sent to a (partition on a) hard disk, so it would
have failed with ENOTTY and the patch isn't changing anything in
practice.  Still, I'm treating it specially to avoid spamming the logs.

In principle, this restriction should include programs running with
CAP_SYS_RAWIO.  If for example I let a program access /dev/sda2 and
/dev/sdb, it still should not be able to read/write outside the
boundaries of /dev/sda2 independent of the capabilities.  However, for
now programs with CAP_SYS_RAWIO will still be allowed to send the
ioctls.  Their actions will still be logged.

This patch does not affect the non-libata IDE driver.  That driver
however already tests for bd != bd->bd_contains before issuing some
ioctl; it could be restricted further to forbid these ioctls even for
programs running with CAP_SYS_ADMIN/CAP_SYS_RAWIO.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=752375#c0)  Petr Matousek    2011-11-09 10:54:36 UTC  ``` Paolo Bonzini of Red Hat found out that the host Linux system allows  executing the SG_IO ioctl on a partition or even on an LVM volume, and will pass the command to the underlying block device. This could be further exploited in the context of virtualization, because virtio disks support a limited form of SCSI passthrough via the SG_IO ioctl. If virtio disk is hosted on a partition or LVM volume with format=raw, tools such as sg_dd can be used to read and write other data on the same disk --- even data that belongs to the host or to other guests.  References: <https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/8/12/218> <https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/8/12/260>   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=752375#c21)  Petr Matousek    2011-11-23 11:10:00 UTC  ``` rhel-5 doesn't implement SG_IO passthrough in virtio-blk (unlike rhel-6) which leaves us with potential local privilege escalation "only".   ```  [Comment 51](show_bug.cgi?id=752375#c51)  Petr Matousek    2011-12-22 10:03:47 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue affects the Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5, 6, and Red Hat Enterprise MRG. This has been addressed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and Red Hat Enterprise MRG via <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0107.html>, <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-1849.html>, and <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0333.html>. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 is now in Production 3 of the maintenance life-cycle, <https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/>, therefore the fix for this issue is not currently planned to be included in the future updates.   ```  [Comment 52](show_bug.cgi?id=752375#c52)  Alasdair Kergon     2011-12-22 15:20:22 UTC  ``` For a storage stack to be vulnerable, every layer must forward the SG_IO ioctls to the layer below it.  Three device-mapper target types are known to do this: linear, multipath and flakey.  If the I/O has to pass through striped, crypt, mirror or snapshot* device-mapper target types or an md software raid layer on its route to disk, any SG_IO will get blocked by those layers and so we believe such configurations are not vulnerable.   ```  [Comment 53](show_bug.cgi?id=752375#c53)  Petr Matousek    2011-12-22 15:32:58 UTC  ``` Issue  It was found that using the SG_IO IOCTL to issue SCSI requests to partitions or LVM volumes resulted in the requests being passed to the underlying block device. If a privileged user only had access to a single partition or LVM volume, they could use this flaw to bypass those restrictions and gain read and write access (and be able to issue other SCSI commands) to the entire block device.  In KVM virtualization environments that use raw format virtio disks backed by a partition or LVM volume, a privileged guest user could use this flaw to bypass intended access restrictions and issue read and write requests (and other SCSI commands) on the host, and possibly access the data of other guests that reside on the same underlying block device. Partition-based and LVM-based storage pools are not used by default. Refer to the "11. Storage pools" chapter of the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 "Virtualization Administration Guide", available from docs.redhat.com, for information about storage pools.  Any driver that uses the SCSI framework is vulnerable. A physical SCSI device is not required to exploit this issue.  Environment  * Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.  * Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor 6.2.  The virtualization aspect of this issue (privileged guests users reading and writing data on the host and other guests on the same underlying block device) does not affect users of KVM (or the Xen hypervisor) on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.  Resolution  The RHSA-2011:1849 update for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 corrected this issue. Future updates will correct this issue for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor 6.2.  It is not possible to use control groups (cgroups) or sVirt mandatory access control to mitigate this issue. For virtualization hosts (including Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor 6.2), before updates are applied, the following SystemTap script prevents privileged guest users from issuing read and write requests (and other SCSI commands) on the host and possibly access the data of other guests that reside on the same underlying block device.  1) On the host, save the following in a file with the ".stp" extension:  #!/usr/sbin/stap -g # Requires guru mode (-g) for target variable writes probe syscall.ioctl {     SG_IO = 0x2285     if($cmd == SG_IO && execname() == "qemu-kvm") {         printf("filtering SG_IO ioctl request from qemu-kvm process %d\n", pid())     $cmd   = 0x0     $fd    = -1     } }  2) Install the "systemtap" package and any required dependencies. Refer to the "2. Using SystemTap" chapter in the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 "SystemTap Beginners Guide" documents, available from docs.redhat.com, for information on installing the required -debuginfo packages.  3) Run the "stap -g [filename-from-step-1].stp" command as root.  If the host is rebooted, the changes will be lost and the script must be run again.

Subject: CVE-2011-4127 kernel: possible privilege escalation via SG_IO ioctl

Paolo Bonzini of Red Hat found out that the host Linux system allows
executing the SG_IO ioctl on a partition or even on an LVM volume, and
will pass the command to the underlying block device. This could be
further exploited in the in the context of virtualization, because
virtio disks support a limited form of SCSI passthrough via the SG_IO
ioctl. If virtio disk is hosted on a partition or LVM volume with
format=raw, tools such as sg_dd can be used to read and write other data
on the same disk --- even data that belongs to the host or to other
guests.
