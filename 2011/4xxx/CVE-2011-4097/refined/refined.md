Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-4097:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an integer overflow in the `oom_badness` function within the Linux kernel's Out-of-Memory (OOM) killer. This function calculates a score to determine which process should be terminated during low memory conditions. The commit f755a04 refactored the oom score calculation and introduced a multiplication operation that, under certain conditions, causes an integer overflow and results in a negative score. This overflow leads to the OOM killer selecting the wrong process for termination.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Integer Overflow:** The core issue is the use of an `int` data type for the `points` variable, which can overflow when multiplied by 1000.  The sum of `rss`, `swapents`, and `nr_ptes` could exceed a value such that the result of `points *= 1000` would exceed the maximum value for an integer on a 64 bit architecture.
- **Incorrect OOM Score:** The integer overflow can lead to a negative value for 'points', which is then handled in the code resulting in an oom score of 1, which is the lowest score possible.
- **Incorrect Process Termination:** Due to the flawed score, the OOM killer might skip a memory-hogging process (which should be killed), and instead kill another, possibly innocent, process with a higher oom score.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service:** The immediate impact is a denial of service as the OOM killer may terminate critical and innocent processes instead of the actual memory hog.
- **System Instability:**  The system becomes unstable when it fails to kill the memory hog and instead terminates other processes, potentially leading to further issues.
- **Unpredictable Process Termination:**  The incorrect scoring can lead to arbitrary process termination, disrupting normal system operation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when the system is under memory pressure and the OOM killer is invoked.
- An attacker could potentially trigger the vulnerability by creating a memory hog process that allocates a very large amount of memory, swap or pte pages

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to execute code on the target system to create a process that consumes a large amount of memory and other resources.
- No specific network access or user privileges are required beyond those required to run a memory intensive process.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix involves changing the `points` variable from `int` to `long` to prevent integer overflows during calculations.
- This vulnerability is specific to 64-bit architectures where the overflow is more likely to happen due to larger address spaces.
- The issue was introduced by the commit `f755a04 oom: use pte pages in OOM score`.
- The vulnerability is present in Linux kernel versions that backported commit `f755a04`, but is absent in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5 and 6, as this commit was not backported to these versions.
