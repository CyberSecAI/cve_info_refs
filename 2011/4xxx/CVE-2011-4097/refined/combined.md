commit [ff05b6f](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/ff05b6f7ae762b6eb464183eec994b28ea09f6dd) upstream.

An integer overflow will happen on 64bit archs if task's sum of rss,
swapents and nr_ptes exceeds (2^31)/1000 value.  This was introduced by
commit

f755a04 oom: use pte pages in OOM score

where the oom score computation was divided into several steps and it's no
longer computed as one expression in unsigned long(rss, swapents, nr_pte
are unsigned long), where the result value assigned to points(int) is in
range(1..1000).  So there could be an int overflow while computing

176          points *= 1000;

and points may have negative value. Meaning the oom score for a mem hog task
will be one.

196          if (points <= 0)
197                  return 1;

For example:
[ 3366]     0  3366 35390480 24303939   5       0             0 oom01
Out of memory: Kill process 3366 (oom01) score 1 or sacrifice child

Here the oom1 process consumes more than 24303939(rss)*4096~=92GB physical
memory, but it's oom score is one.

In this situation the mem hog task is skipped and oom killer kills another and
most probably innocent task with oom score greater than one.

The points variable should be of type long instead of int to prevent the
int overflow.

ath9k: Fix kernel panic in AR2427 in AP mode
commit b25bfda38236f349cde0d1b28952f4eea2148d3f upstream.
don't do aggregation related stuff for 'AP mode client power save
handling' if aggregation is not enabled in the driver, otherwise it
will lead to panic because those data structures won't be never
intialized in 'ath\_tx\_node\_init' if aggregation is disabled

ptrace: ensure JOBCTL\_STOP\_SIGMASK is not zero after detach
commit 8a88951b5878dc475dcd841cefc767e36397d14e upstream.
This is the temporary simple fix for 3.2, we need more changes in this
area.
1. do\_signal\_stop() assumes that the running untraced thread in the
stopped thread group is not possible. This was our goal but it is
not yet achieved: a stopped-but-resumed tracee can clone the running
thread which can initiate another group-stop.
Remove WARN\_ON\_ONCE(!current->ptrace).
2. A new thread always starts with ->jobctl = 0. If it is auto-attached
and this group is stopped, \_\_ptrace\_unlink() sets JOBCTL\_STOP\_PENDING
but JOBCTL\_STOP\_SIGMASK part is zero, this triggers WANR\_ON(!signr)
in do\_jobctl\_trap() if another debugger attaches.
Change \_\_ptrace\_unlink() to set the artificial SIGSTOP for report.
Alternatively we could change ptrace\_init\_task() to copy signr from
current, but this means we can copy it for no reason and hide the
possible similar problems.

commit 9e83ca1fcff0eee2ea7ef2508de95691a0cdeb0c

ptrace: partially fix the do\_wait(WEXITED) vs EXIT\_DEAD->EXIT\_ZOMBIE race
commit 50b8d257486a45cba7b65ca978986ed216bbcc10 upstream.
Test-case:
int main(void)
{
int pid, status;
pid = fork();
if (!pid) {
for (;;) {
if (!fork())
return 0;
if (waitpid(-1, &status, 0) < 0) {
printf("ERR!! wait: %m\n");
return 0;
}
}
}
assert(ptrace(PTRACE\_ATTACH, pid, 0,0) == 0);
assert(waitpid(-1, NULL, 0) == pid);
assert(ptrace(PTRACE\_SETOPTIONS, pid, 0,
PTRACE\_O\_TRACEFORK) == 0);
do {
ptrace(PTRACE\_CONT, pid, 0, 0);
pid = waitpid(-1, NULL, 0);
} while (pid > 0);
return 1;
}
It fails because ->real\_parent sees its child in EXIT\_DEAD state
while the tracer is going to change the state back to EXIT\_ZOMBIE
in wait\_task\_zombie().
The offending commit is 823b018e which moved the EXIT\_DEAD check,
but in fact we should not blame it. The original code was not
correct as well because it didn't take ptrace\_reparented() into
account and because we can't really trust ->ptrace.
This patch adds the additional check to close this particular
race but it doesn't solve the whole problem. We simply can't
rely on ->ptrace in this case, it can be cleared if the tracer
is multithreaded by the exiting ->parent.
I think we should kill EXIT\_DEAD altogether, we should always
remove the soon-to-be-reaped child from ->children or at least
we should never do the DEAD->ZOMBIE transition. But this is too
complex for 3.2.

Revert "rtc: Disable the alarm in the hardware"
commit 157e8bf8b4823bfcdefa6c1548002374b61f61df upstream.
This reverts commit c0afabd3d553c521e003779c127143ffde55a16f.
It causes failures on Toshiba laptops - instead of disabling the alarm,
it actually seems to enable it on the affected laptops, resulting in
(for example) the laptop powering on automatically five minutes after
shutdown.
There's a patch for it that appears to work for at least some people,
but it's too late to play around with this, so revert for now and try
again in the next merge window.

Not doing so can confuse the SCD and make the fw assert.

ipv4: reintroduce route cache garbage collector

Commit 2c8cec5c10b (ipv4: Cache learned PMTU information in inetpeer)
removed IP route cache garbage collector a bit too soon, as this gc was
responsible for expired routes cleanup, releasing their neighbour
reference.
As pointed out by Robert Gladewitz, recent kernels can fill and exhaust
their neighbour cache.
Reintroduce the garbage collection, since we'll have to wait our
neighbour lookups become refcount-less to not depend on this stuff.

This is caused by bridge netfilter special dst\_entry (fake\_rtable), a
special shared entry, where attaching an inetpeer makes no sense.
Problem is present since commit 87c48fa3b46 (ipv6: make fragment
identifications less predictable)
Introduce DST\_NOPEER dst flag and make sure ipv6\_select\_ident() and
\_\_ip\_select\_ident() fallback to the 'no peer attached' handling.

ipv6: Check dest prefix length on original route not copied one in rt6\_alloc\_cow().

for setting the ANYCAST flag is now wrong.
'rt' will always now have a plen of 128, because it is set explicitly

sctp: Do not account for sizeof(struct sk\_buff) in estimated rwnd
[ Upstream commit a76c0adf60f6ca5ff3481992e4ea0383776b24d2 ]
When checking whether a DATA chunk fits into the estimated rwnd a
full sizeof(struct sk\_buff) is added to the needed chunk size. This
quickly exhausts the available rwnd space and leads to packets being
sent which are much below the PMTU limit. This can lead to much worse
performance.
The reason for this behaviour was to avoid putting too much memory
pressure on the receiver. The concept is not completely irational
because a Linux receiver does in fact clone an skb for each DATA chunk
delivered. However, Linux also reserves half the available socket
buffer space for data structures therefore usage of it is already
accounted for.
When proposing to change this the last time it was noted that this
behaviour was introduced to solve a performance issue caused by rwnd
overusage in combination with small DATA chunks.
Trying to reproduce this I found that with the sk\_buff overhead removed,
the performance would improve significantly unless socket buffer limits
are increased.
The following numbers have been gathered using a patched iperf
supporting SCTP over a live 1 Gbit ethernet network. The -l option
was used to limit DATA chunk sizes. The numbers listed are based on
the average of 3 test runs each. Default values have been used for
sk\_(r|w)mem.

sctp: fix incorrect overflow check on autoclose
[ Upstream commit 2692ba61a82203404abd7dd2a027bda962861f74 ]
Commit 8ffd3208 voids the previous patches f6778aab and 810c0719 for
limiting the autoclose value. If userspace passes in -1 on 32-bit
platform, the overflow check didn't work and autoclose would be set
to 0xffffffff.
This patch defines a max\_autoclose (in seconds) for limiting the value
and exposes it through sysctl, with the following intentions.
1) Avoid overflowing autoclose \* HZ.
2) Keep the default autoclose bound consistent across 32- and 64-bit
platforms (INT\_MAX / HZ in this patch).
3) Keep the autoclose value consistent between setsockopt() and
getsockopt() calls.

sparc: Fix handling of orig\_i0 wrt. debugging when restarting syscalls.
[ A combination of upstream commits 1d299bc7732c34d85bd43ac1a8745f5a2fed2078 and
e88d2468718b0789b4c33da2f7e1cef2a1eee279 ]
Although we provide a proper way for a debugger to control whether
syscall restart occurs, we run into problems because orig\_i0 is not
saved and restored properly.
Luckily we can solve this problem without having to make debuggers
aware of the issue. Across system calls, several registers are
considered volatile and can be safely clobbered.
Therefore we use the pt\_regs save area of one of those registers, %g6,
as a place to save and restore orig\_i0.
Debuggers transparently will do the right thing because they save and
restore this register already.

This silently was working for many years and stopped working on

We need to set the MSIQ to VALID before we can set it's state to IDLE.
On Niagara-T3, setting the state to IDLE first was causing HV\_EINVAL
errors. The hypervisor documentation says, rather ambiguously, that
the MSIQ must be "initialized" before one can set the state.
I previously understood this to mean merely that a successful setconf()
operation has been performed on the MSIQ, which we have done at this
point. But it seems to also mean that it has been set VALID too.

commit 8aacc9f550 ("mm/mempolicy.c: fix pgoff in mbind vma merge") is the
slightly incorrect fix.
Why? Think following case.
1. map 4 pages of a file at offset 0
[0123]
2. map 2 pages just after the first mapping of the same file but with
page offset 2
[0123][23]
3. mbind() 2 pages from the first mapping at offset 2.
mbind\_range() should treat new vma is,
[0123][23]
|23|
mbind vma
but it does
[0123][23]
|01|
mbind vma
Oops. then, it makes wrong vma merge and splitting ([01][0123] or similar).
This patch fixes it.

futex: Fix uninterruptible loop due to gate\_area
commit e6780f7243eddb133cc20ec37fa69317c218b709 upstream.
It was found (by Sasha) that if you use a futex located in the gate
area we get stuck in an uninterruptible infinite loop, much like the
ZERO\_PAGE issue.
While looking at this problem, PeterZ realized you'll get into similar
trouble when hitting any install\_special\_pages() mapping. And are there
still drivers setting up their own special mmaps without page->mapping,
and without special VM or pte flags to make get\_user\_pages fail?
In most cases, if page->mapping is NULL, we do not need to retry at all:
Linus points out that even /proc/sys/vm/drop\_caches poses no problem,
because it ends up using remove\_mapping(), which takes care not to
interfere when the page reference count is raised.
But there is still one case which does need a retry: if memory pressure
called shmem\_writepage in between get\_user\_pages\_fast dropping page
table lock and our acquiring page lock, then the page gets switched from
filecache to swapcache (and ->mapping set to NULL) whatever the refcount.
Fault it back in to get the page->mapping needed for key->shared.inode.

oprofile, arm/sh: Fix oprofile\_arch\_exit() linkage issue
commit 55205c916e179e09773d98d290334d319f45ac6b upstream.
This change fixes a linking problem, which happens if oprofile
is selected to be compiled as built-in:
`oprofile\_arch\_exit' referenced in section `.init.text' of
arch/arm/oprofile/built-in.o: defined in discarded section
`.exit.text' of arch/arm/oprofile/built-in.o
The problem is appeared after commit 87121ca504, which
introduced oprofile\_arch\_exit() calls from \_\_init function. Note
that the aforementioned commit has been backported to stable
branches, and the problem is known to be reproduced at least
with 3.0.13 and 3.1.5 kernels.

VFS: Fix race between CPU hotplug and lglocks
commit e30e2fdfe56288576ee9e04dbb06b4bd5f282203 upstream.
Currently, the \*\_global\_[un]lock\_online() routines are not at all synchronized
with CPU hotplug. Soft-lockups detected as a consequence of this race was
reported earlier at https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/8/24/185. (Thanks to Cong Meng
for finding out that the root-cause of this issue is the race condition
between br\_write\_[un]lock() and CPU hotplug, which results in the lock states
getting messed up).
Fixing this race by just adding {get,put}\_online\_cpus() at appropriate places
in \*\_global\_[un]lock\_online() is not a good option, because, then suddenly
br\_write\_[un]lock() would become blocking, whereas they have been kept as
non-blocking all this time, and we would want to keep them that way.
So, overall, we want to ensure 3 things:
1. br\_write\_lock() and br\_write\_unlock() must remain as non-blocking.
2. The corresponding lock and unlock of the per-cpu spinlocks must not happen
for different sets of CPUs.
3. Either prevent any new CPU online operation in between this lock-unlock, or
ensure that the newly onlined CPU does not proceed with its corresponding
per-cpu spinlock unlocked.
To achieve all this:
(a) We introduce a new spinlock that is taken by the \*\_global\_lock\_online()
routine and released by the \*\_global\_unlock\_online() routine.
(b) We register a callback for CPU hotplug notifications, and this callback
takes the same spinlock as above.
(c) We maintain a bitmap which is close to the cpu\_online\_mask, and once it is
initialized in the lock\_init() code, all future updates to it are done in
the callback, under the above spinlock.
(d) The above bitmap is used (instead of cpu\_online\_mask) while locking and
unlocking the per-cpu locks.
The callback takes the spinlock upon the CPU\_UP\_PREPARE event. So, if the
br\_write\_lock-unlock sequence is in progress, the callback keeps spinning,
thus preventing the CPU online operation till the lock-unlock sequence is
complete. This takes care of requirement (3).
The bitmap that we maintain remains unmodified throughout the lock-unlock
sequence, since all updates to it are managed by the callback, which takes
the same spinlock as the one taken by the lock code and released only by the
unlock routine. Combining this with (d) above, satisfies requirement (2).
Overall, since we use a spinlock (mentioned in (a)) to prevent CPU hotplug
operations from racing with br\_write\_lock-unlock, requirement (1) is also
taken care of.
By the way, it is to be noted that a CPU offline operation can actually run
in parallel with our lock-unlock sequence, because our callback doesn't react
to notifications earlier than CPU\_DEAD (in order to maintain our bitmap
properly). And this means, since we use our own bitmap (which is stale, on
purpose) during the lock-unlock sequence, we could end up unlocking the
per-cpu lock of an offline CPU (because we had locked it earlier, when the
CPU was online), in order to satisfy requirement (2). But this is harmless,
though it looks a bit awkward.

After commit 06222e491e663dac939f04b125c9dc52126a75c4 (fs: handle
SEEK\_HOLE/SEEK\_DATA properly in all fs's that define their own llseek)
the behaviour of llseek() was changed so that it always revalidates
the file size. The bug appears to be due to a logic error in the
afore-mentioned commit, which always evaluates to 'true'.

oprofile: Fix uninitialized memory access when writing to writing to oprofilefs
commit 913050b91eb94f194392dd797b1ff3779f606ac0 upstream.
If oprofilefs\_ulong\_from\_user() is called with count equals
zero, \*val remains unchanged. Depending on the implementation it
might be uninitialized.
Change oprofilefs\_ulong\_from\_user()'s interface to return count
on success. Thus, we are able to return early if count equals
zero which avoids using \*val uninitialized. Fixing all users of
oprofilefs\_ulong\_ from\_user().
This follows write syscall implementation when count is zero:
"If count is zero ... [and if] no errors are detected, 0 will be
returned without causing any other effect." (man 2 write)

oom: fix integer overflow of points in oom\_badness
commit ff05b6f7ae762b6eb464183eec994b28ea09f6dd upstream.
An integer overflow will happen on 64bit archs if task's sum of rss,
swapents and nr\_ptes exceeds (2^31)/1000 value. This was introduced by
commit
f755a04 oom: use pte pages in OOM score
where the oom score computation was divided into several steps and it's no
longer computed as one expression in unsigned long(rss, swapents, nr\_pte
are unsigned long), where the result value assigned to points(int) is in
range(1..1000). So there could be an int overflow while computing
176 points \*= 1000;
and points may have negative value. Meaning the oom score for a mem hog task
will be one.
196 if (points <= 0)
197 return 1;
For example:
[ 3366] 0 3366 35390480 24303939 5 0 0 oom01
Out of memory: Kill process 3366 (oom01) score 1 or sacrifice child
Here the oom1 process consumes more than 24303939(rss)\*4096~=92GB physical
memory, but it's oom score is one.
In this situation the mem hog task is skipped and oom killer kills another and
most probably innocent task with oom score greater than one.
The points variable should be of type long instead of int to prevent the
int overflow.

binary\_sysctl(): fix memory leak
commit 3d3c8f93a237b64580c5c5e138edeb1377e98230 upstream.
binary\_sysctl() calls sysctl\_getname() which allocates from names\_cache
slab usin \_\_getname()
The matching function to free the name is \_\_putname(), and not putname()
which should be used only to match getname() allocations.
This is because when auditing is enabled, putname() calls audit\_putname
\*instead\* (not in addition) to \_\_putname(). Then, if a syscall is in
progress, audit\_putname does not release the name - instead, it expects
the name to get released when the syscall completes, but that will happen
only if audit\_getname() was called previously, i.e. if the name was
allocated with getname() rather than the naked \_\_getname(). So,
\_\_getname() followed by putname() ends up leaking memory.

percpu: fix per\_cpu\_ptr\_to\_phys() handling of non-page-aligned addresses
commit 9f57bd4d6dc69a4e3bf43044fa00fcd24dd363e3 upstream.
per\_cpu\_ptr\_to\_phys() incorrectly rounds up its result for non-kmalloc
case to the page boundary, which is bogus for any non-page-aligned
address.
This affects the only in-tree user of this function - sysfs handler
for per-cpu 'crash\_notes' physical address. The trouble is that the
crash\_notes per-cpu variable is not page-aligned:
crash\_notes = 0xc08e8ed4
PER-CPU OFFSET VALUES:
CPU 0: 3711f000
CPU 1: 37129000
CPU 2: 37133000
CPU 3: 3713d000
So, the per-cpu addresses are:
crash\_notes on CPU 0: f7a07ed4 => phys 36b57ed4
crash\_notes on CPU 1: f7a11ed4 => phys 36b4ded4
crash\_notes on CPU 2: f7a1bed4 => phys 36b43ed4
crash\_notes on CPU 3: f7a25ed4 => phys 36b39ed4
However, /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu\*/crash\_notes says:
/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/crash\_notes: 36b57000
/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/crash\_notes: 36b4d000
/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu2/crash\_notes: 36b43000
/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu3/crash\_notes: 36b39000
As you can see, all values are rounded down to a page
boundary. Consequently, this is where kexec sets up the NOTE segments,
and thus where the secondary kernel is looking for them. However, when
the first kernel crashes, it saves the notes to the unaligned
addresses, where they are not found.
Fix it by adding offset\_in\_page() to the translated page address.

In ssb\_pcicore\_fix\_sprom\_core\_index() the sprom on the PCI core is

main system bus. SoCs sometimes have a PCI host controller and there
this code will not be executed, but there are some old SoCs with an PCI
controller in client mode around and ssb\_pcicore\_fix\_sprom\_core\_index()
should not be called on these devices too. The PCI controller on these

mac80211: fix another race in aggregation start
commit 15062e6a8524f5977f2cbdf6e3eb2f144262f74e upstream.
Emmanuel noticed that when mac80211 stops the queues
for aggregation that can leave a packet pending. This
packet will be given to the driver after the AMPDU
callback, but as a non-aggregated packet which messes
up the sequence number etc.
I also noticed by looking at the code that if packets
are being processed while we clear the WANT\_START bit,
they might see it cleared already and queue up on
tid\_tx->pending. If the driver then rejects the new
aggregation session we leak the packet.
Fix both of these issues by changing this code to not
stop the queues at all. Instead, let packets queue up
on the tid\_tx->pending queue instead of letting them
get to the driver, and add code to recover properly
in case the driver rejects the session.
(The patch looks large because it has to move two
functions to before their new use.)

commit 44f747fff6e9f027a4866c1a6864e26ae7c510c8 upstream.
zfcp\_scsi\_slave\_destroy erroneously always tried to finish its task

This zfcp bug is exposed by 4e6c82b (in turn fixing f7c9c6b to be
compatible with 21208ae) which can call slave\_destroy for a
corresponding previous slave\_alloc that did not finish.

cfq-iosched: fix cfq\_cic\_link() race confition
commit 5eb46851de3904cd1be9192fdacb8d34deadc1fc upstream.
cfq\_cic\_link() has race condition. When some processes which shared ioc
issue I/O to same block device simultaneously, cfq\_cic\_link() returns -EEXIST
sometimes. The race condition might stop I/O by following steps:
step 1: Process A: Issue an I/O to /dev/sda
step 2: Process A: Get an ioc (iocA here) in get\_io\_context() which does not
linked with a cic for the device
step 3: Process A: Get a new cic for the device (cicA here) in
cfq\_alloc\_io\_context()
step 4: Process B: Issue an I/O to /dev/sda
step 5: Process B: Get iocA in get\_io\_context() since process A and B share the
same ioc
step 6: Process B: Get a new cic for the device (cicB here) in
cfq\_alloc\_io\_context() since iocA has not been linked with a
cic for the device yet
step 7: Process A: Link cicA to iocA in cfq\_cic\_link()
step 8: Process A: Dispatch I/O to driver and finish it
step 9: Process B: Try to link cicB to iocA in cfq\_cic\_link()
But it fails with showing "cfq: cic link failed!" kernel
message, since iocA has already linked with cicA at step 7.
step 10: Process B: Wait for finishig I/O in get\_request\_wait()
The function does not wake up, when there is no I/O to the
device.
When cfq\_cic\_link() returns -EEXIST, it means ioc has already linked with cic.
So when cfq\_cic\_link() return -EEXIST, retry cfq\_cic\_lookup().

between the power monitoring thread and userspace accesses via debugfs.
The issue can be reproduced easily via the following command:
while ``; do cat /sys/kernel/debug/dri/0/i915\_emon\_status; done
This is particularly dangerous because it can be triggered by
a non-privileged user by just reading the debugfs entry.

rtc: m41t80: Workaround broken alarm functionality
commit c3b79770e51ab1fd4201f3b54edf30113b9ce74f upstream.
The m41t80 driver can read and set the alarm, but it doesn't
seem to have a functional alarm irq.
This causes failures when the generic core sees alarm functions,
but then cannot use them properly for things like UIE mode.
Disabling the alarm functions allows proper error reporting,
and possible fallback to emulated modes. Once someone fixes
the alarm irq functionality, this can be restored.

ipip, sit: copy parms.name after register\_netdevice
commit 72b36015ba43a3cca5303f5534d2c3e1899eae29 upstream.
Same fix as 731abb9cb2 for ipip and sit tunnel.
Commit 1c5cae815d removed an explicit call to dev\_alloc\_name in
ipip\_tunnel\_locate and ipip6\_tunnel\_locate, because register\_netdevice
will now create a valid name, however the tunnel keeps a copy of the
name in the private parms structure. Fix this by copying the name back
after register\_netdevice has successfully returned.
This shows up if you do a simple tunnel add, followed by a tunnel show:

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=750399#c0)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2011-11-01 00:36:33 UTC  ``` <https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/10/31/138> An integer overflow will happen on 64bit archs if task's sum of rss, swapents and nr_ptes exceeds (2^31)/1000 value. This was introduced by commit f755a04 oom: use pte pages in OOM score  where the oom score computation was divided into several steps and it's no longer computed as one expression in unsigned long(rss, swapents, nr_pte are unsigned long), where the result value assigned to points(int) is in range(1..1000). So there could be an int overflow while computing  176          points *= 1000;  and points may have negative value. Meaning the oom score for a mem hog task will be one.  196          if (points <= 0) 197                  return 1; For example: [ 3366]     0  3366 35390480 24303939   5       0             0 oom01 Out of memory: Kill process 3366 (oom01) score 1 or sacrifice child  Here the oom1 process consumes more than 24303939(rss)*4096~=92GB physical memory, but it's oom score is one.  In this situation the mem hog task is skipped and oom killer kills another and most probably innocent task with oom score greater than one.  The points variable should be of type long instead of int to prevent the int overflow.
