# Administrators masquerading as other users can jump to remote XMLRPC applications as that other user

Bug #884223 reported by

### Bug Description

With MNet set up, if a user logs in as another user, and jumps to an XMLRPC target, they're logged in to that target as the child user in the login as.

This really shouldn't be the case. If a two application are joined but have different administrators, then this would potentially allow for privilege escalation.

If the local application administrator knows of an account which is an administrator on a remote application, then they could log in as that user on the local application, and jump to the remote application thereby escalating their privileges.

After chatting to David Mudrak, I've changed my mind on this one.

I'm updating my patch to completely prevent jumps.

The reasoning behind this is that

\* users may be confused when jumping as a masqueraded user and not arriving as that user

\* the session could potentially get into a weird state and have a knock-on effect with portfolio export etc.

Yeh, this is annoying. We should also make a similar bug in moodle and any other application that jumps into mahara?

Andrew, you fixed the spelling, but went back to jumping as the parent user.

I think I'd rather live with the bad spelling :)

![Continuous single line drawing of a person working on a laptop](https://mahara.org/theme/mahara-org/images/dashboard-person-desktop.svg)

## Create portfolios

Using Mahara, students and staff create their personal learning stories by uploading evidence of activities they have participated in, and embedding publicly accessible content they have previously put online. They can write reflections on their experiences that frame this evidence, map it to competencies or registration requirements, and provide necessary context.

Mahara can be used for many different portfolio purposes, such as study, professional development, work-integrated learning, assessment, showcase and presentation, and employability.

[Learn about the portfolio options](https://mahara.org/view/view.php?id=137010)

## Share work

Mahara allows portfolios to be shared flexibly with one person, a specific group of people, or the entire world. Access can be further restricted to a particular time frame or just within an assessment task.

[Find out about sharing portfolios](https://mahara.org/view/view.php?id=137011)

![Continuous single line drawing of a group of people sitting around a laptop in discussion](https://mahara.org/theme/mahara-org/images/dashboard-group-desktop.svg)

## Engage with others

Mahara makes it easy to comment and give feedback. Portfolios can also be submitted to learning management systems via LTI (Learning Tools Interoperability) for marking.

Groups in Mahara allow people to create portfolios collaboratively and engage in forum discussions.

## Listen to portfolio stories

In our podcast 'Create. Share. Engage.' portfolio practitioners, researchers, learning designers, and portfolio authors share their journey. Learn how they navigate the many different facets of portfolios in general, and Mahara specifically.

| Category: | Privilege Escalation |
| --- | --- |
| Severity: | Low |
| Versions affected: | < 1.3.7, < 1.4.1 |
| Reported by: | Mahara Team |
| Identifier: | [CVE-2011-4118](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2011-4118) |
| Bug report: | [884223](https://bugs.launchpad.net/mahara/%2Bbug/884223) |

It has come to our attention that MNet offers Mahara administrators the ability to potentially escalate their privileges onto MNet peers by masquerading as other Mahara users before jumping to a remote site.

All Mahara sites which have MNet enabled are encouraged to upgrade to the latest version in addition to making sure that only a small number of trusted users have site administration rights.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

blists is a registered project with

# Administrators masquerading as other users can jump to remote XMLRPC applications as that other user

Bug #884223 reported by
[Andrew Nicols](https://launchpad.net/~dobedobedoh)
on 2011-10-31

|  | [Mahara](https://bugs.launchpad.net/mahara) | Fix Released | High | [Andrew Nicols](https://launchpad.net/~dobedobedoh) | [Mahara 1.4.1](https://launchpad.net/mahara/%2Bmilestone/1.4.1) |

### Bug Description

With MNet set up, if a user logs in as another user, and jumps to an XMLRPC target, they're logged in to that target as the child user in the login as.

This really shouldn't be the case. If a two application are joined but have different administrators, then this would potentially allow for privilege escalation.

If the local application administrator knows of an account which is an administrator on a remote application, then they could log in as that user on the local application, and jump to the remote application thereby escalating their privileges.

After chatting to David Mudrak, I've changed my mind on this one.

I'm updating my patch to completely prevent jumps.

The reasoning behind this is that

\* users may be confused when jumping as a masqueraded user and not arriving as that user

\* the session could potentially get into a weird state and have a knock-on effect with portfolio export etc.

Yeh, this is annoying. We should also make a similar bug in moodle and any other application that jumps into mahara?

Andrew, you fixed the spelling, but went back to jumping as the parent user.

I think I'd rather live with the bad spelling :)
