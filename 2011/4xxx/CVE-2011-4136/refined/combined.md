                 CVE-2011-4140
Debian Bug     : 641405

Paul McMillan, Mozilla and the Django core team discovered several
vulnerabilities in Django, a Python web framework:

CVE-2011-4136

  When using memory-based sessions and caching, Django sessions are
  stored directly in the root namespace of the cache. When user data is
  stored in the same cache, a remote user may take over a session.

CVE-2011-4137, CVE-2011-4138

  Django's field type URLfield by default checks supplied URL's by
  issuing a request to it, which doesn't time out. A Denial of Service
  is possible by supplying specially prepared URL's that keep the
  connection open indefinately or fill the Django's server memory.

CVE-2011-4139

  Django used X-Forwarded-Host headers to construct full URL's. This
  header may not contain trusted input and could be used to poison the
  cache.

CVE-2011-4140

  The CSRF protection mechanism in Django does not properly handle
  web-server configurations supporting arbitrary HTTP Host headers,
  which allows remote attackers to trigger unauthenticated forged
  requests.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.2-1+lenny3.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.3-3+squeeze2.

For the testing (wheezy) and unstable distribution (sid), this problem
has been fixed in version 1.3.1-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your python-django packages.

For those that are going to prepare updates it may be useful to note that
a correction release to the original announcement has been posted a day
later:
<https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2011/sep/10/127/>

Subject: CVE Request -- Django: v1.3.1, v1.2.7 multiple security flaws

Hello Josh, Steve, vendors,

   multiple security flaws have been recently addressed in the v1.3.1
and v1.2.7 versions of the Django Python Web framework (from [1]):
1, Session manipulation,
2, Denial of service attack via URLField,
3, URLField redirection,
4, Host header cache poisoning,
5, Host header and CSRF,
6, Cross-subdomain CSRF attacks,
7, DEBUG pages and sensitive POST data

References:
[1] <https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2011/sep/09/>
[2] <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=737366>

Could you allocate a CVE ids for these flaws?

Thank you && Regards, Jan.

## Django 1.2.7 released

Posted by **James Bennett** on Sept. 10, 2011

[Yesterday's security disclosure](https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2011/sep/09/security-releases-issued/) included a release -- Django 1.2.6 -- from the Django 1.2 release branch. Although the release branch itself, and [the 1.2.6 release tag](https://code.djangoproject.com/browser/django/tags/releases/1.2.6/) in the Django repository, both contain the patches for the security issues, it has come to our attention that the release package itself was missing at least some of those patches.

To remedy this, we are immediately issuing Django 1.2.7, which is simply the (correct, as it includes all security patches) state of the current 1.2 release branch. All users of the Django 1.2 series are urged to upgrade immediately.

To obtain Django 1.2.7:

* Download [the 1.2.7 package](https://www.djangoproject.com/m/releases/1.2/Django-1.2.7.tar.gz).
* Verify the package using [the signed checksums for 1.2.7](https://www.djangoproject.com/m/pgp/Django-1.2.7.checksum.txt).

We apologize for any inconvenience caused by this issue.

No there aren't particular Fedora release specific bugs (since the updates were scheduled sooner than this main bug existed).  > I'm interested in > the fix for EPEL, and I'd like to help with the testing if possible.  But looks the latest version in EPEL-6 is still Django-v1.2.6 based, thus created new one (previous comment) to ensure update to v1.2.7.  Hope this helps, Jan.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=737366#c8)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-10-19 13:25:04 UTC  ``` The CVE identifiers: [CVE-2011-4136](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-4136), [CVE-2011-4137](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-4137), [CVE-2011-4138](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-4138), [CVE-2011-4139](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-4139), [CVE-2011-4140](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-4140) with the following description have been assigned to these issues by Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures:  1) * Name: CVE-2011-4136:  django.contrib.sessions in Django before 1.2.7 and 1.3.x before 1.3.1, when session data is stored in the cache, uses the root namespace for both session identifiers and application-data keys, which allows remote attackers to modify a session by triggering use of a key that is equal to that session's identifier.
