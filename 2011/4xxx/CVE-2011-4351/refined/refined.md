Based on the provided content, here's the analysis of CVE-2011-4351:

**Verification:**

1. The content from seclists.org specifically mentions "NGS00144 Patch Notification: FFmpeg Libavcodec buffer overflow remote code execution" and identifies "FFmpeg < 0.7.8" as vulnerable.
2. The content from www.ffmpeg.org lists versions and CVEs fixed by each version but this does not include CVE-2011-4351 since the fix occurred in a version predating the listing.

Therefore the seclists content is deemed relevant to CVE-2011-4351

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- A buffer overflow vulnerability exists within the Libavcodec component of FFmpeg.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Buffer Overflow:** The core vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the Libavcodec library. This means that the program writes data beyond the allocated buffer, potentially overwriting adjacent memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system. This could lead to complete compromise of the system, allowing the attacker to take full control.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Media File Processing:** The attack vector involves processing a specially crafted media file. FFmpeg is used to decode or process various media formats; therefore, a malicious media file can trigger the buffer overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Crafted Media File:** The attacker must create a specific media file designed to trigger the buffer overflow.
- **Victim Must Process the File:** The victim must use a vulnerable version of FFmpeg (versions prior to 0.7.8) to process the malicious media file for the exploit to be effective. This could be through direct media playback or conversion via affected libraries

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was discovered by Phillip Langlois of NGS Secure.
- The vulnerability was fixed in FFmpeg versions 0.7.8 and 0.8.7.
- NGS Secure initially withheld the vulnerability details for three months to allow users to apply the patch, which is a sign of responsible disclosure.
- The details of this buffer overflow vulnerability were withheld for three months, likely before full public disclosure.
