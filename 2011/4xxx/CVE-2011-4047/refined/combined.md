## Dell KACE K2000 Appliance database administration account allows arbitrary command execution

#### Vulnerability Note VU#589089

Original Release Date: 2011-11-08 | Last Revised: 2011-11-08

---

### Overview

The Dell KACE K2000 System Deployment Appliance contains a vulnerability that could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on an affected device.

### Description

| The Dell KACE K2000 Deployment Appliance is an integrated systems provisioning product for large-scale operating systems deployment. The database configuration supplied with some versions of the K2000 appliance includes an administrative account with a known username and discernible password. A remote attacker with the ability to connect to the database component may be able to inject commands into a specific database table that will then be executed with administrative privileges by the Task Processor component of the appliance.  Note that systems are only vulnerable if remote access to the database has been enabled. By default, remote access to the included database server is not enabled, however, an attacker may be able to leverage a separate vulnerability (e.g., VU#135606) to enable this access. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker with access to the database component may be able to execute arbitrary programs with root privileges on an affected device. |
| --- |

### Solution

| We are currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem. |
