Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2011-4104:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the unsafe use of `yaml.load` in the deserialization of YAML data within both Django-Piston and Django-Tastypie frameworks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Unsafe Deserialization:** The use of `yaml.load` allows for the execution of arbitrary code embedded within the YAML data being processed. This is because `yaml.load` can instantiate Python objects, potentially malicious ones if crafted by an attacker, which allows for arbitrary code execution.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization/Validation:** The vulnerability exists because the applications did not sanitize or validate the YAML input before deserializing it, allowing for malicious payloads to be processed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution on the server by sending a specially crafted YAML payload. This means the attacker could potentially take complete control of the server, access sensitive data, modify data, or cause denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a malicious YAML payload via an HTTP POST request to the vulnerable application.
- **YAML Deserialization:** The attack relies on the vulnerable application's use of the `yaml.load` function to deserialize the attacker-controlled YAML data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable Django application.
- **Knowledge of API:** The attacker needs to be aware that the API endpoint consumes YAML data for exploitation.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix for this vulnerability is to replace the unsafe `yaml.load` with `yaml.safe_load`, which only loads basic Python data structures, thus preventing arbitrary code execution.
- The vulnerability is present in Piston and Tastypie, which are popular third-party REST API frameworks for Django.
- Servers without the yaml module installed are not affected, however, upgrading is still recommended for all users of the vulnerable libraries.
