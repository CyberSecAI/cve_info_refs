#### Vulnerability Note VU#924307

Original Release Date: 2011-10-10 | Last Revised: 2011-10-10

---

### Overview

The [D-Link DIR-685 Xtreme N storage router](http://www.dlink.com/products/?pid=DIR-685&tab=3) is reported to fail open to an unencrypted wireless connection during heavy network load.

### Description

| The [D-Link DIR-685 Xtreme N storage router](http://www.dlink.com/products/?pid=DIR-685&tab=3) when configured with WPA/WPA2 and an AES cipher with a pre-shared key (PSK) will fail to an open unencrypted wireless connection during heavy network load, such as, the transfer of several gigabytes of data. The router's wireless connection will remain in an open unencrypted state until the device is rebooted. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker within physical range of the wireless router may be able to connect to the router's network without having to authenticate and then sniff traffic and also use the victim's Internet connection to launch other attacks. |
| --- |

### Solution

| We are currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem. |
