{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `journal_unmap_buffer()` function in the Linux kernel's jbd2 (journaling block device) subsystem does not properly clear the `_Delay` or `_Unwritten` flags of a buffer head during a buffer unmap operation. Some parts of the ext4 filesystem code assume that if a buffer is marked with these flags it is a live buffer and do not check if it's mapped, which can lead to system crashes.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The `journal_unmap_buffer()` function partially tears down buffer head states but does not completely clear out flags associated with buffer validity.",
      "Ext4 code incorrectly assumes the validity of buffer heads solely based on flags, without verifying if they are mapped."
    ],
    "impact": "A local, unprivileged user can exploit this flaw to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) by crashing the system. This could occur on systems that have an ext4 filesystem with a journal mounted.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access is required. An unprivileged local user triggers specific filesystem access patterns to reach a vulnerable code path."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An unprivileged local user."
