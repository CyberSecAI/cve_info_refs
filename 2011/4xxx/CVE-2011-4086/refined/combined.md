| [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=806722#c13)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2012-04-20 04:41:48 UTC  ``` Reported by Steve Grubb, if a process increases permissions using fcaps all of the dangerous personality flags which are cleared for suid apps should also be cleared. Thus for example programs given privilege with fcaps will continue to have address space randomization enabled even if the parent tried to disable it to make it easier to attack.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=806722#c14)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2012-04-20 04:48:10 UTC  ``` Upstream commit: <http://git.kernel.org/linus/d52fc5dde171f030170a6cb78034d166b13c9445>   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=806722#c15)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2012-04-20 04:51:19 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect the Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, and 5.

But rpm might get upgraded and some package from Fedora becomes a RHEL6 rebase and then we have the problem. Or maybe the software stacks pulls one in. But we still want to fix it.  Fedora 15 is where we started shipping packages that take advantage of the file system based capabilities. And since RHEL7-alpha is an import of F16/17, it certainly has the issue.   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=806722#c18)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2012-04-20 04:59:06 UTC  ``` Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 814523](show_bug.cgi?id=814523 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2012-2123 kernel: fcaps: clear the same personality flags as suid when fcaps are used [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=806722#c19)  Kurt Seifried    2012-04-20 04:59:37 UTC  ``` Added CVE as per <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2012/04/20/6>   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=806722#c20)  Josh Boyer    2012-04-20 12:17:09 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #14](show_bug.cgi?id=806722#c14)) > Upstream commit: > <http://git.kernel.org/linus/d52fc5dde171f030170a6cb78034d166b13c9445>  You probably also want:  <http://git.kernel.org/linus/51b79bee627d526199b2f6a6bef8ee0c0739b6d1>  to fix a non-x86 build error.   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=806722#c21)  Fedora Update System    2012-04-24 04:30:00 UTC  ``` kernel-3.3.2-8.fc17 has been pushed to the Fedora 17 stable repository.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=749143#c0)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2011-10-26 10:07:49 UTC  ``` journal_unmap_buffer()'s zap_buffer: code clears a lot of buffer head state ala discard_buffer(), but does not touch _Delay or _Unwritten as discard_buffer() does.  This can be problematic in some areas of the ext4 code which assume that if they have found a buffer marked unwritten or delay, then it's a live one.  They do not check whether a buffer is mapped, so jbd2's partial teardown can be problematic if they assume that this buffer head is still valid.  (Mounting without a journal also avoids the bug, because with no journal we go to unmap_buffer(), which does the right thing).  An unprivileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=749143#c9)  Petr Matousek    2012-02-07 21:53:41 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 560073](attachment.cgi?id=560073 "CVE-2011 4086-proposed patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=560073&action=edit "CVE-2011 4086-proposed patch") CVE-2011 4086-proposed patch   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=749143#c11)  Petr Matousek    2012-02-07 21:56:35 UTC  ``` Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 788260](show_bug.cgi?id=788260 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2011-4086 kernel: jbd2: unmapped buffer with _Unwritten or _Delay flags set can lead to DoS [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=749143#c15)  Petr Matousek    2012-02-08 08:11:21 UTC  ``` Upstream proposed patch:  <http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.file-systems.ext4/30623>   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=749143#c17)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-02-09 16:41:30 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2012:0107 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0107.html>   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=749143#c18)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2012-02-15 06:04:40 UTC  ``` Statement:  This has been addressed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and Red Hat Enterprise MRG via <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0107.html>, <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0571.html>, and <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0670.html>.

## Topic

Updated kernel-rt packages that fix two security issues and various bugs
are now available for Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.1.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The kernel-rt packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

This update fixes the following security issues:

* When a set user ID (setuid) application is executed, certain personality

flags for controlling the application's behavior are cleared (that is, a
privileged application will not be affected by those flags). It was found
that those flags were not cleared if the application was made privileged
via file system capabilities. A local, unprivileged user could use this
flaw to change the behavior of such applications, allowing them to bypass
intended restrictions. Note that for default installations, no application
shipped by Red Hat for Red Hat Enterprise MRG is made privileged via file
system capabilities. (CVE-2012-2123, Important)

* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's journal\_unmap\_buffer()

function handled buffer head states. On systems that have an ext4 file
system with a journal mounted, a local, unprivileged user could use this
flaw to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2011-4086, Moderate)

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* The CAP\_SYS\_ADMIN check was missing from the dmesg\_restrict feature.

Consequently, an unprivileged and jailed root user could bypass the
dmesg\_restrict protection. This update adds CAP\_SYS\_ADMIN to both
dmesg\_restrict and kptr\_restrict, which only allows writing to
dmesg\_restrict when root has CAP\_SYS\_ADMIN. (BZ#808271)

* Previously, the \_copy\_from\_pages() function, which is used to copy data

from the temporary buffer to the user-passed buffer, was passed the wrong
size parameter when copying data. Consequently, if the user provided a
buffer greater than PAGE\_SIZE, the getxattr() syscalls were handled
incorrectly. This update fixes \_copy\_from\_pages() to use the ACL length,
which uses a correctly-sized buffer. (BZ#753230)

* Some older versions of hardware or their software could not recognize

certain commands and would log messages for illegal or unsupported errors
the driver could not properly handle. This bug has been fixed and no bogus
error messages are now returned in the described scenario. (BZ#813892)

* Previously, the qla2x00\_poll() function did the local\_irq\_save() call

before calling qla24xx\_intr\_handler(), which had a spinlock. Since
spinlocks are sleepable in the real-time kernel, it is not allowed to call
them with interrupts disabled. This scenario produced error messages and
could cause a system deadlock. With this update, the
local\_irq\_save\_nort(flags) function is used to save flags without disabling
interrupts, which prevents potential deadlocks and removes the error
messages. (BZ#818220)

Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which correct these issues.
The system must be rebooted for this update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>

To install kernel packages manually, use "rpm -ivh [package]". Do not
use "rpm -Uvh" as that will remove the running kernel binaries from
your system. You may use "rpm -e" to remove old kernels after
determining that the new kernel functions properly on your system.

Package        : linux-2.6
Vulnerability  : privilege escalation/denial of service
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2011-4086 CVE-2012-0879 CVE-2012-1601 CVE-2012-2123
                 CVE-2012-2133

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead
to a denial of service or privilege escalation. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2011-4086

    Eric Sandeen reported an issue in the journaling layer for EXT4 filesystems
    (jbd2). Local users can cause buffers to be accessed after they have been
    torn down, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) due to a system crash.

CVE-2012-0879

    Louis Rilling reported two reference counting issues in the CLONE_IO
    feature of the kernel. Local users can prevent io context structures
    from being freed, resulting in a denial of service.

CVE-2012-1601

    Michael Ellerman reported an issue in the KVM subsystem. Local users could
    cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference) by creating VCPUs
    before a call to KVM_CREATE_IRQCHIP.

CVE-2012-2123

    Steve Grubb reported in an issue in fcaps, a filesystem-based capabilities
    system. Personality flags set using this mechanism, such as the disabling
    of address space randomization, may persist across suid calls.

CVE-2012-2133

    Shachar Raindel discovered a use-after-free bug in the hugepages
    quota implementation. Local users with permission to use hugepages
    via the hugetlbfs implementation may be able to cause a denial of
    service (system crash).

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in version
2.6.32-44. Updates are currently only available for the amd64, i386 and sparc
ports.

NOTE: Updated linux-2.6 packages will also be made available in the release
of Debian 6.0.5, scheduled to take place the weekend of 2012.05.12. This
pending update will be version 2.6.32-45, and provides an additional fix for
build failures on some architectures. Users for whom this update is not
critical, and who may wish to avoid multiple reboots, should consider waiting
for the 6.0.5 release before updating, or installing the 2.6.32-45 version
ahead of time from proposed-updates.

The following matrix lists additional source packages that were rebuilt for
compatibility with or to take advantage of this update:

                                             Debian 6.0 (squeeze)
     user-mode-linux                         2.6.32-1um-4+44

We recommend that you upgrade your linux-2.6 and user-mode-linux packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Additional info: This core issue is also present on all other kernel variants, but kernel-rt-debug is the one which complains about sleeping function being called from wrong context.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=818220#c3)  David Sommerseth    2012-05-09 10:57:51 UTC  ``` Verified by booting kernel-rt-debug kernels on a box with a qla2xxx adapter.  Double checked that 3.0.25-rt44.57.el6rt.x86_64.debug provides the backtrace, which still was the issue.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

An update that solves 9 vulnerabilities and has 82 fixes is
now available. It includes one version update.
Description:
The SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 SP2 kernel has been updated to
3.0.26, which fixes a lot of bugs and security issues.
The following security issues have been fixed:
\* CVE-2012-1179: A locking problem in transparent
hugepage support could be used by local attackers to
potentially crash the host, or via kvm a privileged guest
user could crash the kvm host system.
\* CVE-2011-4127: A potential hypervisor escape by
issuing SG\_IO commands to partitiondevices was fixed by
restricting access to these commands.
\* CVE-2012-1146: A local attacker could oops the kernel
using memory control groups and eventfds.
\* CVE-2011-1083: Limit the path length users can build
using epoll() to avoid local attackers consuming lots of
kernel CPU time.
\* CVE-2012-1097: The regset common infrastructure
assumed that regsets would always have .get and .set
methods, but necessarily .active methods. Unfortunately
people have since written regsets without .set method, so
NULL pointer dereference attacks were possible.
\* CVE-2011-2494: Access to the /proc/pid/taskstats file
requires root access to avoid side channel (timing
keypresses etc.) attacks on other users.
\* CVE-2011-4086: Fixed a oops in jbd/jbd2 that could be
caused by specific filesystem access patterns.
\* CVE-2011-4131: A malicious NFSv4 server could have
caused a oops in the nfsv4 acl handling.
\* CVE-2011-4132: Fixed a oops in jbd/jbd2 that could be
caused by mounting a malicious prepared filesystem.
(Also included are all fixes from the 3.0.14 -> 3.0.25
stable kernel updates.)

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=749143#c0)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2011-10-26 10:07:49 UTC  ``` journal_unmap_buffer()'s zap_buffer: code clears a lot of buffer head state ala discard_buffer(), but does not touch _Delay or _Unwritten as discard_buffer() does.  This can be problematic in some areas of the ext4 code which assume that if they have found a buffer marked unwritten or delay, then it's a live one.  They do not check whether a buffer is mapped, so jbd2's partial teardown can be problematic if they assume that this buffer head is still valid.  (Mounting without a journal also avoids the bug, because with no journal we go to unmap_buffer(), which does the right thing).

# RHSA-2012:0571 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Moderate: kernel security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A0571)

## Topic

Updated kernel packages that fix two security issues and several bugs are
now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

This update fixes the following security issues:

* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's journal\_unmap\_buffer()

function handled buffer head states. On systems that have an ext4 file
system with a journal mounted, a local, unprivileged user could use this
flaw to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2011-4086, Moderate)

* A flaw was found in the way the KVM\_CREATE\_IRQCHIP ioctl was handled.

Calling this ioctl when at least one virtual CPU (VCPU) already existed
could lead to a NULL pointer dereference later when the VCPU is scheduled
to run. A local, unprivileged user on a KVM host could use this flaw to
crash the host. (CVE-2012-1601, Moderate)

This update also fixes several bugs. Documentation for these changes will
be available shortly from the Technical Notes document linked to in the
References section.

Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported
patches to correct these issues, and fix the bugs noted in the Technical
Notes. The system must be rebooted for this update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>

To install kernel packages manually, use "rpm -ivh [package]". Do not
use "rpm -Uvh" as that will remove the running kernel binaries from
your system. You may use "rpm -e" to remove old kernels after
determining that the new kernel functions properly on your system.

An update that solves 8 vulnerabilities and has 60 fixes is
now available. It includes one version update.
Description:
The SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 SP1 kernel have been updated
to the 2.6.32.59 stable release to fix a lot of bugs and
security issues.
The following security issues have been fixed:
\* CVE-2012-2133: A use after free bug in hugetlb
support could be used by local attackers to crash the
system.
\* CVE-2012-1097: A null pointer dereference bug in the
regsets proc file could be used by local attackers to
perhaps crash the system. With mmap\_min\_addr is set and
enabled, exploitation is unlikely.
\* CVE-2012-0879: A reference counting issue in CLONE\_IO
could be used by local attackers to cause a denial of
service (out of memory).
\* CVE-2012-1090: A file handle leak in CIFS code could
be used by local attackers to crash the system.
\* CVE-2011-1083: Large nested epoll chains could be
used by local attackers to cause a denial of service
(excessive CPU consumption).
\* CVE-2011-4622: When using KVM, programming a PIT
timer without a irqchip configuration, can be used to crash
the kvm guest. This likely can be done only by a privileged
guest user.
\* CVE-2012-0045: A KVM 32bit guest crash in "syscall"
opcode handling was fixed that could be caused by local
attackers.
\* CVE-2011-4086: Fixed a oops in jbd/jbd2 that could be
caused by specific filesystem access patterns.

ASPM: Fix pcie devices with non-pcie children
commit c9651e70ad0aa499814817cbf3cc1d0b806ed3a1 upstream.
Since 3.2.12 and 3.3, some systems are failing to boot with a BUG\_ON.
Some other systems using the pata\_jmicron driver fail to boot because no
disks are detected. Passing pcie\_aspm=force on the kernel command line
works around it.
The cause: commit 4949be16822e ("PCI: ignore pre-1.1 ASPM quirking when
ASPM is disabled") changed the behaviour of pcie\_aspm\_sanity\_check() to
always return 0 if aspm is disabled, in order to avoid cases where we
changed ASPM state on pre-PCIe 1.1 devices.
This skipped the secondary function of pcie\_aspm\_sanity\_check which was
to avoid us enabling ASPM on devices that had non-PCIe children, causing
trouble later on. Move the aspm\_disabled check so we continue to honour
that scenario.

serial: sh-sci: fix a race of DMA submit\_tx on transfer
commit 49d4bcaddca977fffdea8b0b71f6e5da96dac78e upstream.
When DMA is enabled, sh-sci transfer begins with
uart\_start()
sci\_start\_tx()
if (cookie\_tx < 0) schedule\_work()
Then, starts DMA when wq scheduled, -- (A)
process\_one\_work()
work\_fn\_rx()
cookie\_tx = desc->submit\_tx()
And finishes when DMA transfer ends, -- (B)
sci\_dma\_tx\_complete()
async\_tx\_ack()
cookie\_tx = -EINVAL
(possible another schedule\_work())
This A to B sequence is not reentrant, since controlling variables
(for example, cookie\_tx above) are not queues nor lists. So, they
must be invoked as A B A B..., otherwise results in kernel crash.
To ensure the sequence, sci\_start\_tx() seems to test if cookie\_tx < 0
(represents "not used") to call schedule\_work().
But cookie\_tx will not be set (to a cookie, also means "used") until
in the middle of work queue scheduled function work\_fn\_tx().
This gap between the test and set allows the breakage of the sequence
under the very frequently call of uart\_start().
Another gap between async\_tx\_ack() and another schedule\_work() results
in the same issue, too.
This patch introduces a new condition "cookie\_tx == 0" just to mark
it is "busy" and assign it within spin-locked region to fill the gaps.

Commit 4a53f4e "USB: ehci-tegra: add probing through device tree" added
AUXDATA for Tegra's USB/EHCI controller. However, it pointed the platform
data at a location containing the address of the intended platform data,

rtc: Provide flag for rtc devices that don't support UIE
commit 4a649903f91232d02284d53724b0a45728111767 upstream.
Richard Weinberger noticed that on some RTC hardware that
doesn't support UIE mode, due to coarse granular alarms
(like 1minute resolution), the current virtualized RTC
support doesn't properly error out when UIE is enabled.
Instead the current code queues an alarm for the next second,
but it won't fire until up to a miniute later.
This patch provides a generic way to flag this sort of hardware
and fixes the issue on the mpc5121 where Richard noticed the
problem.

compat: use sys\_sendfile64() implementation for sendfile syscall
commit 1631fcea8399da5e80a80084b3b8c5bfd99d21e7 upstream.
 was set up to use sys\_sendfile() for the 32-bit
compat API instead of sys\_sendfile64(), but in fact the right thing to
do is to use sys\_sendfile64() in all cases. The 32-bit sendfile64() API
in glibc uses the sendfile64 syscall, so it has to be capable of doing
full 64-bit operations. But the sys\_sendfile() kernel implementation
has a MAX\_NON\_LFS test in it which explicitly limits the offset to 2^32.
So, we need to use the sys\_sendfile64() implementation in the kernel
for this case.

x86, tsc: Skip refined tsc calibration on systems with reliable TSC
commit 57779dc2b3b75bee05ef5d1ada47f615f7a13932 upstream.
While running the latest Linux as guest under VMware in highly
over-committed situations, we have seen cases when the refined TSC
algorithm fails to get a valid tsc\_start value in
tsc\_refine\_calibration\_work from multiple attempts. As a result the
kernel keeps on scheduling the tsc\_irqwork task for later. Subsequently
after several attempts when it gets a valid start value it goes through
the refined calibration and either bails out or uses the new results.
Given that the kernel originally read the TSC frequency from the
platform, which is the best it can get, I don't think there is much
value in refining it.
So for systems which get the TSC frequency from the platform we
should skip the refined tsc algorithm.
We can use the TSC\_RELIABLE cpu cap flag to detect this, right now it is
set only on VMware and for Moorestown Penwell both of which have there
own TSC calibration methods.

net: bpf\_jit: fix BPF\_S\_LDX\_B\_MSH compilation
[ Upstream commit dc72d99dabb870ca5bd6d9fff674be853bb4a88d ]
Matt Evans spotted that x86 bpf\_jit was incorrectly handling negative
constant offsets in BPF\_S\_LDX\_B\_MSH instruction.
We need to abort JIT compilation like we do in common\_load so that
filter uses the interpreter code and can call \_\_load\_pointer()

drm/i915: suspend fbdev device around suspend/hibernate
commit 3fa016a0b5c5237e9c387fc3249592b2cb5391c6 upstream.
Looking at hibernate overwriting I though it looked like a cursor,
so I tracked down this missing piece to stop the cursor blink
timer. I've no idea if this is sufficient to fix the hibernate
problems people are seeing, but please test it.
Both radeon and nouveau have done this for a long time.
I've run this personally all night hib/resume cycles with no fails.

module: Remove module size limit
commit f946eeb9313ff1470758e171a60fe7438a2ded3f upstream.
Module size was limited to 64MB, this was legacy limitation due to vmalloc()
which was removed a while ago.
Limiting module size to 64MB is both pointless and affects real world use
cases.

Firstly, task->tk\_status will always return negative error values,

Secondly, clean up the code so that we only need to test

slub: Do not hold slub\_lock when calling sysfs\_slab\_add()
commit 66c4c35c6bc5a1a452b024cf0364635b28fd94e4 upstream.
sysfs\_slab\_add() calls various sysfs functions that actually may
end up in userspace doing all sorts of things.
Release the slub\_lock after adding the kmem\_cache structure to the list.
At that point the address of the kmem\_cache is not known so we are
guaranteed exlusive access to the following modifications to the
kmem\_cache structure.
If the sysfs\_slab\_add fails then reacquire the slub\_lock to
remove the kmem\_cache structure from the list.

xfs: Fix oops on IO error during xlog\_recover\_process\_iunlinks()
commit d97d32edcd732110758799ae60af725e5110b3dc upstream.
When an IO error happens during inode deletion run from
xlog\_recover\_process\_iunlinks() filesystem gets shutdown. Thus any subsequent
attempt to read buffers fails. Code in xlog\_recover\_process\_iunlinks() does not
count with the fact that read of a buffer which was read a while ago can
really fail which results in the oops on
agi = XFS\_BUF\_TO\_AGI(agibp);
Fix the problem by cleaning up the buffer handling in
xlog\_recover\_process\_iunlinks() as suggested by Dave Chinner. We release buffer
lock but keep buffer reference to AG buffer. That is enough for buffer to stay
pinned in memory and we don't have to call xfs\_read\_agi() all the time.

dm thin: fix stacked bi\_next usage
commit 6f94a4c45a6f744383f9f695dde019998db3df55 upstream.
Avoid using the bi\_next field for the holder of a cell when deferring
bios because a stacked device below might change it. Store the
holder in a new field in struct cell instead.
When a cell is created, the bio that triggered creation (the holder) was
added to the same bio list as subsequent bios. In some cases we pass
this holder bio directly to devices underneath. If those devices use
the bi\_next field there will be trouble...
This also simplifies some code that had to work out which bio was the
holder.

dm persistent data: fix btree rebalancing after remove
commit b0988900bae9ecf968a8a8d086a9eec671a9517a upstream.
When we remove an entry from a node we sometimes rebalance with it's
two neighbours. This wasn't being done correctly; in some cases
entries have to move all the way from the right neighbour to the left
neighbour, or vice versa. This patch pretty much re-writes the
balancing code to fix it.
This code is barely used currently; only when you delete a thin
device, and then only if you have hundreds of them in the same pool.
Once we have discard support, which removes mappings, this will be used
much more heavily.

commit 72c6e7afc43e19f68a31dea204fc366624d6eee9 upstream.
Always set io->error to -EIO when an error is detected in dm-crypt.
There were cases where an error code would be set only if we finish
processing the last sector. If there were other encryption operations in
flight, the error would be ignored and bio would be returned with
success as if no error happened.

dm crypt: fix mempool deadlock
commit aeb2deae2660a1773c83d3c6e9e6575daa3855d6 upstream.
This patch fixes a possible deadlock in dm-crypt's mempool use.
Currently, dm-crypt reserves a mempool of MIN\_BIO\_PAGES reserved pages.
It allocates first MIN\_BIO\_PAGES with non-failing allocation (the allocation
cannot fail and waits until the mempool is refilled). Further pages are
allocated with different gfp flags that allow failing.
Because allocations may be done in parallel, this code can deadlock. Example:
There are two processes, each tries to allocate MIN\_BIO\_PAGES and the processes
run simultaneously.
It may end up in a situation where each process allocates (MIN\_BIO\_PAGES / 2)
pages. The mempool is exhausted. Each process waits for more pages to be freed
to the mempool, which never happens.
To avoid this deadlock scenario, this patch changes the code so that only
the first page is allocated with non-failing gfp mask. Allocation of further
pages may fail.

gpio/davinci: fix enabling unbanked GPIO IRQs
commit 81b279d80a63628e580c71a31d30a8c3b3047ad4 upstream.
Unbanked GPIO IRQ handling code made a copy of just
the irq\_chip structure for GPIO IRQ lines which caused
problems after the generic IRQ chip conversion because
there was no valid irq\_chip\_type structure with the
right "regs" populated. irq\_gc\_mask\_set\_bit() was
therefore accessing random addresses.
Fix it by making a copy of irq\_chip\_type structure
instead. This will ensure sane register offsets.

vfs: fix d\_ancestor() case in d\_materialize\_unique
commit b18dafc86bb879d2f38a1743985d7ceb283c2f4d upstream.
In d\_materialise\_unique() there are 3 subcases to the 'aliased dentry'
case; in two subcases the inode i\_lock is properly released but this
does not occur in the -ELOOP subcase.
This seems to have been introduced by commit 1836750115f2 ("fix loop

Signed-off-by: Michel Lespinasse
[ Added a comment, and moved the unlock to where we generate the -ELOOP,
which seems to be more natural.
You probably can't actually trigger this without a buggy network file
server - d\_materialize\_unique() is for finding aliases on non-local
filesystems, and the d\_ancestor() case is for a hardlinked directory
loop.
But we should be robust in the case of such buggy servers anyway. ]

This avoids a kernel BUG\_ON assertion failure.
Tested: Without this patch, the file system image found in

ext4: fix race between sync and completed io work
commit 491caa43639abcffaa645fbab372a7ef4ce2975c upstream.
The following command line will leave the aio-stress process unkillable
on an ext4 file system (in my case, mounted on /mnt/test):
aio-stress -t 20 -s 10 -O -S -o 2 -I 1000 /mnt/test/aiostress.3561.4 /mnt/test/aiostress.3561.4.20 /mnt/test/aiostress.3561.4.19 /mnt/test/aiostress.3561.4.18 /mnt/test/aiostress.3561.4.17 /mnt/test/aiostress.3561.4.16 /mnt/test/aiostress.3561.4.15 /mnt/test/aiostress.3561.4.14 /mnt/test/aiostress.3561.4.13 /mnt/test/aiostress.3561.4.12 /mnt/test/aiostress.3561.4.11 /mnt/test/aiostress.3561.4.10 /mnt/test/aiostress.3561.4.9 /mnt/test/aiostress.3561.4.8 /mnt/test/aiostress.3561.4.7 /mnt/test/aiostress.3561.4.6 /mnt/test/aiostress.3561.4.5 /mnt/test/aiostress.3561.4.4 /mnt/test/aiostress.3561.4.3 /mnt/test/aiostress.3561.4.2
This is using the aio-stress program from the xfstests test suite.
That particular command line tells aio-stress to do random writes to
20 files from 20 threads (one thread per file). The files are NOT
preallocated, so you will get writes to random offsets within the
file, thus creating holes and extending i\_size. It also opens the
file with O\_DIRECT and O\_SYNC.
On to the problem. When an I/O requires unwritten extent conversion,
it is queued onto the completed\_io\_list for the ext4 inode. Two code
paths will pull work items from this list. The first is the
ext4\_end\_io\_work routine, and the second is ext4\_flush\_completed\_IO,
which is called via the fsync path (and O\_SYNC handling, as well).
There are two issues I've found in these code paths. First, if the
fsync path beats the work routine to a particular I/O, the work
routine will free the io\_end structure! It does not take into account
the fact that the io\_end may still be in use by the fsync path. I've
fixed this issue by adding yet another IO\_END flag, indicating that
the io\_end is being processed by the fsync path.
The second problem is that the work routine will make an assignment to
io->flag outside of the lock. I have witnessed this result in a hang
at umount. Moving the flag setting inside the lock resolved that
problem.
The problem was introduced by commit b82e384c7b ("ext4: optimize
locking for end\_io extent conversion"), which first appeared in 3.2.
As such, the fix should be backported to that release (probably along
with the unwritten extent conversion race fix).

ext4: fix race between unwritten extent conversion and truncate
commit 266991b13890049ee1a6bb95b9817f06339ee3d7 upstream.
The following comment in ext4\_end\_io\_dio caught my attention:
/\* XXX: probably should move into the real I/O completion handler \*/
inode\_dio\_done(inode);
The truncate code takes i\_mutex, then calls inode\_dio\_wait. Because the
ext4 code path above will end up dropping the mutex before it is
reacquired by the worker thread that does the extent conversion, it
seems to me that the truncate can happen out of order. Jan Kara
mentioned that this might result in error messages in the system logs,
but that should be the extent of the "damage."
The fix is pretty straight-forward: don't call inode\_dio\_done until the
extent conversion is complete.

ext4: ignore EXT4\_INODE\_JOURNAL\_DATA flag with delalloc
commit 3d2b158262826e8b75bbbfb7b97010838dd92ac7 upstream.
Ext4 does not support data journalling with delayed allocation enabled.
We even do not allow to mount the file system with delayed allocation
and data journalling enabled, however it can be set via FS\_IOC\_SETFLAGS
so we can hit the inode with EXT4\_INODE\_JOURNAL\_DATA set even on file
system mounted with delayed allocation (default) and that's where
problem arises. The easies way to reproduce this problem is with the
following set of commands:
mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdd
mount /dev/sdd /mnt/test1
dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/test1/file bs=1M count=4
chattr +j /mnt/test1/file
dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/test1/file bs=1M count=4 conv=notrunc
chattr -j /mnt/test1/file
Additionally it can be reproduced quite reliably with xfstests 272 and
269. In fact the above reproducer is a part of test 272.
To fix this we should ignore the EXT4\_INODE\_JOURNAL\_DATA inode flag if
the file system is mounted with delayed allocation. This can be easily
done by fixing ext4\_should\_\*\_data() functions do ignore data journal
flag when delalloc is set (suggested by Ted). We also have to set the
appropriate address space operations for the inode (again, ignoring data
journal flag if delalloc enabled).
Additionally this commit introduces ext4\_inode\_journal\_mode() function
because ext4\_should\_\*\_data() has already had a lot of common code and
this change is putting it all into one function so it is easier to
read.
Successfully tested with xfstests in following configurations:
delalloc + data=ordered
delalloc + data=writeback
data=journal
nodelalloc + data=ordered
nodelalloc + data=writeback
nodelalloc + data=journal

jbd2: clear BH\_Delay & BH\_Unwritten in journal\_unmap\_buffer
commit 15291164b22a357cb211b618adfef4fa82fc0de3 upstream.
journal\_unmap\_buffer()'s zap\_buffer: code clears a lot of buffer head
state ala discard\_buffer(), but does not touch \_Delay or \_Unwritten as
discard\_buffer() does.
This can be problematic in some areas of the ext4 code which assume
that if they have found a buffer marked unwritten or delay, then it's
a live one. Perhaps those spots should check whether it is mapped
as well, but if jbd2 is going to tear down a buffer, let's really
tear it down completely.
Without this I get some fsx failures on sub-page-block filesystems
up until v3.2, at which point 4e96b2dbbf1d7e81f22047a50f862555a6cb87cb
and 189e868fa8fdca702eb9db9d8afc46b5cb9144c9 make the failures go
away, because buried within that large change is some more flag
clearing. I still think it's worth doing in jbd2, since
->invalidatepage leads here directly, and it's the right place
to clear away these flags.

commit 073863432f7eaa23c7c09733414d4be2eabf5eef upstream.
When this driver was upgraded to the vendor 20100831 version in

This broke complete operation of the driver whenever AP mode was
enabled. This fixes https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/27996.
The configuration parameter R8712\_AP is misleading as the driver cannot
function as an AP without a heavily hacked version of hostapd. Thus, it
makes sense to remove the parameter; however the code and data configured
for the option is left in.

rtlwifi: Convert to asynchronous firmware load
commit b0302aba812bcc39291cdab9ad7e37008f352a91 upstream.
This patch addresses a kernel bugzilla report and two recent mail threads.
The kernel bugzilla report is https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=42632,
which reports a udev timeout on boot.
The first mail thread, which was on LKML (http://lkml.indiana.edu/hypermail/
linux/kernel/1112.3/00965.html) was for a WARNING that occurs after a
suspend/resume cycle for rtl8192cu.
The scond mail thread (http://marc.info/?l=linux-wireless&m=132655490826766&w=2)
concerned changes in udev that break drivers that delay while firmware is loaded
on modprobe.
This patch converts all rtlwifi-based drivers to use the asynchronous firmware
loading mechanism. Drivers rtl8192ce, rtl8192cu and rtl8192de share a common
callback routine. Driver rtl8192se needs different handling of the firmware,
thus it has its own code.

PM / Domains: Introduce "always on" device flag
This is a backport of mainline commit
1e78a0c7fc92aee076965d516cf54475c39e9894.
The TMU device on the Mackerel board belongs to the A4R power domain
and loses power when the domain is turned off. Unfortunately, the
TMU driver is not prepared to cope with such situations and crashes
the system when that happens. To work around this problem introduce
a new helper function, pm\_genpd\_dev\_always\_on(), allowing a device
driver to mark its device as "always on" in case it belongs to a PM
domain, which will make the generic PM domains core code avoid
powering off the domain containing the device, both at run time and
during system suspend.

PM / Domains: Fix hibernation restore of devices, v2
This is a backport of mainline commit
65533bbf63b4f37723fdfedc73d0653958973323.
During resume from hibernation pm\_genpd\_restore\_noirq() should only
power off domains whose suspend\_power\_off flags are set once and
not every time it is called for a device in the given domain.
Moreover, it shouldn't decrement genpd->suspended\_count, because
that field is not touched during device freezing and therefore it is
always equal to 0 when pm\_genpd\_restore\_noirq() runs for the first
device in the given domain.
This means pm\_genpd\_restore\_noirq() may use genpd->suspended\_count
to determine whether or not it it has been called for the domain in
question already in this cycle (it only needs to increment that
field every time it runs for this purpose) and whether or not it
should check if the domain needs to be powered off. For that to
work, though, pm\_genpd\_prepare() has to clear genpd->suspended\_count
when it runs for the first device in the given domain (in which case
that flag need not be cleared during domain initialization).

The D1F5 revision of the WinTV HVR-1900 uses a tda18271c2 tuner
instead of a tda18271c1 tuner as used in revision D1E9. To
account for this, we must hardcode the frontend configuration

The au8522 driver programs the tuner after programming the demodulator,
but the tuner should be programmed first. This patch fixes this behavior.

as102: add \_\_packed attribute to structs defined inside packed structs
commit abf9d005375d6c6160cc9c17e5dcac32e412c8dc upstream.
This patch fixes a regression in kernel 3.3 due to this patch:
http://patchwork.linuxtv.org/patch/8332/
That patch changes "#pragma pack(1)" with "\_\_packed" attributes, but it is not
complete. In fact, in the as102 driver there are a lot of structs/unions
defined inside other structs/unions.
When the "\_\_packed" attribute is applied only on the external struct, it will
not affect the internal struct definitions.
So the regression is fixed by specifiying the "\_\_packed" attribute also on the
internal structs.
This patch should go into 3.3, as it fixes a regression introduced in the new
kernel version.

sysctl: protect poll() in entries that may go away
commit 4e474a00d7ff746ed177ddae14fa8b2d4bad7a00 upstream.
Protect code accessing ctl\_table by grabbing the header with grab\_header()

is called in entries created by modules: currently only hostname and
domainname support poll(), but this bug may be triggered when/if modules
use it and if user called poll() in a file that doesn't support it.

x86-32: Fix endless loop when processing signals for kernel tasks
commit 29a2e2836ff9ea65a603c89df217f4198973a74f upstream.
The problem occurs on !CONFIG\_VM86 kernels [1] when a kernel-mode task
returns from a system call with a pending signal.
A real-life scenario is a child of 'khelper' returning from a failed
kernel\_execve() in \_\_\_\_call\_usermodehelper() [ kernel/kmod.c ].
kernel\_execve() fails due to a pending SIGKILL, which is the result of
"kill -9 -1" (at least, busybox's init does it upon reboot).
The loop is as follows:
\* syscall\_exit\_work:
- work\_pending: // start\_of\_the\_loop
- work\_notify\_sig:
- do\_notify\_resume()
- do\_signal()
- if (!user\_mode(regs)) return;
- resume\_userspace // TIF\_SIGPENDING is still set
- work\_pending // so we call work\_pending => goto
// start\_of\_the\_loop
More information can be found in another LKML thread:
http://www.serverphorums.com/read.php?12,457826
[1] the problem was also seen on MIPS.

Commit 4231d47e6fe69f061f96c98c30eaf9fb4c14b96d(net/usbnet: avoid

problem by releasing the skb queue lock, but it makes usb\_unlink\_urb
racing with defer\_bh, and the URB to being unlinked may be freed before

triggerd inside usb\_unlink\_urb.
The patch fixes the use-after-free problem by increasing URB

SUNRPC: We must not use list\_for\_each\_entry\_safe() in rpc\_wake\_up()
commit 540a0f7584169651f485e8ab67461fcb06934e38 upstream.
The problem is that for the case of priority queues, we
have to assume that \_\_rpc\_remove\_wait\_queue\_priority will move new
elements from the tk\_wait.links lists into the queue->tasks[] list.
We therefore cannot use list\_for\_each\_entry\_safe() on queue->tasks[],
since that will skip these new tasks that \_\_rpc\_remove\_wait\_queue\_priority
is adding.
Without this fix, rpc\_wake\_up and rpc\_wake\_up\_status will both fail
to wake up all functions on priority wait queues, which can result
in some nasty hangs.

This patch fixes an issue when cifs\_mount receives a

continue after an DFS ROOT referral. In this case, the return code
variable is not reset prior to trying to mount from the system referred
to. Thus, is\_path\_accessible is not executed and the final DFS referral
is not performed causing a mount error.
Use case: In DNS, example.com resolves to the secondary AD server
ad2.example.com Our primary domain controller is ad1.example.com and has
a DFS redirection set up from \\ad1\share\Users to \\files\share\Users.
Mounting \\example.com\share\Users fails.

xfs: fix inode lookup race
commit f30d500f809eca67a21704347ab14bb35877b5ee upstream.
When we get concurrent lookups of the same inode that is not in the
per-AG inode cache, there is a race condition that triggers warnings
in unlock\_new\_inode() indicating that we are initialising an inode
that isn't in a the correct state for a new inode.
When we do an inode lookup via a file handle or a bulkstat, we don't
serialise lookups at a higher level through the dentry cache (i.e.
pathless lookup), and so we can get concurrent lookups of the same
inode.
The race condition is between the insertion of the inode into the
cache in the case of a cache miss and a concurrently lookup:
Thread 1 Thread 2
xfs\_iget()
xfs\_iget\_cache\_miss()
xfs\_iread()
lock radix tree
radix\_tree\_insert()
rcu\_read\_lock
radix\_tree\_lookup
lock inode flags
XFS\_INEW not set
igrab()
unlock inode flags

.....
lock inode flags
set XFS\_INEW
unlock inode flags
unlock radix tree
xfs\_setup\_inode()
inode flags = I\_NEW
unlock\_new\_inode()
WARNING as inode flags != I\_NEW
This can lead to inode corruption, inode list corruption, etc, and
is generally a bad thing to occur.
Fix this by setting XFS\_INEW before inserting the inode into the
radix tree. This will ensure any concurrent lookup will find the new
inode with XFS\_INEW set and that forces the lookup to wait until the
XFS\_INEW flag is removed before allowing the lookup to succeed.

mm: vmscan: forcibly scan highmem if there are too many buffer\_heads pinning highmem
commit cc715d99e529d470dde2f33a6614f255adea71f3 upstream.
Stuart Foster reported on bugzilla that copying large amounts of data
from NTFS caused an OOM kill on 32-bit X86 with 16G of memory. Andrew
Morton correctly identified that the problem was NTFS was using 512
blocks meaning each page had 8 buffer\_heads in low memory pinning it.
In the past, direct reclaim used to scan highmem even if the allocating
process did not specify \_\_GFP\_HIGHMEM but not any more. kswapd no longer
will reclaim from zones that are above the high watermark. The intention
in both cases was to minimise unnecessary reclaim. The downside is on
machines with large amounts of highmem that lowmem can be fully consumed
by buffer\_heads with nothing trying to free them.
The following patch is based on a suggestion by Andrew Morton to extend
the buffer\_heads\_over\_limit case to force kswapd and direct reclaim to
scan the highmem zone regardless of the allocation request or watermarks.

firewire: ohci: fix too-early completion of IR multichannel buffers
commit 0c0efbacab8d70700d13301e0ae7975783c0cb0a upstream.
handle\_ir\_buffer\_fill() assumed that a completed descriptor would be
indicated by a non-zero transfer\_status (as in most other descriptors).
However, this field is written by the controller as soon as (the end of)
the first packet has been written into the buffer. As a consequence, if
we happen to run into such a descriptor when the interrupt handler is
executed after such a packet has completed, the descriptor would be
taken out of the list of active descriptors as soon as the buffer had
been partially filled, so the event for the buffer being completely
filled would never be sent.
To fix this, handle descriptors only when they have been completely
filled, i.e., when res\_count == 0. (This also matches the condition
that is reported by the controller with an interrupt.)

ahci: add AHCI\_HFLAG\_DELAY\_ENGINE host flag
commit 66583c9fa63d05d5580e409f9a58d3cad6d76d17 upstream.
The following commit was intended to fix problems with specific AHCI
controller(s) that would become bricks if the AHCI specification was not
followed strictly (that is, if ahci\_start\_engine() was called while the
controller was in the wrong state):
commit 7faa33da9b7add01db9f1ad92c6a5d9145e940a7
ahci: start engine only during soft/hard resets
However, some devices currently have issues with that fix, so we must
implement a flag that delays the ahci\_start\_engine() call only for specific
controllers.
This commit simply introduces the flag, without enabling it in any driver.
Note that even when AHCI\_HFLAG\_DELAY\_ENGINE is not enabled, this patch does
not constitue a full revert to commit 7faa33da; there is still a change in
behavior to the ahci\_port\_suspend() failure path.

commit 089461dda1770c10fea0b988ff74519a9be81d7e upstream.
Current code sets the peripheral device type to 0x3f == "not present
unknown" for virtual LUN 0 for standard INQUIRY commands, but leaves it
as 0 == "connected direct access block" for VPD INQUIRY commands. This
is just because the check for LUN 0 only happens in some code paths.

target: Fix up handling of short INQUIRY buffers
commit d95b82461c56a6ff8ff248b101049a69ebb20278 upstream.
If the initiator sends us an INQUIRY command with an allocation length
that's shorter than what we want to return, we're simply supposed to
truncate our response and return what the initiator gave us space for,
without signaling any error. Current target code has various tests that
don't fill out the full response if the buffer is too short and
sometimes return errors incorrectly.
Fix this up by allocating a bounce buffer for INQUIRY responses if we
need to, ie if we have cmd->data\_length too small as well as
SCF\_PASSTHROUGH\_SG\_TO\_MEM\_NOALLOC set in cmd->se\_cmd\_flags -- for most
fabrics, we always allocate at least a full page, but for tcm\_loop we
may have a small buffer coming directly from the SCSI stack.
This lets us delete a lot of cmd->data\_length checking, and also makes
our INQUIRY handling correct per SPC in a lot more cases.

drm/i915: Only clear the GPU domains upon a successful finish
commit c501ae7f332cdaf42e31af30b72b4b66cbbb1604 upstream.
By clearing the GPU read domains before waiting upon the buffer, we run
the risk of the wait being interrupted and the domains prematurely
cleared. The next time we attempt to wait upon the buffer (after
userspace handles the signal), we believe that the buffer is idle and so
skip the wait.
There are a number of bugs across all generations which show signs of an
overly haste reuse of active buffers.
Such as:
https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=29046
https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=35863

md: fix clearing of the 'changed' flags for the bad blocks list.
commit d0962936bff659d20522555b517582a2715fd23f upstream.
In super\_1\_sync (the first hunk) we need to clear 'changed' before
checking read\_seqretry(), otherwise we might race with other code
adding a bad block and so won't retry later.
In md\_update\_sb (the second hunk), in the case where there is no
metadata (neither persistent nor external), we treat any bad blocks as
an error. However we need to clear the 'changed' flag before calling
md\_ack\_all\_badblocks, else it won't do anything.

md/raid1,raid10: avoid deadlock during resync/recovery.
commit d6b42dcb995e6acd7cc276774e751ffc9f0ef4bf upstream.
If RAID1 or RAID10 is used under LVM or some other stacking
block device, it is possible to enter a deadlock during
resync or recovery.
This can happen if the upper level block device creates
two requests to the RAID1 or RAID10. The first request gets
processed, blocks recovery and queue requests for underlying
requests in current->bio\_list. A resync request then starts
which will wait for those requests and block new IO.
But then the second request to the RAID1/10 will be attempted
and it cannot progress until the resync request completes,
which cannot progress until the underlying device requests complete,
which are on a queue behind that second request.
So allow that second request to proceed even though there is
a resync request about to start.
This is suitable for any -stable kernel.

md: don't set md arrays to readonly on shutdown.
commit c744a65c1e2d59acc54333ce80a5b0702a98010b upstream.
It seems that with recent kernel, writeback can still be happening
while shutdown is happening, and consequently data can be written
after the md reboot notifier switches all arrays to read-only.
This causes a BUG.
So don't switch them to read-only - just mark them clean and
set 'safemode' to '2' which mean that immediately after any
write the array will be switch back to 'clean'.
This could result in the shutdown happening when array is marked
dirty, thus forcing a resync on reboot. However if you reboot
without performing a "sync" first, you get to keep both halves.
This is suitable for any stable kernel (though there might be some
conflicts with obvious fixes in earlier kernels).

commit 187e70a554e0f0717a65998bc9199945cbbd4692 upstream.
This patch addresses a bug in srpt\_handle\_cmd() failure handling where
send\_ioctx->kref is being leaked with the local extra reference after init,
causing the expected kref\_put() in srpt\_handle\_send\_comp() to not be the final
call to invoke srpt\_put\_send\_ioctx\_kref() -> transport\_generic\_free\_cmd() and
perform se\_cmd descriptor memory release.
It also fixes a SCF\_SCSI\_RESERVATION\_CONFLICT handling bug where this code
is incorrectly falling through to transport\_handle\_cdb\_direct() after
invoking srpt\_queue\_status() to send SAM\_STAT\_RESERVATION\_CONFLICT status.
Note this patch is for >= v3.3 mainline code, and current lio-core.git
code has already been converted to target\_submit\_cmd() + se\_cmd->cmd\_kref usage,
and internal ioctx->kref usage has been removed. I'm including this patch
now into target-pending/for-next with a CC' for v3.3 stable.

udlfb: remove sysfs framebuffer device with USB .disconnect()
commit ce880cb860f36694d2cdebfac9e6ae18176fe4c4 upstream.
The USB graphics card driver delays the unregistering of the framebuffer
device to a workqueue, which breaks the userspace visible remove uevent
sequence. Recent userspace tools started to support USB graphics card
hotplug out-of-the-box and rely on proper events sent by the kernel.
The framebuffer device is a direct child of the USB interface which is
removed immediately after the USB .disconnect() callback. But the fb device
in /sys stays around until its final cleanup, at a time where all the parent
devices have been removed already.
To work around that, we remove the sysfs fb device directly in the USB
.disconnect() callback and leave only the cleanup of the internal fb
data to the delayed work.

ALSA: hda - fix printing of high HDMI sample rates
commit 25dc16f69892182192b1234594fd3cf342ad4195 upstream.
A previous commit af65cbf296 (ALSA: hdmi: fix printout of SAD sampling
rates) fixed the sample rates shown in /proc/asound/cardX/eldY and
kernel log to not be entirely wrong. However, a missing rate from the
array added in the patch causes HDMI rates 88.2 kHz, 96 kHz, 176.4 kHz,
and 192 kHz to be shown as 96 kHz, 176.4 kHz, 192 kHz, and 384 kHz,
respectively.
Fix the reporting by adding the ALSA rate 64 kHz into the conversion
array between 48 kHz and 88.2 kHz.

tcm\_loop: Set residual field for SCSI commands
commit 6cf3fa6918baab0c447f1206f1cef9166ad04864 upstream.
If the target core signals an over- or under-run, tcm\_loop should call
scsi\_set\_resid() to tell the SCSI midlayer about the residual data length.
The difference can be seen by doing something like
strace -eioctl sg\_raw -r 1024 /dev/sda 8 0 0 0 1 0 > /dev/null
and looking at the "resid=" part of the SG\_IO ioctl -- after this patch,
the field is correctly reported as 512.

ASoC: pxa-ssp: atomically set stream active masks
commit 273b72c8ce6b28df6b49423d775c3e59072c73c5 upstream.
PXA's SSP engine fails to take its current channel phase into account
when enabling a stream while the engine is already running. This
results in randomly swapped left/right channels on either the record
or the playback side, depending on which one was enabled first.
The following patch fixes this by factoring out the bit field
modifications in question to a separate function that pauses the
engine temporarily, modifies the bits and kicks it off again
afterwards. Appearantly, a transition of SSCR0\_SSE syncs both
directions properly.
The patch has been rolled out to quite a number of devices over the
last weeks and seems to fix the issue reliably.

commit 70ac07bb633dee75ac554195b9a4d69adfa7803c upstream.
The WM8776 codec driver requires the machine driver to set one of the
SND\_SOC\_DAIFMT\_CBx\_xxx values. The P1022DS machine driver should be setting
SND\_SOC\_DAIFMT\_CBM\_CFM, but since that value was zero, no one noticed.
Commit 75d9ac46 ("ASoC: Allow DAI formats to be specified in the
dai\_link"), however, changed the value of SND\_SOC\_DAIFMT\_CBM\_CFM from zero
to a non-zero value, which means that it now needs to be specifically set
by the machine driver.
We also set SND\_SOC\_DAIFMT\_NB\_NF, for the same reason.

hugetlbfs: avoid taking i\_mutex from hugetlbfs\_read()
commit a05b0855fd15504972dba2358e5faa172a1e50ba upstream.
Taking i\_mutex in hugetlbfs\_read() can result in deadlock with mmap as
explained below
Thread A:
read() on hugetlbfs
hugetlbfs\_read() called
i\_mutex grabbed
hugetlbfs\_read\_actor() called
\_\_copy\_to\_user() called
page fault is triggered
Thread B, sharing address space with A:
mmap() the same file
->mmap\_sem is grabbed on task\_B->mm->mmap\_sem
hugetlbfs\_file\_mmap() is called
attempt to grab ->i\_mutex and block waiting for A to give it up
Thread A:
pagefault handled blocked on attempt to grab task\_A->mm->mmap\_sem,
which happens to be the same thing as task\_B->mm->mmap\_sem. Block waiting
for B to give it up.
AFAIU the i\_mutex locking was added to hugetlbfs\_read() as per
http://lkml.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0707.2/3066.html to take
care of the race between truncate and read. This patch fixes this by
looking at page->mapping under lock\_page() (find\_lock\_page()) to ensure
that the inode didn't get truncated in the range during a parallel read.
Ideally we can extend the patch to make sure we don't increase i\_size in
mmap. But that will break userspace, because applications will now have
to use truncate(2) to increase i\_size in hugetlbfs.
Based on the original patch from Hillf Danton.

bootmem/sparsemem: remove limit constraint in alloc\_bootmem\_section
commit f5bf18fa22f8c41a13eb8762c7373eb3a93a7333 upstream.

This is
BUG\_ON(limit && goal + size > limit);
and after some debugging, it seems that
goal = 0x7ffff000000
limit = 0x80000000000
and sparse\_early\_usemaps\_alloc\_node ->
sparse\_early\_usemaps\_alloc\_pgdat\_section calls
return alloc\_bootmem\_section(usemap\_size() \* count, section\_nr);
This is on a system with 8TB available via the AMS pool, and as a quirk
of AMS in firmware, all of that memory shows up in node 0. So, we end
up with an allocation that will fail the goal/limit constraints.
In theory, we could "fall-back" to alloc\_bootmem\_node() in
sparse\_early\_usemaps\_alloc\_node(), but since we actually have HOTREMOVE
defined, we'll BUG\_ON() instead. A simple solution appears to be to
unconditionally remove the limit condition in alloc\_bootmem\_section,
meaning allocations are allowed to cross section boundaries (necessary
for systems of this size).
Johannes Weiner pointed out that if alloc\_bootmem\_section() no longer
guarantees section-locality, we need check\_usemap\_section\_nr() to print
possible cross-dependencies between node descriptors and the usemaps
allocated through it. That makes the two loops in
sparse\_early\_usemaps\_alloc\_node() identical, so re-factor the code a
bit.

PM / Domains: Fix handling of wakeup devices during system resume
commit cc85b20780562d404e18a47b9b55b4a5102ae53e upstream.
During system suspend pm\_genpd\_suspend\_noirq() checks if the given
device is in a wakeup path (i.e. it appears to be needed for one or
more wakeup devices to work or is a wakeup device itself) and if it
needs to be "active" for wakeup to work. If that is the case, the
function returns 0 without incrementing the device domain's counter
of suspended devices and without executing genpd\_stop\_dev() for the
device. In consequence, the device is not stopped (e.g. its clock
isn't disabled) and power is always supplied to its domain in the
resulting system sleep state.
However, pm\_genpd\_resume\_noirq() doesn't repeat that check and it
runs genpd\_start\_dev() and decrements the domain's counter of
suspended devices even for the wakeup device that weren't stopped by
pm\_genpd\_suspend\_noirq(). As a result, the start callback may be run
unnecessarily for them and their domains' counters of suspended
devices may become negative. Both outcomes aren't desirable, so fix
pm\_genpd\_resume\_noirq() to look for wakeup devices that might not be
stopped by during system suspend.

mm: thp: fix pmd\_bad() triggering in code paths holding mmap\_sem read mode
commit 1a5a9906d4e8d1976b701f889d8f35d54b928f25 upstream.
In some cases it may happen that pmd\_none\_or\_clear\_bad() is called with
the mmap\_sem hold in read mode. In those cases the huge page faults can
allocate hugepmds under pmd\_none\_or\_clear\_bad() and that can trigger a
false positive from pmd\_bad() that will not like to see a pmd
materializing as trans huge.
It's not khugepaged causing the problem, khugepaged holds the mmap\_sem
in write mode (and all those sites must hold the mmap\_sem in read mode
to prevent pagetables to go away from under them, during code review it
seems vm86 mode on 32bit kernels requires that too unless it's
restricted to 1 thread per process or UP builds). The race is only with
the huge pagefaults that can convert a pmd\_none() into a
pmd\_trans\_huge().
Effectively all these pmd\_none\_or\_clear\_bad() sites running with
mmap\_sem in read mode are somewhat speculative with the page faults, and
the result is always undefined when they run simultaneously. This is
probably why it wasn't common to run into this. For example if the
madvise(MADV\_DONTNEED) runs zap\_page\_range() shortly before the page
fault, the hugepage will not be zapped, if the page fault runs first it
will be zapped.
Altering pmd\_bad() not to error out if it finds hugepmds won't be enough
to fix this, because zap\_pmd\_range would then proceed to call
zap\_pte\_range (which would be incorrect if the pmd become a
pmd\_trans\_huge()).
The simplest way to fix this is to read the pmd in the local stack
(regardless of what we read, no need of actual CPU barriers, only
compiler barrier needed), and be sure it is not changing under the code
that computes its value. Even if the real pmd is changing under the
value we hold on the stack, we don't care. If we actually end up in
zap\_pte\_range it means the pmd was not none already and it was not huge,
and it can't become huge from under us (khugepaged locking explained
above).
All we need is to enforce that there is no way anymore that in a code
path like below, pmd\_trans\_huge can be false, but pmd\_none\_or\_clear\_bad
can run into a hugepmd. The overhead of a barrier() is just a compiler
tweak and should not be measurable (I only added it for THP builds). I
don't exclude different compiler versions may have prevented the race
too by caching the value of \*pmd on the stack (that hasn't been
verified, but it wouldn't be impossible considering
pmd\_none\_or\_clear\_bad, pmd\_bad, pmd\_trans\_huge, pmd\_none are all inlines
and there's no external function called in between pmd\_trans\_huge and
pmd\_none\_or\_clear\_bad).
if (pmd\_trans\_huge(\*pmd)) {
if (next-addr != HPAGE\_PMD\_SIZE) {
VM\_BUG\_ON(!rwsem\_is\_locked(&tlb->mm->mmap\_sem));
split\_huge\_page\_pmd(vma->vm\_mm, pmd);
} else if (zap\_huge\_pmd(tlb, vma, pmd, addr))
continue;
/\* fall through \*/
}
if (pmd\_none\_or\_clear\_bad(pmd))
Because this race condition could be exercised without special
privileges this was reported in CVE-2012-1179.
The race was identified and fully explained by Ulrich who debugged it.
I'm quoting his accurate explanation below, for reference.

mapcount 0 page\_mapcount 1
kernel BUG at mm/huge\_memory.c:1384!
At some point prior to the panic, a "bad pmd ..." message similar to the
following is logged on the console:
mm/memory.c:145: bad pmd ffff8800376e1f98(80000000314000e7).
The "bad pmd ..." message is logged by pmd\_clear\_bad() before it clears
the page's PMD table entry.
143 void pmd\_clear\_bad(pmd\_t \*pmd)
144 {
-> 145 pmd\_ERROR(\*pmd);
146 pmd\_clear(pmd);
147 }
After the PMD table entry has been cleared, there is an inconsistency
between the actual number of PMD table entries that are mapping the page
and the page's map count (\_mapcount field in struct page). When the page
is subsequently reclaimed, \_\_split\_huge\_page() detects this inconsistency.
1381 if (mapcount != page\_mapcount(page))
1382 printk(KERN\_ERR "mapcount %d page\_mapcount %d\n",
1383 mapcount, page\_mapcount(page));
-> 1384 BUG\_ON(mapcount != page\_mapcount(page));
The root cause of the problem is a race of two threads in a multithreaded
process. Thread B incurs a page fault on a virtual address that has never
been accessed (PMD entry is zero) while Thread A is executing an madvise()
system call on a virtual address within the same 2 MB (huge page) range.

The mmap\_sem does not prevent the race because both threads are acquiring
it in shared mode (down\_read). Thread B holds the page\_table\_lock while
the page's map count and PMD table entry are updated. However, Thread A
does not synchronize on that lock.

With the recent changes to clear\_IO\_APIC\_pin() which tries to
clear remoteIRR bit explicitly, some of the users started to see
"Unable to reset IRR for apic .." messages.
Close look shows that these are related to bogus IO-APIC entries
which return's all 1's for their io-apic registers. And the
above mentioned error messages are benign. But kernel should
have ignored such io-apic's in the first place.
Check if register 0, 1, 2 of the listed io-apic are all 1's and
ignore such io-apic.

IB/iser: Post initial receive buffers before sending the final login request
commit 89e984e2c2cd14f77ccb26c47726ac7f13b70ae8 upstream.
An iser target may send iscsi NO-OP PDUs as soon as it marks the iSER
iSCSI session as fully operative. This means that there is window
where there are no posted receive buffers on the initiator side, so
it's possible for the iSER RC connection to break because of RNR NAK /

rtnetlink: Fix VF IFLA policy
commit 48752f6513012a1b078da08b145d5c40a644f058 upstream.
Add VF spoof check to IFLA policy. The original patch I submitted to
add the spoof checking feature to rtnl failed to add the proper policy
rule that identifies the data type and len. This patch corrects that
oversight. No bugs have been reported against this but it may cause
some problem for the netlink message parsing that uses the policy

rtc: Disable the alarm in the hardware (v2)
commit 41c7f7424259ff11009449f87c95656f69f9b186 upstream.
Currently, the RTC code does not disable the alarm in the hardware.
This means that after a sequence such as the one below (the files are in the
RTC sysfs), the box will boot up after 2 minutes even though we've
asked for the alarm to be turned off.
# echo $((`cat since\_epoch`)+120) > wakealarm
# echo 0 > wakealarm
# poweroff
Fix this by disabling the alarm when there are no timers to run.
The original version of this patch was reverted. This version
disables the irq directly instead of setting a disabled timer
in the future.

genirq: Fix long-term regression in genirq irq\_set\_irq\_type() handling
commit a09b659cd68c10ec6a30cb91ebd2c327fcd5bfe5 upstream.
In 2008, commit 0c5d1eb77a8be ("genirq: record trigger type") modified the
way set\_irq\_type() handles the 'no trigger' condition. However, this has
an adverse effect on PCMCIA support on Intel StrongARM and probably PXA
platforms.
PCMCIA has several status signals on the socket which can trigger
interrupts; some of these status signals depend on the card's mode
(whether it is configured in memory or IO mode). For example, cards have
a 'Ready/IRQ' signal: in memory mode, this provides an indication to
PCMCIA that the card has finished its power up initialization. In IO
mode, it provides the device interrupt signal. Other status signals
switch between on-board battery status and loud speaker output.
In classical PCMCIA implementations, where you have a specific socket
controller, the controller provides a method to mask interrupts from the
socket, and importantly ignore any state transitions on the pins which
correspond with interrupts once masked. This masking prevents unwanted
events caused by the removal and application of socket power being
forwarded.
However, on platforms where there is no socket controller, the PCMCIA
status and interrupt signals are routed to standard edge-triggered GPIOs.
These GPIOs can be configured to interrupt on rising edge, falling edge,
or never. This is where the problems start.
Edge triggered interrupts are required to record events while disabled via
the usual methods of {free,request,disable,enable}\_irq() to prevent
problems with dropped interrupts (eg, the 8390 driver uses disable\_irq()
to defer the delivery of interrupts). As a result, these interfaces can
not be used to implement the desired behaviour.
The side effect of this is that if the 'Ready/IRQ' GPIO is disabled via
disable\_irq() on suspend, and enabled via enable\_irq() after resume, we
will record the state transitions caused by powering events as valid
interrupts, and foward them to the card driver, which may attempt to
access a card which is not powered up.
This leads delays resume while drivers spin in their interrupt handlers,
and complaints from drivers before they realize what's happened.
Moreover, in the case of the 'Ready/IRQ' signal, this is requested and
freed by the card driver itself; the PCMCIA core has no idea whether the
interrupt is requested, and, therefore, whether a call to disable\_irq()
would be valid. (We tried this around 2.4.17 / 2.5.1 kernel era, and
ended up throwing it out because of this problem.)
Therefore, it was decided back in around 2002 to disable the edge
triggering instead, resulting in all state transitions on the GPIO being
ignored. That's what we actually need the hardware to do.
The commit above changes this behaviour; it explicitly prevents the 'no
trigger' state being selected.
The reason that request\_irq() does not accept the 'no trigger' state is
for compatibility with existing drivers which do not provide their desired
triggering configuration. The set\_irq\_type() function is 'new' and not
used by non-trigger aware drivers.
Therefore, revert this change, and restore previously working platforms
back to their former state.

uevent: send events in correct order according to seqnum (v3)
commit 7b60a18da393ed70db043a777fd9e6d5363077c4 upstream.
The queue handling in the udev daemon assumes that the events are
ordered.
Before this patch uevent\_seqnum is incremented under sequence\_lock,
than an event is send uner uevent\_sock\_mutex. I want to say that code
contained a window between incrementing seqnum and sending an event.
This patch locks uevent\_sock\_mutex before incrementing uevent\_seqnum.
v2: delete sequence\_lock, uevent\_seqnum is protected by uevent\_sock\_mutex
v3: unlock the mutex before the goto exit

iwlwifi: always monitor for stuck queues
commit 342bbf3fee2fa9a18147e74b2e3c4229a4564912 upstream.
If we only monitor while associated, the following
can happen:
- we're associated, and the queue stuck check
runs, setting the queue "touch" time to X
- we disassociate, stopping the monitoring,
which leaves the time set to X
- almost 2s later, we associate, and enqueue
a frame
- before the frame is transmitted, we monitor
for stuck queues, and find the time set to
X, although it is now later than X + 2000ms,
so we decide that the queue is stuck and
erroneously restart the device
It happens more with P2P because there we can
go between associated/unassociated frequently.

commit a9b89e2567c743483e6354f64d7a7e3a8c101e9e upstream.
Driver rtl8192ce when used with the RTL8188CE device would start at about
20 Mbps on a 54 Mbps connection, but quickly drop to 1 Mbps. One of the
symptoms is that the AP would need to retransmit each packet 4 of 5 times

unloading and reloading the driver. This problem was reported at

When driver rtl8192cu is used with the debug level set to 3 or greater,

This lock is not necessary as the USB driver does not use the struct

usb: cp210x: Update to support CP2105 and multiple interface devices
commit a5360a53a7ccad5ed9ccef210b94fef13c6e5529 upstream.
This patch updates the cp210x driver to support CP210x multiple
interface devices devices from Silicon Labs. The existing driver
always sends control requests to interface 0, which is hardcoded in
the usb\_control\_msg function calls. This only allows for single
interface devices to be used, and causes a bug when using ports on an
interface other than 0 in the multiple interface devices.
Here are the changes included in this patch:
- Updated the device list to contain the Silicon Labs factory default
VID/PID for multiple interface CP210x devices
- Created a cp210x\_port\_private struct created for each port on
startup, this struct holds the interface number
- Added a cp210x\_release function to clean up the cp210x\_port\_private
memory created on startup
- Modified usb\_get\_config and usb\_set\_config to get a pointer to the
cp210x\_port\_private struct, and use the interface number there in the
usb\_control\_message wIndex param

cdc-wdm: Fix more races on the read path
commit 711c68b3c0f7a924ffbee4aa962d8f62b85188ff upstream.
We must not allow the input buffer length to change while we're
shuffling the buffer contents. We also mustn't clear the WDM\_READ
flag after more data might have arrived. Therefore move both of these
into the spinlocked region at the bottom of wdm\_read().
When reading desc->length without holding the iuspin lock, use
ACCESS\_ONCE() to ensure the compiler doesn't re-read it with
inconsistent results.

Bugzilla 40012: PIO\_UNIMAP bug: error updating Unicode-to-font map
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=40012
The unicode font map for the virtual console is a 32x32x64 table which
allocates rows dynamically as entries are added. The unicode value
increases sequentially and should count all entries even in empty
rows. The defect is when copying the unicode font map in con\_set\_unimap(),
the unicode value is not incremented properly. The wrong unicode value
is entered in the new font map.

sysfs: Fix memory leak in sysfs\_sd\_setsecdata().
commit 93518dd2ebafcc761a8637b2877008cfd748c202 upstream.
This patch fixies follwing two memory leak patterns that reported by kmemleak.
sysfs\_sd\_setsecdata() is called during sys\_lsetxattr() operation.
It checks sd->s\_iattr is NULL or not. Then if it is NULL, it calls
sysfs\_init\_inode\_attrs() to allocate memory.
That code is this.
iattrs = sd->s\_iattr;
if (!iattrs)
iattrs = sysfs\_init\_inode\_attrs(sd);
The iattrs recieves sysfs\_init\_inode\_attrs()'s result, but sd->s\_iattr
doesn't know the address. so it needs to set correct address to
sd->s\_iattr to free memory in other function.

usb: musb: Reselect index reg in interrupt context
commit 39287076e46d2c19aaceaa6f0a44168ae4d257ec upstream.
musb INDEX register is getting modified/corrupted during temporary
un-locking in a SMP system. Set this register with proper value
after re-acquiring the lock
Scenario:
---------
CPU1 is handling a data transfer completion interrupt received for
the CLASS1 EP
CPU2 is handling a CLASS2 thread which is queuing data to musb for
transfer
Below is the error sequence:
CPU1 | CPU2
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Data transfer completion inter- |
rupt recieved. |
|
musb INDEX reg set to CLASS1 EP |
|
musb LOCK is acquired. |
|
| CLASS2 thread queues data.
|
| CLASS2 thread tries to acquire musb
| LOCK but lock is already taken by
| CLASS1, so CLASS2 thread is
| spinning.
|
From Interrupt Context musb |
giveback function is called |
|
The giveback function releases | CLASS2 thread now acquires LOCK
LOCK |
|
ClASS1 Request's completion cal-| ClASS2 schedules the data transfer and
lback is called | sets the MUSB INDEX to Class2 EP number
|
Interrupt handler for CLASS1 EP |
tries to acquire LOCK and is |
spinning |
|
Interrupt for Class1 EP acquires| Class2 completes the scheduling etc and
the MUSB LOCK | releases the musb LOCK
|
Interrupt for Class1 EP schedul-|
es the next data transfer |
but musb INDEX register is still|
set to CLASS2 EP |
Since the MUSB INDEX register is set to a different endpoint, we
read and modify the wrong registers. Hence data transfer will not
happen properly. This results in unpredictable behavior
So, the MUSB INDEX register is set to proper value again when
interrupt re-acquires the lock

In commit a5ee652 "staging: r8712u: Interface-state not fully tracked",
the private boolean "bup" was set false when the interface was brought down,
as that seemed appropriate. This change has not caused any problems when
using NetworkManager or manual control of the device; however, when wicd
control is used, there is a locking problem in wpa\_supplicant, as shown in
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=42818.
This fix reverts the only code change in commit a5ee652. My
analysis is that "bup" is badly named. In its present form, it
seems to indicate the up/down state of the device, but its usage
is more consistent with an initialized/uninitialized state. That
problem will be addressed in a later patch.
Note: Commit 8c213fa, which introdued asynchronous firmware loading
for this driver, exposed this bug to a greater extent. That bug
is addressed in the next patch in this series.
This bug is also responsible for the bug in

USB: ftdi\_sio: add support for BeagleBone rev A5+
commit 444aa7fa9bd752d19ce472d3e02558b987c3cc67 upstream.
BeagleBone changed to the default FTDI 0403:6010 id in rev A5 to make life
easier for Windows users, so we need a similar workaround as the Calao
board to support it.

staging: zcache: avoid AB-BA deadlock condition
commit cfbc6a92212e74b07aa76c9e2f20c542e36077fb upstream.
Commit 9256a47 fixed a deadlock condition, being sure that the buddy
list spinlock is always taken before the page spinlock.
However in zbud\_free\_and\_delist() locking order is the opposite
(page lock -> list lock).
Possible unsafe locking scenario (reported by lockdep):
CPU0 CPU1
---- ----
lock(&(&zbpg->lock)->rlock);
lock(zbud\_budlists\_spinlock);
lock(&(&zbpg->lock)->rlock);
lock(zbud\_budlists\_spinlock);
Fix by grabbing the locks in opposite order in zbud\_free\_and\_delist().

staging: android/lowmemorykiller: Don't unregister notifier from atomic context
commit 1eda5166c7640092f512138be6899d050c3d62ed upstream.
The lowmemorykiller registers an atomic notifier for notfication of when
the task is freed. From this atomic notifier callback, it removes the
atomic notifier via task\_free\_unregister(). This is incorrect because
atomic\_notifier\_chain\_unregister() calls syncronize\_rcu(), which can
sleep, which shouldn't be done from an atomic notifier.
Fix this by registering the notifier during init, and only unregister it
if the lowmemorykiller is unloaded.

jbd2: clear BH\_Delay & BH\_Unwritten in journal\_unmap\_buffer

[Browse files](/torvalds/linux/tree/15291164b22a357cb211b618adfef4fa82fc0de3)

```
journal_unmap_buffer()'s zap_buffer: code clears a lot of buffer head
state ala discard_buffer(), but does not touch _Delay or _Unwritten as
discard_buffer() does.

This can be problematic in some areas of the ext4 code which assume
that if they have found a buffer marked unwritten or delay, then it's
a live one.  Perhaps those spots should check whether it is mapped
as well, but if jbd2 is going to tear down a buffer, let's really
tear it down completely.

Without this I get some fsx failures on sub-page-block filesystems
up until v3.2, at which point [4e96b2d](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/4e96b2dbbf1d7e81f22047a50f862555a6cb87cb)
and [189e868](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/189e868fa8fdca702eb9db9d8afc46b5cb9144c9) make the failures go
away, because buried within that large change is some more flag
clearing.  I still think it's worth doing in jbd2, since
->invalidatepage leads here directly, and it's the right place
to clear away these flags.
