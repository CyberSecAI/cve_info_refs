    "CVE-2011-4318": {
      "root_cause": "The application does not properly check if the \"Common Name\" field provided inside SSL server certificates matches the requested hostname of a server when proxying IMAP and POP3 connections with TLS/SSL protocols.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Inadequate certificate validation",
        "Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) vulnerability"
      ],
      "impact": "A remote attacker can conduct Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks via specially-crafted x509v3 certificates, potentially allowing them to intercept and manipulate communication between the Dovecot server and the proxied server.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Network-based attacks",
        "Exploiting the proxy functionality of Dovecot when TLS/SSL protocols are enabled (ssl=yes or starttls=yes)"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be positioned in the network path between the Dovecot server and the proxied server, and have the ability to generate or obtain a specially crafted x509v3 certificate for a domain different from the proxied host.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability exists when Dovecot is configured to proxy IMAP and POP3 connections to remote hosts. The fix skips the hostname check when the proxy destination is specified by an IP address, which might have backwards compatibility implications."
