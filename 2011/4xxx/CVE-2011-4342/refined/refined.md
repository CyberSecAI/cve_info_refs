Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2011-4342:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to the insecure inclusion of local or remote PHP files via the `wpabs` variable in the `wp_xml_export.php` component of the BackWPup WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI) / Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The plugin allows an attacker to include and execute arbitrary PHP code from local or remote locations by manipulating the `wpabs` parameter.
- **Missing or Incorrect Nonce Handling:** The plugin uses a nonce for security, however, the nonce value is a static constant and is not defined in the script, so it defaults to a known value `822728c8d9`. This allows attackers to bypass the nonce protection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code on the web server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
- **System Access:** The impact is classified as "System Access", meaning that the attacker could gain control over the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote, unauthenticated attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely without requiring prior authentication.
- The attacker sends a crafted HTTP request to `wp_xml_export.php` with the `_nonce` and `wpabs` parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the target WordPress website.
- The attacker must be aware that the BackWPup plugin version 1.6.1, or potentially other vulnerable versions, are in use by the target.
- The attacker must know the static nonce value (`822728c8d9`).

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Phil Taylor of Sense of Security Labs.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.7.2 of the BackWPup plugin.
- The provided proof of concept demonstrates how to inject and execute PHP code using a base64 encoded payload within the `wpabs` parameter.
