Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-4573:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an incorrect permissions check in JBoss Operations Network (JON). Specifically, JON failed to verify if a user had the necessary "modify resource" permissions before allowing them to delete a plug-in configuration update from the group connection properties history.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Authorization Check:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper authorization checks before performing a delete operation. This allows users without the required privileges to potentially remove configurations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Data Modification:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to delete plugin configuration updates without having the required permissions to modify resources. The specific impact of this deletion is not detailed in provided text, but may include denial of service or inconsistent operation of the monitored resources.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The attack vector involves a user with access to the JON management interface, but without the proper resource modification permissions.
*   **Specific Operation:** The attacker would need to attempt to delete a plugin configuration update from the group connection properties history.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be a user with access to the JON management interface, but without the correct resource "modify" permissions.

**Additional Notes**
*   The issue was resolved in JON 3.0 and a fix was included in a JON 2.4.2 update.
*   The fix was delivered via RHSA-2012:0089.
