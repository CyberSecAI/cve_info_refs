Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the identified vulnerabilities:

**Commit 762f98a - Fix: Bug #232 Multiple Cross-Site-Scripting vulnerabilities**

*   **Root Cause:** Insufficient sanitization of user input, particularly the username field, before using it in the application.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. The code was directly using the username from POST parameters without proper sanitization or validation.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to inject malicious client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.
*  **Attack Vectors:** By manipulating the username parameter sent in POST requests.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs the ability to send crafted POST requests to the Dolibarr instance.

**Commit d08d28c - Fix: Sanitize PHP_SELF**

*   **Root Cause:**  Inadequate sanitization of the `PHP_SELF` server variable.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability could be exploited through the `PHP_SELF` variable.
*  **Impact:** An attacker could potentially inject malicious script in the URL, leading to XSS if the `PHP_SELF` variable isn't properly handled.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Manipulating the URL to inject malicious code into `PHP_SELF`.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs the ability to craft URLs.

**Commit c539155 - Security: More security holes fixed**

*   **Root Cause:** Inconsistent use of user input and lack of proper escaping of data in SQL queries. Also, direct use of GET/POST parameters without proper sanitization.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Multiple vulnerabilities, including potential SQL injection and XSS vulnerabilities
*   **Impact:** An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries, leading to data breaches, or inject scripts for XSS attacks.
*   **Attack Vectors:** By manipulating GET/POST parameters, including 'rowid', 'search_group', and 'sall'.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs the ability to send crafted GET/POST requests.

**Commit 63820ab - Security: A lot of security fixes**

*   **Root Cause**:  Inconsistent sanitization and validation of user-provided data, as well as improper handling of sort fields/orders in database queries.
*  **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** SQL Injection vulnerabilities and XSS. The code was not properly sanitizing data used in SQL queries or outputting user data without encoding.
*  **Impact:** Attackers could potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries to extract, modify or delete data, as well as inject client-side scripts to conduct XSS attacks.
*  **Attack Vectors:** By injecting malicious values in the `sortfield`, `sortorder` or `sall` parameters in GET/POST requests.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**: The attacker needs the ability to send crafted GET/POST requests to the application.

**Summary of Vulnerabilities**

The provided commits reveal a pattern of vulnerabilities stemming from insufficient input sanitization and validation in the Dolibarr application. These vulnerabilities include XSS and SQL injection, arising from direct usage of user-supplied data without proper escaping or validation. The areas affected include:

*   **Usernames in login:** Not sanitized leading to XSS.
*   `**PHP_SELF**`: Not sanitized leading to XSS.
*   **Various GET/POST parameters:** Used directly in SQL queries or output, leading to SQL injection and XSS.
*   **Sort fields and order**: Used unsanitized in SQL queries leading to SQL injection.

The fixes address these issues by implementing input validation and sanitization.
