How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : phpldapadmin
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
Debian bug     : 646754
CVE IDs        : CVE-2011-4075 CVE-2011-4074

Two vulnerabilities have been discovered in phpldapadmin, a web based
interface for administering LDAP servers. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2011-4074

  Input appended to the URL in cmd.php (when "cmd" is set to "_debug") is
  not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. This can be
  exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser
  session in context of an affected site.

CVE-2011-4075

  Input passed to the "orderby" parameter in cmd.php (when "cmd" is set to
  "query_engine", "query" is set to "none", and "search" is set to e.g.
  "1") is not properly sanitised in lib/functions.php before being used in a
  "create_function()" function call. This can be exploited to inject and
  execute arbitrary PHP code.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.1.0.5-6+lenny2.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.0.5-2+squeeze1.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems will be fixed soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.0.5-2.1.

We recommend that you upgrade your phpldapadmin packages.

From: Vincent Danen <vdanen@...hat.com>

Subject: CVE request: phpldapadmin <= 1.2.1.1 XSS and and code injection flaws

Two flaws were found in phpldapadmin <= 1.2.1.1 that can lead to an XSS
or code injection:

1) Input appended to the URL in cmd.php (when "cmd" is set to "_debug")
is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. This can be
exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser
session in context of an affected site.

2) Input passed to the "orderby" parameter in cmd.php (when "cmd" is set
to "query_engine", "query" is set to "none", and "search" is set to e.g.
"1") is not properly sanitised in lib/functions.php before being used in
a "create_function()" function call. This can be exploited to inject and
execute arbitrary PHP code.

Could CVEs be assigned to these please?
