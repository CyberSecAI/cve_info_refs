Details=======
:package: celery:vulnerability: privilege escalation:problem type: local:risk: medium:bug-no: Celery #544:versions-affected: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4
Description===========
The --uid and --gid arguments to the celeryd-multi,celeryd\_detach, celerybeat and celeryev programs shippedwith Celery versions 2.1 and later was not handled properly:only the effective user was changed, with the real id remainingunchanged.
In practice for affected users the vulnerability means that malicious codeloaded in the worker process would be allowed to escalate privileges.
We take this issue seriously since the Pickle serializer used bydefault makes it possible to execute arbitrary code.
We recommend that users takes steps to secure their systems so thatmalicious users cannot abuse the message broker to send messages,or disable the pickle serializer used in Celery so that arbitrary codeexecution is not possible.
Patches are now available for all maintained versions (see below),and users are urged to upgrade, even if not directlyaffected.
Systems affected================
Users of Celery versions 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4 except the recentlyreleased 2.2.8, 2.3.4 and 2.4.4, daemonizing the celery programsas the root user, using either: 1) the --uid or --gid arguments, or 2) the provided generic init scripts with the environment variables CELERYD\_USER or CELERYD\_GROUP defined,are affected.
Users using the Debian init scripts, CentOS init scripts, OS X launchctlscripts, Supervisor, or users not starting the programs as the root userare \*not\* affected.
Solution========
Users of the 2.4 series should upgrade to 2.4.4:
 \* ``pip install -U celery``, or \* ``easy\_install -U celery``, or \* http://pypi.python.org/pypi/celery/2.4.4
Users of the 2.3 series should upgrade to 2.3.4:
 \* ``pip install -U celery==2.3.4``, or \* ``easy\_install -U celery==2.3.4``, or \* http://pypi.python.org/pypi/celery/2.3.4
Users of the 2.2 series should upgrade to 2.2.8:
 \* ``pip install -U celery==2.2.8``, or \* ``easy\_install -U celery==2.2.8``, or \* http://pypi.python.org/pypi/celery/2.2.8
The 2.1 series is no longer being maintained, so we urge usersof that series to upgrade to a more recent version.
Distribution package maintainers are urged to provide their userswith updated packages.
Please direct questions to the celery-users mailing-list:http://groups.google.com/group/celery-users/,
or if you are planning to report a security issue we request thatyou keep the information confidential by contactingsecurity@celeryproject.org, so that a fix can be issued as quickly as possible.
Thank you!

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
