Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2011-4946:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `user_field` variable within the `/e107_admin/users_extended.php` script.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw. The application fails to sanitize user-provided input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into database queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database Compromise:** An attacker could alter SQL queries, execute arbitrary database queries.
*   **Data Access/Modification:** The attacker can access and/or modify sensitive data within the database.
*   **Application Compromise:**  The attacker can potentially compromise the entire application.
*   **Underlying Database Exploitation**: The attacker could potentially exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying SQL database

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:**  The attacker exploits the vulnerability via a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/e107_admin/users_extended.php` script.
*   **`user_field` parameter:**  The malicious SQL code is injected through the `user_field` parameter of the POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Administrator Privileges:** The attacker needs administrator privileges to access the vulnerable script.
*   **`magic_quotes_gpc` Disabled:** The server needs to have `magic_quotes_gpc` disabled for the SQL injection to work.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrates how to inject malicious SQL code using the `user_field` parameter.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in revision 12306 of the e107 codebase.
*   This vulnerability is distinct from the XSS vulnerability described in the same advisory, which is assigned CVE-2011-4947.
