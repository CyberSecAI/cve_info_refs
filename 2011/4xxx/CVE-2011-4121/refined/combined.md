Subject: CVE-2013-2228 : Salt Stack RSA exponent of 1 (there can be only one!
 da-na-naaah! na-na-na-naahh-nah-nahhh!)

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

<https://github.com/saltstack/salt/commit/5dd304276ba5745ec21fc1e6686a0b28da29e6fc>

This is indeed CVE worthy, for example we have CVE-2006-7140 and
CVE-2011-4121 for RSA exponent 3, so RSA exponent 1 definitely qualifies.

Please use CVE-2013-2228 for the RSA exponent of 1 in Salt Stack

The OpenSSL extension of Ruby (Git trunk) versions after 2011-09-01 up to
2011-11-03 always generated an exponent value of '1' to be used for private
RSA key generation. A remote attacker could use this flaw to bypass or
corrupt integrity of services, depending on strong private RSA keys
generation mechanism.

Edit: This user does not represent the Salt project or Salt Stack

Just to clarify, this is about the public exponent, *not* keysize.

It's of course [questionable whether 1 (not a prime) was a good choice for the exponent](http://security.stackexchange.com/a/2339) to begin with, but it's hardly necessary to [lose faith over this](https://twitter.com/svs/status/350367599210663936).

As for the padding, that is [properly done on encryption](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/5dd304276ba5745ec21fc1e6686a0b28da29e6fc/salt/crypt.py#L346-L350).

So, all in all: good this was changed, but the world wasn't doomed before either.

Sorry, something went wrong.

Hehe, I was about to whack the Wikipedia article at you, but this isn't the issue.

Your explanation is sound, and I will just have to take your word, because quite frankly, I am not the professional cryptographer you want. I know crypto, but on a far higher level than mathematics. ;)

The commit should have fixed this once and for all, right?

Given that there were no reported compromises, there is no damage.

I am sure that Salt will at one point undergo an audit, that is if we don't change it all to SSH before (which we might well not). Would you want to volunteer?

Why was 65537 selected? Assuming correct padding and the 2048-bit RSA key size which I believe is your default, a smaller exponent like 3, would seem a better choice.

You should probably add 1 just to be safe and use 4.

You don't want to get bit by that trailing null.

e=3 is not a great choice; in the presence of other vulnerabilities, there are exploits that are easier to write on very-low-exponent RSA. 2^16+1 is the correct conservative choice.

[@tqbf](https://github.com/tqbf): surely, 65537 is better (and slower) than 3, but I fail to answer your earlier question because I don't know the precedence rules of ^ vs. % off the top of my head. ;)

A professional cryptographer did find this fault and evaluated the entire crypto sequence. This audit is what resulted in this change and the number selected was the recommended value to use.

With that said we are open to and continually seeking more analysis of the routines used.

Also, while I did not want to reveal it quite yet, I am working on an optional ssh transport system for Salt allowing Salt to run using just the ssh agent, although, of course, this makes Salt MUCH slower.

In the end, there are no known issues with the crypto in Salt today, and all security issues have been taken care of quickly, and publicly announced.

No, the cryptographer never told us that 1 was ok, he told us that the best choice was 65537 and that we should change it from 1 ASAP, which we did.

I think the larger question here is: why aren't you using TLS?

I will warn you in advance that "because we're using ZeroMQ" is a silly answer. This is at least the third vulnerability that has been found in your homebrew transport encryption, after the lack of a MAC and a timing attack. I hope you now realize that homebrewing your own transport encryption is a bad idea and you should seriously consider switching to TLS at this point to avoid future attacks.

I agree and am looking into working TLS into Salt, it is also noteworthy that we are actively working on an ssh transport system.

We are always looking for help and would appreciate help with getting TLS working in Salt and with ZeroMQ.

Ansible has a "fireball" mode by which they start a 0mq listener through SSH, but that does not actually solve the problem of the security of the 0mq channel.

I am 100% for TLS. SSH is a nice idea too, but probably will be too slow. Good to have as an option for small changes and bootstrapping though.

It's a shame 0mq doesn't do TLS itself.

A CVE was issued, bt since ti was our first CVE it seems that there was a communication problem, thanks @kseifriedredhat for making sure this was filed, I will make sure these are filed in advance in the future

Sorry, something went wrong.

@kseifriedredhat, yes, I submitted this to mitre right away, they allocated a CVE for it, but I must have dropped the ball somewhere since the CVE number that was given was not used on their end. I am conversing with Mitre to make sure that this does not happen again and that future security issues get CVEs allocated correctly.

This paper does not say that GPUs threaten e=3 RSA, Kurt. It's about using GPUs to implement RSA efficiently, not about solving IFP or DLP with a GPU.

Exactly what made you think e=3 *was* a vulnerability?

Maybe because of this <http://www.imc.org/ietf-openpgp/mail-archive/msg06063.html> ? e.g. [CVE-2006-4340](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-q7vf-rjwh-chxv "CVE-2006-4340") - AFAIK this was due to an implementation error of RSA and not a vulnerability of RSA itself.

e=3 is vuln to chinese remaindering: If you have three keys having e=3, modulus N1, N2, N3 and one message is encrypted using each key, then chinese remaindering allows calculating mod N1 x N2 x N3 and using an ordinary (continuous) cubic root.

Please PM me if you have questions on this.

Yes, I saw that. I don't know much about 0MQ, but it looks to me like a good case for DTLS. Its usage is not as widespread as TLS, but it's still much better than a homegrown encrypted transport protocol.

What [@yanosz](https://github.com/yanosz) explained is basically [Coppersmith's Attack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coppersmith%27s_Attack). The model of the attack involves low `e` such that the number of parties participating in the common encryption of a substantially similar plaintext is greater than or equal to `e`. IIRC, in this case, decryption can be performed without `d`, `p` or `q` in polynomial time... which is a Big Deal.

Well, about the homegrown encryption, all known vulnerabilities have been addressed. We can't assume it's bad just because of that, right?

Known vulnerabilities having been addressed doesn't mean there aren't many more not yet found. Furthermore, why waste time maintaining an encrypted transport protocol at all (regardless of the wisdom of doing so), when it would (eventually) be less work to use an established protocol.

[@listrophy](https://github.com/listrophy) A corollary to that is if you have a "web scale" crypto system with more than 2^16+1 users and you use encrypted broadcasts your system may be vulnerable if enough of those individually encrypted broadcasts are hoovered up by an attacker (aka NSA).

You never encrypt the exact same message to more than one person in RSA, nor do you ever encrypt deterministically. This is an example of where e=3 makes a vulnerability that already exists easy to exploit, but not an example of an e=3 vulnerability. It's also the reason we have OAEP ("modern" RSA encryption). If you're passing plaintext directly to modexp to implement RSA encryption, you're boned no matter what public exponent you use.

[@mattkeenan](https://github.com/mattkeenan) --- that is a corollary only if you are using RSA unsafely to begin with. In a competent RSA design, you'd never be passing deterministic plaintext directly to RSA; every message would be different by dint of padding. You must not ever use RSA without a secure padding scheme. RSA padding is not like block cipher padding; it's not a nicety, but instead absolutely required for the security of the system.

In response to this issue, [@thatch45](https://github.com/thatch45) has opened an issue to further improve salt's security model in the 0.17 release due mid-July:

[#5913](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/5913)

"A few things to bring up here. First off, cryptography alone is not considered sufficient security, it is unwise to, for instance, expose ssh on the internet. Salt is a command and control system, it is unwise to expose ANY such system to the internet without aggressive firewall rules (any config management system, a system that contains code that manages a config management system or a system that contains keys allowing access to command and control systems)."

@kseifriedredhat Sounds like these are the approaches [@thatch45](https://github.com/thatch45) is considering in the next release ( 0.17, due mid-July 2013 ) to enhance the system security:

"The main goals in my mind with the present crypto in Salt are these:

1. Change to use a lib where someone else maintains the crypto backend (libssh, paramiko, nacl, keyczar, libzmqCurve(very new, needs investigation), (pycrypto does a much better job of this now then when I first wrote Salt and we may be able to just lean entirely on pycrypto)). The question of us keeping up with the changes in the crypto world is of the greatest concern.
2. Get rid of M2Crypto - this is unmaintained and not python3 compatible
3. Keep the ssh like approach to keys (WAY easier to manage and less prone to user error - perhaps the most common cause for security breaches)
4. Enable a pure ssh agent based system for Salt that does not require installing minions or masters at all (in the works - as in it kind of works in git right now - but can't use the awesome ZeroMQ power that makes Salt so amazing - read: slow, no peer system, no syndic, no mine etc.)"

Could 1. be "switch to OpenSSL-provided TLS"? TLS key handling can function like SSH's with a little massaging, so it's not fundamentally a worse user experience.

TLS ought to be avoided for it's inherent complexity and unresolved issues / limited (secure) crypto configuration.

aside from an ssh-based tunnel, the proper solution here is to see through enhancements to libzmq or outsourcing salt's crypto to a more common library like NaCl/pycrypto/etc/

Those `os.umask` calls look odd. Are there multiple threads when this code runs?

### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.
Needs triage

### [CVEProject/cve-schema](/CVEProject/cve-schema)[Support PURL as identifier](/CVEProject/cve-schema/issues/173)

Seconded. Had I known that Purl would take off I would have added it to the original *CVE* JSON specification I wrote.
