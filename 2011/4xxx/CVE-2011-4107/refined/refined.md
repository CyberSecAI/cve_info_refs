{
  "CVE-2011-4107": {
    "Description": "The XML import plugin in phpMyAdmin allowed a remote attacker to read arbitrary files via XML data containing external entity references.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from the usage of the `simplexml_load_string` function in `libraries/import/xml.php` to parse user-provided XML data without proper sanitization. This function is vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) injection.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "XML External Entity (XXE) injection",
      "Lack of input validation/sanitization of XML data"
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker can read arbitrary files from the server or network that the web server has access to. This is due to the use of external entity references in the XML file.",
     "Attack vectors": [
      "By crafting a malicious XML file with an external entity reference.",
       "Uploading the malicious XML file through the phpMyAdmin import functionality."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker must be able to upload an XML file through the phpMyAdmin interface and have a valid session (authenticated to MySQL). No special privileges are required on the server."
