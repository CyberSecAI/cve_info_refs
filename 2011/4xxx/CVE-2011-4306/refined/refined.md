```
Root cause of vulnerability: Course section editing form data was being used without being filtered.
Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to unfiltered user-supplied data.
Impact of exploitation:  An attacker could inject malicious scripts into course section editing forms, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution in the context of other users' browsers who view the modified content. This could allow the attacker to steal cookies, deface the website, or redirect users to malicious sites.
Attack vectors: An attacker could submit specially crafted input through the course section editing form.
Required attacker capabilities/position:  The attacker would need to have the ability to edit course section information.
