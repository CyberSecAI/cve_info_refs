Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the identified vulnerabilities related to CVE-2011-4750:

**Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

*   **Root Cause:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before storing and displaying it. Specifically, the `ctl00$MPH$txtName_SettingText` parameter in several URLs is vulnerable to stored XSS.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Improper input validation and sanitization.
    *   The application stores unsanitized user-supplied data.
    *   The stored data is later rendered in the browser without proper encoding.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code, which will be executed in the browsers of users who view the affected application content. This can lead to:
    *   Stealing of session tokens or login credentials.
    *   Performing arbitrary actions on behalf of the victim user.
    *   Keystroke logging
    *   Potential for creating web application worms that spread among users.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attacker crafts a malicious payload containing JavaScript.
    *   The attacker injects the payload into the vulnerable parameter (`ctl00$MPH$txtName_SettingText`) when submitting a form on one of these URLs:
        *   `/Client/frmCustomReport.aspx`
        *   `/Client/frmCustomReports.aspx`
        *   `/Client/frmFavoriteReports.aspx`
    *    `/Default.aspx`
    *   The injected script is stored in the application and rendered when the page is loaded, executing in the browser of any user viewing the vulnerable page.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable SmarterStats web server.
    * The attacker needs to be able to access the application's functionality that allows user-controllable data to be stored.
* **Additional notes**
  *   The report highlights that the SmarterStats webserver runs on a different port (9999), and the XSS vulnerability can be exploited to inject javascript that gets reflected out of IIS on port 80. This is not part of the CVE description, but the report details this as a very common scenario.

**URLs affected:**

*   `http://SmarterStats 6.x (6.2.4100):9999/Client/frmCustomReport.aspx`
*   `http://SmarterStats 6.x (6.2.4100):9999/Client/frmCustomReports.aspx`
*   `http://SmarterStats 6.x (6.2.4100):9999/Client/frmFavoriteReports.aspx`
*    `http://SmarterStats 6.x (6.2.4100):9999/Default.aspx`

**Payload Example:**

`8b487<script>alert(1)</script>4627a0c1662`

**Additional Vulnerabilities Identified (Not related to CVE-2011-4750):**

*   **Reflected XSS** in `/Client/frmFavoriteReport.aspx` via `ctl00$MPH$txtName_SettingText`.
*   **Cleartext Password Submission** on `/login.aspx`.
*   **Password Field with Autocomplete Enabled** on `/login.aspx`.
*   **Cross-Domain Referer Leakage** on `/Admin/GettingStarted/frmGettingStarted.aspx`.
*   **Cookie without HttpOnly Flag** on `/login.aspx`.
*   **Incorrect Content Type** on several pages.
