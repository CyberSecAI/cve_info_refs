  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Incorrect acceptance of UPnP requests over the WAN interface.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of UPnP requests on the WAN interface of certain router devices.",
      "Specifically, 'AddPortMapping' and 'DeletePortMapping' actions are accepted, which should not be allowed from the WAN side."
    ],
    "impact": "A remote unauthenticated attacker can scan internal hosts behind a NAT firewall or proxy Internet traffic through the vulnerable device, potentially compromising internal network security and privacy.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack is carried out by sending UPnP requests to the vulnerable router's WAN interface.",
     "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker requires a network connection to the router's WAN interface and needs to be able to send UPnP requests. No authentication is needed."
