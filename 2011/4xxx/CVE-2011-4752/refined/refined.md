  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input, leading to stored and reflected XSS vulnerabilities.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-site scripting (stored)",
       "Cross-site scripting (reflected)",
       "Cleartext submission of password",
       "Password field with autocomplete enabled",
       "Cross-domain Referer leakage",
       "Cookie without HttpOnly flag set",
       "Content type incorrectly stated"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the application, which will execute within the browser of any user who views the relevant application content. This could lead to stealing session tokens, login credentials, performing actions on the victim's behalf or keystroke logging.",
    "attack_vectors": [
     "HTTP POST request to /Client/frmCustomReportItem.aspx, /Client/frmCustomReport.aspx, /Client/frmFavoriteReport.aspx  with a crafted ctl00%24MPH%24txtName_SettingText parameter to inject stored XSS.",
      "HTTP POST request to /Client/frmFavoriteReport.aspx with a crafted  ctl00%24MPH%24txtName_SettingText parameter to inject reflected XSS."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code through request parameters. For stored XSS, they need to have access to the application to store the malicious input. For reflected XSS, they can craft a malicious link and induce a victim to click on it.",
     "more_details": "The report provides specific URLs and parameters susceptible to XSS attacks, along with the vulnerable software version, which is SmarterStats 6.x (6.2.4100). It also details the exploitation process using  HTTP requests and the vulnerable parameters, as well as the associated HTTP responses containing the injected payloads.  The report also details additional security weaknesses such as clear text submission of passwords, cookies without HttpOnly flag, password field with autocomplete enabled, Cross-domain Referer leakage and incorrect content type."
