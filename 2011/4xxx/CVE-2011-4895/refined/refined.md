The provided content describes a critical anonymity vulnerability fixed in Tor version 0.2.2.34, which is identified as CVE-2011-2768.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Clients were reusing their TLS certificates when communicating with different relays. This allowed relays to identify a user by the identity key in their certificate.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  TLS certificate reuse by clients across different relays.
-  Relays' ability to identify clients based on their TLS certificate identity key.
-  Relays accepting `CREATE_FAST` cells on TLS connections, which allowed attackers to probe for unpatched clients.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could deanonymize Tor users by:
1. Knowing a client's identity key from their TLS cert.
2. Probing guard relays to check if that specific identity key is currently connected.
3. Using active traffic analysis techniques to identify the guard relays a user is connected to.
4. Leveraging the fact that users typically have unique sets of guard relays, acting as a fingerprint.

**Attack vectors:**
- A malicious relay can identify a client via the reused TLS certificate.
- An attacker can probe guard relays by sending a `CREATE_FAST` cell on a TLS connection to see if a specific client is connected to them.
- Malicious websites can use traffic analysis to discover the guard relays used by a Tor user visiting them.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to operate a malicious Tor relay.
- Ability to perform active traffic analysis on the Tor network.
- Knowledge of a client's identity key.

The fix involves clients and bridges no longer sending TLS certificate chains on outgoing OR connections. Relays also no longer consider a connection with a `CREATE_FAST` cell as suitable for satisfying a circuit EXTEND request. Additionally, directory authorities no longer assign the Guard flag to relays vulnerable to this issue.
