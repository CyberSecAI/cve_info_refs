### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

Package: gpw
Version: 0.0.19940601-8.1
Severity: normal
Tags: patch

Hi,

in some (seldom) cases gpw does not generate a password with the length the
user declared.

an example to see this problem:
> gpw 1000000 10 | sed '/^.\{10\}$/d'
prints out ~20 lines which are shorter than 10 chars.
The reason is, that there are bigrams whithout trigrams (qs in this case),
which can not get completed.

I resolved this problem by checking the bi- and trigrams in loadtris.c before
writing and exclude bi- and trigrams, which cannot be continued.

PS: I am not sure of the servity of this bug. On the one side, this bug
appears very seldom and shouldn't affect a typical user, but on the
other site, may a script uses this to generate a password (for example an
initial user password for a website or so), and when the bug appears here
a 2 or 3 char password could be generated instead a secure long password.
In this case, the bug could be security relevant.

Greetings,
Michael

Agreed, the manpage is pretty specific about that, the passwords are
supposed to be of the specified length.

To me that's definitely a security issue, though I'm not sure how much
people use gpw in a script (or gpw at all).

That'd be a start, but note that gpw doesn't look like the most
maintained piece of software.

Sorry, I did not receive the mail about that, maybe filtered out by
my multi-layer spam filters. That said, it is a bug. About security
I would note that an alphabetic only password should not be considered
safe enough. Gpw should be used in combination with some other randomizer
to obtain a semi-pronounceable password.
So I consider that bug from minor to neglectable at the security level.
Gpw can be considered safe enough in some contexts, but not in general.
And that's true independently on this bug.

That's sure but as for a lot of softwares, it is useful enough
for some goals.

This is security issue as as some people are using this via wrappers/scripts. Also has impact to policies set by organizations.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.
