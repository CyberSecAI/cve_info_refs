{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Some UPnP enabled router devices incorrectly accept UPnP requests over the WAN interface.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of UPnP requests on the WAN interface of routers, specifically accepting 'AddPortMapping' and 'DeletePortMapping' actions.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A remote unauthenticated attacker can scan internal hosts behind a NAT firewall or proxy Internet traffic through the vulnerable device.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the WAN interface by sending UPnP requests.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send UPnP requests to the WAN interface of the vulnerable router."
