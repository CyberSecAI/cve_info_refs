Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-4959:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from inconsistent database escaping of user-provided input, specifically when using "far east character encodings" with MySQL.
*   The code was using `addslashes()` or `DB::getConn()->addslashes()`, which are not multibyte safe, and can lead to SQL injection when certain character encodings are used.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:**  The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. By crafting malicious input with specific character encodings, an attacker can bypass the insufficient escaping mechanisms and inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach/Modification:** Successful SQL injection can allow an attacker to read, modify, or delete data stored in the database.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Depending on the database user's permissions, the attacker might be able to escalate their privileges within the database.
*   **Application Compromise:** In severe cases, a SQL injection might lead to complete compromise of the application and the underlying server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **User-Supplied Input:** The attack vector is through user-supplied input that is not correctly sanitized and escaped before being used in SQL queries. This could be via web forms, API calls or other data entry points.
*   **Specific Character Encodings:** The vulnerability is specifically triggered when using "far east character encodings" in the input.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Interact with the Application:**  The attacker must be able to interact with the application through the vulnerable input fields.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Input Points:** The attacker needs to identify where user input is used in a SQL query that is not properly escaped.
*   **Understanding of Character Encoding Issues:** They must understand how to use the character encodings to craft malicious SQL payloads.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix for this vulnerability involved replacing `addslashes()` and `DB::getConn()->addslashes()` with `Convert::raw2sql()`, which utilizes `mysql_real_escape_string()` to perform proper database escaping that is safe against multibyte characters.
*   The provided code snippets demonstrate the changes made to address the vulnerability within the SilverStripe framework and CMS. The changes consistently replace insecure escaping with `Convert::raw2sql()`.
