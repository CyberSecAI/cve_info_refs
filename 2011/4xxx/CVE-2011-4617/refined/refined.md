Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-4617:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insecure handling of temporary files in the `/tmp` directory by the `python-virtualenv` package.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The specific weakness is insecure file handling in `/tmp`. This suggests that `python-virtualenv` was likely creating files in `/tmp` without proper security measures (e.g., using predictable file names, not setting restrictive permissions, or not using `mkstemp()` or similar functions properly).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially exploit this to perform various attacks, such as:
    - **Local Privilege Escalation**: By creating a file in `/tmp` with a predictable name that `virtualenv` would later overwrite, an attacker might gain elevated permissions by tricking a privileged process.
    - **Denial of Service:** An attacker could fill up `/tmp` with files or use symbolic links to cause issues.
    - **Data Injection**: An attacker could create files with malicious content that `virtualenv` might later execute.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is local and involves a malicious local user or process that can create files in the /tmp directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have local access to the system where `python-virtualenv` is used.
- They need to be able to create files in the `/tmp` directory.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided changeset link shows that the vulnerability was fixed by using the `mkstemp()` function to create temporary files. This function creates files with random names, which makes them less vulnerable to attacks.
-  The vulnerability was discovered by Nico Golde and assigned CVE-2011-4617 by Kurt Seifried.
