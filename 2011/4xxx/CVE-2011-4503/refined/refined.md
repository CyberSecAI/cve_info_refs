The provided content describes a vulnerability related to UPnP requests being accepted over router WAN interfaces. This aligns with the general description of CVE-2011-4503, which involves UPnP vulnerabilities.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability stems from the fact that some internet router devices incorrectly accept UPnP requests over the WAN interface. Specifically, "AddPortMapping" and "DeletePortMapping" actions are being processed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Unrestricted WAN Access:** The core issue is that UPnP requests, which are generally meant for local network use, are being accepted from the public internet (WAN).
*   **Port Mapping Manipulation:** The acceptance of "AddPortMapping" and "DeletePortMapping" actions allows for manipulation of the router's port forwarding rules.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Internal Host Scanning:** Attackers can scan internal hosts behind the NAT firewall.
*  **Proxy Connections:** Attackers can establish proxy connections through the vulnerable device, allowing them to route traffic through the compromised router and back out to the Internet.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable by remote unauthenticated attackers over the internet.
*   **UPnP Requests:**  Attackers send UPnP requests, specifically "AddPortMapping" and "DeletePortMapping", to the router's WAN interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable router's WAN interface.
*   **No Authentication:** The attacker does not need to authenticate with the router.

**Additional Information:**
*   The document includes a list of affected vendors including Canyon-Tech, Edimax, Linksys, Sitecom, Sweex, Technicolor, and ZyXEL.
*   It also includes a CVSS score, which provides an estimate of the severity of the vulnerability.
*   It references Daniel Garcia's whitepaper for further technical details on the attacks possible.
*   The vulnerability is known to have been publicly disclosed on August 5th, 2011
