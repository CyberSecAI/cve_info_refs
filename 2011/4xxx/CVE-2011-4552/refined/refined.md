Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the security fixes in One Click Orgs version 1.2.3, which are relevant to CVE-2011-4552:

**Vulnerabilities and Root Causes:**

*   **HTML Injection:** HTML was not properly escaped in proposal descriptions and comments, leading to a potential for HTML injection.
*   **Open Redirect:** Users could be redirected to an external site by manipulating the URL used for registering a vote.
*   **Email Spoofing:** Members could set their email to that of an existing member, and new members could be added with the same email as an existing member.
*   **Credential Caching:** Browsers were permitted to cache login credentials.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The password reset system allowed a non-member to determine whether or not an email address corresponded to a valid user or not.
*   **Email Header Injection:** The organization's name was not properly escaped for the 'From' field of emails.
*   **Input Validation:** Some invalid characters were allowed in members' email addresses.
*   **Open Redirect:** Users could be redirected to an external site by inserting special characters into the organization's subdomain.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **HTML Injection:** Allows attackers to inject malicious HTML and JavaScript into the application, potentially leading to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. This could result in session hijacking, cookie theft, and defacement.
*  **Open Redirect:**  Attackers could redirect users to malicious websites, potentially leading to phishing attacks or malware distribution.
*   **Email Spoofing:**  Attackers could potentially impersonate other users within the application, potentially leading to social engineering attacks.
*   **Credential Caching:** Exposes sensitive login credentials to potential unauthorized access if the user's machine is compromised or the browser's cache is accessed.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Exposes user information (email existence) to non-members.
*   **Email Header Injection:** Allows attackers to potentially manipulate email headers, possibly leading to spoofed emails, and potentially bypassing email security measures.
*   **Input Validation:**  Allows for malformed email addresses potentially leading to unexpected behavior in the system.
*   **Open Redirect:**  Attackers could redirect users to malicious websites using crafted subdomains, potentially leading to phishing attacks or malware distribution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTML Injection:** Inserting malicious HTML in proposal descriptions or comments.
*   **Open Redirect:**  Manipulating the URL used for registering a vote or subdomain.
*  **Email Spoofing:**  Using the functionality to set a member's email address.
*   **Credential Caching:** Exploiting browser cache and security configuration.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  Using the password reset mechanism.
*  **Email Header Injection:** Injecting malicious characters into the organization's name.
*   **Input Validation:**  Inserting malicious characters into a member's email address during registration or profile modification.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **HTML Injection:** A user with the ability to post or edit proposal descriptions or comments.
*   **Open Redirect:** An attacker could be anyone, including anonymous users, if the vote registration URL and subdomain manipulation is not protected.
*   **Email Spoofing:** An attacker with access to the application's user settings.
*   **Credential Caching:** An attacker who can access the user's browser cache or local machine.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  An attacker with access to the password reset mechanism.
*   **Email Header Injection:**  An attacker with the ability to set the organization name or email.
*   **Input Validation:** An attacker with the ability to register a new account or modify an existing user's profile.
