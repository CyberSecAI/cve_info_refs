{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The system does not properly enforce field access restrictions in reports. Specifically, when a non-admin user has certain fields disabled in their profile, those disabled fields are still visible in pre-existing reports.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient access control",
      "Inconsistent enforcement of field-level permissions"
    ],
    "impact": "Non-admin users can view data in reports that they are not supposed to have access to based on their profile settings. This can lead to unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Accessing pre-existing reports as a non-admin user."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
        "A non-admin user account",
        "Access to the reporting feature"
    ],
    "additional_details": "The issue is that while non-admin users cannot select disabled fields when creating a new report, those fields are still displayed in existing reports. This highlights an inconsistency in access control, and reveals that pre-existing reports do not respect the user's current field access profile."
