The provided content relates to the release of Geeklog version 1.8.1, which addresses several issues, including information leaks and a potential XSS vulnerability in jQuery.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant security information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   **Information Leakage:** The OAuth consumer key and secret were exposed when the "rootdebug" option was enabled. Additionally, the MS SQL driver was displaying full details of SQL errors by default.
*   **Potential XSS:** While not directly affecting Geeklog, a possible XSS vulnerability existed in the jQuery library (version 1.6.3) used by Geeklog, which could potentially be exploited by add-ons that heavily utilize jQuery.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive information (OAuth credentials and SQL error details) was being exposed due to improper configuration and error handling.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** A potential XSS vulnerability existed within the jQuery library used by Geeklog, which could be exploited via add-ons.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Information Leakage:** Attackers could potentially gain access to sensitive data, like OAuth credentials, by enabling the rootdebug option, which could lead to unauthorized access.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Attackers could inject malicious scripts into the application via vulnerable add-ons using jQuery, potentially leading to account hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Information Leakage:** Attackers would need to have the ability to enable the "rootdebug" option, which is off by default, or have access to the MS SQL error messages.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Attackers could exploit vulnerable add-ons that rely on the vulnerable jQuery library to inject malicious code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Information Leakage:** Administrative access or knowledge of how to enable root debug or access to SQL error messages.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Ability to manipulate or create add-ons or find vulnerable add-ons.

**Additional Notes:**

*   Geeklog 1.8.1 was released to address these issues, and updating to this version was recommended.
*   The core Geeklog system was not directly affected by the XSS vulnerability, but the potential impact on add-ons made it a priority to update jQuery.
