**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) flaw present in Joomla. Specifically, it's in "various administrator screens".

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The primary weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization or output encoding in Joomla's administrator screens, allowing for XSS attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this XSS vulnerability could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the administrative interface of Joomla. This could lead to:
  - Session hijacking of administrators
  - Unauthorized modifications to the website's content
  - Data theft from the admin panel
  - Redirection of users to malicious sites
  - Full website compromise
  - Other malicious activities through the compromised admin session.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves injecting malicious scripts into vulnerable input fields of Joomla's administrator interface.
- An attacker would need to be able to supply malicious input to the affected screens.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs access to an administrative account of a Joomla instance using a vulnerable version (1.6.x up to and including 1.6.3).
- They need the ability to craft malicious input that isn't properly sanitized in the admin screens.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was discovered during testing with the Netsparker Web Application Security Scanner.
- The advisory indicates that all Joomla 1.6.x versions prior to and including 1.6.3 are affected.
- The fix is to upgrade to Joomla version 1.6.4 or later.
- This XSS vulnerability is distinct from issues addressed by CVE-2011-2708 and CVE-2011-3595, which were related to a separate XSS issue in Joomla from a different date.
