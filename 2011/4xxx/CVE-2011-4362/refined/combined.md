**Vulnerable App:**

```
29 of November 2011 was the date of public disclosure interesting
vulnerability in lighttpd server. Xi Wang discovered that mod_auth
for this server does not propely decode characters from the extended
ASCII table. The vulnerable code is below:

"src/http_auth.c:67"
--- CUT ---
static const short base64_reverse_table[256] = ...;
static unsigned char * base64_decode(buffer *out, const char *in) {
	...
	int ch, ...;
	size_t i;
	...

		ch = in[i];
		...
		ch = base64_reverse_table[ch];
	...
}
--- CUT ---

Because variable 'in' is type 'char', characters above 0x80 lead to
negative indices.
This vulnerability may lead out-of-boud read and theoretically cause
Segmentation Fault (Denial of Service attack).
Unfortunately I couldn't find any binaries where .rodata section before
the base64_reverse_table
table cause this situation.

I have added some extra debug in the lighttpd source code to see if this
vulnerability is
executed correctly. Here is output for one of the example:

--- CUT ---

First column is the offset so vulnerability is executed like it should be
(negative offsets). Second column is byte which is read out-of-bound.

How to run this very primitive Proof of Concept?

$ gcc p_cve-2011-4362.c -o p_cve-2011-4362
$ ./p_cve-2011-4362

	...::: -=[ Proof of Concept for CVE-2011-4362 (by Adam 'pi3' Zabrocki)

	Usage: ./p_cve-2011-4362 <options>

		Options:
			 -v <victim>
			 -p <port>
			 -d <remote_dir_for_auth>

$ ./p_cve-2011-4362 -h 127.0.0.1 -p 81 -d dupa

	...::: -=[ Proof of Concept for CVE-2011-4362 (by Adam 'pi3' Zabrocki)

		[+] Preparing arguments... OK
		[+] Creating socket... OK
		[+] Connecting to [127.0.0.1]... OK
		[+] Sending dirty packet... OK

		[+] Check the website!

$

Lighttpd will log this situation probably in error-log file like this:

--- CUT ---
..
..
2011-12-xx xx:xx:11: (http_auth.c.887) : is missing in
�Yg\���n�Xt�]rze���gY��\��Yb�Y(�d��r�[Y���-�xi��i�k�Wp�	]߶��\���@V��x���ize

--- CUT ---

Maybe you can find vulnerable binary?

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: CVE Request: lighttpd/mod_auth out-of-bounds read due to signedness
 error

Hi,

Xi Wang discovered the following issue in lighttpd:

for http auth we need to base64-decode user input; the allowed character
range includes non ASCII characters above 0x7f.

The function to decode this string takes a "const char *in"; and reads
each character into an "int ch", which is used as offset in the table.

So characters above 0x7f lead to negative indices (as char is signed on
most platforms).

Here the vulnerable code (src/http_auth.c:67)

---
static const short base64_reverse_table[256] = ...;
static unsigned char * base64_decode(buffer *out, const char *in) {
	...
	int ch, ...;
	size_t i;
	...

		ch = in[i];
		...
		ch = base64_reverse_table[ch];
	...
}
---

It doesn't matter if "broken" data is read - it just may allow more
encodings of the correct login information.

The only possible impact is a segfault, leading to DoS.

I had a look at some debian and openSUSE binaryies, and it looks like
there is always enough data (>= 256 bytes) in the .rodata section
before the base64_reverse_table table, so these binaries are not
vulnerable afaict.

we plan to release 1.4.30 soon, including the fix for this issue.

regards,
stefan

Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
Debian bug     : 652726
CVE IDs        : CVE-2011-4362 CVE-2011-3389

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in lighttpd, a small and fast
webserver with minimal memory footprint.

CVE-2011-4362

  Xi Wang discovered that the base64 decoding routine which is used to
  decode user input during an HTTP authentication, suffers of a signedness
  issue when processing user input.  As a result it is possible to force
  lighttpd to perform an out-of-bounds read which results in Denial of
  Service conditions.

CVE-2011-3389

  When using CBC ciphers on an SSL enabled virtual host to communicate with
  certain client, a so called "BEAST" attack allows man-in-the-middle
  attackers to obtain plaintext HTTP traffic via a blockwise
  chosen-boundary attack (BCBA) on an HTTPS session.  Technically this is
  no lighttpd vulnerability.  However, lighttpd offers a workaround to
  mitigate this problem by providing a possibility to disable CBC ciphers.

  This updates includes this option by default. System administrators
  are advised to read the NEWS file of this update (as this may break older
  clients).

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.19+lenny3.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.28-2+squeeze1.

For the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem will be fixed soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.30-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your lighttpd packages.

### out-of-bounds read due to signedness error

**Description**

For http auth we need to base64-decode user input; the allowed character range
includes non ASCII characters above 0x7f.

The function to decode this string takes a "const char \*in"; and reads
each character into an "int ch", which is used as offset in the table.

So characters above 0x80 lead to negative indices (as char is signed on most
platforms).

Here the vulnerable code (src/http\_auth.c:67)

```

static const short base64_reverse_table[256] = ...;
static unsigned char * base64_decode(buffer *out, const char *in) {
    ...
    int ch, ...;
    size_t i;
    ...

        ch = in[i];
        ...
        ch = base64_reverse_table[ch];
    ...
}

```

It doesn't matter if "broken" data is read - it just may allow more
encodings of the correct login information.

The only possible impact is a segfault, leading to DoS.

I had a look at some debian and openSUSE binaryies, and it looks like
there is always enough data (>= 256 bytes) in the .rodata section before the
base64\_reverse\_table table, so these binaries are not vulnerable.

Thanks to Xi Wang who discovered the issue:

`ch = (unsigned char) in[i];` should fix it; casting from unsigned char to int keeps the value positive (sizeof(int) > sizeof(char)).

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

# [Lighttpd Proof of Concept code for CVE-2011-4362](http://blog.pi3.com.pl/?p=277)

by pi3

29 of November 2011 was the date of public disclosure interesting vulnerability in lighttpd server. Xi Wang discovered that mod\_auth for this server does not propely decode characters from the extended ASCII table. The vulnerable code is below:

```
"src/http_auth.c:67"
--- CUT ---
static const short base64_reverse_table[256] = ...;
static unsigned char * base64_decode(buffer *out, const char *in) {
    ...
    int ch, ...;
    size_t i;
    ...

        ch = in[i];
        ...
        ch = base64_reverse_table[ch];
    ...
}
--- CUT ---
```

Because variable ‘in’ is type ‘char’, characters above 0x80 lead to negative indices. This vulnerability may lead out-of-boud read and theoretically cause Segmentation Fault (Denial of Service attack). Unfortunately I couldn’t find any binaries where .rodata section before the base64\_reverse\_table table cause this situation.

I have added some extra debug in the lighttpd source code to see if this vulnerability is executed correctly. Here is output for one of the example:

First column is the offset so vulnerability is executed like it should be (negative offsets). Second column is byte which is read out-of-bound.

How to run this very primitive Proof of Concept?

```
$ gcc p_cve-2011-4362.c -o p_cve-2011-4362
$ ./p_cve-2011-4362

    ...::: -=[ Proof of Concept for CVE-2011-4362 (by Adam 'pi3' Zabrocki) ]=- :::...

    Usage: ./p_cve-2011-4362 <options>

        Options:
             -v <victim>
             -p <port>
             -d <remote_dir_for_auth>

$ ./p_cve-2011-4362 -h 127.0.0.1 -p 81 -d dupa

    ...::: -=[ Proof of Concept for CVE-2011-4362 (by Adam 'pi3' Zabrocki) ]=- :::...

        [+] Preparing arguments... OK
        [+] Creating socket... OK
        [+] Connecting to [127.0.0.1]... OK
        [+] Sending dirty packet... OK

        [+] Check the website!

$
```

Lighttpd will log this situation probably in error-log file like this:

```
--- CUT ---
...
...
2011-12-xx xx:xx:11: (http_auth.c.887) : is missing in ÇYg\§ÎúnöXt¾]rzeëÛô¾gYóï\ðÿYbîY(¿dßørÖ[YóúÙ-·xiþèi°kÂWpË    ]߶øò\äÂ×@VØä¦xóúÝize

```

Maybe you can find vulnerable binary?

 out-of-bounds read due to signedness error
============================================
CVE-2011-4362 was assigned to this bug.
Description
-------------
For http auth we need to base64-decode user input; the allowed character range
includes non ASCII characters above 0x7f.
The function to decode this string takes a "const char \*in"; and reads
each character into an "int ch", which is used as offset in the table.
So characters above 0x80 lead to negative indices (as char is signed on most
platforms).
Thanks to Xi Wang who discovered the issue.
Detailed analysis
-------------------
Here the vulnerable code (src/http\_auth.c:67)
---
static const short base64\_reverse\_table[256] = ...;
static unsigned char \* base64\_decode(buffer \*out, const char \*in) {
...
int ch, ...;
size\_t i;
...
ch = in[i];
...
ch = base64\_reverse\_table[ch];
...
}
---
It doesn't matter if "broken" data is read - it just may allow more
encodings of the correct login information.
The only possible impact is a segfault, leading to DoS.
I had a look at some debian and openSUSE binaries, and it looks like
there is always enough data (>= 256 bytes) in the .rodata section before the
base64\_reverse\_table table, so these binaries are not vulnerable.
Upstream issue
----------------
http://redmine.lighttpd.net/issues/2370
Affected versions
-------------------
all versions before 1.4.30 / svn revision 2806
not all binaries are vulnerable (no vulnerable one found yet)
Fixed in
----------
1.4.x: http://redmine.lighttpd.net/projects/lighttpd/repository/revisions/2806
1.5: http://redmine.lighttpd.net/projects/lighttpd/repository/revisions/2807
Solutions or Workaround
-------------------------
There is no workaround (unless you don't need mod\_auth and you just disable it).
Apply lighttpd-fix-base64-signedness.patch, also inline below (patch applies
to both 1.4.x and 1.5)
