Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-4362:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the `base64_decode` function within `src/http_auth.c` of the lighttpd web server. This function decodes base64 encoded strings used in HTTP authentication. The code uses a `char` type to index the `base64_reverse_table`. Because `char` is a signed type, when the input contains characters with values greater than `0x7f`, they are interpreted as negative numbers, resulting in out-of-bounds access to the `base64_reverse_table`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds read:** The core vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read due to using a signed `char` as an index into the `base64_reverse_table` array.
*   **Signedness Error**: The vulnerability stems from a signedness error in how the character is handled.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The out-of-bounds read can cause a segmentation fault, leading to the termination of the lighttpd process. This can be exploited to perform a DoS attack.
*   **Potential Information Disclosure:**  Although not the primary impact, an attacker might potentially read arbitrary data from the `.rodata` section, depending on the memory layout, this data isn't expected to be sensitive.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP Authentication:** The vulnerability is triggered by supplying a specially crafted, base64-encoded string during HTTP authentication.
*   **Remote:** The attack can be carried out remotely by sending a malicious HTTP request to a vulnerable server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target lighttpd server.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:**  The attacker needs to know to craft a base64 string containing characters with a value above `0x7f` to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**

*   The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) code demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability is located in the `mod_auth` module of lighttpd.
*   The fix involves casting the `char` to an `unsigned char` before using it as an index, ensuring it's always positive and within the array bounds.
*   Some systems might not be vulnerable if the `.rodata` segment has enough space before the `base64_reverse_table` to prevent segmentation faults. However, the vulnerability is still present and could be triggered on other setups.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Xi Wang.

**Summary of relevant information:**

The core issue is an out-of-bounds read vulnerability in the `base64_decode` function of lighttpd, caused by a signedness error. This can be triggered with a crafted base64 string in HTTP authentication leading to a potential denial of service.
