**Bug ID:** SPL-44614, SPL-45172, SPL-45243

## Description

Splunk version 4.2.5 addresses three vulnerabilities:

* Reflected XSS in SplunkWeb (SPL-44614) (CVE-2011-4778)
* Remote Code Execution in Splunk Web (SPL-45172) (CVE-2011-4642)
* Directory traversal in Splunk (SPL-45243) (CVE-2011-4643)

At the time of this announcement, Splunk is not aware of any cases where this vulnerability has been exploited. Splunk recommends that customers upgrade any instances of Splunk to the latest maintenance release as soon as possible.

Splunk also recommends that you apply as many components of the Splunk Hardening Standards as possible to mitigate the risk and impact of exploitation.

## Affected Products and Components

Security vulnerabilities addressed by this maintenance release affect the following versions of Splunk running Splunk Web:

* SPL-44614 (CVE-2011-4778) and SPL-45172 (CVE-2011-4642): Splunk 4.2 through 4.2.4
* SPL-45243 (CVE-2011-4643): Splunk 4.0 through 4.2.4

Both SPL-44614 (CVE-2011-4778) and SPL-45172 (CVE-2011-4642) affect the Splunk Web component of the Splunk server software. Splunk Web refers to the web server used to deliver the Splunk user interface to the client browser.

## Mitigation and Upgrades

Splunk recommends that all vulnerable instances of Splunk be updated to the latest maintenance release.

**Splunk Version Recommendation** 4.0 through 4.2.4 Upgrade to the latest maintenance release

Splunk releases are cumulative, meaning that releases posted subsequent to those we are posting today will contain these fixes to these vulnerabilities as well as new features and fixes to other bugs and flaws.

## Credit

For SPL-44614 (CVE-2011-4778), Splunk would like to credit Emmanuel Bouillon of the NATO C3 Agency with the responsible disclosure of this issue.

For SPL-45172 (CVE-2011-4642) and SPL-45243 (CVE-2011-4643), Splunk would like to credit Gary Oleary-Steele with the responsible disclosure of this issue.
