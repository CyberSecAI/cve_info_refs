Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2011-4079:

**Root Cause:**
- An off-by-one error exists in the `postalAddressNormalize()` function within OpenLDAP's `slapd` daemon. Specifically, this occurs in the `UTF8StringNormalize()` function when handling zero-length strings.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The vulnerability is a one-byte heap-based buffer overflow. When a zero-length string is passed to the vulnerable function, a null byte ('\0') is written past the end of a one-byte buffer allocated on the heap.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The primary impact of this vulnerability is a denial of service (DoS). An authenticated attacker could potentially crash the `slapd` daemon by sending a specially crafted LDIF entry containing an empty `postalAddress`. This can be triggered by an empty postalAddress attribute, or a postalAddress attribute with the value "$".

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based. An attacker must be able to send LDAP traffic to the vulnerable OpenLDAP server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user to send the crafted LDIF entry. They do not need any special privileges beyond being able to connect and authenticate to the server.

**Additional Notes:**
- Some sources mention that the vulnerability has been present since 2003, affecting most OpenLDAP versions prior to the fix.
- Red Hat's Security Response Team initially considered this issue not to be a security vulnerability due to how memory allocation was handled in their environment. However, this position does not negate the vulnerability's impact on other systems.
- The fix involves correcting the off-by-one error in the `postalAddressNormalize()` function as seen in the provided patch links.
