Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2011-4458:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the handling of certain configuration options related to VERP (Variable Envelope Return Path) and the global `$DisallowExecuteCode` option within the Request Tracker (RT) application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Remote Code Execution (RCE) via VERP:**
    *   If the optional VERP configuration options `$VERPPrefix` and `$VERPDomain` are enabled in RT versions 3.6.1 and above, a remote attacker can execute arbitrary code.
2.  **Limited RCE for Privilege Escalation:**
    *   RT versions 3.8.0 and higher are vulnerable to a limited form of RCE that can be leveraged for privilege escalation.
3.  **Bypass of `$DisallowExecuteCode`:**
    *   RT versions 4.0.0 and above contain a vulnerability in the global `$DisallowExecuteCode` option. This option is designed to prevent the execution of arbitrary code, but sufficiently privileged users can bypass this setting, enabling them to execute code even if it was configured to be disallowed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers can elevate their privileges within the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote:** The vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely, specifically the VERP-related vulnerability.
*   **Local / Privileged User:** The bypass of `$DisallowExecuteCode` is accessible to sufficiently privileged users.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   For VERP-related RCE: An attacker needs the ability to send a crafted request to the vulnerable RT instance, provided that the VERP configuration is enabled.
*   For Privilege Escalation/Bypass: An attacker needs to be a sufficiently privileged user within RT (for bypassing $DisallowExecuteCode)
