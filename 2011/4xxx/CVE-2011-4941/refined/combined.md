This case is still not handled. Information from the URL:

The Piwik 1.5 release addresses a critical security vulnerability, which affect all Piwik users that have let granted some access to the "anonymous" user. Users should upgrade immediately.

Piwik 1.5 contains a remotely exploitable vulnerabiliy that could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code. Only Installations that have granted untrusted view access to their stats (ie. grant "view" access to a website to anonymous) are at risk.

CVE ID: not yet assigned
Known Versions Affected: Piwik 1.2, 1.3, and 1.4

This issue was disclosed to us privately and safely. Our thanks to Neal Poole for discovering and reporting the issue to the Piwik Security Team. Neal is the first bounty recipient of Piwik's Security Bug Bounty program.

This release also includes Zend Framework 1.11.6 which addresses a potential SQL injection vector when using PDO_MySql. Piwik users should be unaffected as it has used UTF-8 since Piwik 0.5.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):
