Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-4948:

**Summary:**

CVE-2011-4948 is assigned to a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability in eGroupware before version 1.8.002.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a flaw in how eGroupware handles file paths, allowing an attacker to include local files from the server's filesystem within the application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The application does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input used to construct file paths. This allows attackers to manipulate the path and include arbitrary files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially access and read sensitive files from the server's filesystem, such as configuration files, database credentials, or even source code.
- **Potential for Further Attacks:** The disclosure of sensitive information may allow an attacker to escalate privileges, further compromise the system or launch other attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Maliciously crafted URL:** An attacker would likely manipulate URL parameters or input fields that are used to construct file paths within the eGroupware application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the eGroupware server.
- The attacker may need to have some knowledge of the application's structure, file locations and parameters used.
