ICS Advisory
# MICROSYS PROMOTIC Vulnerabilities

Last RevisedSeptember 06, 2018
Alert Code ICSA-12-024-02

## Overview

This advisory is a follow-up to [ICS-ALERT-11-286-01 - MICROSYS PROMOTIC Vulnerabilities](/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-11-286-01), released to the ICS-CERT Web page on October 12, 2011.

Independent researcher Luigi Auriemma has identified and released three vulnerabilities in MICROSYS, spol. s r.o. PROMOTIC application without coordination with ICS-CERT, the vendor, or any other known coordinating entity. The vulnerabilities include directory traversal, ActiveX heap overflow, and ActiveX stack overflow vulnerabilities. Public exploits are known to target these vulnerabilities.

ICS-CERT has coordinated these vulnerabilities with MICROSYS, which has produced an update. Luigi Auriemma has independently confirmed the update resolves these three vulnerabilities.

## Affected Products

The following products are affected:

* PROMOTIC versions prior to Version 8.1.5.

## Impact

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may result in denial of service or data leakage.

Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.

## Background

PROMOTIC is a Microsoft Windows based supervisory control and data acquisition human-machine interface (SCADA HMI) software programming suite for creating applications that monitor, control, and display technological processes. This suite also includes support for a [web interface](http://www.promotic.eu).

MICROSYS, spol. s r.o. is a Czech company with headquarters in Ostrava. The PROMOTIC system is primarily used in Czech and Slovak Republics. It is also used in Poland, Hungary, Slovenia, Serbia, Bulgaria, and Romania.

## Vulnerability Characterization

### Vulnerability Overview

#### Directory Traversal

A directory traversal vulnerability may occur when a specially crafted request is passed to the web server running on Port 80\TCP. Successful exploitation could result in data leakage.

[CVE-2011-4518](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2011-4518%20) has been assigned to this vulnerability.

#### ActiveX Stack Overflow

A stack overflow affecting an ActiveX component used by PROMOTIC may occur when a specially crafted HTML document is opened on a client machine. Successful exploitation may cause a denial of service.

[CVE-2011-4519](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2011-4519) has been assigned to this vulnerability.

#### ActiveX Heap Overflow

A Heap Overflow affecting an ActiveX component used by PROMOTIC may occur when a specially crafted HTML document is opened on a client machine. Successful exploitation may cause a denial of service.

[CVE-2011-4520](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2011-4520) has been assigned to this vulnerability.

### Vulnerability Details

#### Exploitability

Three of these vulnerabilities are remotely exploitable.

#### Existence of Exploit

Public exploits are known to target these vulnerabilities.

#### Difficulty

An attacker with a low skill level would be able to exploit these vulnerabilities.

## Mitigation

MICROSYS recommends that customers or affected versions of PROMOTIC update their installations by downloading the latest version from MICROSYS’ website <http://www.promotic.eu/en/firm/microsys.htm>.

MICROSYS has produced a news release that contains additional information about these vulnerabilities. <http://www.promotic.eu/en/pmdoc/News.htm#ver80105>.

ICS-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices. Critical devices should not directly face the Internet.
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

The Control Systems Security Program (CSSP) also provides [a section for control systems security recommended practices](/ics/recommended-practices) on the CSSP web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents. ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to taking defensive measures.

In addition, ICS-CERT recommends that users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:

1. Do not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in e-mail messages.
2. Refer to [*Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams*](/reading_room/emailscams_0905.pdf) f for more information on avoiding e-mail scams.
3. Refer to [*Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks*](/cas/tips/ST04-014.html) for more information on social engineering attacks.

# PROMOTIC system news

**Main PROMOTIC versions overview**

The following description provides informations regarding the main PROMOTIC versions. There are some warning concerning the upgrades from lower to upper versions of the system, for example when some obsolete functions of the PROMOTIC system are no longer present in newer versions, or some operating system support has been remowed, etc.

Upgrades from older PROMOTIC version to newer version are free of charge during the period of 10 years since the licence has been created. For additional info see [PmUpgrade](PriceList/PriceList.htm#PriceList_PmUpgrade) and [PmUpgrade10](PriceList/PriceList.htm#PriceList_PmUpgrade10).

## Version: PROMOTIC 9

| News | State | Date | Download |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **[PROMOTIC 9.0](NewsPm900.htm)** | stable version | 7.1.2025 | [PROMOTIC9.0.31](https://www.promotic.eu/en/promotic/download/Pm0900.htm) |

- This version has been released in: **2018**
- This version is designed for: Windows OS 11/10/8/7/2008-22Server
- The following is no longer supported: Windows OS XP/Vista/2003Server
- An upgrade (i.e. transition from older to newer version) to this version can be done only from the PROMOTIC 7.5 version.

If the upgrade is needed to be done from older version, then it is necessary to go through the PROMOTIC 7.5 first.
- Main news and modifications:
- The development environment and runtime were separated into two individual programs.
- The application editor and the Panel editor were unified in the development environment. The graphics of the [PmaPanel](Objects/Pma/PmaPanel/PmaPanel.htm) object can now be edited directly without the need to open another editor.
- The viewers of alarms/events are now available as graphic objects [PmgAlarmStateViewer](Objects/Pmg/PmgAlarmStateViewer/PmgAlarmStateViewer.htm) / [PmgAlarmHistoryViewer](Objects/Pmg/PmgAlarmHistoryViewer/PmgAlarmHistoryViewer.htm) / [PmgEventViewer](Objects/Pmg/PmgEventViewer/PmgEventViewer.htm). It is now possible to completely adapt these viewers to application designer needs.
- The [JavaScript](ScriptLangs/JavaScript/JavaScript.htm) language can now be used also in [in the Pma objects editor](DtEnv/DtEnv.htm#Ch_PmaEdit). It is now possible to create applications while using only a single language. The [VBScript](ScriptLangs/VBScript/VBScript.htm) language is no longer needed.
- In order to increase the clarity of the system the application objects and graphic objects were renamed - now each object type has clear prefix:
- Each application object has Pma prefix (for example the PmData object was renamed to [PmaData](Objects/Pma/PmaData/PmaData.htm))
- Each graphic object has Pmg prefix (for example the PmiBar object was renamed to [PmgBar](Objects/Pmg/PmgBar/PmgBar.htm))
- See [Transition from older versions to PROMOTIC 9](Pm9Conv.htm).

- This version has been released in: **2009**
- This version is designed for: Windows OS 11/10/8/7/Vista/XP/[Embedded](Directions/WinEmbed.htm)/2003-19Server. For versions older than [Pm8.2.0](NewsPm802.htm#ver80200) installed on Windows OS 10/8 it is necessary to complete [Hardware (USB) licence key](PriceList/LicMedia/HwKey.htm) driver update.
- The following is no longer supported: Windows OS 98/Me/2000
- An upgrade (i.e. transition from older to newer version) to this version can be done only from the PROMOTIC 7.5 version.

If the upgrade is needed to be done from older version, then it is necessary to go through the PROMOTIC 7.5 first.
## Version: PROMOTIC 7

| News | State | Date | Download |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **[PROMOTIC 7](Pm7Conv.htm)** | stable version | 28.06.2012 | [PROMOTIC7.5.7](https://www.promotic.eu/en/promotic/download/Pm0705.htm) |

- This version has been released in: **2006**
- This version is designed for: Windows OS 11/10/8/7/Vista/XP/[Embedded](Directions/WinEmbed.htm)/2003-12Server/98/Me
- The following is no longer supported: Windows OS 95/NT
- This version is available in two variations: for [Unicode](Subsystems/Languages/Unicode.htm) and ANSII. The ANSII variation is meaningful only for Windows OS 98/Me.
- During the installation this version to Windows OS 2000 and higher system, [Hardware (USB) licence key](PriceList/LicMedia/HwKey.htm) driver installation failure may occur. The fixing procedure is described in [Known problems during the installation of the HW Key driver](PriceList/LicMedia/HwKey.htm#ProblemHWkey).
- This version uses the ne Microsoft graphic library (GdiPlus), that displays the texts a little bit wider. After upgrading from older PROMOTIC version it is possible that the size of some texts in graphic panels will be slightly different than before.

The PROMOTIC version 7.5 (no matter if 7.5.0 or higher) is very important because all currently running PROMOTIC applications (if the upgrade to the PROMOTIC 8 version is wanted) **will have to go through this version first**. The PROMOTIC version 8 is able to work only with applications, that went through the version PROMOTIC 7.5. The main reason is, that PROMOTIC version 8 no longer contains algorithms for conversion very old applications.

The PROMOTIC version 8 no longer supports some very old (not offered for a very long time) technologies. Therefore in this version 7.5, there is a new item "[Warnings](Subsystems/Info/InfoSystem.htm#Item_Warnings)" in the INFO system, that is displaying warnings regarding the usage of obsolete components in current application.

One additional item that is no longer available since version PROMOTIC 8 is the **"MDI type main window"**. The main reason for that is the fact, that using the [PmaWorkspace](Objects/Pma/PmaWorkspace/PmaWorkspace.htm) object as a main window is positively much simpler, more general and practical than the "MDI window".

If the application is using the "MDI" (all applications older than PROMOTIC 7), then this fact will also be highlighted in the "[Warnings](Subsystems/Info/InfoSystem.htm#Item_Warnings)" item of the [INFO system](Subsystems/Info/InfoSystem.htm) and the designer can simply transform his application in order to use the main window of the [PmaWorkspace](Objects/Pma/PmaWorkspace/PmaWorkspace.htm) type.

Because the PROMOTIC version 8 no longer supports the obsolete saving formats, it is necessary for those who use [Compound Pmg objects](DtEnv/PmgEditor/CompObject.htm) (these objects are saved in independent files with the \*.pmi extension), to transform these objects into version PROMOTIC 7.5.
## Version: PROMOTIC 6

- This version has been released in: **2002**
- This version is designed for: Windows OS XP/2000/NT/95/98/Me
- This version is available only in ANSII encoding, the [Unicode](Subsystems/Languages/Unicode.htm) is not available.
