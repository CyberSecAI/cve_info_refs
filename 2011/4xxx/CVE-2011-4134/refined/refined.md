  "details": {
    "vulnerability": {
      "root_cause": "The process trusts a user-provided value when calculating the bytes remaining in the packet. Using this tainted remaining length value, the process then copies packet data into a buffer on the heap.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper validation of user-supplied data leading to a heap-based buffer overflow"
      ],
      "impact": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code under the context of the lmadmin user.",
      "attack_vector": "A remote attacker sends a crafted packet to the lmadmin or lmgrd components listening on TCP port 27000 (default). The packet contains an opcode of 0x2f and a malicious length value.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker does not need authentication to exploit the vulnerability."
