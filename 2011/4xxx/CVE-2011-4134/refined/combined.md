| CVSS SCORE | 9.0, [AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:C](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=2.0&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:C) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [Flexera Software](http://www.flexerasoftware.com/) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | [FlexNet License Server Manager](http://www.globes.com/support/fnp_utilities_download.htm) |
| TREND MICRO CUSTOMER PROTECTION | Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID ['11526']. For further product information on the TippingPoint IPS: <http://www.tippingpoint.com> |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Flexera Software Flexnet License Server Manager. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.  The flaw exists within the lmadmin and lmgrd components which listen by default on TCP port 27000 (this can vary however if the port is in use). When handling a packet type having the opcode 0x2f the process trusts a user provided value when calculating the bytes remaining in the packet. Using this tainted remaining length value the process then copies packet data into a buffer on the heap. A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of the lmadmin user. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | [August 12, 2011] - Vendor publicly issued patch:<http://www.flexerasoftware.com/pl/12982.htm>  [July 28, 2011] - This vulnerability is being disclosed publicly without a patch in accordance with the ZDI 180 day deadline.  Mitigation supplied by vendor:This report has been entered into Flexera Softwares technical support case tracking system as IOC-000086525.
