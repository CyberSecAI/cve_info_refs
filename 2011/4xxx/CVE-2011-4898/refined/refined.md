  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2011-4898",
      "root_cause": "The WordPress 'setup-config.php' installation page allows users to install WordPress in local or remote MySQL databases. It prompts for database name, server, username, and password.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "MySQL username/password disclosure",
        "Lack of proper input sanitization"
      ],
      "impact": "A malicious user can omit the 'dbname' parameter and use the setup page to brute-force MySQL usernames and passwords of the target server or any MySQL instance accessible to it. This can also be used as a proxy to brute-force other MySQL servers outside of the target network.",
      "attack_vector": "A malicious user can send POST requests to the 'setup-config.php' page with a missing 'dbname' parameter, along with a supplied username, password and target host. The server's response to the request will vary based on the validity of the credentials being tested.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs network access to the WordPress installation page and the ability to send HTTP POST requests. They also need a dictionary of usernames and passwords to attempt."
