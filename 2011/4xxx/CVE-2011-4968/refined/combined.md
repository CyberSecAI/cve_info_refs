### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.
Needs triage

| [Description](#c0)  Agostino Sarubbo   gentoo-dev  2013-01-04 19:53:34 UTC  ``` From $URL :  nginx offers the ability for its http proxy module to talk to an origin server over https.  However, it does not verify the identity of the origin server in this case, which leaves it subject to MITM attacks between the proxy and the origin server.  Sadly, this appears to be unfixed for over a year after it was first reported:   <http://trac.nginx.org/nginx/ticket/13>  some patch review starts over here, but doesn't seem to reach any resolution:   <http://mailman.nginx.org/pipermail/nginx-devel/2011-September/001182.html>  As far as i can tell, there is no CVE assigned for this yet. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Kristian Fiskerstrand (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2014-06-17 22:15:31 UTC  ``` This appears to be fixed in 1.7.0 . From <http://nginx.org/en/CHANGES> :      *) Feature: backend SSL certificate verification.     *) Feature: support for SNI while working with SSL backends.  See also:  <http://trac.nginx.org/nginx/ticket/13> <http://trac.nginx.org/nginx/changeset/060c2e692b96a150b584b8e30d596be1f2defa9c/nginx> ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Kristian Fiskerstrand (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2014-08-17 17:47:56 UTC  ``` nginx 1.7.4 is now the only ebuild in the tree.   @Security, please vote on GLSA ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Yury German   Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev  2014-08-19 03:37:42 UTC  ``` GLSA Vote: No ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Kristian Fiskerstrand (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2014-08-19 07:45:13 UTC  ``` GLSA Vote: No ``` |  |

## Notes

### [seth-arnold](https://launchpad.net/~seth-arnold)

Backporting this fix is non-trivial and may break deployed
applications. Someone who really wanted this could use stunnel as a
work-around until 16.04 LTS is released.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=892030#c0)  Vincent Danen    2013-01-04 21:56:11 UTC  ``` It was reported [1],[2] that nginx does not verify the identity of an origin server when the http proxy module talks to that origin server over HTTPS.  This could allow for a MITM attack between the proxy and the origin server.  There are proposed patches attached to the upstream ticket, but as of yet this is not fixed in any release.

Subject: [CVE-2011-4968] nginx does not verify the backend's identity when proxying
to an https origin server
Date: Fri, 11 Jan 2013 11:37:07 -0500
```
Package: nginx
Version: 0.7.67-3+squeeze2
Severity: normal
Tags: upstream security
Control: found -1 1.2.1-2.2

When nginx is configured as a reverse proxy with an https origin
server, it is vulnerable to a MITM attack, because it does not verify
the certificate of the origin server.

This is upstream's bug <https://trac.nginx.org/nginx/ticket/13>, and
also [CVE-2011-4968](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4968).

It appears to have been known for over a year, but the proposed
patches to resolve the problem appear to have never made it through
the patch review process in upstream:

 <http://mailman.nginx.org/pipermail/nginx-devel/2011-September/001182.html>

nginx maintainers, what's the status?

"nginx maintainers, what's the status?"

... Look at the link to the root bug. There's a reason they haven't taken that
patch and committed it yet. This isn't trivial and we're not going to decide
how this "non-issue" should be rectified. Us making a small change could cause
a big headache down the road. Patience.

Honestly... If you don't trust the network in which proxy_pass is being sent to
or the network in between, you're already screwed. I don't even see a
legitimate need for proxy_pass to https backends.

"Trusting Trust"

* This issue will be closed when upstream closes it. We won't be doing any
special patching for this bug without careful consideration.

I'm closing this bug because it's an issue in upstream that needs to be solved
there. As I said, we won't be making this significant of a patch. If you need
to follow up on this, please see <http://trac.nginx.org/nginx/ticket/13>.

Hi,

This issue is not yet fixed in the package so it seems premature to close
it. You're probably right that upstream needs to do this and there's no
need for Debian to do it locally. But that is expressed with the
'upstream' and 'forwarded' tags; no need to close it for that reason. It
can be closed when a new upstream is uploaded to Debian that fixes the
issue.

Cheers,
Thijs

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=797033#c0)  Sebastian Krahmer   2013-01-07 14:22:56 UTC  ``` Via oss-sec:  Date: Thu, 03 Jan 2013 10:36:20 -0500 From: Daniel Kahn Gillmor  To: oss-security  nginx offers the ability for its http proxy module to talk to an origin server over https.  However, it does not verify the identity of the origin server in this case, which leaves it subject to MITM attacks between the proxy and the origin server.  Sadly, this appears to be unfixed for over a year after it was first reported:   <http://trac.nginx.org/nginx/ticket/13>  some patch review starts over here, but doesn't seem to reach any resolution:   <http://mailman.nginx.org/pipermail/nginx-devel/2011-September/001182.html>  As far as i can tell, there is no CVE assigned for this yet.          --dkg ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=797033#c1)  Sebastian Krahmer   2013-01-07 14:23:35 UTC  ``` CVE-2011-4968  Probably something for factory. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=797033#c2)  Swamp Workflow Management   2013-01-07 23:00:26 UTC  ``` bugbot adjusting priority ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=797033#c3)  Victor Pereira   2015-02-16 15:08:30 UTC  ``` we have it just in opensuse and its already fixed. ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=797033#c4)  Marcus Meissner   2015-02-18 07:57:28 UTC  ``` No, nginx is also on SLE  nginx-0.8 and nginx-1.0nginx-1.0 ``` |  |
