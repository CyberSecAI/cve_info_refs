Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-4103:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the unsafe deserialization of YAML post data within the django-piston framework. Specifically, the framework utilized the `yaml.load` method, which is known to be unsafe.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unsafe deserialization of YAML data using `yaml.load` instead of the secure `yaml.safe_load` method. This allows for arbitrary code execution if crafted YAML data is processed.
- Lack of input validation or sanitization when processing YAML data, making the application susceptible to malicious payloads.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server running the vulnerable application.
- Potential for complete compromise of the server and the data it stores.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a malicious YAML payload within a POST request to an endpoint handled by django-piston.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to a server that utilizes the vulnerable django-piston framework.
- No special privileges or prior authentication is needed.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability is present in `django-piston` versions prior to 0.2.3 and 0.2.2.1.
- The fix involves using `yaml.safe_load` which prevents the execution of arbitrary code during deserialization.
- The vulnerability also affects the `Tastypie` framework, another REST API framework for Django.
- This vulnerability was assigned CVE-2011-4103.
-  The vulnerability is specific to servers that have the `yaml` module installed.

The provided content offers more detailed information than a basic CVE description would typically include, outlining the specific method causing the vulnerability (`yaml.load`), the fix (`yaml.safe_load`), and the affected frameworks.
