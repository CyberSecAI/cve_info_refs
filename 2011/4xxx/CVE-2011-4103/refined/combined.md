| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=750658#c0)  Vincent Danen    2011-11-01 21:46:07 UTC  ``` A flaw in Piston, a popular REST API framework for Django, was reported [1] in how it handles de-serialization of YAML post data.  It uses the yaml.load method, which is unsafe and in certain circumstances could be used to allow remote execution of arbitrary code.  The updated versions of Piston (0.2.3 and 0.2.2.1) correctly use the yaml.safe_load method which prevents remote code execution.  This does not affect Django itself, but any users who have installed and use the django-piston package on Fedora may be vulnerable.  The upstream patch [2] is in git.

## Piston and Tastypie security releases issued

Posted by **Jacob Kaplan-Moss** on Nov. 1, 2011

[Piston](https://bitbucket.org/jespern/django-piston) and [Tastypie](http://django-tastypie.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html), two popular REST API frameworks for Django, today issued security releases for a remote code execution vulnerability. Users of these frameworks should upgrade immediately.

Users of Piston should upgrade to version [0.2.3](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-piston/0.2.3) or [0.2.2.1](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-piston/0.2.2.1); Tastypie users should upgrade to version [0.9.10](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-tastypie/0.9.10).

#### Details

It was discovered that both Piston and Tastypie share a similar vulnerability with respect to their de-serialization of YAML post data. Both Piston and Tastypie used the yaml.load method, which is unsafe. In certain circumstances this could be used to allow remote execution of arbitrary code. The updated versions, released today, correctly use the yaml.safe\_load method, which prevents remote code execution. Servers without the yaml module installed are not affected. Regardless, we recommend that all users of Piston or Tastypie upgrade immediately.

#### Why are we announcing this here?

It's important to point out that this issue does **not** affect all users of the Django framework. Piston and Tastypie are third-party modules and are not created by or distributed by the Django core team.

However, we're choosing to publicize this security release here because these modules are in common use on many Django sites. We're hoping that publicizing this fix widely will help protect all Django users.

#### General notes regarding security

As always, we ask that potential security issues in Django be reported via
private email to security@djangoproject.com, and not via Django's Trac
instance or the django-developers mailing list.

Security issues in third-party modules should be reported to the relevant maintainer(s). When in doubt, we're happy to receive security reports about third-party modules to security@djangoproject.com; we can help direct you to the proper venue for the issue.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : python-django-piston
Vulnerability  : deserialization vulnerability
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-4103
Debian Bug     : 647315

It was discovered that the Piston framework can deserializes untrusted
YAML and Pickle data, leading to remote code execution. (CVE-2011-4103)

The old stable distribution (lenny) does not contain a
python-django-piston package.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.2.2-1+squeeze1.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 0.2.2-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your python-django-piston packages.

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).
