Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2011-4623:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an integer signedness error within the `rsyslog`'s `imfile` module when processing log messages from monitored files. Specifically, the issue occurs when extending a counted string buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Integer Signedness Error:** The code uses an `unsigned short` to store the size of the new buffer, which can cause issues when a file larger than 64KB is being processed, leading to a potential integer overflow.
*   **Heap-Based Buffer Overflow:** The integer overflow leads to an undersized buffer being allocated on the heap. Subsequent attempts to write data to the buffer will then overflow the heap, leading to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploit leads to a crash of the rsyslogd daemon. This can lead to a service interruption as logging functionality will be unavailable. The daemon is reported to hang.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** An attacker with local access to the system and the ability to write to files monitored by rsyslog through the imfile module can trigger the vulnerability. The attacker needs to craft log messages in the monitored file to cause the buffer overflow.
*   **File Monitoring:** The vulnerability relies on the `imfile` module being enabled and configured to monitor a file controlled by the attacker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system.
*   **File Write Access:** The attacker needs to be able to write to files that `rsyslog` is configured to monitor via the `imfile` module.
*   **Knowledge of Configuration:** While not strictly a requirement, knowledge of `rsyslog`'s configuration (specifically which files are being monitored using the `imfile` module) would make exploitation easier.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The `imfile` module is disabled by default in Ubuntu.
*   The vulnerability affects `rsyslog` versions prior to the fix.
*   The fix involved changing the variable type used for storing buffer size from `unsigned short` to `size_t` in the function `rsCStrExtendBuf()` located in the `runtime/stringbuf.c` file
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 was affected by this issue. RHEL 5, Fedora 15 and 16 were not affected.
* Red Hat provided a patch via RHSA-2012:0796
