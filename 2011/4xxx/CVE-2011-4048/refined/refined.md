Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The Dell KACE K2000 Deployment Appliance includes a database configuration with a read-only account. This account has a known username and password, intended for third-party reporting applications. Insufficient access restrictions are applied to this read-only account.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- Attackers can perform offline password cracking to recover the original passwords.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote access to the database. Note that remote access is not enabled by default.
- Potentially, exploitation of another vulnerability (e.g., VU#135606) could enable remote database access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to remotely connect to the database.
- Knowledge of the read-only account's username and password.

**Additional Notes**

- The vulnerability is present if remote access to the database is enabled.
- The provided document is more detailed than the typical CVE description.
