The provided content indicates that Plesk Parallels Panel versions, specifically `psa v10.2.0_build1011110331.18` on RedHat el6 and version `20110407.20` for Windows, are vulnerable to multiple issues, including Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL Injection. CVE-2011-4732 is mentioned within the context of multiple other CVEs relating to the same vulnerability.

Here's a breakdown:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The root cause is related to improper input handling and sanitization within the Plesk Parallels Panel application. Specifically, the application does not adequately sanitize user-supplied input before rendering it in web pages, allowing for XSS. It also does not adequately sanitize input before passing to SQL queries, allowing for SQL Injection

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The panel is vulnerable to reflected XSS, as evidenced by the report detailing it as CWE-79.
*   **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The panel is vulnerable to SQL injection, as evidenced by the report detailing it as CWE-89.
*   **Javascript Injection:** The report also mentions general Javascript Injection as a possible exploitation of the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **XSS:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. This can lead to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Defacement of the panel
    *   Redirection to malicious websites
    *   Theft of sensitive information
*   **SQL Injection:** Attackers could potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries, leading to:
    *   Data theft or modification
    *   Unauthorized access to the database
    *   Denial of Service

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **XSS:**  Attackers can inject malicious scripts via manipulated URL parameters or other forms of user-supplied input that are not properly sanitized.
*   **SQL Injection:** Attackers can inject malicious SQL code through user inputs that are not correctly sanitized before being used in database queries.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have a valid login to the Plesk Control Panel, even with least privileges. This suggests that the XSS and SQLi vulnerabilities can be exploited by any authenticated user, not just administrators.
*   The attacker would need to craft malicious input for the vulnerable parameters.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerabilities were initially reported to Plesk in October 2010 and to CERT in April 2011, and were still present in the product by September 2011 when this report was created.
*   The report references multiple vulnerability scanners being able to detect the vulnerabilities, including Burp Suite, Acunetix, and Paros Desktop.
*   The vulnerabilities affect both Windows and Linux versions of the Plesk Panel,
    The report was specifically made for psa v10.2.0_build1011110331.18 on RedHat el6 and version 20110407.20 for Windows
