# Tor 0.2.2.24-alpha is out

by erinn | April 13, 2011

![](../static/images/lead.png)

Tor 0.2.2.24-alpha fixes a variety of bugs, including a big bug that

prevented Tor clients from effectively using "multihomed" bridges,

that is, bridges that listen on multiple ports or IP addresses so users

can continue to use some of their addresses even if others get blocked.

<https://www.torproject.org/download/download>

**Major bugfixes:**

* Fix a bug where bridge users who configure the non-canonical

  address of a bridge automatically switch to its canonical

  address. If a bridge listens at more than one address, it should be

  able to advertise those addresses independently and any non-blocked

  addresses should continue to work. Bugfix on Tor 0.2.0.x. Fixes

  bug 2510.
* If you configured Tor to use bridge A, and then quit and

  configured Tor to use bridge B instead, it would happily continue

  to use bridge A if it's still reachable. While this behavior is

  a feature if your goal is connectivity, in some scenarios it's a

  dangerous bug. Bugfix on Tor 0.2.0.1-alpha; fixes bug 2511.
* Directory authorities now use data collected from their own

  uptime observations when choosing whether to assign the HSDir flag

  to relays, instead of trusting the uptime value the relay reports in

  its descriptor. This change helps prevent an attack where a small

  set of nodes with frequently-changing identity keys can blackhole

  a hidden service. (Only authorities need upgrade; others will be

  fine once they do.) Bugfix on 0.2.0.10-alpha; fixes bug 2709.

**Minor bugfixes:**

* When we restart our relay, we might get a successful connection

  from the outside before we've started our reachability tests,

  triggering a warning: "ORPort found reachable, but I have no

  routerinfo yet. Failing to inform controller of success." This

  bug was harmless unless Tor is running under a controller

  like Vidalia, in which case the controller would never get a

  REACHABILITY\_SUCCEEDED status event. Bugfix on 0.1.2.6-alpha;

  fixes bug 1172.
* Make directory authorities more accurate at recording when

  relays that have failed several reachability tests became

  unreachable, so we can provide more accuracy at assigning Stable,

  Guard, HSDir, etc flags. Bugfix on 0.2.0.6-alpha. Resolves bug 2716.

  - Fix an issue that prevented static linking of libevent on

  some platforms (notably Linux). Fixes bug 2698; bugfix on

  versions 0.2.1.23/0.2.2.8-alpha (the versions introducing

  the --with-static-libevent configure option).
* We now ask the other side of a stream (the client or the exit)

  for more data on that stream when the amount of queued data on

  that stream dips low enough. Previously, we wouldn't ask the

  other side for more data until either it sent us more data (which

  it wasn't supposed to do if it had exhausted its window!) or we

  had completely flushed all our queued data. This flow control fix

  should improve throughput. Fixes bug 2756; bugfix on the earliest

  released versions of Tor (svn commit r152).
* Avoid a double-mark-for-free warning when failing to attach a

  transparent proxy connection. (We thought we had fixed this in

  0.2.2.23-alpha, but it turns out our fix was checking the wrong

  connection.) Fixes bug 2757; bugfix on 0.1.2.1-alpha (the original

  bug) and 0.2.2.23-alpha (the incorrect fix).
* When warning about missing zlib development packages during compile,

  give the correct package names. Bugfix on 0.2.0.1-alpha.

**Minor features:**

* Directory authorities now log the source of a rejected POSTed v3

  networkstatus vote.
* Make compilation with clang possible when using

  --enable-gcc-warnings by removing two warning optionss that clang

  hasn't implemented yet and by fixing a few warnings. Implements

  ticket 2696.
* When expiring circuits, use microsecond timers rather than

  one-second timers. This can avoid an unpleasant situation where a

  circuit is launched near the end of one second and expired right

  near the beginning of the next, and prevent fluctuations in circuit

  timeout values.
* Use computed circuit-build timeouts to decide when to launch

  parallel introduction circuits for hidden services. (Previously,

  we would retry after 15 seconds.)

**Packaging fixes:**

* Create the /var/run/tor directory on startup on OpenSUSE if it is

  not already created. Patch from Andreas Stieger. Fixes bug 2573.

**Documentation changes:**

* Modernize the doxygen configuration file slightly. Fixes bug 2707.
* Resolve all doxygen warnings except those for missing documentation.

  Fixes bug 2705.
* Add doxygen documentation for more functions, fields, and types.
