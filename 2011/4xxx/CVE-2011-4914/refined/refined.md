  "CVE-2011-4914": {
    "description": "The ROSE protocol implementation in the Linux kernel before 2.6.39 does not verify that certain data-length values are consistent with the amount of data sent, which might allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory or cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) via crafted data to a ROSE socket.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The ROSE protocol implementation in the Linux kernel lacks proper validation of data-length values against the actual data sent.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper validation of data lengths.",
         "Out-of-bounds read vulnerability"
      ],
      "impact": "Remote attackers can potentially:\n  - Obtain sensitive information from kernel memory.\n  - Cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read)",
