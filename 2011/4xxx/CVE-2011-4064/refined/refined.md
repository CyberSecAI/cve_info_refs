Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-4064:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization within the phpMyAdmin setup interface. Specifically, crafted values entered during the setup process were not correctly handled, leading to the possibility of injecting malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS, which occurs because unsanitized user inputs are reflected in the web page. 
- **Insecure File Storage:** If the configuration directory is writable, the injected XSS payload can be saved to this directory, potentially leading to persistent XSS attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the phpMyAdmin setup page.
- If the setup directory is writable, the injected code could be stored and executed whenever a user accesses the setup page, leading to persistent XSS.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the phpMyAdmin setup interface. An attacker crafts input values containing malicious script, which are then processed and rendered within the setup web page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to have access to the phpMyAdmin setup page.
- The attacker needs to be able to input crafted values into the setup interface.
- If persistent XSS is targeted, the attacker would need the phpMyAdmin configuration directory to be writable by the webserver.

**Additional Notes**

- The vulnerability is classified as "non-critical" because it only affects users who visit the setup page, which should not be publicly accessible in a production environment.
- The phpMyAdmin team provided patches to address this issue.
- The advisory mentions that documentation warns against leaving the configuration directory writable, which would be necessary for persistent XSS.
