Subject: unsafe use of /tmp
Date: Wed, 30 Nov 2011 10:36:03 +0100
```
Package: libproc-processtable-perl
Version: 0.45-1
Severity: important
Tags: security

Proc::ProcessTable can cache TTY information (not enabled by default).
For this it uses the file /tmp/TTYDEVS.

If caching is enabled, there is a race condition that allows to
overwrite arbitrary files in ProcessTable.pm:

102       if( -r $TTYDEVSFILE )
103       {
104         $_ = Storable::retrieve($TTYDEVSFILE);
  [...]
107       else
108       {
  [...]
112         Storable::store(\%Proc::ProcessTable::TTYDEVS, $TTYDEVSFILE);

If a symlink /tmp/TTYDEVS is created between line 102 and 112, the file the
link points to is overwritten.  Alternatively wrong information can be
provided.

The relevant code path can be reached with

  perl -MProc::ProcessTable -e 'my $t = Proc::ProcessTable->new(cache_ttys => 1, enable_ttys => 1); $t->table;'

Dear Debian Perl Group,
this doesn't warrant a DSA; but can you fix this through a point update
once an upstream fix is available?

Cheers,
        Moritz

Thanks for the CVE request too. I have forwarded the report to
upstream. But the latest upstream release was back to 2008. And thus
it might be unlikely that there will be a fix for it (before the
rewrite, as far as I know Jens Rehsack is planning to do so).

We can try to coordinate with fedora/redhat [1].

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=758866#c0)  Vincent Danen    2011-11-30 20:52:03 UTC  ``` It was reported [1] that the perl Proc::ProcessTable module would cache TTY information insecurely, using the predictable file name /tmp/TTYDEVS, which could allow an attacker to overwrite arbitrary files due to a race condition.  Caching is not enabled by default.  The relevant codepath can be reached using:  $ perl -MProc::ProcessTable -e 'my $t = Proc::ProcessTable->new(cache_ttys => 1, enable_ttys => 1); $t->table;'  The flaw is in ProcessTable.pm:  102       if( -r $TTYDEVSFILE ) 103       { 104         $_ = Storable::retrieve($TTYDEVSFILE);   [...] 107       else 108       {   [...] 112         Storable::store(\%Proc::ProcessTable::TTYDEVS, $TTYDEVSFILE);  [1] <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=650500>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=758866#c1)  Vincent Danen    2011-11-30 20:53:50 UTC  ``` 0.45 is the latest upstream version and was released in 2008; I don't think upstream will be providing a fix for this judging by the number of open bug reports.  A CVE was also requested:  <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2011/q4/439>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=758866#c2)  Vincent Danen    2011-11-30 20:54:29 UTC  ``` Created perl-Proc-ProcessTable tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: epel-all [[bug 758868](show_bug.cgi?id=758868 "CLOSED ERRATA - perl-Proc-ProcessTable: unsafe temporary file usage [epel-all]")] Affects: fedora-all [[bug 758869](show_bug.cgi?id=758869 "CLOSED ERRATA - perl-Proc-ProcessTable: unsafe temporary file usage [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=758866#c3)  Vincent Danen    2011-11-30 21:04:28 UTC  ``` This was assigned the name CVE-2011-4363:  <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2011/q4/440>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=758866#c4)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-10-08 09:01:03 UTC  ``` Upstream ticket:   <https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=72862>  Other references:   <http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/50868>   <http://www.osvdb.org/77428>   <http://secunia.com/advisories/47015>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=758866#c5)  Vincent Danen    2013-07-24 17:11:23 UTC  ``` This looks to be the fix:  <https://github.com/jwbargsten/perl-proc-processtable/commit/89f27a6d47df79b8bdb93781ba3247d7a5123165>  And is corrected in upstream version 0.48   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=758866#c6)  Fedora Update System    2013-08-02 21:52:09 UTC  ``` perl-Proc-ProcessTable-0.48-1.fc19 has been pushed to the Fedora 19 stable repository.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).
