Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the `pam_start()` function within OpenPAM not validating the `service_name` argument. This allows a user-controlled service name to be passed, which causes the PAM stack to parse user-owned configuration files and load user-provided Dynamic Shared Objects (DSOs).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Insecure Input Handling:** OpenPAM fails to sanitize or validate the `service_name` argument passed to `pam_start()`.
- **Uncontrolled DSO Loading:**  The vulnerability allows loading of arbitrary DSOs because the user-provided service name is used to look up configuration files and load modules specified within.
- **Lack of Specification:** The PAM documentation does not specify the format of a service name which contributes to the issue

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By crafting a malicious PAM service configuration file and a malicious DSO, an attacker can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the application calling `pam_start()`, typically root, if the application is setuid root.
- **Privilege Escalation:** In the case of a setuid root program like `kcheckpass`, this allows an unprivileged user to gain root access.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through a program (like `kcheckpass`) that calls `pam_start()` with a user-controlled `service_name`.
- An attacker needs to create a malicious PAM configuration file and a malicious shared object (.so) file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **User-Level Access:** The attacker needs to have user-level access to the system where the vulnerable application is running.
- **File Write Access:** The attacker needs to be able to write files to the file system to create the malicious PAM configuration and shared object files.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was tested on FreeBSD 8.1, and is likely to affect other BSD variants and potentially OSX.
- The issue is not present in Linux-PAM, which performs checks for `/` characters in the service name.
- The vulnerability exists because of unclear responsibility for input validation.
- The `kcheckpass` program is cited as a main example of a vulnerable application but isn't the root cause of the vulnerability.
- OpenPAM introduced a filter for the service name in a later commit, but this was not widely adopted by vendors at the time of discovery.
