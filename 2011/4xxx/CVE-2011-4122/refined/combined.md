### openpam trickery

While reviewing an entirely different server side component

of some code, I came across a funny vulnerability inside

**OpenPAM** (note that this is different from Linux-PAM)

as used in **FreeBSD** or **Solaris**. Yet, I only tested it on

a *FreeBSD 8.1* machine. The bug is that a program,

namely *kcheckpass*, which is suid to root, is calling

*pam\_start()*with a user provided argument which makes

the PAM stack parse user owned

config files which ends in loading of user

provided DSO's. WTF?!

Interestingly, **OpenPAM** recently introduced a filter for

the service name via

<http://trac.des.no/openpam/changeset/478/trunk/lib/openpam_configure.c>

commit but I dont think that any BSD or so vendor is

aware of it.

A really trivial PoC exploit can be found [here.](http://stealth.openwall.net/xSports/pamslam)

[Update:] **Solaris** is not using **OpenPAM** (at least the **OpenSolaris**

version I checked), but I could not find code that strips

off certain character sequences. As the PAM setup is different

from the */etc/pam.d* we know it is possible that there are no

consequences if the service argument is not filtered.

However a lot of BSD derivates

use **OpenPAM** and **OSX** as well. The question is whether one can

find a vector different than the *kcheckpass* which is usually

found with all **KDE3** and **KDE4** installs.

If you can confirm vulnerability on any **Solaris** or non-**FreeBSD**

machine, please let me know. Also if you found out how **OSX**

can be exploited this way.

The bug is in kcheckpass, not in OpenPAM. It should not allow the user to specify which policy to use.

BTW, I'm pretty sure FreeBSD's libpam maintainer is aware of recent changes in OpenPAM, but he has a policy of only importing official releases unless there is a critical bug that needs fixing.

Hi DES,

Indeed thats a point. Actually
such vulnerabilities exist because
its unclear who is responsible
for input cleaning.
FWIW, The same bug exists in squid and
squid3 package.

BTW, I'd like your opinion on [this patch](http://trac.des.no/openpam/changeset/493), which should alleviate the issue. I'm considering introducing similar restrictions on policy files.

Changesets [496 and 497](http://trac.des.no/openpam/changeset?old_path=%2Ftrunk&old=495&new_path=%2Ftrunk&new=497) should further improve matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Message-ID: <4EDF77A4.50600@kde.org>

Subject: Disputing CVE-2011-4122

Hello,

I've been asked by the kcheckpass maintainer to lodge a dispute of
CVE-2011-4122.

As explained in the blog entry linked from the CVE[1], the problem is
that neither kcheckpass nor OpenPAM validate the 'service_name' input
argument of pam_start(). This hole can be used to make PAM load
arbitrary shared libraries, which can be used to execute arbitrary code
as root, as kcheckpass is setuid root.

One could assume that kcheckpass should do the validation. However, the
PAM documentation makes no mention of what a service name is supposed to
look like, and consequently it must be treated as opaque by the
application code. Therefore all validation must be expected to be done
by the library, and failure to do so must be seen as a bug in the
library exclusively.

As a result, it is correct to list kcheckpass as an affected
application, but not as the origin of the vulnerability. The linked
advisories from ISS and Secunia are clearer about that.

Thanks,
Jeff

Sorry, misunderstood what you were getting at  :-)

Yes, agreed. It should be defined better, and as you pointed out apps
trying to filter or restrict things can be prone to mistakes. Which I
think exactly points out why this CVE is invalid; the lack of real
specification means that an application cannot successfully guess what
is valid, nor is it specified that an application should even try to
make such guesses. Given the current situation, OpenPAM is culpable
here, both for not checking the data it's receiving, and for having a
specification that makes it impossible for upstream apps to properly try
to help out.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
