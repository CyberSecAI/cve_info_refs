  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve": "CVE-2011-4138",
      "description": "The verify_exists functionality in the URLField implementation in Django before 1.2.7 and 1.3.x before 1.3.1 originally tests a URL's validity through a HEAD request, but then uses a GET request for the new target URL in the case of a redirect, which might allow remote attackers to trigger arbitrary GET requests with an unintended source IP address via a crafted Location header.",
      "root_cause": "Django's URLField, when configured to verify URLs, uses a HEAD request to check URL validity. In case of redirection, it uses a GET request to the new URL.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Unintended GET request triggered by a crafted Location header.",
        "Lack of proper handling of redirection in URL verification."
       ],
      "impact": "A remote attacker can cause the server to make arbitrary GET requests to a URL of their choosing, potentially leaking sensitive information or causing denial-of-service.",
      "attack_vector": "A remote attacker can craft a URL that, when checked, redirects to a malicious URL. The Django server will then issue a GET request to that malicious URL.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker only needs to provide a crafted URL to the vulnerable application. No other specific capabilities are needed."
