Debian Security Advisory DSA-2832-1                   security@debian.org

Package        : memcached
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-4971 CVE-2013-7239
Debian Bug     : 706426 733643

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in memcached, a high-performance
memory object caching system. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following issues:

CVE-2011-4971

    Stefan Bucur reported that memcached could be caused to crash by
    sending a specially crafted packet.

CVE-2013-7239

    It was reported that SASL authentication could be bypassed due to a
    flaw related to the managment of the SASL authentication state. With
    a specially crafted request, a remote attacker may be able to
    authenticate with invalid SASL credentials.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.4.5-1+deb6u1. Note that the patch for CVE-2013-7239 was not
applied for the oldstable distribution as SASL support is not enabled in
this version. This update also provides the fix for CVE-2013-0179 which
was fixed for stable already.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.13-0.2+deb7u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your memcached packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Memcached Remote Denial of Service PoC

 [Uncategorized](http://insecurety.net/category/uncategorized/)
6 years agoby [Patrick Macgregor](http://insecurety.net/author/iadmin/)

A long time ago, in 2011, a rather serious vulnerability was reported in Memcached. It is now 2013, and the vulnerability still exists in the latest version on the memcached Google Code page.

The report is here: <https://code.google.com/p/memcached/issues/detail?id=192>

Now, as you can see, by sending a specially crafted packet, we can cause Memcached to segfault, and essentially die. Memcached is used by a lot of high profile sites to speed up page load times, and killing it would impact a bit on site performance, so I was rather curious as to why this bug had not yet been killed.

As you can see from the report, the vulnerability is trivial to exploit. Just send the magic packet of death and it kills the memcached service. I tried to get remote code execution from it, but had no luck at all. Perhaps one of you might have more luck!

![](http://insecurety.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/2013-04-29-135036_1366x768_scrot.png)memcached ded

Exploit code available to download here: killthebox.py

As always, responsible use is encouraged. Killing $(big website) memcached might get you in trouble, so don’t do it.

As for the memcached devs: You have known about this for two bloody years and never fixed it. This is terribly irresponsible of you. Fix it.

# USN-2080-1: Memcached vulnerabilities

13 January 2014

Several security issues were fixed in Memcached.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 13.10](/security/notices?release=saucy)
* [Ubuntu 13.04](/security/notices?release=raring)
* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [memcached](/security/cves?package=memcached) - A high-performance memory object caching system

## Details

Stefan Bucur discovered that Memcached incorrectly handled certain large

body lengths. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause Memcached to

crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-4971](/security/CVE-2011-4971))

Jeremy Sowden discovered that Memcached incorrectly handled logging certain

details when the -vv option was used. An attacker could use this issue to

cause Memcached to crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2013-0179](/security/CVE-2013-0179))

It was discovered that Memcached incorrectly handled SASL authentication.

A remote attacker could use this issue to bypass SASL authentication

completely. This issue only affected Ubuntu 12.10, Ubuntu 13.04 and Ubuntu

13.10. ([CVE-2013-7239](/security/CVE-2013-7239))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 13.10

* [memcached](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/memcached)
  -
  [1.4.14-0ubuntu4.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/memcached/1.4.14-0ubuntu4.1)

##### Ubuntu 13.04

* [memcached](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/memcached)
  -
  [1.4.14-0ubuntu1.13.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/memcached/1.4.14-0ubuntu1.13.04.1)

##### Ubuntu 12.10

* [memcached](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/memcached)
  -
  [1.4.14-0ubuntu1.12.10.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/memcached/1.4.14-0ubuntu1.12.10.1)

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [memcached](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/memcached)
  -
  [1.4.13-0ubuntu2.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/memcached/1.4.13-0ubuntu2.1)

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

## Binary packages built by this source

[memcached](/ubuntu/precise/%2Bpackage/memcached):
A high-performance memory object caching system

Danga Interactive developed memcached to enhance the speed of LiveJournal.com,

 a site which was already doing 20 million+ dynamic page views per day for 1

 million users with a bunch of webservers and a bunch of database servers.

 memcached dropped the database load to almost nothing, yielding faster page

 load times for users, better resource utilization, and faster access to the

 databases on a memcache miss.

 .

 memcached optimizes specific high-load serving applications that are designed

 to take advantage of its versatile no-locking memory access system. Clients

 are available in several different programming languages, to suit the needs

 of the specific application. Traditionally this has been used in mod\_perl

 apps to avoid storing large chunks of data in Apache memory, and to share

 this burden across several machines.
