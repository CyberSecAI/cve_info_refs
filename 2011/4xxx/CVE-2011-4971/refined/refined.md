Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2011-4971:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from memcached's incorrect handling of certain large body lengths within specially crafted packets.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper input validation of the body length in a packet received by memcached.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A remote attacker can send a crafted packet that triggers the vulnerability, causing memcached to crash.
- This crash results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, rendering the caching service unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is remote, involving sending a specially crafted network packet to the memcached server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send network packets to the memcached server.
- No authentication is explicitly mentioned as a requirement.

**Additional Details:**
- A proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit, "killthebox.py", exists for this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was reported in 2011, but remained unpatched in some versions for a considerable time.
- The fix involves checking the length of the packet in `memcached.c`.
- A test case was also added to `t/issue_192.t` to prevent regressions.
