  "CVE-2011-4139": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "Django before 1.2.7 and 1.3.x before 1.3.1 uses a request's HTTP Host header to construct a full URL in certain circumstances, which allows remote attackers to conduct cache poisoning attacks via a crafted request.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the way Django constructs full URLs by using the HTTP Host header from incoming requests.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Use of untrusted HTTP Host header in URL construction."
      ],
      "impact": "A remote attacker can perform a cache poisoning attack. By sending crafted HTTP requests containing a malicious Host header, the attacker can influence the content that is stored in the cache associated with the crafted URL. This could lead to users being redirected to malicious sites, or other attacks if the cache is used in sensitive contexts.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Sending HTTP requests with a crafted 'Host' header."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.",
