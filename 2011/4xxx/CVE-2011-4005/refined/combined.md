The vulnerability can be exploited via a remote session to the Services Ready Platform Configuration Utility web interface.  Affected Products  * Vulnerable ProductsThe following Cisco Small Business SRP520 Series models are affected if running firmware prior to version 1.1.24:   + Cisco SRP521W   + Cisco SRP526W   + Cisco SRP527W The following Cisco Small Business SRP540 Series models are affected if running firmware prior to version 1.2.1:    + Cisco SRP541W   + Cisco SRP546W   + Cisco SRP547WTo view the firmware version on a device, log in to the Services Ready Platform Configuration Utility and navigate to the **Status > Router** page to view information about the SRP and its firmware status. The **Firmware Version** field indicates the current running version of firmware on the SRP500 Series device.Products Confirmed Not VulnerableNo other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Details  * Cisco Small Business SRP500 Series Services Ready Platforms are flexible, cost-effective,   fixed-configuration customer premises equipment (CPE) with embedded   intelligence to enable service providers to create, provision, and   deploy premium revenue-generating services - a variety of high-quality   IP voice, data, security, and wireless services - to small businesses on   an as-needed basis.      Cisco Small Business SRP500 Series devices running affected versions of firmware contain the following vulnerability:      **Cisco Small Business SRP500 Series Services Ready Platforms Command Injection Vulnerability**      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco Bug ID [**CSCtr45124**](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtr45124)([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only)and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2011-4005.      For this vulnerability to be exploited, a remote attacker must either entice an administrator to access a crafted link or perform a man-in-the-middle attack, intercepting an authenticated session. The operating system commands that are injected are run in the context of the root user.  Workarounds  * The following mitigations help limit exposure to this vulnerability.    + Disable Remote Management          **Caution:**  Do not disable remote     management if administrators manage devices via the WAN connection. This action     will result in a loss of management connectivity to the device.          Remote Management is enabled by default. Administrators can disable     this feature by choosing **Administration > Web Access Management**. Change the     setting for the Remote Management field to Disabled. Disabling remote management limits exposure because the   vulnerability can then be exploited from the inter-LAN network only.    + Limit Remote Management Access to Specific IP Addresses          If remote management is required, secure the device so     that it can be accessed by certain IP addresses only, rather than the default     setting of All IP Addresses. After choosing **Administration > Web Access Management**, an administrator can change the Allowed Remote IP Address setting to ensure that only devices with specified IP addresses can access the     device.  Fixed Software  * When considering software upgrades, also consult <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and any subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.      In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact the Cisco Small Business Support Center or your contracted maintenance provider for assistance.

| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 2.0 |
| Vector: AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C/CDP:ND/TD:ND/CR:ND/IR:ND/AR:ND |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV:Â Local AV:Â Adjacent Network AV:Â Network  Access Complexity AC:Â High AC:Â Medium AC:Â Low  Authentication Au:Â Multiple Au:Â Single Au:Â None  Confidentiality Impact C:Â None C:Â Partial C:Â Complete  Integrity Impact I:Â None I:Â Partial I:Â Complete  Availability Impact A:Â None A:Â Partial A:Â Complete     Base Score: 9.3 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E:Â Unproven  E:Â Proof-of-Concept  E:Â Functional  E:Â High  E:Â Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL:Â Official-Fix  RL:Â Temporary-Fix  RL:Â Workaround  RL:Â Unavailable  RL:Â Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC:Â Unconfirmed  RC:Â Uncorroborated  RC:Â Confirmed  RC:Â Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 7.7 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP:Â None  CDP:Â Low  CDP:Â Low-Medium  CDP:Â Medium-High  CDP:Â High  CDP:Â Not Defined   Target Distribution TD:Â None  TD:Â Low  TD:Â Medium  TD:Â High  TD:Â Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR:Â Not Defined  CR:Â Low  CR:Â Medium  CR:Â High   Integrity Requirement IR:Â Not Defined  IR:Â Low  IR:Â Medium  IR:Â High   Availability Requirement AR:Â Not Defined  AR:Â Low  AR:Â Medium  AR:Â High      Environmental Score: 7.7 |
