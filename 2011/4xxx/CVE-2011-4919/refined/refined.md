Based on the provided information, here's a summary of the vulnerability CVE-2011-4919:

*   **Vulnerability:** Information Disclosure
*   **Affected Software:** mpack 1.6
*   **Root Cause:** The mpack software creates temporary files with insecure permissions (0644). This allows any user on the system to read the contents of these temporary files before they are deleted.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    1.  An attacker can eavesdrop on mails (or parts of them) sent by other users on the system, including mails sent by root.
    2.  The attacker needs to monitor the creation of temporary files.
    3.  On FreeBSD, the vulnerability exists in the second part and after if the file is split into multiple emails due to the use of `O_TRUNC` without `O_EXCL` in `open()`. This could potentially lead to symlink or hardlink attacks.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can gain access to sensitive information contained within the emails, such as passwords or other confidential data.
*   **Affected Systems:** Debian, Gentoo, and FreeBSD (FreeBSD is only vulnerable in the split file case). Ubuntu releases 10.04 LTS through 17.04 are listed as not affected.
*   **Mitigation:** The vulnerability can be mitigated by changing the file creation permissions to 0600, ensuring that only the owner can read the temporary files. A patch has been created to address this issue.
*   **Fix:** Debian fixed this issue in version 1.6-8, by applying a patch by Sebastian Pipping.

The information available indicates the vulnerability is due to insecure temporary file creation, leading to information disclosure. A network-based attacker can potentially eavesdrop on email content by monitoring and accessing these temporary files.
