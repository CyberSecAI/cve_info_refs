Message-ID: <4EFF64E1.8020902@pipping.org>

Subject: mpack 1.6 allows eavesdropping on mails sent by other users

Hello oss-security,

I think I have found something :-)

Target software
===============
I recently stumbled upon a vulnerability in mpack 1.6 [1], a handy tool
to (1) wrap/unwrap files into/from MIME containers and (2) send files
via e-mail from the command line.

Potential damage
================
The vulnerability allows to eavesdrop on mails (or parts of them on
FreeBSD) sent by other any user on the system, including mails sent by
root.  I guess "information disclosure" is the term.

To reduce the probability of telling something here that turns out wrong
later, I wrote a little tool called "mpacktrafficripper" [2] to
demonstrate and verify the exploit.

The FreeBSD version may allow additional damage, see details below.

Affected distros
================
So far I have superficially tested the latest editions of three major
distros.  The results:

 - Debian (1.6-7):   vulnerable

 - Gentoo (1.6-r1):  vulnerable

 - FreeBSD (1.6):    vulnerable  (part 2 and after if split,
                                  see details)

Check [3] for my Git repo collecting the patches of all of these.

Technical details
=================
The original code of mpack 1.6 operates this way:

  1) make a tempfile name using mktemp

  2) open that file using open(..., O_CREAT|O_EXCL, 0644)
  3) write to the file                              ^^^^
  4) close it

  5) re-open the file using fopen(..., "r")
  6) read from it
  7) close it

  8) delete the file

So due to permissions 0644 everyone can read the file he opens the file
for reading before it's deleted.  With an open file descriptor, there
should not even be a reason to hurry.

So a call like

  # sudo mpack -s foo /etc/passwd fake@...l.com

can be eavesdropped on in Debian and Gentoo.
When instructing mpack to split the file into several mails as in

  # sudo mpack -s foo -m 1700 /etc/passwd fake@...l.com
                      ^^^^^^^
the tempfile names follow a pattern:

  foo
  foo.01
  foo.02

Now on FreeBSD the original use of mktemp followed by open with
O_CREAT|O_EXCL has been adjusted to this procedure, instead:

  1) make a temp file using mkstemp and close returned file descriptor
                              ^
  2) open that file using open(..., O_CREAT|O_TRUNC, 0644)
                                            ^^^^^^^
  3) to 8) as above

So mkstemp creates the first file (not open) which gets the permissions
right but all following files are created using open _without_ O_EXCL
and with 0644 permissions.  So the second part and after can be
eavesdropped on FreeBSD, too.  Additionally, there could be room for
symlink or hardlink attacks in that case, I have tested that.

A patch
=======
A patch could be to change create files with 0600 permissions rather
than 0644 as done by [4].  However, that approach affects creation of
non-temporary files too.  In some cases, users may not want that
behaviour -- you tell me.

Upstream
========
My attempts of contacting upstream failed.  I wrote to

  To: mpack-bugs@...rew.cmu.edu
  CC: "John G. Myers" <jgm@....edu>,
      "Christopher J. Newman" <chrisn@....edu>

and got this back:

  ----- The following addresses had permanent fatal errors -----

  niftytelnet@....com
    (reason: 550 5.1.1 unknown or illegal alias: niftytelnet@....com)
    (expanded from: <chrisn@....edu>)

  550 5.1.1 niftytelnet@....com... User unknown
  <<< 554 5.5.0 No recipients have been specified.

Next steps
==========
You tell me.  Does this need a CVE number?  With a dead upstream, how do
we best get this fixed in all distros ?

Best,

Sebastian

| [Description](#c0)  Marek Chmielewski    2007-03-15 19:54:42 UTC  ``` When I try send mail with attachment mpack give me a message "File exists" and dont send a mail.  $ mpack -s test file mail File exists  net-mail/mpack-1.5-r1 work fine.   Reproducible: Always ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Jonas Pedersen    2007-05-03 22:54:28 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 118097](attachment.cgi?id=118097 "Patch for mpack-1.6") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=118097&action=edit "Patch for mpack-1.6"), [diff](attachment.cgi?id=118097&action=diff "Patch for mpack-1.6")] Patch for mpack-1.6  Apply this patch instead of mpack-1.6-gentoo.patch already in portage. The difference between the two patches is that the change to use mkstemp have been reverted back to use mktemp. This should be safe as the temp file is opened with O_EXCL flag later in the program. When using mkstemp the file is created when mkstemp is called and opening file later with O_EXCL fails. This is reason for program giving "File exists" error. If mktemp should give a filename collision with an other temp file it still gives out an error when it is opened with O_EXCL flag set. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Christian Faulhammer (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-05-24 19:29:21 UTC  ``` Your patch leads to this:  cp unixpk.man mpack.1 xmalloc.c:27: error: conflicting types for 'malloc' xmalloc.c: In function 'xmalloc': xmalloc.c:37: warning: incompatible implicit declaration of built-in function 'exit' xmalloc.c: In function 'xrealloc': xmalloc.c:50: warning: incompatible implicit declaration of built-in function 'exit' make: *** [xmalloc.o] Error 1  ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Jonas Pedersen    2007-05-25 21:41:34 UTC  ``` I have only been able to reproduce the error, you mention, by NOT applying the patch.  I will not take full credit for the patch as the patch I attached is largely based on the one already in portage. I only changed it back to use mktemp instead of mkstemp.   Are you sure that you actually applied the patch to mpack? ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Tiago Cunha (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-06-20 03:28:40 UTC  ``` FreeBSD[1][2] and Debian[3] already have the patches to fix this.  I've download the FreeBSD patches except the patch-uudecode.c because gcc gave warnings (appending -Wall to the CFLAGS in the mpack Makefile) regarding the signedness (they changed char to unsigned char). I also sed'ed the TMPDIR from the FreeBSD default /tmp to /var/tmp (as the existing mpack-1.6-gentoo.patch does).  Executing "mpack -s test file mail" sends file to mail successfully. The error "File exists" ocurred because (as Jonas said) of the use of O_CREAT with O_EXCL, not in mktemp() but on the open() syscall - in the unixos.c file (when O_CREAT and O_EXCL are both specified on open(), open() fails if the file already exists).  The bzip'ed patch (15 patches total but they aren't bigger than 20Kb, but its a lot of patches) and the ebuild diff follows.

Thanks!  sparc doesn't need this package, if any user that uses sparc still uses it he'll complain.

Hi,

as it seems mpack has an open vulnaribility which has been assigned a
CVE already. See <http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/12/31/1> for
more information.

The security tracker is updated as I understand it, thanks to pabs.

Hauke

Dear maintainer,

Recently you fixed one or more security problems and as a result you closed
this bug. These problems were not serious enough for a Debian Security
Advisory, so they are now on my radar for fixing in the following suites
through point releases:

squeeze (6.0.6) - use target "stable"

Please prepare a minimal-changes upload targetting each of these suites,
and submit a debdiff to the Release Team [0] for consideration. They will
offer additional guidance or instruct you to upload your package.

I will happily assist you at any stage if the patch is straightforward and
you need help. Please keep me in CC at all times so I can
track [1] the progress of this request.

For details of this process and the rationale, please see the original
announcement [2] and my blog post [3].

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.
