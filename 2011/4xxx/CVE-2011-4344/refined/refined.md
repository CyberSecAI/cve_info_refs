```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability exists in the Winstone servlet container, which is used by Jenkins when running in standalone mode. Error messages were not properly escaped before being displayed in the HTML error page, which allows for cross-site scripting.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can embed malicious JavaScript into pages generated by Jenkins. This allows the attacker to perform actions on behalf of the user, including impersonating an administrator.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker can trigger the display of an error message containing malicious JavaScript. This could be done by crafting specific requests that cause the application to generate error messages.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker does not need a valid user account to exploit this vulnerability. They can trigger the vulnerability remotely."
