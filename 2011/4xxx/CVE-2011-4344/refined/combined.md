# CloudBees Security Advisory 2011-11-08

Vulnerability in Jenkins Core

Luca De Fulgentis discovered a [cross-site scripting vulnerability](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting) in Jenkins that allows an attacker to embed malicious JavaScript into pages generated by Jenkins. The attacker does not need a valid user account in order to exploit this vulnerability.

This affects all versions of Jenkins prior to 1.438 and 1.409.3, but only if you are running it on its stand-alone container. This "stand-alone container" setup includes those who have installed Jenkins via native packages, including Windows, Mac OS X, Debian, Redhat, and OpenSUSE.

### Severity

CloudBees rate this vulnerability as **high**, as the attack is passive, even though it allows an attacker to impersonate the administrator.

### Fix

This issue has been fixed in Jenkins 1.438. We recommend you update your Jenkins to this version or later. If you don't see the update in your update center, you can [download it manually](http://mirrors.jenkins-ci.org/war/1.438/jenkins.war) and replace your `jenkins.war` . LTS users should update to Jenkins [1.409.3](http://mirrors.jenkins-ci.org/war-stable/1.409.3/jenkins.war), which fixes this problem.

Running Jenkins on other servlet containers is another possible fix to the problem, such as [jetty runner](http://blogs.webtide.com/janb/entry/jetty_runner) , which allows similar command-line execution.

Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).
