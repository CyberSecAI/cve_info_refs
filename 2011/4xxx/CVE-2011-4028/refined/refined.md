Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-4028:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way the X.Org X11 server manages temporary lock files. Specifically, the server uses the `open()` function without the `O_NOFOLLOW` flag when attempting to read from an existing lock file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Symbolic Link Following:** The lack of the `O_NOFOLLOW` flag causes the `open()` function to follow symbolic links.
- **File Existence Disclosure:** A local attacker can exploit this by creating a symbolic link with the same name as the X server lock file and pointing it to a target file or directory they are interested in. If the target exists the server will follow the link and attempt to open the target, and the attacker can deduce from the result.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **File Existence Disclosure:**  An unprivileged local attacker can determine the existence of files or directories that they normally would not have access to by observing whether the X server successfully opens a file pointed to by the attacker-controlled symbolic link. This can reveal sensitive information about the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system.
- **Symbolic Link Creation:** The attacker needs to be able to create symbolic links in the appropriate directory where the X server creates its lock files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unprivileged User:** The attacker does not need special privileges.
- **X Server Access:** The attacker needs to be able to run the X server.

**Technical Details:**

The fix for this vulnerability involves modifying the `os/utils.c` file in the X.Org server codebase. The `open()` call is changed from:
```c
lfd = open(LockFile, O_RDONLY);
```
to:
```c
lfd = open(LockFile, O_RDONLY|O_NOFOLLOW);
```
The addition of `O_NOFOLLOW` ensures that symbolic links are not followed, preventing the disclosure of information through symbolic link attacks.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability was rated as "Low" severity by Red Hat.
- The fix for this vulnerability was included in Red Hat Enterprise Linux updates: RHSA-2012:0303 and RHSA-2012:0939.
- The vulnerability was initially reported by a researcher with the nickname "vladz".
