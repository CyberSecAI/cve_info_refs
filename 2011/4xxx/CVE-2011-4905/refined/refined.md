Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-4905:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way Apache ActiveMQ handles the "failover" feature. Specifically, when a client attempts to connect using a "failover:tcp://[IP]:61616" connection string, the broker creates a TCP connection even if a valid session is not established. Due to the failure mechanism the TCP connections are kept active even when no valid session has been created. This behavior allows an attacker to exhaust server resources by initiating numerous connections without proper authentication or session establishment.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of control over the number of TCP connections created during the failover process. The broker does not properly close the connections when a session isn't established, leading to resource exhaustion.
*   **Missing Authentication/Session Management:** The vulnerability is exacerbated by the fact that an unauthenticated user can trigger the resource exhaustion simply by issuing connection requests with the failover string, without establishing a valid session.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The impact is a denial of service. By sending a large number of connection requests using the "failover" URL, an attacker can cause the ActiveMQ broker to consume excessive resources, specifically open file handles. This leads to a `java.net.SocketException: Too many open files` exception which will freeze or crash the broker service.
*  **Potential Cascading Failures:** The DoS can also lead to connected systems crashing since they rely on the broker's availability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is network-based, with the attacker sending malicious connection requests to the ActiveMQ broker service.
*   **Connection String Abuse:** The specific attack vector is the use of the "failover:tcp://" connection string to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the ActiveMQ broker's port (default 61616).
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need valid credentials to exploit this vulnerability since it occurs before authentication process

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Apache ActiveMQ versions prior to 5.6.0.
*   The issue is present in the default configuration, and is not mitigated by different authentication plugins.
* The fix includes changes to how connections are handled on error and to only stop the transport when a java.lang.SecurityException is thrown.
* The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Luca Carettoni, according to the Apache JIRA ticket.
*  A proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit was provided in the Jira ticket.
