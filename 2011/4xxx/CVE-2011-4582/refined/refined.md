Based on the provided content, here's the information related to CVE-2011-4582:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Calendar's `set.php` page was accepting a full URL for redirection without validating if the URL was within the Moodle site. This lack of validation allows for a potential open redirect.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Open Redirect: The calendar set page does not validate the `$returnurl` parameter, which could lead to an open redirect vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Malicious redirection: An attacker could craft a malicious URL that redirects users to an arbitrary external website, potentially leading to phishing or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious URL parameter: By manipulating the `$returnurl` parameter in the Calendar's `set.php` page, an attacker can redirect a user to an external, attacker-controlled website.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious link with a crafted `returnurl` parameter. The attacker doesn't need any special privileges on the Moodle platform.

**Additional Details**
- The vulnerability is identified by the Moodle Security Advisory (MSA) number MSA-11-0043, and the associated issue number is MDL-28720.
- The affected versions are 2.1 to 2.1.2+. Versions 2.0.x and 1.9.x were not affected.
- A fix is referenced in the Moodle git repository.
