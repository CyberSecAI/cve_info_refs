Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-4597:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability arises from inconsistent handling of NAT (Network Address Translation) settings for SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) requests within the Asterisk software. Specifically, a discrepancy between the global NAT settings in the `[general]` section of the `sip.conf` file and the NAT settings for individual users/peers/friends can be exploited.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** When the global NAT setting and a specific user/peer NAT setting differ, the server's response behavior varies based on the source port and Via header.
*   **Inconsistent NAT Handling:**  The different `nat` settings (`yes`, `no`, `force_rport`, `comedia`, `never`, `route`) dictate whether Asterisk responds to the port from which the request was received or the port specified in the Via header. This inconsistency allows for enumeration of usernames.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SIP Username Enumeration:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can discover valid SIP usernames by sending requests to different ports than the one specified in the Via header. This information can then be used for further attacks such as password guessing or social engineering.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote:** The attack can be performed remotely over the network.
*   **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need to have valid credentials for the SIP server.
*   **UDP:** The vulnerability occurs when using SIP over UDP.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send SIP requests to the Asterisk server.
*   The attacker needs to be aware of the discrepancy in NAT settings between the general and user/peer configurations.
*   The attacker must send the SIP request to a different port than specified in the Via header to trigger the vulnerability and potentially enumerate usernames

**Additional Notes:**

*   The issue is more of a general problem with SIP over UDP with NAT involved.
*   The default NAT setting was changed to `force_rport` in Asterisk versions supporting this value and to `yes` for other versions to respond to the port from which the request was received.
*   The documentation now recommends configuring NAT settings at the global level rather than for individual users/peers to avoid this vulnerability.
*   The advisory mentions that a discussion about the reasons for the change and why no general fix is provided can be found in the mailing list discussion referenced in the "Links" section.
*   Asterisk versions 1.4.43, 1.6.2.21, and 1.8.7.2 include the default NAT setting change.
