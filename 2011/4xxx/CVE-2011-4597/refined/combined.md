# [asterisk-dev] Summary: SIP, NAT, security concerns, oh my!

OK, in order to bring this to a close (after the thread died a bit while
many of us were at AstriCon and our post-AstriCon recovery locations),
this is the current proposal on the table:

* Change the default for the sip.conf 'nat' configuration option to
'force_rport' in versions of Asterisk that offer that value, and to
'yes' in versions that do not.

* Add a strongly-worded warning in the sample sip.conf file (and on the
wiki, and anywhere else that seems appropriate) about changing the 'nat'
setting for a specific user/peer/friend to any value other than the one
in the [general] section (or the default, if no value has been set in
the [general] section). For some combinations of 'nat' settings, the
user/peer/friend so configured could become discoverable through the
method documented in this thread.

* For Asterisk trunk (and possibly Asterisk 10), consider sending
failure responses to *both* the port the request was received from *and*
the port listed in the top-most Via header. This would only be done for
non-authenticated requests, e.g. any request that cannot be definitively
associated with a user/peer/friend (through actual authentication, or IP
address/port matching, or any other valid mechanism). A configuration
option (valid only at the [general] level) would be provided to disable
this behavior if necessary.

The first two changes would be made to the release branches for Asterisk
1.4, 1.6.2, and 1.8, with a suitable security advisory published (and
new releases made from those branches). These same changes would be made
to the release branch for Asterisk 10 and trunk, along with
investigating whether a patch to implement the dual-response mechanism
would be feasible in a short time frame (less than two weeks). Based on
the result of that process, a decision can be made whether it would be
merged at all, and into the Asterisk 10 branch, or just trunk (depending
on its risk of causing regressions).

If I've incorrectly represented the consensus here please speak up; I'd
like to get moving on making these changes in the next few days so we
can put this behind us. Thanks for all your input on this subject, it
has been very valuable!

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: CVE Request -- Asterisk -- AST-2011-013 and AST-2011-014

Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,

   the following two security flaws have been recently fixed:
   <http://www.asterisk.org/node/51693>

in Asterisk:

1) AST-2011-013 Possible to enumerate SIP usernames when general and user/peer NAT settings differed

    An information disclosure flaw was found in the way Asterisk handled UDP
    requests in configurations using network address translation (NAT) for the SIP
    protocol. When the general configuration file section and user / peer
    configuration file section NAT settings differed, it was possible to enumerate
    SIP usernames if the request was sent to different port as that, specified in
    the Via header.

    [4] <https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=394095>
    [5] <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=765773>

    Upstream bug report:
    [6] <https://issues.asterisk.org/jira/browse/ASTERISK-18862>

    Upstream review board request:
    [7] <https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/1591/>

    Upstream patch (for 1.8 branch):
    [8] <http://svnview.digium.com/svn/asterisk?view=revision&sortby=date&revision=345828>

2) AST-2011-014 NULL pointer dereference (crash) when processing INFO automon message
    with no channel

    A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way Asterisk handled INFO
    requests, when the 'automon' feature was enabled. If no channel had been
    created yet, a remote attacker could use this flaw to cause a denial of service

Asterisk
Project Security Advisory - AST-2011-013

| **Product** | Asterisk |
| **Summary** | Possible remote enumeration of SIP endpoints with differing NAT settings |
| **Nature of Advisory** | Unauthorized data disclosure |
| **Susceptibility** | Remote unauthenticated sessions |
| **Severity** | Minor |
| **Exploits Known** | Yes |
| **Reported On** | 2011-07-18 |
| **Reported By** | Ben Williams |
| **Posted On** |  |
| **Last Updated On** | December 8, 2011 |
| **Advisory Contact** | Terry Wilson <twilson@digium.com> |
| **CVE Name** |  |

| **Description** | It is possible to enumerate SIP usernames when the general and user/peer NAT settings differ in whether to respond to the port a request is sent from or the port listed for responses in the Via header. In 1.4 and 1.6.2, this would mean if one setting was nat=yes or nat=route and the other was either nat=no or nat=never. In 1.8 and 10, this would mean when one was nat=force\_rport or nat=yes and the other was nat=no or nat=comedia. |

| **Resolution** | Handling NAT for SIP over UDP requires the differing behavior introduced by these options.    To lessen the frequency of unintended username disclosure, the default NAT setting was changed to always respond to the port from which we received the requestâthe most commonly used option.    Warnings were added on startup to inform administrators of the risks of having a SIP peer configured with a different setting than that of the general setting. The documentation now strongly suggests that peers are no longer configured for NAT individually, but through the global setting in the âgeneralâ context.    For a discussion of the reasons behind this change and why no general fix is provided, please see the mailing list discussion referenced in the âLinksâ section below. |

| **Affected Versions** | | |
| **Product** | **Release Series** |  |
| Asterisk Open Source | All | All versions |

| **Corrected In** |
| As this is more of an issue with SIP over UDP in general, there is no fix supplied other than documentation on how to avoid the problem. The default NAT setting has been changed to what we believe the most commonly used setting for the respective version in Asterisk 1.4.43, 1.6.2.21, and 1.8.7.2. |

CVE ID         : CVE-2011-4597 CVE-2011-4598
Debian Bug     :

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Asterisk, an Open
Source PBX and telephony toolkit:

CVE-2011-4597

   Ben Williams discovered that it was possible to enumerate SIP
   user names in some configurations. Please see the upstream
   advisory for details:
   <http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/security/AST-2011-013.html>

   This update only modifies the sample sip.conf configuration
   file. Please see README.Debian for more information on how
   to update your installation.

CVE-2011-4598

   Kristijan Vrban discovered that Asterisk can be crashed with
   malformed SIP packets if the "automon" feature is enabled.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:1.4.21.2~dfsg-3+lenny6.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:1.6.2.9-2+squeeze4.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:1.8.8.0~dfsg-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your asterisk packages.
