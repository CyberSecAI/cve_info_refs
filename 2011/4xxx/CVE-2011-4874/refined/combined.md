# PROMOTIC system news

**Main PROMOTIC versions overview**

The following description provides informations regarding the main PROMOTIC versions. There are some warning concerning the upgrades from lower to upper versions of the system, for example when some obsolete functions of the PROMOTIC system are no longer present in newer versions, or some operating system support has been remowed, etc.

Upgrades from older PROMOTIC version to newer version are free of charge during the period of 10 years since the licence has been created. For additional info see [PmUpgrade](PriceList/PriceList.htm#PriceList_PmUpgrade) and [PmUpgrade10](PriceList/PriceList.htm#PriceList_PmUpgrade10).

## Version: PROMOTIC 9

| News | State | Date | Download |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **[PROMOTIC 9.0](NewsPm900.htm)** | stable version | 7.1.2025 | [PROMOTIC9.0.31](https://www.promotic.eu/en/promotic/download/Pm0900.htm) |

- This version has been released in: **2018**
- This version is designed for: Windows OS 11/10/8/7/2008-22Server
- The following is no longer supported: Windows OS XP/Vista/2003Server
- An upgrade (i.e. transition from older to newer version) to this version can be done only from the PROMOTIC 7.5 version.

If the upgrade is needed to be done from older version, then it is necessary to go through the PROMOTIC 7.5 first.
- Main news and modifications:
- The development environment and runtime were separated into two individual programs.
- The application editor and the Panel editor were unified in the development environment. The graphics of the [PmaPanel](Objects/Pma/PmaPanel/PmaPanel.htm) object can now be edited directly without the need to open another editor.
- The viewers of alarms/events are now available as graphic objects [PmgAlarmStateViewer](Objects/Pmg/PmgAlarmStateViewer/PmgAlarmStateViewer.htm) / [PmgAlarmHistoryViewer](Objects/Pmg/PmgAlarmHistoryViewer/PmgAlarmHistoryViewer.htm) / [PmgEventViewer](Objects/Pmg/PmgEventViewer/PmgEventViewer.htm). It is now possible to completely adapt these viewers to application designer needs.
- The [JavaScript](ScriptLangs/JavaScript/JavaScript.htm) language can now be used also in [in the Pma objects editor](DtEnv/DtEnv.htm#Ch_PmaEdit). It is now possible to create applications while using only a single language. The [VBScript](ScriptLangs/VBScript/VBScript.htm) language is no longer needed.
- In order to increase the clarity of the system the application objects and graphic objects were renamed - now each object type has clear prefix:
- Each application object has Pma prefix (for example the PmData object was renamed to [PmaData](Objects/Pma/PmaData/PmaData.htm))
- Each graphic object has Pmg prefix (for example the PmiBar object was renamed to [PmgBar](Objects/Pmg/PmgBar/PmgBar.htm))
- See [Transition from older versions to PROMOTIC 9](Pm9Conv.htm).

- The following is no longer supported: Windows OS 98/Me/2000
- An upgrade (i.e. transition from older to newer version) to this version can be done only from the PROMOTIC 7.5 version.

If the upgrade is needed to be done from older version, then it is necessary to go through the PROMOTIC 7.5 first.
## Version: PROMOTIC 7

| News | State | Date | Download |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **[PROMOTIC 7](Pm7Conv.htm)** | stable version | 28.06.2012 | [PROMOTIC7.5.7](https://www.promotic.eu/en/promotic/download/Pm0705.htm) |

- This version has been released in: **2006**
- This version is designed for: Windows OS 11/10/8/7/Vista/XP/[Embedded](Directions/WinEmbed.htm)/2003-12Server/98/Me
- The following is no longer supported: Windows OS 95/NT
- This version is available in two variations: for [Unicode](Subsystems/Languages/Unicode.htm) and ANSII. The ANSII variation is meaningful only for Windows OS 98/Me.
- During the installation this version to Windows OS 2000 and higher system, [Hardware (USB) licence key](PriceList/LicMedia/HwKey.htm) driver installation failure may occur. The fixing procedure is described in [Known problems during the installation of the HW Key driver](PriceList/LicMedia/HwKey.htm#ProblemHWkey).
- This version uses the ne Microsoft graphic library (GdiPlus), that displays the texts a little bit wider. After upgrading from older PROMOTIC version it is possible that the size of some texts in graphic panels will be slightly different than before.

The PROMOTIC version 7.5 (no matter if 7.5.0 or higher) is very important because all currently running PROMOTIC applications (if the upgrade to the PROMOTIC 8 version is wanted) **will have to go through this version first**. The PROMOTIC version 8 is able to work only with applications, that went through the version PROMOTIC 7.5. The main reason is, that PROMOTIC version 8 no longer contains algorithms for conversion very old applications.

The PROMOTIC version 8 no longer supports some very old (not offered for a very long time) technologies. Therefore in this version 7.5, there is a new item "[Warnings](Subsystems/Info/InfoSystem.htm#Item_Warnings)" in the INFO system, that is displaying warnings regarding the usage of obsolete components in current application.

One additional item that is no longer available since version PROMOTIC 8 is the **"MDI type main window"**. The main reason for that is the fact, that using the [PmaWorkspace](Objects/Pma/PmaWorkspace/PmaWorkspace.htm) object as a main window is positively much simpler, more general and practical than the "MDI window".

If the application is using the "MDI" (all applications older than PROMOTIC 7), then this fact will also be highlighted in the "[Warnings](Subsystems/Info/InfoSystem.htm#Item_Warnings)" item of the [INFO system](Subsystems/Info/InfoSystem.htm) and the designer can simply transform his application in order to use the main window of the [PmaWorkspace](Objects/Pma/PmaWorkspace/PmaWorkspace.htm) type.

Because the PROMOTIC version 8 no longer supports the obsolete saving formats, it is necessary for those who use [Compound Pmg objects](DtEnv/PmgEditor/CompObject.htm) (these objects are saved in independent files with the \*.pmi extension), to transform these objects into version PROMOTIC 7.5.
## Version: PROMOTIC 6
