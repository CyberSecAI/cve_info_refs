Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2011-4918:

**Verification:**
The provided content directly mentions CVE-2011-4918 and discusses the merging of two XSS vulnerabilities in Elxis CMS under this CVE ID. This aligns with the CVE description, which indicates a placeholder for CVE description retrieval, suggesting the need for further details which are found in the content.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The root cause of these vulnerabilities is the insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input before it is returned to the user. Specifically, the "task" parameter in `index.php` and input passed via the URL to `administrator/index.php` are not properly sanitized.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The identified vulnerabilities are Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session within the context of the affected website. This could lead to various malicious activities such as session hijacking, defacement, and phishing.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The first XSS vulnerability is triggered via the `task` parameter in `index.php` when `option` is set to `com_content`.
    *   The second XSS vulnerability is triggered via URL input to `administrator/index.php`.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to craft malicious input and inject it through the specified parameters (`task` or the URL) to trigger the XSS vulnerability. No authentication is mentioned, implying that the vulnerability can be triggered by both authenticated and unauthenticated users.

**Additional Information:**
The provided content indicates that these two XSS issues were merged into a single CVE (CVE-2011-4918). They affect the same product, versions, and have similar impact. The fix for the issues was implemented in Elxis CMS version "2009.3 Aphrodite rev2684".
The content also mentions that Secunia has an advisory for this vulnerability.
