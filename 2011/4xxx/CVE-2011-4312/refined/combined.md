Fix a comment vulnerability allowing scripts to be loaded.

```
Due to the way that comments were loaded in, it was possible to
terminate a script and inject a new one while loading the diff viewer.
This isn't believed to have been a problem in the wild, but is certainly
an important one to fix.

We now ensure that the text is escaped at the point where it's being fed
into the JavaScript. It's no longer possible to inject scripts.

Thanks to Damian Johnson for the heads up and for the fix that this
change is based on.

This will be going into 1.5.7 and 1.6.3 releases.

Subject: CVE Request -- ReviewBoard v1.5.7 && v1.6.3 -- XSS in the commenting
 system (diff viewer and screenshot pages components)

Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,

   a cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the way the commenting
system of the ReviewBoard, a web-based code review tool, sanitized user
input (new comments to be loaded). A remote attacker could provide a
specially-crafted URL, which once visited by valid ReviewBoard user
could lead to arbitrary HTML or web script execution in the 'diff
viewer' or 'screenshot pages' components.

Relevant upstream patch:
[4]
<https://github.com/reviewboard/reviewboard/commit/7a0a9d94555502278534dedcf2d75e9fccce8c3d>

Could you allocate a CVE id for this?

Thank you && Regards, Jan.

P.S.: Cc-ed Christian Hammond, who committed change [4] to the
       upstream Git repository too, so they could update CVE id
       in their advisory, if / where needed.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and

These files are also
