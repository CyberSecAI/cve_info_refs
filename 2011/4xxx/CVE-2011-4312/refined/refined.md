Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-4312:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from inadequate sanitization of user-supplied input within the commenting system of ReviewBoard. Specifically, the text of comments was not properly escaped before being used in JavaScript code, which allowed for the injection of arbitrary HTML or web scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core issue is an XSS vulnerability. The application failed to neutralize or sanitize user-provided data before incorporating it into dynamically generated web pages. This allowed attackers to inject malicious scripts.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper escaping or sanitization of comment text, particularly within the context of its usage in JavaScript within the "diff viewer" and "screenshot pages" components.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary HTML/JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation allowed an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary HTML and JavaScript within the ReviewBoard application as viewed by other users.
- **Page Manipulation:** An attacker could modify the appearance and behavior of the affected web pages, potentially redirecting users to other sites, altering content, or capturing sensitive information.
- **Session Hijacking:** With JavaScript execution, attackers could potentially steal session cookies or other sensitive information, leading to session hijacking or account compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Specially Crafted URLs:** The attack vector involves crafting URLs that contain malicious code within the comment data. These crafted URLs could be delivered to users via various methods, such as phishing, or by posting comments containing malicious code that is not properly sanitized.
- **Comment Injection:** Attackers could inject malicious scripts by posting them as a comment in the review board interface, targeting the 'diff viewer' or 'screenshot pages' components.
- **Remote Attack:**  The attacker is considered remote as they do not need local system access or to be on the same network segment as the target.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote User:** The attacker does not need physical access or any special privileges within the ReviewBoard system. They can perform the attack remotely.
- **Knowledge of ReviewBoard:**  The attacker needs to know how to craft malicious comment content that would be rendered in the diff viewer or screenshot pages without being properly sanitized.
- **Ability to inject comment:** The attacker needs to be able to post a comment, either directly or via some other means that could result in a comment being added to the system.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was present in ReviewBoard versions 1.5.7 and 1.6.3.
- The vulnerability was fixed by properly escaping the text at the point where it's being fed into the JavaScript. This prevented further script injection.
- The fix was introduced via the commit `7a0a9d94555502278534dedcf2d75e9fccce8c3d` on GitHub, which changed the way that comments are loaded in to the diff viewer and screenshot pages.
- The issue was reported by Damian Johnson.

In summary, CVE-2011-4312 describes an XSS vulnerability in ReviewBoard arising from the lack of sanitization of user-provided comment text, which could be exploited by a remote attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript within the context of other ReviewBoard users.
