Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-4083:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `sosreport` utility, part of the `sos` package, incorrectly included Certificate-based Red Hat Network (RHN) private entitlement keys in the debugging information archive it generated.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the inclusion of sensitive private keys within the sosreport archive.
- **Insecure Data Handling:** The tool was not properly filtering out private keys when collecting system information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker gaining access to the sosreport archive could extract the private entitlement keys. These keys could then be used to:
- Access Red Hat Network content (e.g., software updates, packages) that should only be accessible to the legitimate owner of the system.
- Potentially perform other unauthorized actions on the Red Hat Network, depending on the privileges associated with the compromised keys.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Archive Access:** An attacker needs access to the `sosreport` archive which could be achieved through various means including:
    - Compromising the system where the `sosreport` was generated.
    - Intercepting the archive if it was transmitted over a network without sufficient protection.
    - Gaining unauthorized access to a location where the archive is stored.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to the sosreport archive:** The attacker must obtain the archive generated by the `sosreport` utility.
- **No direct system access is required** to exploit the vulnerability once the archive has been obtained.
- **Understanding of RHN entitlements:** The attacker would need some knowledge of how Red Hat Network entitlements work to leverage the stolen keys.

**Additional details from the content:**

- **Affected Products:** Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 were affected.
- **Mitigation:** The vulnerability was fixed by updating the `sos` package to prevent the inclusion of private keys in the `sosreport` output.
- **Severity:** The vulnerability was rated as having a "low" security impact by Red Hat. This is due to the fact that exploitation requires access to the sosreport, and that the attacker can not directly impact the system where the report was generated.
- **CVSS score:**  A CVSS base score is mentioned to be available on the CVE link, but not explicitly provided in this content.
- **Fix Details:** Patches were applied to the `sos` package to prevent the inclusion of the private keys.  In the resolution for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5,  the cluster module was also modified to catch parser exceptions internally and alert the user to problems when malformed XML is present.
- **Red Hat Network Classic:**  Users of Red Hat Network Classic were not affected by this issue.
