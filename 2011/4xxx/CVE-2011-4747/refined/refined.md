{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The web application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before including it in the HTML output.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application is susceptible to reflected XSS attacks, where malicious scripts are injected via user input and executed in the victim's browser.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious scripts (JavaScript, VBScript, ActiveX, HTML, or Flash) into the web application. This can be used to steal session cookies, impersonate the victim, modify displayed content, or perform other malicious activities within the user's context.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through a POST request to `/plesk-billing/admin/index.php/default` where the `message_id` parameter is vulnerable.  Also, the `sso_api_path` parameter is vulnerable in the GET requests.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker requires the ability to inject malicious input, this could be done via a crafted URL, or through some other form of user interaction. They do not need to be logged in, although this was a report for logged in users. "
