| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=811937#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-04-12 11:11:47 UTC  ``` It was found that when starting to use the Python Django web framework, the web interface of Cobbler, a network install server, failed to apply the Django built-in CSRF protection. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted web page, which once visited by an unsuspecting, valid Cobbler web interface user would potentially lead to unauthorized actions execution in the context of authenticated Cobbler user (the victim).  References: [1] [https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/oneiric/+source/cobbler/+bug/858878](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/oneiric/%2Bsource/cobbler/%2Bbug/858878)  CVE Request: [2] <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2012/04/12/6>  Ubuntu patch by Robie Basak: [3] <http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~racb/ubuntu/oneiric/cobbler/858878_858883/revision/53>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=811937#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-04-12 11:14:34 UTC  ``` This issue affects the versions of the cobbler package, as shipped with Fedora EPEL 5 and Fedora EPEL 6. Please schedule an update.  As of right now, this issue did NOT affect the current versions of the cobbler package, as shipped with Fedora release of 15 and 16 (the cobbler-2.0.11-3.* versions). But since there are cobbler-2.2.2-1.fc* versions scheduled to get next stable versions and these are affected too, please schedule Fedora release 15 and 16 cobbler package versions updates too.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=811937#c4)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-04-12 11:29:01 UTC  ``` Created cobbler tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 811942](show_bug.cgi?id=811942 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - cobbler various flaws [fedora-all]")] Affects: epel-all [[bug 811943](show_bug.cgi?id=811943 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - cobbler various flaws [epel-all]")]   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=811937#c6)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-04-12 11:33:18 UTC  ``` This issue did NOT affect the versions of the cobbler package, as shipped with Red Hat Network Satellite Server version 5.4.1 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6, since they did NOT include support for Cobbler web interface.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=811937#c7)  Kurt Seifried    2012-04-12 16:13:40 UTC  ``` Added CVE as per <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2012/04/12/10>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=811937#c8)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-06-20 14:34:55 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect the version of cobbler as shipped with Red Hat Network Satellite Server 5.4 as Red Hat Network Satellite Server did not include support for Cobbler web interface.   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=811937#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-04-12 11:11:47 UTC  ``` It was found that when starting to use the Python Django web framework, the web interface of Cobbler, a network install server, failed to apply the Django built-in CSRF protection. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted web page, which once visited by an unsuspecting, valid Cobbler web interface user would potentially lead to unauthorized actions execution in the context of authenticated Cobbler user (the victim).

Please schedule an update.  As of right now, this issue did NOT affect the current versions of the cobbler package, as shipped with Fedora release of 15 and 16 (the cobbler-2.0.11-3.* versions). But since there are cobbler-2.2.2-1.fc* versions scheduled to get next stable versions and these are affected too, please schedule Fedora release 15 and 16 cobbler package versions updates too.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=811937#c4)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-04-12 11:29:01 UTC  ``` Created cobbler tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 811942](show_bug.cgi?id=811942 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - cobbler various flaws [fedora-all]")] Affects: epel-all [[bug 811943](show_bug.cgi?id=811943 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - cobbler various flaws [epel-all]")]   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=811937#c6)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-04-12 11:33:18 UTC  ``` This issue did NOT affect the versions of the cobbler package, as shipped with Red Hat Network Satellite Server version 5.4.1 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6, since they did NOT include support for Cobbler web interface.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=811937#c7)  Kurt Seifried    2012-04-12 16:13:40 UTC  ``` Added CVE as per <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2012/04/12/10>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=811937#c8)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-06-20 14:34:55 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect the version of cobbler as shipped with Red Hat Network Satellite Server 5.4 as Red Hat Network Satellite Server did not include support for Cobbler web interface.   ``` |  |

### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.
