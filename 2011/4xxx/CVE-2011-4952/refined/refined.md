{
  "CVE-2011-4952": {
    "Description": "The web interface of Cobbler, a network install server, lacks CSRF protection when using the Django web framework. A remote attacker could provide a specially crafted web page that, when visited by a valid Cobbler user, could lead to the execution of unauthorized actions in the context of the authenticated user.",
    "Root cause": "The Cobbler web interface, when using the Django framework, fails to implement Django's built-in CSRF protection.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Missing CSRF protection"
    ],
    "Impact": "A successful exploit could allow a remote attacker to perform unauthorized actions on the Cobbler server by leveraging the authenticated user's session.",
    "Attack vector": "The vulnerability is exploitable through a network attack.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious web page and lure a valid Cobbler user into visiting it. No specific authentication is required, but the attack relies on an active and authenticated user session with Cobbler"
