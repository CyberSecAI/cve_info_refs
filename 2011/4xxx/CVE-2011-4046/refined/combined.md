## Dell KACE K2000 Appliance contains backdoor administrator account

#### Vulnerability Note VU#135606

Original Release Date: 2011-11-08 | Last Revised: 2015-09-30

---

### Overview

The Dell KACE K2000 System Deployment Appliance contains a hidden administrator account that could allow a remote attacker to take control of an affected device.

### Description

| The Dell KACE K2000 Deployment Appliance is an integrated systems provisioning product for large-scale operating systems deployment. Some versions of the product contain a backdoor administrator account with a fixed password, accessible via the administrative web interface of the device. Furthermore, the backdoor account is not visible from, and cannot be removed via the appliance's administrative web interface. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker could login to an affected device with administrative privileges. Secondary impacts include: the ability to make configuration changes, modification of existing deployment/recovery images, access to sensitive information, and the ability to mount further attacks (e.g., execute arbitrary commands with elevated privileges). |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**  The Dell KACE K2000 Deployment Appliance version 3.7 removed this hidden administrator account. Affected users are encouraged to update as soon as possible to version 3.7 or later. |
