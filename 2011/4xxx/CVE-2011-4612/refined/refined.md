Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2011-4612:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Newline injection in the `error.log` file of Icecast2.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject newline characters into the Icecast2 error log.

**Impact of exploitation:** By injecting newline characters, an attacker can manipulate the log file, potentially causing issues like:
    *   Log file corruption or misinterpretation
    *   Log injection
    *   Hiding malicious activities
    *   Making log analysis difficult

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves injecting a malicious string containing newline characters into the input that Icecast2 logs into the error.log.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
   *   The attacker needs to be able to send data to the Icecast server, which the server then logs into the error log.
   *   The attacker does not need to be authenticated, but may require knowledge of specific input fields or parameters that are logged.

**Additional Details:**
   *   The vulnerability was fixed in Icecast version 2.3.3.
   *   The issue was tracked in Red Hat Bugzilla as bug 768176.
   *   This was a public security issue.
   *   Updates for Fedora 17, 18, EPEL 5, and EPEL 6 were released to address this vulnerability.
