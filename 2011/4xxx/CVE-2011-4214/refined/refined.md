{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application is vulnerable to authentication bypass and SQL injection due to insufficient input validation and improper handling of cookies.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Authentication bypass: The application allows an attacker to generate a session cookie ('oozimsrememberme') and log in as an administrator without providing a password.",
       "SQL injection: The application directly uses a cookie value in a SQL query without filtering, making it vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. Specifically, the `cookieName` variable from the `$_COOKIE` array is directly included in the SQL query on line 136 of `lib\\ooz_access.php`."
    ],
    "impact": "An unauthenticated remote attacker can bypass authentication and gain administrative access or leak database information.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The authentication bypass is achieved by crafting a specific session cookie.",
       "The SQL injection vulnerability is exploited by injecting malicious SQL code via the `oozimsrememberme` cookie."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests containing malicious cookie values to the vulnerable application."
