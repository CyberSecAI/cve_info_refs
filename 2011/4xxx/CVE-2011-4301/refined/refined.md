{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Moodle Forms API did not properly protect constant form values from being modified by users upon form submission.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Input Validation",
       "Insecure Handling of Constants"
    ],
    "impact": "Users can alter form values that are intended to be constant, potentially leading to unexpected behavior, data corruption, or privilege escalation if these constant values are used for security checks or access control.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker modifies form data before submitting the form, overriding the constant values.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a user who has the ability to submit the affected form."
