Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-4203:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of sanitization of the `$url` variable within the `redirect()` function before it's used in the `header()` function. Specifically, the code `@header('Location: '.$url);` is vulnerable because the `$url` variable is not checked for malicious input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CRLF Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a CRLF (carriage return line feed) injection, also known as HTTP Response Splitting. This occurs because an attacker can inject CRLF sequences (`\r\n`) into the `$url` variable. Since the `header()` function uses this unsanitized variable, the injected CRLF sequences are interpreted as new HTTP headers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Header Injection:** Attackers can inject arbitrary HTTP headers, controlling the way the web application functions.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** By injecting malicious scripts using manipulated headers, attackers can perform XSS attacks.
- **Cross-User Defacement:** Attackers can alter the appearance of web pages for other users.
- **Web Page Hijacking:**  Attackers can redirect users to malicious websites or substitute content.
- **Web Cache Poisoning:** By controlling the response headers, attackers can manipulate client-side web caches.

**Attack Vectors:**
- By manipulating the `$url` parameter passed to the `redirect()` function, an attacker can inject CRLF sequences. This vector is present in `/calendar/set.php` and other parts of the Moodle system that use the vulnerable `redirect()` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control the `$url` parameter passed to the redirect function, implying that the attacker could be any user who can influence the redirect URL or perform a request that calls the vulnerable redirect function.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Moodle versions 1.9.14, 2.0.5, 2.1.2, and 2.2.
- It was fixed in versions 1.9.15, 2.0.6, and 2.1.3.
- The issue was assigned the Moodle issue number MDL-24808.
