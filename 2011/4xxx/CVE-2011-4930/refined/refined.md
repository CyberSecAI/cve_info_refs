  "cveId": "CVE-2011-4930",
  "description": "Multiple format string flaws were found in Condor: a) when the XML message log format was requested in Condor submit job by remote Condor user and that user attempted to write a specially-crafted message into user log file via condor_hold tool it could lead to condor_schedd daemon crash, or, potentially arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the 'condor' user [*]. Also this way an attacker could potentially prevent other Condor jobs from being scheduled and ever executed, b) request for file transfer by remote Condor user to transmit a file, with specially-crafted name, could lead to child process of condor_schedd daemon to crash (repeated process, where condor_schedd daemon would fork a child process to handle the request, the child to crash, while trying to handle it and condor_schedd daemon to fork another child since the particular Condor job still have not been completed successfully).",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "Improperly coded printf statements that allow user-controlled format strings.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Format String Vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service due to condor_schedd crashes. In vulnerable configurations, arbitrary code execution with condor user privileges may be possible.",
    "attackVectors": [
        "Submitting a Condor job with XML user log enabled",
        "Using condor_hold to place a job on hold and specifying a hold reason with format string specifiers",
        "File transfer requests using specially crafted file names"
    ],
      "requiredCapabilities": "The attacker must be able to submit jobs to the Condor system and be able to use the condor_hold tool."
