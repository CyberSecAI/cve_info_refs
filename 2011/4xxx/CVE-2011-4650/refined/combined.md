This is considered expected behavior when configured for remote authentication.If the remote authentication server does not contain credentials that match the local credentials, a failure message will be displayed. This indicates that the remote authentication server does not contain a username and password combination that matches the local username and password combination and that this username and password combination are only configured locally.If the locally configured credentials cannot be authenticated via the remote authentication server, exit the SAN Client and attempt to login with the locally configured credentials that returned the 'failure' message in the 'Test AAA' window. The login will succeed even though the Client is configured for remote authentication, the account that is logging in is only configured locally, and the remote authentication server is available.**Conditions:**DCNM SAN Client with 'Remote AAA Properties' tab configured for remote authentication.Remote authentication server is available.Local account credentials are different from the remote authentication credentials.Local account credentials fail LDAP authentication.Remote account credentials successfully complete LDAP authentication.**Workaround:**If the customer does not desire to fallback to local when the remote authentication server is unavailable, once a user has been configured for remote authentication, remove the local account.If the customer desires to fallback to local authentication, there is no workaround.**Further Problem Description:** | | | **Last Modified:** | 28-AUG-2015 | | | **Known Affected Releases:** | 7.1(2)ZD(0.1) | | | **Known Fixed Releases:** |  | | | |  |  | |  |  | || **Alert Type:** | **Updated \*** | | --- | --- |  **Bug Id:** | [CSCur96084](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCur96084?emailclick=CNSemail) | | **Title:** | N5K-56XX devices are not listed in config template | | | **Status:** | Fixed | | | **Severity:** | 3 Moderate | | **Description:** | **Symptom:**When the templates supported platform is N5600, no N56\*\* device types are listed for config delivery**Conditions:**N56\*\* device types are discovered and managed**Workaround:**Add N5500 to the templates supported platform and save the template.

Delete the "lanstartup.log" and "sanstartup.log" files under "%INSTALL\_DIR\dcm\jboss-as-7.2.0.Final\standalone\log" (you can take a copy as backup beforehand, if needed). alternatively you can delete or rename the "%INSTALL\_DIR\dcm\jboss-as-7.2.0.Final\standalone\log" directory and recreate it.3.
