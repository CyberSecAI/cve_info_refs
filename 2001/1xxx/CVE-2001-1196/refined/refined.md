Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the security issue:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `edit_action.cgi` script within the Webmin's Bootup and Shutdown module. Specifically, the script uses a user-supplied parameter, which represents a filename to be opened, without validating that the filename doesn't contain directory traversal sequences such as `../`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Directory Traversal:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to manipulate the `file` parameter in the `edit_action.cgi` script, using sequences like `../` to access and potentially read files outside of the intended directory.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The script does not sanitize or validate the filename, allowing the directory traversal to occur.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Reading:** An attacker could read any file on the server that the web server's user has access to. In the example provided, an attacker could read `/etc/shadow`, which contains the hashed passwords for system users. This could lead to complete system compromise.
- **Potential for File Modification:** While the provided content focuses on reading, the context of "saving file on server" implies that this vulnerability could potentially be leveraged to overwrite or modify files as well.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request Manipulation:** The attack is performed by sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `edit_action.cgi` script, with the `file` parameter set to a path containing directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../../../../../etc/shadow`).
- **Web-based Interface:** The vulnerability is exploitable via a web browser through the Webmin interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to Webmin Interface:** The attacker needs to have access to the Webmin interface and be able to access the Bootup and Shutdown module.
- **Knowledge of the vulnerable module and parameter.**
- **User Privilege:** While the attacker does not need to be root, the attacker needs sufficient privileges to access the Webmin module that contains the vulnerable `edit_action.cgi` script.
