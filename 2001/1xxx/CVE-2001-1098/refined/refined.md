- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Cisco PIX Firewall Manager (PFM) stores the enable password for Cisco Pix Firewalls in plaintext on the Windows NT workstation where the PFM software is running. This password is also stored in a location accessible to all users on the workstation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  - Storing sensitive credentials (enable password) in plaintext.
  - Storing the password in a location accessible to all users on the workstation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker who gains access to a local user account on the workstation running PFM can retrieve the plaintext enable password and gain administrative access to the Cisco Pix Firewall. Once they have administrative access, they can perform any action a legitimate administrator could.
- **Attack vectors:**
  - Local access to the workstation running Cisco PIX Firewall Manager.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
  - The attacker needs to have access to a local user account on the workstation where the PFM software resides. This could be through compromising an existing account or another form of local access.
