I.
    A. Background
       Hewlett-Packard Company has become aware of a defect in the
       text editor, in various releases of the HP-UX OS.  This defect
       affects various programs such as e, ex, vi, edit, view, and
       vedit which all use the same facilities.

    B. Fixing the problem
       The problem can be fully resolved by applying the appropriate
       patches to the system. For HP-UX releases
                 for 11.00:           PHCO\_22229,
                     11.04:           PHCO\_23354,
                     10.20:           PHCO\_22228,
                     10.24:           PHCO\_23353,
                     10.10:           PHCO\_22848,
                     10.01:           PHCO\_22849.

       While this patch does not require a reboot, appropriately
       terminating any instances of editor before installation of the
       patch will assure that continued operation is now done with
       the patched binaries.
