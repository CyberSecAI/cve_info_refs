The provided content is related to a vulnerability in Check Point VPN-1/FireWall-1 running on Nokia IPXXX appliances.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the firewall appliance retransmitting the third packet of a TCP three-way handshake with the original, untranslated destination IP address, after having initially sent a correctly translated packet to the local subnet. This only occurs when SYN Defender is configured in Active Gateway mode.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The firewall incorrectly retransmits packets with the external IP address, bypassing Network Address Translation (NAT) in certain circumstances.
- This issue specifically occurs with the third packet of the TCP handshake when SYN Defender is in Active Gateway mode.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can send traffic through the firewall with the original, external destination IP address preserved. This bypasses the NAT functionality.
- While standard IP spoofing protection still applies, an attacker could potentially leverage this issue to reach internal hosts using the external IP address, but not directly address them behind the firewall.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves sending a TCP connection request to a host behind the firewall, taking advantage of the retransmission of the third packet of the TCP handshake with the original destination IP address.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send traffic to the firewall.
- The attacker would not be able to directly address hosts behind the firewall.
- The firewall must have SYN Defender enabled in Active Gateway mode.
- The internal appliance interface and the destination host must be in the same collision domain.
