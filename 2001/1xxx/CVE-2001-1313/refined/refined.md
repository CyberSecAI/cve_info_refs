  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2001-1313",
    "description": "The Lotus Domino R5 Server Family contains multiple vulnerabilities in the code that processes LDAP requests. In the encoding section of the test suite, this product failed 1 of 77 groups. The failed group tests a server's response to miscellaneous packets with semi-valid BER encodings. In the application section of the test suite, this product failed 23 of 77 groups. These results suggest that both buffer overflow and format string vulnerabilities are likely to be present in a variety of application components.",
    "root_cause": "Multiple vulnerabilities in the code that processes LDAP requests, specifically in handling semi-valid BER encodings and various application components.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer overflow vulnerabilities",
      "Format string vulnerabilities"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Domino server, potentially gaining system privileges. Denial of service is also possible.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending specially crafted LDAP requests with semi-valid BER encodings.",
      "Exploiting vulnerabilities in application components."
     ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send LDAP requests to the vulnerable server. No specific user interaction or authentication details are mentioned."
