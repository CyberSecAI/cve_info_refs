## Cisco IOS vulnerable to DoS via crafted PPTP packet sent to port 1723/tcp

#### Vulnerability Note VU#656315

Original Release Date: 2001-07-29 | Last Revised: 2004-02-23

---

### Overview

Cisco IOS contains a vulnerability that allows an intruder to crash the router.

### Description

| By sending a specially crafted [PPTP](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2637.txt?number=2637) packet to port 1723, an intruder can crash a device running a vulnerable version of IOS. Quoting from the Cisco Advisory:   *By sending a crafted PPTP packet to a port 1723, a control PPTP port, it is possible to crash the router. This vulnerability does not require special router configuration. Enabling PPTP is sufficient to expose the vulnerability. The router will crash after it receives a single packet.* For more information, see the [Cisco Advisory](http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/PPTP-vulnerability-pub.html). |
| --- |

### Impact

| An intruder can cause a vulnerable router to crash. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Upgrade to a later version of IOS as documented in the [Cisco Advisory](http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/PPTP-vulnerability-pub.html). |

             Cisco Security Advisory: Cisco IOS PPTP vulnerability

Revision 1.0

  For Public Release 2001 July 12 08:00 (UTC -0800)
     \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Summary

   Point to Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) allows users to tunnel to an
   Internet Protocol (IP) network using a Point to Point Protocol (PPP).
   The protocol is described in RFC2637.

   PPTP implementation using Cisco IOS® software releases contains a
   vulnerability that will crash a router if it receives a malformed or
   crafted PPTP packet. No special conditions or router configuration is
   required.

   This vulnerability is present in all Cisco IOS releases that support
   PPTP protocol. PPTP is supported in the following software releases:

     \* 12.1 train, releases: T, E, EZ, YA, YD and YC
     \* 12.2 train, all releases

   No other Cisco product is vulnerable.

   There is no workaround for this vulnerability.

   This advisory is available at
   <http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/PPTP-vulnerability-pub.html>

Affected Products

   This vulnerability is present in all Cisco IOS releases that are
   supporintg PPTP protocol. PPTP is supported in the following releases

     \* 11.x train does not supports PPTP
     \* 12.1 train, releases: T, E, EZ, YA, YD and YC
     \* 12.2 train, all releases

   To determine if a Cisco product is running an affected IOS, log in to
   the device and issue the command show version. Look for the
   "Internetwork Operating System Software" or "IOS (tm)" information,
   which also will have a version number. Other Cisco devices either will
   not have the command "show version" or will give different output.

Details

   By sending a crafted PPTP packet to a port 1723, a control PPTP port,
   it is possible to crash the router. This vulnerability does not
   require special router configuration. Enabling PPTP is sufficient to
   expose the vulnerability. The router will crash after it receives a
   single packet.

   This vulnerability is documented as Cisco Bug ID CSCdt46181

Impact

   By repeaditly exploiting this vulnerability it is possible to cause
   permanent Denial of Service (DoS). This denial is not only of the PPTP
   functionality but the whole router will stop functioning.

Software Versions and Fixes

   Each row of the table describes a release train and the platforms or
   products for which it is intended. If a given release train is
   vulnerable, then the earliest possible releases that contain the fix
   and the anticipated date of availability for each are listed in the
   "Rebuild", "Interim", and "Maintenance" columns. A device running a
   release in the given train that is earlier the release in a specific
   column (less than the earliest fixed release) is known to be
   vulnerable. The release should be upgraded at least to the indicated
   release or a later version (greater than the earliest fixed release
   label).

   When selecting a release, keep in mind the following definitions:

        Maintenance
                Most heavily tested and highly recommended release of any
                label in a given row of the table.

        Rebuild
                Constructed from the previous maintenance or major
                release in the same train, it contains the fix for a
                specific defect. Although it receives less testing, it
                contains only the minimal changes necessary to effect the
                repair.

        Interim
                Built at regular intervals between maintenance releases
                and receive less testing. Interims should be selected
                only if there is no other suitable release that addresses
                the vulnerability, and interim images should be upgraded
                to the next available maintenance release as soon as
                possible. Interim releases are not available via
                manufacturing, and usually they are not available for
                customer download from CCO without prior arrangement with
                the Cisco TAC.

   In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the
   devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current
   hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported
   properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact
   the Cisco TAC for assistance as shown in the following section.

   More information on IOS release names and abbreviations is available
   at <http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/620/1.html>.

Obtaining Fixed Software

   Cisco is offering free software upgrades to eliminate this
   vulnerability for all affected customers.

   Customers with contracts should obtain upgraded software through their
   regular update channels. For most customers, this means that upgrades
   should be obtained through the Software Center on Cisco's Worldwide
   Web site at <http://www.cisco.com>.

   Customers whose Cisco products are provided or maintained through
   prior or existing agreement with third-party support organizations
   such as Cisco Partners, authorized resellers, or service providers
   should contact that support organization for assistance with the
   upgrade, which should be free of charge.

   Customers who purchase direct from Cisco but who do not hold a Cisco
   service contract and customers who purchase through third party
   vendors but are unsuccessful at obtaining fixed software through their
   point of sale should get their upgrades by contacting the Cisco
   Technical Assistance Center (TAC). TAC contacts are as follows:

     \* +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free from within North America)
     \* +1 408 526 7209 (toll call from anywhere in the world)
     \* e-mail: tac@cisco.com

   Please have your product serial number available and give the URL
   of this notice as evidence of your entitlement to a free upgrade. Free
   upgrades for non-contract customers must be requested through the TAC.

   Please do not contact either "psirt@cisco.com" or
   "security-alert@cisco.com" for software upgrades.

Workarounds

   There is no workaround for this vulnerability.
