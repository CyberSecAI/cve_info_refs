- **Root cause of vulnerability:**
    - Faulty method used to generate RC4 keys. The server uses the first 16 bytes of the session key (SK) as an RC4 key (SK1) and the client uses the last 16 bytes (SK2). The server XORs its key (SK1) with the session ID (SID), while the client does not. This difference in key derivation, combined with the fact that session ID information is ignored when password authentication is used, allows for replay attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Insecure key derivation for RC4 encryption in SSH1.
    - The server's failure to validate session ID when using password authentication.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Attackers can replay a captured SSH1 session, potentially gaining unauthorized access or performing unintended actions within the valid timeframe of the server key.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - The attacker must eavesdrop on an SSH1 session where RC4 encryption and password authentication are used.
    - The attacker must then replay the recorded traffic within the valid timeframe of the server key (default one hour).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Ability to intercept network traffic between a client and server.
    - Ability to replay the captured traffic to the server.
    - The attacker needs to replay the session within the server key's validity period.
