The provided content describes a vulnerability in the remote administration client of RhinoSoft Serv-U.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The remote administration client for RhinoSoft Serv-U incorrectly handles S/KEY one-time password (OTP) authentication challenges. Instead of responding with the OTP, it sends the user's password in plaintext.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The administration client ignores the S/KEY OTP challenge sent by the server.
- The client sends the user's password in plaintext during the authentication process when OTP is configured.
- The client transmits the password without any encryption, making it vulnerable to eavesdropping.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A network attacker with a sniffer can intercept and obtain administrative user passwords transmitted in plaintext.
- Administrative users configured to use S/KEY OTP authentication cannot log in using the vulnerable client.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network sniffing: An attacker needs to be positioned on the network path between the client and the server to intercept the plaintext password.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to capture network traffic between the vulnerable client and the server.
- The attacker does not require any prior credentials.
- No other specific capabilities or conditions are mentioned in the provided text.
