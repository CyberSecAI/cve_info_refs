{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A design flaw in the SSH-1 protocol allows modification of a server's public host key without changing the derived session ID. The modified key is often much weaker than the original, so it is easily factored to create a corresponding private key. This new key pair can be used to negotiate multiple concurrent SSH connections with the same session ID.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The SSH-1 protocol's assumption that it's difficult to find a different public host key and/or cookie which yield the same session ID is broken. This allows for the creation of a modified, weak key pair that generates the same session ID.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Attackers can obtain victim user privileges on other hosts running an SSH-1 server. This is done through man-in-the-middle attacks where the attacker can impersonate the server.",
  "Attack vectors": "Man-in-the-middle attack by a malicious server that establishes two concurrent sessions with the same session ID.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept and manipulate the SSH connection and must be able to convince the client to accept the malicious server's host key.  They also need to modify the server's public key to create a weak key pair while maintaining the original session ID."
