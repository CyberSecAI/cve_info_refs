The provided content describes a vulnerability in Seagate Crystal Reports, where database credentials are exposed in cleartext within the HTML source when accessed via URLs or HTTP requests.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The product embeds database usernames and passwords directly into the HTML page as part of the URL when using technologies other than Active Server Pages (ASP).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cleartext storage of database passwords in HTML source.
- Exposure of credentials via URL parameters.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could gain unauthorized access to the back-end database by obtaining the username and password from the HTML source.
- This could allow an attacker to access, modify, or steal sensitive data.

**Attack vectors:**
-  Viewing HTML source of web pages using Seagate Crystal Reports.
-  Network eavesdropping if SSL is not used to secure HTML files in transit.
-  Accessing the Crystal Reports Design file for additional database design information.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker could be an internal user with network access to the database or web server.
- An external attacker who has gained access to the local network through other vulnerabilities.
- Ability to view HTML source code.
