<http://www.midwinter.com/~koreth/uncgi.html>.
## Introduction

This is uncgi,
a frontend for processing queries and forms from
the Web on UNIX systems. (It can also be run under Windows in some cases;
[see below.](#windows))
You can get it
[here](/ftp/pub/uncgi-1.11.tar.Z).

Without this program, if you wanted to process a form, you'd have to either
write or dig up routines to translate the values of the form's fields from
"URL encoding" to whatever your program required. This was a hassle in C,
and a real pain in the shell, and you had do things differently for GET
and POST queries.

Which is where uncgi comes in. It decodes all the form fields and sticks
them into environment variables for easy perusal by a shell script, a C
program, a Perl script, or whatever you like, then executes whatever other
program you specify.

(Actually, "uncgi" is something of a misnomer, as the weird URL syntax is
from the HTML forms specification, not from CGI itself.)
## Installation

This section assumes you have at least a passing familiarity with compiling
and installing programs from the net (e.g., that you know how to unpack a
compressed tarfile and use "make") and with the operation of your HTTP
server. If you don't, you're probably not the right person to install Un-CGI;
point your system administrators to this page and ask them to set it up for
you.

To install, edit the Makefile. Change the following settings:

CC
The name of your system's C compiler. Typically "cc" or "gcc".

SCRIPT\_BIN
The directory where you want Un-CGI to look for your programs. This doesn't
have to be the same as your server's CGI directory, if any. Note that you
cannot use "~" here to signify a home directory; you have to use the entire
path, beginning with "/". You can put your programs in subdirectories of
SCRIPT\_BIN if you like.

DESTDIR
The directory where you want the Un-CGI executable to be installed. If your
server has a "cgi-bin" directory, that's generally what you'll need to put
here, since the server needs to know to run Un-CGI as a CGI program, and
often that can only happen for programs that are located in the server's
cgi-bin directory.

Note that you cannot just make a directory called "cgi-bin" in your
account and expect uncgi to be run from it. The HTTP server needs to
be configured to know where to look for executable programs. If you
don't manage the HTTP server on your system, you probably cannot
install uncgi in the right place. (On some servers, you can put CGI
programs anywhere if you give them a certain file extension; talk to
your system administrator to find out if this is the case on your
system, and if so, see the next item.)

EXTENSION
If your server allows CGI programs to be run from anywhere
as long as they have a particular filename extension (typically .cgi,) you
should set this to that extension, including the ".". In that case you can
set DESTDIR to point into any directory that the server has access to (e.g.
your public\_html directory.)

You don't need to follow any particular naming rules for the programs you're
going to ask Un-CGI to run; as long as they're in the SCRIPT\_BIN directory,
you can name them any way you see fit.

SECURITY
Security-related options may be set at compile time:

* EXECUTABLES\_ONLY - If set, Un-CGI's ability to execute shell scripts
  that begin with "#!" but don't have execute permission set in the filesystem
  is disabled. Ordinarily Un-CGI will look at non-executable files to see
  if they're shell scripts, and will automatically invoke the appropriate
  shell if so. Some sites find this capability convenient, others may decide
  it's a security hole.

Once you're done editing the Makefile, run "make install" and your system
will build and install Un-CGI into whatever directory you specified as
DESTDIR. If you get an error message like "make:
Command not found" or "cc: Command not found," talk to your system
administrator. I have no way of magically knowing where your system
happens to put its compiler tools, so asking me where to look will do you
no good.

Also, make sure the file permissions on Un-CGI (and the directory it's in)
are set so the HTTP server can execute it. On most systems the HTTP server
runs as user "nobody" or "www". You may want to make Un-CGI a setuid program
if you want to manipulate private files with your backend scripts, since
they will ordinarily be run under the same user ID as the HTTP server. Consult
your system administrator to find out your site's policy on setuid programs;
they are frowned on in some places.
## Usage

An example is the easiest way to demonstrate uncgi's use. Suppose you
have the following in an HTML file:

```
<form method=POST action="/cgi-bin/uncgi/myscript">
What's your name?
<input type=text size=30 name=name>
<p>
Type some comments.
<br>
<textarea name=_comments rows=10 cols=60></textarea>
What problem are you having? <select name=problem multiple>
<option> Sleeplessness
<option> Unruly goat
<option> Limousine overcrowding
</select>
<p>
<input type=submit value="  Send 'em in!  ">
</form>
```
When the user selects the "Send 'em in!" button, the HTTP server will run
uncgi. Uncgi will set three environment variables, `WWW_name`,
`WWW_comments` and `WWW_problem`,
to the values of the "name", "comments", and "problem"
fields in the form, respectively.
Then it will execute myscript in the SCRIPT\_BIN directory.

All the usual CGI environment variables (`PATH_INFO`,
`QUERY_STRING`, etc.) are
available to the script or program you tell uncgi to run. A couple of them
(`PATH_INFO` and `PATH_TRANSLATED`)
are tweaked by uncgi to the values they'd
have if your program were being executed directly by the server.
`PATH_INFO` is, in case you haven't read up on CGI, set to
all the path elements after the script name in your URL, if any.
This is an easy way to specify additional parameters to
your script without resorting to hidden fields.

Myscript might be as simple as this:

```
#!/bin/sh
echo 'Content-type: text/html'
echo ''
cat /my/home/directory/htmlfiles/thanks.html

(
	echo "$WWW_name is having $WWW_problem problems and said:"
	echo "$WWW_comments"
) | mail webmaster
```

With uncgi, that's all you need to do to write a script to send you mail
from a form and print a prewritten file as a response. And it's the same
whether you want to use GET or POST queries.

If you're using Perl, $ENV{"WWW\_xyz"} will look up the value of the "xyz"
form field. (You're on your own beyond that; Perl isn't my native language.)

If more than one "problem" is selected in the example above, the values will
all be placed in `WWW_problem`, separated by hash marks ('#'). You
can use the library function strtok() to separate the values in a C program; in
a shell script, your best bet is probably to replace the hash marks with
newlines using "tr", something like:
```
echo $WWW_problem | tr '#' \\012 | while read value; do
        echo $value 'selected.'
done
```

A useful learning tool is to point your form at a script that just prints
the contents of the environment. On most systems there is a program to
do that, called either env or printenv; you can
write a little script that runs it:

```
#!/bin/sh
echo 'Content-type: text/plain'
echo ''
env
```

That'll show you exactly what your script can expect from a form.
### Special Processing

Eagle-eyed readers noticed that the text area in the above example
had an underscore ("\_") at the beginning of its name. When Un-CGI sees a
form field whose name begins with an underscore, it strips whitespace from
the beginning and end of the value and makes sure that all end-of-line
characters in the value are UNIX-style newlines (as opposed to DOS-style
CR-LF pairs, or Macintosh-style CRs, both of which are sent by some
browsers.) This makes processing text easier, since your program doesn't
have to worry about the browser's end-of-line conventions. Note that if a
form field is named \_xyz, you still get an environment variable
called WWW\_xyz (i.e., the extra underscore doesn't show up in the
environment variable name.)

Un-CGI also modifies variable names containing periods, the major source of
which is <input type=image>. Shell scripts have trouble coping with
periods in environment variable names, so Un-CGI converts periods to
underscores. This is only done to variable *names* -- periods in
values will remain untouched.
## Other Features

Extra feature: If you compile with -DLIBRARY, you can use uncgi as a library
function in a C program of your own. Just call uncgi() at the start of
your program. See this
[example.](uncgi-c.html)

Uncgi will handle hybrid GET/POST requests. Specify a method of POST in
the form, and add a GET-style query string to the action, for example
`<form method=POST
action="/cgi-bin/uncgi/myscript?form_id=feedback">`.
When your script is run, `WWW_form_id`
will be set to "feedback". This will
only work if your HTTP server supports it (NCSA's does, for now anyway.)

Un-CGI is freeware; if you want to include it in a commercial product, please
send me mail. I'll probably just ask you to include a pointer to this page
with your product.
## Bugs

There should be a way to specify a list of directories that uncgi will
search for backend scripts.
## If you want to report a problem...

If you find problems with Un-CGI, I'll take a look at them. Since Un-CGI is
getting fairly popular, though, I have to lay down a few rules:

* I'm not in the business of providing free Web consulting. If you
  can't get your form to look right, or you don't know how to configure
  your server to run CGI programs, I'm not going to help you. There
  are now thousands of qualified consultants who can come to you and
  set up your site and write your forms. Post a message to
  comp.infosystems.www.authoring.cgi if you need help in that area.* Along similar lines, I won't debug your shell scripts for you. If
    your script doesn't work, replace it with the
    [small example script](#envscript)
    elsewhere on this page. If that works, then your script, not Un-CGI,
    is at fault, and you're on your own.* Look through the FAQ in the next section before you send me mail. If
      you ask a question that's answered there, I won't reply.

If you think you've found a genuine problem with Un-CGI, I'll most effectively
be able to help you if you give me the following information. The more of this
you leave out, the less likely I'll be able to do anything useful.

* Your form. Either include it in your mail or include a URL so I can
  fetch it.* The exact input, including any checkbox settings, that you enter into
    the form to cause the problem you're seeing.* Your Makefile.* The results of submitting your form through Un-CGI after you recompile
        with the debugging option turned on. See
        the Makefile for details about activating it. The debugging option
        often tells you enough about what's going on that you'll see what
        the problem is.* If possible, your script or program.

I won't guarantee to fix every problem, but if you give me a complete report,
I'll often be able to help.

### I get an error about sys\_errlist when I compile.

Some UNIX variants' standard include files contain a declaration for the
list of system error codes, and some don't; for the latter, I need to include
the declaration in uncgi.c. If you get an error about the "strerror" function
not being defined, edit the Makefile, search for "SYS\_ERRLIST", and remove the
"#" from the beginning of the line.
### How do I put forms in my documents?

See the
[NCSA documentation](http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/Mosaic/Docs/fill-out-forms/overview.html)
on forms. It includes several examples.
### I'm having trouble getting my output to look right.

I'm afraid I don't have the time to help people with HTML. Pick up any of
the numerous HTML books on the market. Many of them discuss putting together
forms as well as regular documents.
### Where do I put everything?

Short answer: Look in the Makefile.

Long answer: When you edit uncgi's Makefile, you'll see two macro definitions
relating to paths.
The first, `SCRIPT_BIN`, tells uncgi where to look for your scripts
or programs. It must be set to the name of an existing directory; you can set
it to any directory you like. Sometimes it's set to the location of your
server's cgi-bin directory, though that's not necessary.

The second, `DESTDIR`, tells the Makefile where to install uncgi.
It must point to your server's cgi-bin directory, if your server
has one.

Note that you can't just create a directory called "cgi-bin" in your account
and expect it to work. The server has configuration files that tell it where
to look for scripts and programs. Talk to your system administrator if you
aren't the person in charge of the server on your machine.

An additional Makefile setting, `EXTENSION`, should be of help if
your server allows you to put CGI programs anywhere on the system. Again,
consult your system administrator to see if this is the case.
### Why does uncgi tell me it can't run my script?

First, make sure your script is in the right place; see the preceding
section.

Second, make sure your script can be executed by the server. Remember,
Un-CGI is run by the server, which is probably using a system user ID,
not your user ID. You need to set the
permissions on your script such that it can be run by any user. Usually,
you can say "chmod 755 scriptname" (replacing scriptname with
the name of your script) to set the permissions properly.

If you're still having trouble, edit the Makefile, uncomment the
DEBUG\_PATH line, and rebuild. This will instruct Un-CGI to include the full
path to where it thinks your script should be in its error message.
### What do I do in my forms?

The `<form>` tag has two attributes, `METHOD` and
`ACTION`. `METHOD` must be set to either `GET`
or `POST`; uncgi will handle either one, but `POST` is
preferred if you have textarea fields or are expecting a lot of information
from the client. Note that the attribute name (`METHOD`) can be
upper or lower case, but the value must be all caps.

`ACTION` should have the following components:

* The alias for your server's cgi-bin directory (usually just
  `/cgi-bin/`)* `uncgi/` to tell the server which program to execute.* The name of your script as it appears in the directory where you told uncgi to
      find your scripts and programs (the `CGI_BIN` macro in the
      Makefile.) Example: `myscript`* Optionally, a forward slash followed by additional parameters, often the
        path to another file you want your script to print. This path information
        will be available to your script in the `PATH_INFO` and
        `PATH_TRANSLATED` environment variables (the latter contains
        the full path to the document, including the path to the server root
        directory.) Note that you can't use tilde notation. Example:
        `/form_output/acknowledge.html`

So, if you wanted to tell uncgi to run sendmemail with no
additional parameters, you'd put sendmemail in the directory
you specified as the value of `CGI_BIN` in uncgi's makefile, and
use the following tag to begin your form:
> <form method=POST action="/cgi-bin/uncgi/sendmemail">

### I get an error 403 when I submit my form.

The usual cause of this is that your server requires a special filename
extension on CGI programs. (Most often it's ".cgi".) You need to give uncgi
a name that will identify it as a CGI program to the Web server. There is
nothing special about uncgi from the Web server's point of view; it's just
another program that gets run like any other, and your installation of it
has to obey the same rules as other programs'.
### I get an error code 500 from the server.

That code almost always results from a CGI script spitting out something
invalid when the server is expecting an HTTP header. There are a few common
reasons that can happen.

* Your script isn't specifying a content type to the
  server. The first thing your script needs to output is:
  > `Content-type: text/html`

  followed by a blank line. Note that the blank line is not optional, and
  it has to be completely empty -- no whitespace. If you're writing a shell
  script, for instance, you'll need:
  > `echo Content-type: text/html
  >
  > echo ""`

  The empty quotes on the second line are necessary in some shells, e.g. csh;
  without them echo won't
  print anything, not even a blank line. (Of course, if your script is
  outputting something other than HTML, adjust the content type accordingly.)

  In many shells you can achieve the same effect with a command like
  > `cat << EOF
  >
  > Content-type: text/html
  >
  >
  >
  > EOF`

  * Your form has fields whose names contain special
    characters that confuse the shell you're using, if any, causing it to spit
    out a warning message which the Web server tries (and fails) to interpret as
    an HTTP header line. Some shells, notably
    /bin/sh, won't allow you to have certain characters in environment variable
    names, and will often refuse to run a script if they're present. If you stick
    to alphanumeric characters in your form's field names, you should be safe.

    * You compiled Un-CGI or the backend program it's running on a machine other
      than your Web server. If the host you used to compile Un-CGI had a different
      version of the C compiler, or different versions of shared libraries, than your
      Web server, in many cases the OS will output a warning message (e.g. "Shared
      library xyz is an unexpected version") when the program is run. Unfortunately,
      in the case of a CGI program, that warning is picked up by the Web server,
      which is expecting an HTTP header line and doesn't know what to make of the
      message. Compiling on the Web server is usually enough to stop this kind
      of error.

In general,
if your HTTP server outputs CGI scripts' standard error streams to a logfile
(often called "error\_log") you should look there to see if your script, or
its shell, is outputting any diagnostic information. Most Web servers will
log any illegal header lines they get from CGI programs, and once you see
what it is that's confusing your server, it should be straightforward to fix.

If that's no help, try removing the # from the start of the "DEBUG" line in
the Makefile and rebuilding Un-CGI. It will spit out diagnostic information
that might help.
### My script doesn't see the form variables.

There are a few common causes for this:

* Make sure you're actually running Un-CGI. If you install uncgi but
  your form's ACTION attribute still points to something like
  `/cgi-bin/myscript`, Un-CGI isn't being executed by the Web
  server when the user submits the form. See the example forms above.* Put another way: If your <form> tag doesn't contain the string
    "uncgi" somewhere in its "action" attribute, you're not using Un-CGI.
    Simply installing Un-CGI on your system doesn't cause your Web server
    to know when to execute it.* Environment variables are case sensitive. That means that if you have
      a field in your form named "revision", Un-CGI will create an environment
      variable named "WWW\_revision", not "WWW\_REVISION" or "WWW\_Revision".* Many shells restrict the characters you can use in variable names. In
        particular, spaces and punctuation are usually illegal. Underscores
        and numbers are all right.

### The browser just sits there when I submit my form.

The most common cause of hangs like that is trying to convert an old
CGI-compliant program or script to run under Un-CGI. Your script is
detecting that the form was submitted with the POST method, and is trying
to read form results from the browser. Unfortunately, by the time your
script is run, Un-CGI has already read the results, so your program sits
there waiting forever for bytes that've already been consumed.

Remove the part of your code that reads a query from the standard input --
it'll generally be located somewhere around the word "POST", which is
easy to search for -- and replace it with code that fills your program's
internal variables via getenv() calls (assuming your program is in C)
on the WWW\_ variables defined by Un-CGI.
### How do I parse checkbox results?

Un-CGI puts hash marks ("#") between checkbox selections if there are
several of them. How you parse that depends entirely on what language you're
using. In C, use strtok(). In Python, use string.splitfields(). In Perl,
use split(). In Bourne shell, do something like
```
echo $WWW_whatever | tr \# \\012 | while read result; do
        echo User picked $result
done
```
### Do I need to make a directory called "uncgi"?

No. You're probably assuming that since your form has an ACTION like
`/cgi-bin/uncgi/xyz`, there must be an `uncgi`
directory under `cgi-bin`. That's not how it works.

The parts of a URL between the slashes are not directory names. They are
symbols to tell the server where to find a particular document. In most
cases, the server will look for a directory of the same name as the symbol
in question, and if there is one, go into that directory and proceed to the
next symbol. But that isn't always what happens. If the server sees that
a particular symbol matches the name of a program, it will typically run
that program and pass the rest of the URL to the program as an argument.
And that's exactly what's happening here.

There's no `uncgi` directory. You can think of
`/cgi-bin/uncgi/xyz` as `/cgi-bin/uncgi xyz` if that
helps (it's not strictly speaking accurate, but that's the concept.)
Uncgi sees the "xyz" argument and looks in its SCRIPT\_BIN directory to find
a program by that name.

If you're still not sure what all this means, just try it out and see what
happens!
### Does uncgi strip out special shell characters that might cause security problems?

No, for the simple reason that uncgi isn't tied to any one shell, or any
shell at all, for that matter. It sits in front of C programs just as easily
as Bourne shell scripts, just as easily as Perl scripts or Python scripts.
(All of which are used in conjunction with uncgi at Midwinter, incidentally.)

In most of those languages, there *aren't* any special characters that'd
inherently be security problems, so having uncgi strip characters that cause
problems for a particular shell would just end up pointlessly mangling the
input to other kinds of scripts and programs. And people using shells with
different special characters would still have to specially handle them
anyway.

On most UNIXes, you can use the "tr -d" command to strip out characters
your shell processes specially. For example, to strip out
dollar signs from a Bourne shell variable, you'd do:
> `WWW_puppycount="`echo $WWW_puppy | tr -d \$`"`

### Do you have a Windows version?

Thanks to a couple of contributors who prefer to remain anonymous, Un-CGI
will compile under Borland's Turbo C.

I do not support Un-CGI under Windows. If you're having trouble
getting Un-CGI to work under Windows, I will not help you. I know almost
nothing about Windows programming and I know even
less about Windows HTTP servers. It is probable that Un-CGI will work
with some HTTP servers and not others. It's known to work on:

* SAIC's freeware httpd.* OmniHTTPD.

If you know of another one under which it works, send me mail and I'll list it
here. There is currently a Win-CGI port underway, which should help Un-CGI
work on a wider range of servers. The port will be folded into the main source
base when it's available. I don't know, even roughly, when that will be.

I have no plans to make binaries available for any platform, Windows or
otherwise.

If the above sounds obstructionist, that's not the intent; I want to make
Un-CGI useful to a wide audience, but I'd really rather not raise people's
expectations and then not be able to help them in the slightest. It's
frustrating for all concerned when people send me questions I can't answer.
### What about security?

Un-CGI is as secure as the SCRIPT\_BIN directory. That is, if a malicious
user can add files to SCRIPT\_BIN, he or she can use Un-CGI to execute
them under the Web server's user ID. In that sense the security level
is no different than that of a typical Web server's cgi-bin directory.

Some specific security concerns:

Scripts can be setuid
If Un-CGI didn't allow setuid scripts/programs to be executed, a
malicious user could simply create a trivial wrapper script to run a setuid
program somewhere else. Disallowing setuid scripts would be at worst a slight
inconvenience to intruders.
Symbolic links can point from SCRIPT\_BIN to anywhere on the server
As is the case with setuid scripts, if Un-CGI disallowed symbolic links,
a malicious user would replace a symlink with a script to run a program from
somewhere else on the server. Again, disabling symlinks would prove nothing
more than a slight bump in the road, meanwhile making it less convenient
for a system administrator to allow specific user-supplied programs to be
run using Un-CGI.

=== Content from www.midwinter.com_3bf9e4b5_20250126_003341.html ===

# Un-CGI Change Log

## Version 1.11

Use strerror() rather than sys\_errlist by default to produce human-readable
error messages. For systems that don't have strerror(), supply an option in
the Makefile to revert to the old behavior.
## Version 1.10

Check for ".." elements in script paths; this closes a security hole that
could be used to execute arbitrary applications on the server.

Add security-related compile-time option EXECUTABLES\_ONLY. The old behavior
may be retained by not setting the option.
## Version 1.9

Fix a memory corruption bug that caused unpredictable results, especially
in the presence of <select multiple> tags in a form.

The Netscape server is passing a PATH\_TRANSLATED variable with an empty
value, which was causing uncgi to crash or generate corrupt data.
## Version 1.8

The NO\_MAIN define has been changed to LIBRARY, which is more descriptive.

Various minor tweaks to increase readability.

Don't do the check for scripts beginning with #! on Linux systems, since
some Linux versions have buggy fgets() implementations that will cause the
check to hang if no newline occurs in a binary.
## Version 1.7

If compiled with -DNO\_QUERY\_OK, it's not an error to run uncgi without a
query string.

Un-CGI now prints a tagline linking back to its home page when it spits
out an error message. From there you can check the FAQ and see if your
problem is covered.

Modifications to support compilation under Turbo C on Windows 95. I do not
support Un-CGI on Windows.
## Version 1.6.2

Added a lot of debugging messages to help diagnose future bug reports.

Fixed a memory allocation problem.

Fixed a problem in the script name parser that was causing it to not
execute scripts properly.
## Version 1.6.1

Doing a "make install" won't return an error if you don't have a previous
version of uncgi installed.

Incorporated a patch from Bruce Korb <bkorb@mport.com>
to make the function that runs shell scripts more robust.
## Version 1.6

Revamped the Makefile to make configuration less confusing.

Added an internal version of strdup() since Ultrix doesn't seem to include
it in its system library.
## Version 1.5

If an input field name begins with an underscore, Un-CGI will do some simple
normalizing of the value. It will strip whitespace from the beginning and
end of the value, and will change all end-of-line characters (including
CR-LF pairs) to single linefeeds. This should make transmitting forms via
E-mail more straightforward. This is mainly useful for <textarea>
inputs.

**Possible incompatibility!**
Change periods to underscores in variable names, so that shell scripts can
access the coordinate values from "image" form fields. If you were using
<input type=image> with Un-CGI before, or you had forms with periods
in field names, you'll need to adjust your backend software.

Explicitly include <sys/types.h> before <sys/stat.h< for systems
(e.g. BSDI) that don't do so implicitly; this makes uncgi compile properly.
## Version 1.4

Un-CGI is now distributed in "tar" format, rather than "shar", which lots of
people had trouble figuring out what to do with.

POST queries would sometimes cause heap corruption due to uncgi not mallocing
enough space for an input buffer.

Scripts that had a space after the shell name but no additional arguments
would cause uncgi to dump core. (E.g., scripts whose first line was
"#!/bin/sh ".)

If a nonexistent script name is used, uncgi will no longer print the entire
path to the script directory in its error message. This makes it harder
for potential intruders to discover the location of the scripts.
## Version 1.3

The SCRIPT\_NAME environment variable is adjusted to include the name of the
backend script run by uncgi.

The QUERY\_STRING environment variable is passed to backend programs
unchanged. It used to get mangled on some systems.

Backend programs can now be in subdirectories of the script directory.
Un-CGI will adjust SCRIPT\_NAME and PATH\_INFO appropriately.
## Version 1.2

Multiple selections with the same name are now supported (e.g. a
<select multiple> form element.) All the values are stuffed into the
same WWW\_ environment variable, separated by pound signs. If you can
think of a more elegant way to do it, let me know.
## Version 1.1

Shell scripts, if they start with "#!", are now executed by running the
shell directly with the script name as an argument. Some SVR3-based systems
were having trouble running scripts via execve(), so this should work
everywhere.

Empty query strings are handled properly.

Query strings containing entries that aren't of the form "x=y" cause
empty environment variables to be created, i.e., a string "foo=" is entered
into the environment. Version 1.0 just passed the variable name to
setenv(), which isn't valid.
