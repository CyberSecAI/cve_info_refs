```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Apache PL/SQL module in Oracle9i Application Server does not properly decode double URL encoded strings.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Improper URL decoding: The module only performs one decoding pass, failing to fully decode double URL encoded characters."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An unauthenticated remote attacker can read files outside the web server's root directory with the privileges of the Apache process. On Windows systems where Apache typically runs with SYSTEM privileges, this could allow an attacker to read any file on the system that can be displayed in a web browser.",
  "Attack vectors": "A crafted HTTP request for a help page containing double URL encoded characters, which when decoded represents ../, can be used to access files outside the web server's root directory.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No authentication is required."
