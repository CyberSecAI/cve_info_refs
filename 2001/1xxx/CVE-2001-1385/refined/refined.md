Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2001-1385:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Issue 1:** A bug in the Apache module version of PHP allowed remote attackers to manipulate per-directory PHP directives (usually set via .htaccess files) by crafting special HTTP requests. This could cause subsequent pages served by the same Apache process to use incorrect directive values.
*   **Issue 2:** A bug in the Apache module version of PHP allowed the `engine = off` setting (which disables PHP script execution) from one virtual host to propagate to other virtual hosts within the same Apache server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Issue 1:** Incorrect handling of per-directory configuration settings when processing HTTP requests within the Apache module for PHP.
*   **Issue 2:** Improper isolation of PHP configuration settings between different virtual hosts within the Apache module for PHP.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Issue 1:** In certain situations, exploiting this vulnerability could lead to a security problem (the specific security impact isn't specified, but it's stated that in their worst case could have severe implications). The advisory mentions the attacker would need a good understanding of the site structure and PHP directives configuration.
*   **Issue 2:** Exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to the source code of PHP scripts being sent to end clients, potentially exposing sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Issue 1:** Sending specially crafted HTTP requests to the server.
*   **Issue 2:** Having multiple virtual hosts configured in Apache, with some having `engine = off` set, allows the propagation to other virtual hosts.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Issue 1:** An attacker needs a good understanding of the site's structure and the values of PHP directives in different directories. They need to craft specific HTTP requests and be fortunate enough to have the attack occur on the same Apache process that was used in a prior request.
*   **Issue 2:** An attacker wouldn't need any specific knowledge or capabilities other than to send an HTTP request to a web server with vulnerable PHP and Apache configuration.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerabilities only affect the Apache module version of PHP, not the CGI module or other server modules.
*   PHP 3.0 is not affected by these issues, only PHP 4.0.0 up to 4.0.4
*   The provided advisory was published in 2001.
*   The advisory recommends upgrading to PHP 4.0.4pl1 to resolve the vulnerabilities. Workarounds include explicitly setting `engine=on` on all virtual hosts that are supposed to serve PHP pages, and disallowing `OPTIONS` requests.
