## tcpdump vulnerable to buffer overflow via improper decoding of AFS RPC (Rx) packets

#### Vulnerability Note VU#797201

Original Release Date: 2002-06-07 | Last Revised: 2002-06-12

---

### Overview

A vulnerability exists in tcpdump that could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of tcpdump, typically root.

### Description

| tcpdump is a widely-used network sniffer that is capable of decoding AFS traffic. A buffer overflow vulnerability has been discovered in tcpdump's handling of AFS RPC (Rx) packets. Rx is the proprietary remote procedure call (RPC) protocol used by AFS to communicate between AFS processes running on different systems. According to FreeBSD Security Advisory FreeBSD-SA-01:48, this vulnerability is caused by "...incorrect string length handling in the decoding of AFS RPC packets." |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker who is able to send crafted AFS RPC (Rx) packets may be able to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service on a system running tcpdump. If tcpdump is operating in promiscuous mode, the attacker only needs to send packets to the ethernet segment in which tcpdump is running. On Linux systems, tcpdump runs with root privileges. On other UNIX systems, tcpdump may run with root privileges. On Windows 2000 systems, [windump](http://windump.polito.it/) can be run with user privileges. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade tcpdump**This vulnerability was addressed in July 2001. tcpdump3\_6\_rel3 and later are not vulnerable. tcpdump 3.6.2 and earlier are vulnerable. Obtain an upgraded tcpdump package or apply the appropriate patch from your vendor. |
| --- |

| **Filter AFS Traffic**Block AFS RPC (Rx) packets destined to hosts (and networks with hosts) running vulnerable versions of tcpdump. AFS services communicate on a number of UDP ports:7000/udp fileserver7001/udp callback (cache manager on AFS client)7002/udp ptserver  7003/udp vlserver7004/udp kaserver7005/udp volserver7007/udp bosserver7008/udp upserver7009/udp rmtsysd (NFS/AFS translator)7021/udp buserver7025-65535/udp butc (backup servers)It may also be possible to instruct tcpdump not to decode packets that use AFS Rx port numbers (ports 7021 and >7025 are not included in this filter):$ tcpdump not udp port 7000 or 7001 or 7002 or 7003 or 7004 or 7005 or 7006 or 7007 or 7008 or 7009While blocking AFS Rx traffic into a network may protect internal hosts, it may not protect systems that run tcpdump at the network perimeter, such as an Intrusion Detection System (IDS). Also, it is unclear how tcpdump determines that a given packet should be decoded as an AFS Rx packet. It is likely that tcpdump does not rely on port numbers, and if this is the case then an attacker could easily bypass port filters by using non-AFS port numbers. |

CONECTIVA LINUX SECURITY ANNOUNCEMENT
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

PACKAGE   : tcpdump
SUMMARY   : Several vulnerabilities
DATE      : 2002-05-07 18:23:00
ID        : CLA-2002:480
RELEVANT
RELEASES  : 5.0, 5.1, 6.0, 7.0, 8

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

DESCRIPTION
 Tcpdump is a command-line tool for monitoring network traffic. It
 uses libpcap, a library which provides a portable framework for
 low-level network monitoring. Both are developed by the same
 team[1].

 This advisory addresses problems found in both projects.

 tcpdump buffer overflows: during a tcpdump code auditing done by
 FreeBSD developers, several buffer overflows were discovered[2] in
 tcpdump versions prior to 3.5. New versions (including 3.6.2) are
 also vulnerable to another buffer overflow[3] in AFS RPC decoding
 functions, as pointed out by Nick Cleaton <nick@cleaton.net>.

 These vulnerablities could be exploited by a remote attacker to crash
 the tcpdump process or even execute arbitrary code as the user
 running tcpdump (which usually is root).

 libpcap 0.6 has been audited and a better buffer boundary checking
 was implemented in several functions, thus making it more safe.

 This upgrade also fixes a lot of minor bugs[4] in both tcpdump and
 libpcap. Notice that the number of vulnerabilities and bug fixes
 which apply to every version of Conectiva Linux varies accordingly to
 the tcpdump/libpcap versions included in it. This update brings all
 packages to the most recent version as of this date plus the tcpdump
 security patches which have not yet been included in the upstream
 stable version (3.6.2).

SOLUTION
 All tcpdump users should upgrade their packages immediately. If
 you're only using libpcap, you should also consider upgrading since
 this new version solves several minor bugs.

Topic:          tcpdump contains remote vulnerabilities [REISSUED]

Category:       core
Module:         tcpdump
Announced:      2000-10-31
Reissued:2000-11-06
Credits:Discovered during internal auditing.
Affects:        All releases of FreeBSD 3.x, 4.x prior to 4.2
                FreeBSD 3.5.1-STABLE and 4.1.1-STABLE prior to the
                correction date
Corrected:      2000-10-04 (FreeBSD 4.1.1-STABLE)
2000-10-05 (FreeBSD 3.5.1-STABLE)
Vendor status:Patch released
FreeBSD only:   NO

0.   Revision History

v1.0  2000-10-31  Initial release
v1.1  2000-11-06  Corrected patch

I.   Background

tcpdump is a tool for monitoring network activity.

II.  Problem Description

Several overflowable buffers were discovered in the version of tcpdump
included in FreeBSD, during internal source code auditing.  Some
simply allow the remote attacker to crash the local tcpdump process,
but there is a more serious vulnerability in the decoding of AFS ACL
packets in the more recent version of tcpdump (tcpdump 3.5) included
in FreeBSD 4.0-RELEASE, 4.1-RELEASE and 4.1.1-RELEASE, which may allow
a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the local system
(usually root, since root privileges are required to run tcpdump).

The former issue may be a problem for systems using tcpdump as a form
of intrusion detection system, i.e. to monitor suspicious network
activity: after the attacker crashes any listening tcpdump processes
their subsequent activities will not be observed.

All released versions of FreeBSD prior to the correction date
including 3.5.1-RELEASE, 4.0-RELEASE, 4.1-RELEASE and 4.1.1-RELEASE
are vulnerable to the "remote crash" problems, and FreeBSD
4.0-RELEASE, 4.1-RELEASE and 4.1.1-RELEASE are also vulnerable to the
"remote execution" vulnerability.  Both problems were corrected in
4.1.1-STABLE prior to the release of FreeBSD 4.2-RELEASE.

III. Impact

Remote users can cause the local tcpdump process to crash, and (under
FreeBSD 4.0-RELEASE, 4.1-RELEASE, 4.1.1-RELEASE and 4.1.1-STABLE prior
to the correction date) may be able to cause arbitrary code to be
executed as the user running tcpdump, usually root.

IV.  Workaround

Do not use vulnerable versions of tcpdump in network environments
which may contain packets from untrusted sources.

V.   Solution

One of the following:

1) Upgrade your vulnerable FreeBSD system to 4.1.1-STABLE or
3.5.1-STABLE after the respective correction dates.

2a) FreeBSD 3.x systems prior to the correction date

Download the patch and the detached PGP signature from the following
locations, and verify the signature using your PGP utility.

ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/patches/SA-00:61/tcpdump-3.x.patch
ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/patches/SA-00:61/tcpdump-3.x.patch.asc

# cd /usr/src/contrib/tcpdump
# patch -p < /path/to/patch
# cd /usr/src/usr.sbin/tcpdump
# make depend && make all install

2b) FreeBSD 4.x systems prior to the correction date

NOTE: The patch distributed with the original version of this advisory
was incomplete and did not include all of the security fixes made to
the tcpdump utility. In particular, it did not address the remote code
execution vulnerability.

> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.
