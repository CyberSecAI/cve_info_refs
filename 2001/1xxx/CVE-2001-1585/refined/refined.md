- Root cause of vulnerability: The OpenSSH 2.3.1 development snapshot omitted the challenge-response step in the protocol 2 server, which is necessary to verify that the connecting client possesses the private key corresponding to the public key listed in the user's authorized_keys file.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Missing private key ownership verification during public key authentication in OpenSSH protocol 2.
- Impact of exploitation: Anyone who obtains a user's public key listed in their authorized_keys file can log in as that user without proper authentication.
- Attack vectors: Network-based attacks. An attacker would need to connect to the SSH server over the network.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker must know or obtain the public key listed in the target user's authorized_keys file. The attacker also needs network access to the SSH server.
