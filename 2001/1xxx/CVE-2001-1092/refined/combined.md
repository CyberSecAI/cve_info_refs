## Digital Unix msgchk vulnerable to file contents disclosure via symlink redirection of profile

#### Vulnerability Note VU#440539

Original Release Date: 2001-11-15 | Last Revised: 2001-11-15

---

### Overview

msgchk, a part of the MH mail system, reads the user's .mh\_profile in order to obtain configuration options. If the .mh\_profile is linked to another file with illegal format, the first line of that file will be displayed in an error message by msgchk.

### Description

| msgchk is the portion of the MH mail system that checks for new mail in the system spool folder. It reads the user's .mh\_profile in order to obtain configuration options. If that file is linked to another file readable by the effective user of msgchk, and not of legal .mh\_profile format, then msgchk will display the first line of that file in an error message. |
| --- |

### Impact

| If msgchk executes with the user's effective UID, there is no vulnerability here. If msgchk is protected to set another UID, there is a possibility that an attacker may view protected information. |
| --- |

### Solution

| The CERT/CC is currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem. |
| --- |

| Remove setuid privileges from msgchk. |
