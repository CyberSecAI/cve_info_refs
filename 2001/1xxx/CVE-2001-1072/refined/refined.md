- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `mod_rewrite` module in Apache does not perform full canonicalization of the path portion of the URL. Specifically, it doesn't normalize multiple consecutive slashes in a URI.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The vulnerability lies in the fact that `mod_rewrite` can be bypassed by using multiple slashes in the URL path (e.g., `//somepath` instead of `/somepath`). This can lead to incorrect or unintended rewrite rules being applied.
- **Impact of exploitation:** If `mod_rewrite` is used for access restrictions, this vulnerability could allow attackers to bypass these restrictions. It could potentially lead to serving pages that were not intended to be accessible. This could also allow bypassing of access control rules or other security measures that rely on specific URL patterns.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker can craft URLs with multiple consecutive slashes to bypass `RewriteCond` and `RewriteRule` directives within the Apache web server configuration.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the targeted Apache server. No special position or privileges are needed, other than the ability to send network requests.
