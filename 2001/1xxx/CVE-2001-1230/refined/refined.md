Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the Icecast vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is buffer overflow vulnerabilities present in the Icecast software. Additionally, format string vulnerabilities were present in earlier versions and have been addressed in the 1.3.9 release.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Buffer overflow vulnerabilities: Multiple buffer overflows were identified by Andreas Hasenack and confirmed to be remotely exploitable by Matt Messier.
- Format string vulnerabilities: Previously announced format string vulnerabilities were also present.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: The buffer overflows are remotely exploitable, indicating an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server. This could allow the attacker to compromise the system, potentially taking control of the server, accessing sensitive data, or disrupting service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attacks: The vulnerabilities are remotely exploitable, implying the attack vector is through the network (likely via malformed requests or data sent to the Icecast server).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access: An attacker needs network access to the Icecast server in order to exploit these vulnerabilities.
- No authentication required: There is no indication that authentication is required to exploit the buffer overflows, suggesting they could be triggered by unauthenticated users if the vulnerable endpoints are exposed.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerabilities affect all Icecast users.
- Icecast team released version 1.3.10 to correct the reported buffer overflows.
- The 1.3.9 release fixed several buffer overflows as well as the format string vulnerabilities announced earlier.
- A full audit of Icecast, especially the upcoming 2.0 version, is recommended due to its widespread use and lack of thorough security review.
