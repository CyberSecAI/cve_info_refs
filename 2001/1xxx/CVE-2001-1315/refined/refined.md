The provided content relates to CVE-2001-1315.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Multiple vulnerabilities exist in the LDAP handling code of Critical Path's InJoin Directory Server and LiveContent Directory products. These were found using the PROTOS LDAPv3 test suite which revealed failures in both encoding and application sections.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Multiple vulnerabilities exist in the code that processes LDAP requests. These vulnerabilities are related to how the products handle LDAP requests, specifically in encoding and application.

**Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker can crash the affected Critical Path directory servers, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. Additionally, an attacker might be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the directory server, which typically runs with system privileges, leading to unauthorized privileged access.

**Attack vectors:** Remote network access via LDAP protocol.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send malicious LDAP requests to the vulnerable server. Network access to the LDAP service is required.
