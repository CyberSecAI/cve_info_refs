- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A vulnerability in Allaire ColdFusion Server allows unauthorized access to files on the target host.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability allows attackers to read and delete arbitrary files accessible to the ColdFusion server process.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can retrieve or delete arbitrary files, potentially disclosing confidential information and/or destroying data on the target host.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is remotely exploitable.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the ColdFusion server. The vulnerability does not depend on the ColdFusion application code itself.
