- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `kmmodreg` program in HP-UX creates two temporary files with predictable names in the `/tmp` directory without checking for prior existence. Specifically, it uses `creat()` which does not check for existing files, making it vulnerable to symlink attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure handling of temporary files, specifically the lack of prior existence checks during the creation of `/tmp.kmmodreg_lock` and `/tmp/kmpath.tmp`. These files are created with permissions that allow modification by anyone.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can create symbolic links with the same names as the temporary files before `kmmodreg` is executed. This allows the attacker to overwrite arbitrary files on the system with data from `kmmodreg`. This can lead to:
    - File corruption and denial of service.
    - Modification of system files leading to privilege escalation, as the temporary files are created with permissions that allow modification by anyone.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - By creating symbolic links named for either of the two temporary files, an attacker can redirect the output of `kmmodreg` to an arbitrary location on the system.
    - The vulnerability is triggered automatically during system reboot as `kmmodreg` is executed during the boot process.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have the ability to create symbolic links in the `/tmp` directory before the system reboots and `kmmodreg` runs.
