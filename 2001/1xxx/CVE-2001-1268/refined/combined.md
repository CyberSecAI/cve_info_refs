# UnZip 6.0

### *The Third Most Portable Program in the World!* [\*](#Footnote)

UnZip is an extraction utility for archives compressed in *.zip* format
(also called "zipfiles"). Although highly compatible both with
PKWARE's PKZIP and PKUNZIP utilities for MS-DOS and with Info-ZIP's
own [Zip](http://infozip.sourceforge.net/Zip.html) program, our primary objectives have
been portability and non-MSDOS functionality.

UnZip will list, test, or extract files from a *.zip* archive, commonly
found on MS-DOS systems. The default behavior (with no options) is to
extract into the current directory (and subdirectories below it) all
files from the specified zipfile. A companion program,
[Zip](http://infozip.sourceforge.net/Zip.html), creates *.zip* archives; both programs are
compatible with archives created by PKZIP and PKUNZIP for MS-DOS, but
in many cases the program options or default behaviors differ. (For
example, UnZip recreates the stored directory structure by default;
PKUNZIP unpacks all files in the current directory by default.)

| The Unix port of UnZip 5.52 is reported to have a **race-condition vulnerability**, whereby a local attacker could change the permissions of the user's files during unpacking. (This has been assigned CVE ID [CAN-2005-2475](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-2475).) |
| --- |

| All versions of UnZip through 5.50 have a number of **directory-traversal vulnerabilities**, and version 5.50 also has a **textmode data-corruption bug** that affects 16-bit ports such as MS-DOS. See the [**FAQ page**](http://infozip.sourceforge.net/FAQ.html#corruption) for details. |

## Latest Release

New features in **UnZip 6.0**, released 20 April 2009:

* Support PKWARE ZIP64 extensions, allowing Zip archives and Zip archive
  entries larger than 4 GiBytes and more than 65536 entries within a single
  Zip archive. This support is currently only available for Unix,
  OpenVMS and Win32/Win64.
* Support for bzip2 compression method.
* Support for UTF-8 encoded entry names, both through PKWARE's "General
  Purpose Flags Bit 11" indicator and Info-ZIP's new "up" unicode path
  extra field. (Currently, on Windows the UTF-8 handling is limited to
  the character subset contained in the configured non-unicode "system
  code page".)
* Added "wrong implementation used" warning to error messages of the MSDOS
  port when used under Win32, in an attempt to reduce false bug reports.
* Fixed "Time of Creation/Time of Use" vulnerability when setting attributes
  of extracted files, for Unix and Unix-like ports.
* Fixed memory leak when processing invalid deflated data.
* Fixed long-standing bug in unshrink (partial\_clear), added boundary checks
  against invalid compressed data.
* On Unix, keep inherited SGID attribute bit for extracted directories
  unless restoration of owner/group id or SUID/SGID/Tacky attributes was
  requested.
* On Unix, allow extracted filenames to contain embedded control characters
  when explicitly requested by specifying the new command line option "-^".
* On Unix, support restoration of symbolic link attributes.
* On Unix, support restoration of 32-bit UID/GID data using the new "ux"
  IZUNIX3 extra field introduced with Zip 3.0.
* Support for ODS5 extended filename syntax on new OpenVMS systems.
* Support symbolic links zipped up on VMS.
* On VMS (only 8.x or better), support symbolic link creation.
* On VMS, support option to create converted text files in Stream\_LF format.
* New -D option to suppress restoration of timestamps for extracted
  directory entries (on those ports that support setting of directory
  timestamps). By specifying "-DD", this new option also allows to suppress
  timestamp restoration for ALL extracted files on all UnZip ports which
  support restoration of timestamps.
  On VMS, the default behaviour is now to skip restoration of directory
  timestamps; here, "--D" restores ALL timestamps, "-D" restores none.
* On OS/2, Win32, and Unix, the (previously optional) feature UNIXBACKUP
  to allow saving backup copies of overwritten files on extraction is now
  enabled by default.

For the UnZip 6.0 release, we want to give special credit to Myles Bennet,
who started the job of supporting ZIP64 extensions and Large-File (> 2GiB)
and provided a first (alpha-state) port.

## Future Plans

The next major release will be version **6.1**.

It is questionable whether there will ever be a *subsequent* major
release, but on the off-chance that there is, it will probably be version
**7.0**, perhaps with a much-improved and unified DLL interface and
possibly better file system support for the MVS and VM/CMS ports, assuming
that doesn't happen sooner. And then perhaps version **8.0** will be
released, with full filter support (that is, able to read and extract a
zipfile from standard input like fUnZip does now), but now we're really
dreaming. While we're at it, though, a **tcl/tk** or **Python/PIL**
graphical interface might be nice--but see the [related-links section](http://infozip.sourceforge.net/Info-ZIP2.html#RelatedLinks) for a pointer to
TkZip, which already exists (and has for a long time).

## Downloads

Ready-to-run binary versions of UnZip are available for numerous platforms
and operating systems, but for most systems, only older binaries are available.
The three primary CTAN sites (and their many mirrors) contain a snapshot of
these binaries, current as of roughly 2004 (i.e., UnZip 5.51 and Zip 2.3
timeframe):

* tug.ctan.org (US)
  **[FROZEN]**
* ftp.tex.ac.uk (UK)
  **[FROZEN]**
* ftp.dante.de (Germany)
  **[FROZEN]**

Here's a quick guide to the directory structure of the old ftp site:

probably second. (The Linux kernel may very well be third...)
