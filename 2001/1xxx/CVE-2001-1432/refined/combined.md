## Cherokee Web Server does not adequately validate user input thereby allowing directory traversal

#### Vulnerability Note VU#464827

Original Release Date: 2002-09-24 | Last Revised: 2002-09-24

---

### Overview

Cherokee contains a directory traversal vulnerability caused by failure to filter '../' character sequences.

### Description

| Cherokee is a compact, open-source web server. Cherokee does not filter '../' sequences from HTTP requests. As a result, it is possible for a remote attacker to request and read files outside the Cherokee HTTP root directory. |
| --- |

### Impact

| Attackers may read any file on the filesystem that is readable by the Cherokee process, which may be running as root. |
| --- |

### Solution

| The CERT/CC is currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem. |
