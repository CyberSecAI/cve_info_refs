The provided content relates to CVE-2001-1308.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The iPlanet Directory Server contains multiple vulnerabilities in its LDAP request processing code. Specifically, issues were found with handling invalid BER length fields and format string vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Buffer overflows:** The server failed multiple tests related to handling invalid BER length fields in LDAP requests. This indicates the presence of buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
*   **Format string vulnerabilities:** The server exhibited suspicious behavior during tests for format string vulnerabilities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary code execution:** A remote attacker can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Directory Server, which typically runs with system privileges.
*   **Denial of service:** The vulnerabilities can be used to launch denial-of-service attacks.
*   **Unauthorized privileged access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized privileged access to the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote exploitation:** The vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely.
*   **LDAP requests:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerabilities by sending crafted LDAP requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server.
*   **LDAP request crafting:** The attacker needs the ability to craft malicious LDAP requests, specifically those with invalid BER length fields or that can trigger format string vulnerabilities.
