## RSA Security ACE/Agent for Windows, ACE/Agent for Windows NT, and ACE/Agent for Windows 2000 do not properly handle null characters in URL

#### Vulnerability Note VU#609840

Original Release Date: 2001-10-19 | Last Revised: 2001-11-01

---

### Overview

RSA Security [ACE/Agent for Windows](http://www.rsa.com/products/securid/techspecs/windows.html), ACE/Agent for Windows NT, and [ACE/Agent for Windows 2000](http://www.rsa.com/products/securid/techspecs/windows2000.html) contain a vulnerability in which the ACE/Agent does not properly handle null characters contained in a URL. A specially crafted request may cause ACE/Agent to enter a debugging mode, possibly disclosing sensitive configuration information about the server.

### Description

| [ProCheckup Ltd](http://www.procheckup.com/) has reported a vulnerability in RSA Security [ACE/Agent for Windows](http://www.rsa.com/products/securid/techspecs/windows.html), ACE/Agent for Windows NT, and [ACE/Agent for Windows 2000](http://www.rsa.com/products/securid/techspecs/windows2000.html). The Windows versions of ACE/Agent can be used to protect resources on Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) web servers. Requests for protected resources are passed from the web server to the ACE/Agent, which is implemented in the file sdiis.dll. The ACE/Agent authenticates the request against an RSA Security [ACE/Server](http://www.rsa.com/products/securid/rsaaceserver.html) using RSA Security [SecurID](http://www.rsa.com/products/securid/) technology. While processing a crafted URL containing an encoded null character, ACE/Agent may crash and return debugging information, which may be useful to an attacker.  RSA Security addressed this issue in July 2001. The following ACE/Agents are not affected:     + RSA ACE/Agent 4.4.3 (or later) for Windows NT + RSA ACE/Agent 1.1.2 (or later) for Windows 2000 + RSA ACE/Agent 5.0 for Windows |

### Impact

| An attacker may be able to cause ACE/Agent to crash, possibly revealing sensitive configuration information about the server. |
| --- |

### Solution

| This vulnerability is fixed in the versions of ACE/Agents specified in the [Vendor Statement](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/AAMN-53LNTF). RSA Security recommends that customers install the latest releases, which are available through RSA Security's SecurCare Online and through RSA Security's public web site. RSA Security informed customers of this vulnerability in a Security Bulletin dated July 24, 2001. |
