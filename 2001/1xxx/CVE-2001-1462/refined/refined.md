  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The RSA Security ACE/Agent for Windows, ACE/Agent for Windows NT, and ACE/Agent for Windows 2000 do not properly handle null characters contained in a URL.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper handling of null characters in URLs within the ACE/Agent software.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can cause the ACE/Agent to crash, potentially revealing sensitive server configuration information.",
  "Attack vectors": "Specially crafted requests containing encoded null characters in the URL.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to a web server protected by a vulnerable version of RSA Security ACE/Agent."
