The provided content relates to CVE-2001-1321.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Oracle Internet Directory server contains multiple vulnerabilities in the code used to process LDAP requests. Specifically, the server failed tests related to invalid encodings of BER OBJECT-IDENTIFIER values and exhibited failures in multiple application components during tests. This indicates underlying issues with how the server handles malformed or unexpected data within LDAP requests.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Buffer overflows
- Format string vulnerabilities

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Oracle server, which typically runs with system privileges.
- Potential denial-of-service attacks and unauthorized privileged access.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending specially crafted LDAP requests to the vulnerable server.
- Exploitation can be done remotely.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to send LDAP requests to the vulnerable Oracle Internet Directory server.
- No specific authentication or prior access seems to be needed for exploitation based on the provided details.
