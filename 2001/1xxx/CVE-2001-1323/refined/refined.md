Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2001-1323

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from buffer overflows in the FTP daemon included with MIT Kerberos 5 (krb5). There are two distinct overflow locations:
    1.  **`ftpglob()` function:** A buffer overflow occurs in code that calls `ftpglob()`, a function responsible for expanding glob characters in pathnames. Although recent versions of `ftpd` should not have overflows *within* `ftpglob()`, the code calling it is vulnerable.
    2.  **`radix_encode()` function:** A lack of bounds-checking in the calling of `radix_encode()` can lead to an overflow.  `radix_encode()` is used for base64 encoding of data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:**  Both vulnerabilities are classic buffer overflows. In the case of `ftpglob()`, the vulnerability lies in how the return value of `ftpglob` is handled by the caller. For `radix_encode()`, the overflow happens because the code doesn't check the length of the data before passing it to `radix_encode()`.
*   **Lack of Bounds Checking:** The core issue with the `radix_encode()` vulnerability is that there is no bounds checking before calling this function.  The code doesn't ensure that the data being encoded won't overflow the destination buffer when base64-encoded.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Root Access (Anonymous FTP):** If anonymous FTP is enabled, a remote attacker can exploit the buffer overflow in `ftpglob` to gain root access on the server.
*   **Local Root Access:** Users with access to local accounts on the server can also leverage the `ftpglob` vulnerability to gain root access.
*   **Remote Root Access (Authenticated):** An attacker who can successfully authenticate to the FTP daemon can exploit the `radix_encode()` vulnerability to gain root access, regardless of whether anonymous FTP is enabled.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **`ftpglob()` Overflow:** Triggered through manipulating pathnames containing glob characters via FTP commands. Specifically, the vulnerability is present when the FTP server expands tilde (`~`) characters in path names.
*   **`radix_encode()` Overflow:** Triggered by sending data that, after being processed by `radix_encode` for base64 encoding, results in an overflow. This can be done by sending specific commands with specific data that will cause the function to write beyond the buffer's boundaries.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Anonymous FTP enabled (ftpglob):** No prior authentication is required.
*   **Local user access (ftpglob):** An attacker needs an account on the system.
*   **Valid FTP authentication (radix_encode):** The attacker needs to have valid credentials to log into the FTP server, but does not necessarily need any special access to local files or accounts on the system itself.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is described as "somewhat difficult to exploit," particularly the `radix_encode()` overflow, due to the need to inject data that base64-encodes to the desired machine code and target address.
*   Patches are provided against `krb5-1.2.2` which address these issues. These patches may also be applicable to older versions.

**Mitigation:**

*   Apply the provided patches.
*   Disable anonymous FTP access as a workaround until patching is possible.

This vulnerability allows for remote and local attackers to gain root access through the ftpd service included with MIT Kerberos 5.  The primary attack vector is via crafted inputs to the ftpglob function and specifically crafted inputs that will cause a buffer overflow during base64 encoding. The patches address these vulnerabilities by adding checks for length limits and by adding proper handling of the ftpglob return values.
