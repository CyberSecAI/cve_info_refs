## Advanced Poll does not adequately authenticate users

#### Vulnerability Note VU#140723

Original Release Date: 2001-12-20 | Last Revised: 2001-12-21

---

### Overview

Advanced Poll is a polling system written in PHP for use on web sites. When a flat file database is used, Advanced Poll does not adequately authenticate users, thereby allowing any user to gain Advanced Poll administrative privileges.

### Description

| On versions of Advanced Poll older than 1.61 configured to use a flat file database, Advanced Poll allows clients to login as any user by setting the "logged\_in" variable in the CGI query string of the GET request to Advanced Poll. |
| --- |

### Impact

| Attackers may login as the administrative user without authentication and gain adminstrator privileges for Advanced Poll. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Upgrade to version 1.61 or later at:  <http://www.proxy2.de> |
| --- |

| None. |
