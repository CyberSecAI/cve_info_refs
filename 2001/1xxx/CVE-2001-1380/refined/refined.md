Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in how OpenSSH parses and applies source IP-based access control restrictions ("from=" option) in the `authorized_keys2` file when multiple keys of different types (e.g., RSA and DSA) are present.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Incorrect Option Application:** When a source IP restricted key (e.g., DSA) is immediately followed by a key of a different type (e.g., RSA), the `from=` restriction of the second key is applied to both keys. This means the restriction from the second key overwrites the restriction from the first key.
- **Type Mismatch Handling:** The `key_read` function incorrectly handles type mismatches by returning `-1` instead of `0`, causing the `from=` option of the second key to incorrectly be applied to the first key.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Bypassing Access Control:** Attackers with a compromised key can circumvent IP-based access control policies and log in from unauthorized source IP addresses.
- **Privilege Escalation (in specific setups):** If a system administrator manages `authorized_keys2` via a single world-readable file, users could bypass restrictions by exploiting the vulnerability with their own keys.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Compromised Key:** The attacker needs a compromised private key corresponding to a public key present in the `authorized_keys2` file.
- **Specific Key Order:** The vulnerability is triggered when a key with an IP restriction is immediately followed by a key of a different type in the `authorized_keys2` file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to a compromised key:** The attacker must have obtained a key that is authorized for access, and is subject to the vulnerable conditions.
- **Knowledge of `authorized_keys2` structure:** The attacker must be able to identify keys with differing types in the `authorized_keys2` file, with a source IP restricted key immediately preceding a key of a different type.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects OpenSSH versions between 2.5.x and 2.9.x.
- The vulnerability is fixed in OpenSSH 2.9.9.
- The provided patch fixes the incorrect type mismatch handling in the `key_read` function.
- The vulnerability was discovered by the OpenSSH team.
- Several vendors were affected, including Conectiva, Immunix, MandrakeSoft, Red Hat, and Trustix.
