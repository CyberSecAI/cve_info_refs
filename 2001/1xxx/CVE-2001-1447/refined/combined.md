## Mac OS X executes 'recent items' with privileges of foreground application

#### Vulnerability Note VU#945747

Original Release Date: 2001-11-05 | Last Revised: 2001-11-05

---

### Overview

The "recent items" feature of [MacOS X](http://www.apple.com/macosx/) allows users at the console to trivially obtain root privileges.

### Description

| [MacOS X](http://www.apple.com/macosx) includes a feature called *recent items*. *Recent Items* is a list of documents and applications that have recently been accessed. An application launched from the *Recent Items* list runs with the privileges of the foreground application, not the privilege of the console user. This enables a trivial exploit to gain root access from the console. |
| --- |

### Impact

| Attackers with access to the console (i.e. logged in at the desktop, not remotely) can gain root access. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Use the Software Update feature of MacOS X to install the security update dated 10-19-2001. |
