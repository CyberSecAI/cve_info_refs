    "root_cause": "PHP's default behavior of storing variables passed from the URL in a global context, combined with programmers failing to sanitize these inputs or use proper coding practices.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use of global variables to store sensitive data",
      "Failure to sanitize user-supplied input",
       "Lack of proper input validation",
      "Insecure default PHP configuration"

      "Crafted URLs to modify global variables"
