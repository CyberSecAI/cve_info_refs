The provided content describes a vulnerability related to how PHP handles variables passed from the browser, which can lead to security issues if not properly managed by developers. This aligns with the general type of vulnerability that CVE-2001-1236 might represent, though a specific CVE description is not provided for verification.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The root cause is the default behavior of PHP to store variables passed through the URL (or client) in the global context. This behavior, combined with poor coding practices by developers who don't sanitize or validate these inputs, leads to vulnerabilities.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   **Global variable manipulation:** The primary weakness is that by default, PHP allows external manipulation of global variables through URL parameters.
    *   **Lack of input validation:** Developers often fail to properly sanitize or validate input parameters, including global variables, making the applications vulnerable to manipulation.
    *   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** A specific vulnerability occurs when a global variable used to specify the path for included files is not properly managed. By altering this global variable, an attacker can force the webserver to include and execute code from a remote location (RFI).

*   **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   **Administrative access:** Exploiting these vulnerabilities can allow intruders to gain administrative access to the application or server.
    *   **Data manipulation:** Attackers can manipulate sensitive data stored in global variables.
    *   **Arbitrary code execution:** The most severe impact is the ability to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server, especially through remote file inclusion. This can lead to complete system compromise.

*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   **Crafted URLs:** The primary attack vector involves crafting malicious URLs with parameters designed to overwrite sensitive global variables.
    *  **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** By manipulating variables related to file inclusion, remote code can be injected and executed on the server.

*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   **Basic web access:** Attackers only need the ability to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
    *   **Understanding of the application's use of global variables:** To exploit the vulnerability effectively, the attacker needs to know which variables are being used and how they are being used by the vulnerable PHP application.

The document provides specific examples of how the vulnerability can be exploited, particularly the RFI scenario, and also lists multiple affected vendors with references to affected products. It also provides solutions such as disabling global variables from the URL, setting `variables_order` in `php.ini` and setting the value of every global variable in every file that uses the global variable.
