| | |  | **Winsock RSHD/NT** is a Remote Shell Daemon for Windows NT, 2000, and XP. It services the standard **rsh** and **rcp** commands.  It runs as a Windows Service and will work only under Windows NT, 2000, XP, or 2003. For a version that runs on Windows 95/98/ME, see [Winsock RSHD/95](http://www.denicomp.com/rshd95.htm).  The **rsh** command allows you to remotely execute programs on the system running Winsock RSHD/NT from another system over a TCP/IP connection.  The standard output and standard error output of the program executed is returned to the rsh command, if the program executed is a Win32 console application (and some DOS applications).  Note: On some systems, the **rsh** command is named **remsh** or **rcmd**.  The **rcp** command allows you to copy files over a TCP/IP connection to and from the system running RSHD/NT.  The **rcp** command works much like the Unix **cp** or DOS **COPY** command, except that either the source or destination may be another system running a Remote Shell Daemon that supports **rcp**, such as Winsock RSHD/NT.  Unlike **rexec**, the **rsh** command does not require you to specify a password for each command.  Instead, security is enforced through *host equivalency*, meaning that you can specify that user "A" on "host1" is equivalent to user "A" on "host2" and no password is necessary for that user.  Winsock RSHD/NT does **not** include the **rsh** and **rcp** commands - it is the ***server*** side of those commands.  Unix, Windows NT, 2000, XP, and 2003 includes a native implementation of the **rsh** and **rcp** commands, but Windows 95/98/ME does not.  If you need these commands, check into our  [Winsock RCP/RSH/REXEC](rcprsh.htm) product.   ---   **Pricing**   | Single License | $44.95 | | --- | --- | | Multiple Licenses    Example: 5 x $40 = $200 | $40.00 each | | Site License  Unlimited use - single location within a company or organization\* | $600.00 each | | Corporate License  Usage at multiple locations within a company or organization\*, up to 500 systems | $1500.00 each | | Enterprise License  Unlimited usage at multiple locations within a company or organization\* | Contact for pricing: sales@denicomp.com |   \* - A "*company or organization*" is a singular legal entity trading under a single name, or other organization, or agency of government, or department of government, operating under a single name.
