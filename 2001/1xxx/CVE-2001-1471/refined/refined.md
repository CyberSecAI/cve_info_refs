{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Improper input validation of language settings in phpBB. The application fails to validate if a specified language file exists before using it, leading to the execution of arbitrary PHP code.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient input validation",
      "Use of eval() with unsanitized input"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary PHP code and gain a shell with the privileges of the web server.",
    "attack_vectors": "A specially crafted URL is used to specify a non-existent language file, and then set variables that would normally be set by the language file, which are then processed by eval().",
   "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL that specifies a non-existent language file and then include malicious PHP code in the URL."
