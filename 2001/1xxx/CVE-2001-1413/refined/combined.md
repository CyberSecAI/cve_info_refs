| [Description](#c0)  Matt Beland    2002-02-12 00:04:09 UTC  ``` During the initial bootstrap, Gentoo downloads the packages for various applications (including glibc, gcc, binutils, gettext, etc.) using a "generic" make.conf rather than the customized make.conf created by the user. As was illustrated during the recent ibiblio outage, this means that the use of mirrors is impossible during initial installations. While a minor annoyance for single-system installations affected by rare outages, it could be a substantial problem for larger installations intending to run installations from a local mirror.  Suggested fix: Download the packages required for bootstrap.sh before switching the custom make.conf for the generic one. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Daniel Robbins (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-02-12 17:49:38 UTC  ``` This should now be fixed. ``` |  |

## ncompress vulnerable to buffer overflow via long filename

#### Vulnerability Note VU#176363

Original Release Date: 2002-08-01 | Last Revised: 2002-08-10

---

### Overview

Some versions of ncompress contain a buffer-overflow vulnerability.

### Description

| Versions 4.2.4 and earlier of ncompress do not properly handle filenames longer than 1023 characters. |
| --- |

### Impact

| By supplying long filenames to ncompress, an attacker may be able to gain local access to the server or force ncompress to execute arbitrary code. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Obtain a patch from your vendor. |
| --- |

| Remove ncompress or remove execute permissions. |
| --- |

# ncompress: Buffer overflow — GLSA **200410-08**

compress and uncompress, which could be used by daemon programs, contain a
buffer overflow that could lead to remote execution of arbitrary code with
the rights of the daemon process.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-arch/ncompress** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **4.2.4** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.2.4-r1** |

### Background

ncompress is a utility handling compression and decompression of
Lempel-Ziv archives, compatible with the original \*nix compress and
uncompress utilities (.Z extensions).

### Description

compress and uncompress do not properly check bounds on command line
options, including the filename. Large parameters would trigger a
buffer overflow.

### Impact

By supplying a carefully crafted filename or other option, an attacker
could execute arbitrary code on the system. A local attacker could only
execute code with his own rights, but since compress and uncompress are
called by various daemon programs, this might also allow a remote
attacker to execute code with the rights of the daemon making use of
ncompress.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All ncompress users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge sync

 # emerge -pv ">=app-arch/ncompress-4.2.4-r1"
 # emerge ">=app-arch/ncompress-4.2.4-r1"
```

But... you still some how need to change the EIP to execute arbitrary
code (injected or existing).

I did a simple "biggrep" of a simple "unction [Pp]ointer" pattern on the
Glibc 2.1.92 and found some hints about atexit and malloc hooks and a
few other interesting spots.

Of course, there are more...
