      "source": "www.kb.cert.org_86da84ad_20250126_113616.html",
      "root_cause": "Versions 4.2.4 and earlier of ncompress do not properly handle filenames longer than 1023 characters.",
      "vulnerability": "Buffer overflow",
      "impact": "An attacker may be able to gain local access to the server or force ncompress to execute arbitrary code.",
      "attack_vector": "Supplying long filenames to ncompress.",
        "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to supply a long filename to the ncompress utility. This could be a local attacker or a remote attacker if ncompress is used by a daemon."

        "cve_id": "CVE-2001-1413",
        "source": "security.gentoo.org_3cd35bad_20250125_200712.html",
        "root_cause": "compress and uncompress do not properly check bounds on command line options, including the filename. Large parameters would trigger a buffer overflow.",
        "vulnerability": "Buffer overflow",
         "impact": "An attacker could execute arbitrary code on the system. A local attacker could only execute code with his own rights, but since compress and uncompress are called by various daemon programs, this might also allow a remote attacker to execute code with the rights of the daemon making use of ncompress.",
        "attack_vector": "Supplying a carefully crafted filename or other option.",
          "attacker_capabilities": "A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability with his own rights. A remote attacker can execute code with the rights of the daemon making use of ncompress."
