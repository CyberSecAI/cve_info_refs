The provided content describes a vulnerability where SSH host key authentication can be bypassed when DNS is used to resolve "localhost". This vulnerability is assigned VU#786900 and is related to CVE-2001-1474.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
SSH disables host key checking when connecting to localhost for compatibility with NFS filesystems.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper handling of localhost resolution
- Reliance on DNS for localhost resolution
- Disabled host key checking when connecting to localhost

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can redirect a victim's SSH connection to an arbitrary host by poisoning the victim's DNS server. This allows the attacker to potentially gain unauthorized access to the victim's system or perform malicious actions on the redirected host.

**Attack vectors:**
- DNS poisoning or manipulation
- Interception of DNS traffic

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to manipulate or poison the victim's DNS server.
