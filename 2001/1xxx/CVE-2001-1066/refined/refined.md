- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Netscape 6.01a installer for Solaris creates a temporary file `/tmp/admin.$$` with insecure permissions (mode 644).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure temporary file creation. The temporary file, meant to store pkgadd and pkgrm commands, is created with read permissions for all users.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious local user can overwrite the `/tmp/admin.$$` file, potentially injecting malicious commands that would be executed by the installer with root privileges, leading to privilege escalation and arbitrary code execution. This could allow the malicious user to modify or delete system files or install other malicious software.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local. A malicious user on the system can exploit this during the installation process when the installer runs with root privileges.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be a local user on the system with the ability to create files in the `/tmp` directory. They must also have knowledge of the installation process and timing to manipulate the file before the installer executes it.
