## Beck GmbH IPC@Chip TelnetD vulnerable to brute-force password attack

#### Vulnerability Note VU#198979

Original Release Date: 2001-09-26 | Last Revised: 2002-12-18

---

### Overview

There is a vulnerability in the [Beck IPC@CHIP](http://www.bcl-online.de/mproducts/products.asp?id=1&status=de_products) that may allow an attacker to gain access to the device.

### Description

| The Beck IPC@CHIP is a [single chip embedded webserver](http://www.bcl-online.de/mproducts/lp1.asp?status=en_products). This device contains a telnet server that "leaks information". That is, when an attacker connects to the telnet daemon and enters a valid username, the telnet daemon will prompt the user with "Password". However, if the attacker supplies the telnet daemon with an invalid account name, the device will respond with "User Unknown". Additionally, the telnet daemon permits unlimited login attempts and it isn't counting or logging any bad passwords. Given this, an attacker could make use of a brute-force password attack and gain entry to the device. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker can connect to the telnet service and make use of a brute-force password attack and perhaps gain entry to the device. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Obtain a patch from the vendor. |
