Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in the context of CVE-2001-1403:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of this vulnerability is the use of the HTTP GET method for submitting login credentials in Bugzilla. This resulted in the username and password being included in the URL, which is visible in the browser's address bar, browser history, and potentially in web server logs. Additionally, the password was also being exposed in the HTML of certain pages like the mid-air collision page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Exposure of Credentials in URL:** The primary weakness is sending sensitive information (username and password) as part of the URL, which is easily exposed.
*   **Exposure of Credentials in HTML:** The password was present in the HTML source of the mid-air collision page, further increasing the attack surface.
*   **Lack of Secure Transmission:** The use of GET method for sensitive data does not provide the security guarantees of the POST method, especially when not using HTTPS, which could lead to man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Credential Theft:** Attackers (such as someone shoulder surfing or accessing browser history or logs) could easily steal the user's login credentials, potentially gaining access to their Bugzilla account and possibly other accounts using the same password.
*  **Compromised Data:** By logging into the victim's account the attacker could access or modify private data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Shoulder Surfing:** An attacker could simply look at the victim's screen when they log in to Bugzilla.
*   **Browser History:** An attacker with access to the victim's computer could view the browser's history and extract the credentials from the URL.
*   **Web Server Logs:** The password could be recorded in web server logs, which could then be accessed by an attacker.
*   **Mid-air collision:** Password exposed in the HTML.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Proximity to Victim's Screen:** For shoulder surfing attacks, physical proximity is required.
*   **Access to Victim's Computer or Server Logs:** For other attacks, the attacker would need access to the victim's computer or the server logs.

**Mitigation:**

The vulnerability was resolved by switching to the HTTP POST method for login forms which does not embed the login credentials into the URL, along with removing passwords from the HTML source, preventing the password from being visible in the location bar, server logs, and HTML source.

**Additional Details:**
The bug report also discussed the option of MD5 hashing the password, but was rejected due to compatibility issues with LDAP, and that hashing would not prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.  The discussion also included some users who wanted to be able to bookmark URLs that included their password, which was ultimately rejected in favor of security. The fix involved commenting out the code that would switch to the GET method, forcing the use of POST.

The advisory also notes that there were other serious security issues in Bugzilla prior to version 2.14 including unauthorized access to confidential bugs and untrusted parameters not being checked.

The information provided in the bug report and advisory is more detailed than the generic CVE description, providing a good understanding of the vulnerability, its impact, and the steps taken to fix it.
