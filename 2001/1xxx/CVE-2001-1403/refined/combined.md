If you enter bugzilla the first time and enter your account information, it is
displayed in the location-bar during the rest of the bugzilla-session.
While my Bugzilla-account isn't exactly critical, i use my standard-password
here, so people standing next to me could easily see the password and use it for
various of my accounts.

suggested solution: use POST instead of GET for forms involving the bugzilla
password.

I would like to vote AGAINST using an MD5 hash as a way to obscure the password
in the URL. An MD5 hash is only effective if the application (internally) has
access to the real password to create a hash to compare against (eg. by getting
it from the MySQL database). However, LDAP users would then be toast as many
LDAP servers do not allow the application to query the real password; you
provide it with a username and password, and it tells you whether it is
correct. An MD5 scheme would not work for LDAP users.
Jesse's suggestion to use POST seems to be a much better solution.

Changing the operation to post is trivial, and prevents the password from
appearing in the location bar and the web server log.
To change it:
In CGI.pl, remove lines 845-847 ( the 3 lines after 'my method = "POST"' )

Dupe [bug #56375](/show_bug.cgi?id=56375 "VERIFIED DUPLICATE - Password appears in location bar") has a variety of suggestions - basically we could support POST
and GET, POST as the default and later drop GET when feasible.

Well, from hacking on Bugzilla, it appears that once the user has been
authenticated and issued a cookie, Bugzilla should never again need their
password. That it then gets pasted in to GET URLs I figger to be an accident
from maybe just taking all existing form values and sticking them in there.
I'll go poke at this a little and see if this may just be a simple patch against
Bugzilla 2.x.

Taking all Bugzilla 3.0 bugs -- congratulations to MattyT for the triage, it
really was spot on. Note: I may end up pushing some of these bugs back to 3.2,
we'll see. However, I believe all these bugs should just fall out of the
redesign. Let's hope I'm right!

My thoughts on this: (sorry timeless) As a security administrator for my local
network, I strongly \*dislike\* the ability to bookmark an authenticated login.
Maybe this isn't a big issue if your computer is secure, but that would mean that
anyone else could walk up to your computer and pretend to be you. :-)
The one thing that I don't like about this is that it is a cool thing to be able
to bookmark various other URLs in Bugzilla, which you can't do if a POST is used.
I'm thinking to perhaps add a "redirect.cgi" which will process a POSTed login,
then redirect to the original URL via GET (so the parameters are visible) except
that the bugzilla\_login and bugzilla\_password items are removed from the query.
This will break Bugzilla for anyone who has cookies turned off though. A
possible way around that is, if the original query was generated by a GET, add a
checkbox to the login screen for "keep my query visible in the address bar",
which would default to checked if there are any Bugzilla cookies present at all
(previous query lists, prefered sort order, whatever, just so we know cookies are
turned on). People without cookies would have to leave that unchecked, then it
would use POST to finish the query and they wouldn't be able to bookmark it, but
that's a tradeoff for not using cookies.

Go to CGI.pl and edit the "confirm\_login" subroutine.Go to:my $method = "POST";This is line 882 in our locally-hacked version.Comment out the next three lines:# if (defined $ENV{"REQUEST\_METHOD"} && length($::buffer) > 1) {# $method = $ENV{"REQUEST\_METHOD"};# }The default is POST. The lines I comment out here only disable the parent CGI's inclination to override POST, but you never want GET if the transaction involves passwords.If my understanding is correct, this ONLY applies to the case where you are logging in. If you want to bookmark a GET CGI, then log in first, and THEN run your query.Things seem to work right here, except my Konquerer web browser may have some bugs wrt deleting cookies. Can others try this fix, and if it passes muster, it can be committed to 2.x.

It seems that timeless shouldn't need to have a bookmark with his password since
the cookie will keep him logged in? Since we now have saved searches and such
it seems that there is little reason to use GET. As long as a get url will
still pull up the right page (so we can reference bugs by URLS on the newsgroup
and such) it should be ok.
Suggestion, each bug has a line somewhere, 'url to referene: bugzilla\_url\_here'
so that people can copy the URL into email and such.

timeless (that's me) has two bugzilla accounts. And also occasionally lives
behind a rotating transparent proxy.
Between these to facts, i can't rely on or even use the cookie, because it
either (a) invalidates or (b) gives me the wrong user state.
Do i actually use something like this? yes ie keeps very few history states
because i don't use it, but among them are urls to login as me or my alter
state.

BTW, there's no reason to make putting the login and password in the URL query
field stop working. We just won't use it from the login screen. If the user
then wants to take a query URL and insert the parms for the login\_name and
password into it, reload, then bookmark it, that would work just fine, I'd think.

>BTW, there's no reason to make putting the login and password in the URL query
>field stop working.
I wouldn't say there was no reason. There are two security issues here: the
security of the user and the security of the system. Fixing this bug in a way
that allows users to continue to use URLs containing their usernames and
passwords resolves the first issue (because by intentionally altering URLs users
are accepting potential compromises), but it doesn't resolve the second issue,
since it leaves the system vulnerable to those compromises.
Given that in this case very few users are likely to hack their URLs, it
probably isn't a big deal, but Matty's suggestion of dropping GET support after
an interim period of supporting both methods seems like the best approach.

SSL encrypts all data beyond the key used to encrypt the message. The public
key itself is sent in the clear (it has to be ), but the data portion of the
packet is completely encrypted. So advising people to run Bugzilla in SSL
would be sufficient to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. However, without
SSL even putting the password in a POST is vulnerable.
The real issue here is the "co-worker looking over the shoulder" fear.

Uhhhh, no.URLs are frequently stored in browser-side caches. POST form data is less likely to get such royal treatment. Storing passwords on the filesystem, particularly within the context of a web browser, is a bad idea - there are then plenty of chances for another to read the password from the file, from permissive file permissions on a multi-user machine, to memory buffer overflow explouts.All the SSL in the world isn't going to save you from bad security practice.Any way, the fix I proposed earlier on this bug addresses this problem to my satisfaction in my environment, so I'll remove myself from the CC list now. :)

The patch I just attached simply comments out the check to see what request
method the calling page was using, thus the default of POST is always used.
If you need to bookmark something and have cookies off, bookmark it from the
screen asking you to log in. It should still get you there after logging in.

v3 looks good (I can't verify that the username and password doesn't show up in
the HTML becase my IE install doesn't seem to want to View Source at all and
Mozilla seems to re-request the page rather than show my the source as it
appears in the active window, but The code for not printing it looks good).

Subject:    Security Advisory for Bugzilla v2.13 and older
From:       [David Miller <justdave () syndicomm ! com>](?a=99912907200004&r=1&w=2)
Date:       [2001-08-29 22:55:42](?l=bugtraq&r=1&w=2&b=200108)
[Download RAW [message](?l=bugtraq&m=99912899900567&q=mbox) or [body](?l=bugtraq&m=99912899900567&q=raw)]

All users of Bugzilla, the bug-tracking system from mozilla.org, are
strongly recommended to update to version 2.14.

Bugzilla 2.14 is a general security update, but not all of the security
issues are serious.

Serious issues include:

    * Multiple instances where data on "confidential" bugs could be
      obtained by valid users of the system who are not authorized to.
    * Multiple instances of security holes where parameters were not being
      checked/escaped properly.

There are many patches that need to be applied to properly close these
holes, so they are not included here.  If you will not be upgrading your
system to 2.14 and instead wish to apply these patches to your existing
system, please consult the bug reports on bugzilla.mozilla.org for the bug
numbers listed below, where you can obtain the patches attached to those
bugs.

Complete bug reports for all bugs can be obtained by visiting the
following URL:  <http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=XXXXX>
where you replace the XXXXX at the end of the URL with a bug number as
listed below.  You may also enter the bug numbers in the "enter a bug#" box
on the main page at <http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/> or in the footer of any
other page on bugzilla.mozilla.org.

*** SECURITY ISSUES RESOLVED ***

- Multiple instances of unauthorized access to confidential
  bugs has been fixed.
  (bug 39524, 39526, 39527, 39531, 39533, 70189, 82781)
- Multiple instances of untrusted parameters not being
  checked/escaped was fixed.  These included definite security
  holes.
  (bug 38854, 38855, 38859, 39536, 87701, 95235)
- After logging in passwords no longer appear in the URL.
  (bug 15980)
- Procedures to prevent unauthorized access to confidential
  files are now simpler.  In particular the shadow directory
  no longer exists and the data/comments file no longer needs
  to be directly accessible, so the entire data directory can
  be blocked.  However, no changes are required here if you
  have a properly secured 2.12 installation as no new files
  must be protected.
  (bug 71552, 73191)
- If they do not already exist, checksetup.pl will attempt to
  write Apache .htaccess files by default, to prevent
  unauthoried access to confidential files.  You can turn this
  off in the localconfig file.
  (bug 76154)
- Sanity check can now only be run by people in the 'editbugs'
  group.  Although it would be better to have a separate
  group, this is not possible until the limitation on the
  number of groups allowed has been removed.
  (bug 54556)
- The password is no longer stored in plaintext form.  It will
  be eradicated next time you run checksetup.pl.  A user must
  now change their password via a password change request that
  gets validated at their e-mail account, rather than have it
  mailed to them.
  (bug 74032)
- When you using product groups and you move a bug between
  products (single or mass change), the bug will no longer be
  restricted to the old product's group (if it was) and will
  be restricted to the new product's group.
  (bug 66235)
- There are now options on a bug to choose whether the
  reporter, assignee, QA and CCs can access a bug even if
  they aren't in groups the bug it is restricted to.
  (bug 39816)
- You can no longer mark a bug as a duplicate of a bug you
  can't see, and if you mark a bug a duplicate of a bug
  the reporter cannot see you will be given options as to
  what to do regarding adding the reporter of the resolved
  bug to the CC of the open bug.
  (bug 96085)

> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.
