This in itself is not an issue due to the lack of a suid bit... however
if I remember correctly there were a few linux suid root binaries that
were reliant
upon m4 in some way or another thus making them vulnerable to a local
root expoit. This is on osx 10.1.

-r-xr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  26696 Sep  2 20:59 /usr/bin/m4
[OSXBOX:~] elguapo% ls -al `which gm4`
-rwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  97464 Sep  2 20:53 /usr/bin/gm4
[OSXBOX:~] elguapo% m4 %p
m4: %p: No such file or directory
[OSXBOX:~] elguapo% gm4 %p
gm4: 0x4f4d453d: No such file or directory
[OSXBOX:~] elguapo% gm4 %s
gm4: Memory bounds violation detected (SIGSEGV).  Either a stack overflow
occurred, or there is a bug in gm4.  Check for possible infinite
recursion.
