## Compaq Tru64 Unix inetd vulnerable to DoS

#### Vulnerability Note VU#880624

Original Release Date: 2001-12-12 | Last Revised: 2002-01-31

---

### Overview

The inetd service on Compaq's Tru64 UNIX is vulnerable to a denial-of-service.

### Description

| The inetd service on Compaq's Tru64 UNIX V5.1 (all patch levels) is vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack in which inetd will stop accepting new connections. In turn, this would disrupt the normal operation of any service that is started from inetd. Quoting from Compaq's advisory:  *A potential security vulnerability has been discovered for Tru64 UNIX V5.1, where under certain circumstances, there is a problem with the inetd Internet services daemon that can cause it to stop accepting connections. This causes all services handled by inetd to be inaccessible including ftp, telnet, rsh, rlogin, rexec, pop3, imap, radius, etc..*An intruder may be able to exploit this vulnerability by interrupting other services. Again quoting from Compaq: *The inetd may stop responding to requests if one of its services cores as it is being started.* |
| --- |

### Impact

| An intruder may be able to interrupt services started from inetd, such as ftp, telnet, rsh, etc. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Apply the latest aggregate patch kits for Compaq Ttru64 Unix. If that is not possible, obtain a patch through your normal Compaq Services support channel using the reference SSRT0708U. |

  TITLE:  Potential denial of Service in inetd Tru64 V5.1 Only
                (Compaq Case ID: SSRT0708U)

   Date:  23-FEB-2000

  "Compaq is broadly distributing this Security Advisory in order
  to bring to the attention of users of Compaq products the
  important security information contained in this Advisory.
  Compaq recommends that all users determine the applicability of
  this information to their individual situations and take
  appropriate action.

  Compaq does not warrant that this information is necessarily
  accurate or complete for all user situations and, consequently,
  Compaq will not be responsible for any damages resulting from
  user's use or disregard of the information provided in this
  Advisory."

  IMPACT:

  Versions Affected:
   Compaq's Tru64 UNIX  V5.1 ONLY (all patch levels)

   A potential security vulnerability has been discovered for
   Tru64 UNIX V5.1, where under certain circumstances, there
   is a problem with the inetd Internet services daemon that can
   cause it to stop accepting connections.   This causes all
   services handled by inetd to be inaccessible including ftp,
   telnet, rsh, rlogin, rexec, pop3, imap,  radius, etc..

  SEVERITY: Medium

  PROBLEM STATEMENT:

   This problem exists in Tru64 UNIX 5.1 inetd only. The
   /usr/sbin/inetd is the master daemon for many services.
   The inetd may stop responding to requests if one of its
   services cores as it is being started. Inetd continues to run.
   The netstat -An command may indicate many outstanding
   connections to the same PCB.

   If you are installing Open Source Internet Solutions on Tru64 UNIX
   Version 5.1, it is strongly urged that you install this patch kit.

   If you are installing Open Source Internet Solutions
   on a Tru64 UNIX Version 5.1 TruCluster system, you must
   install this patch kit prior to installing Open Source
   Internet Solutions  because without it inetd failure during
   this procedure will cause an installation failure since it will
   interfere with intra-cluster communications.

  SOLUTION:

  Compaq Tru64 UNIX engineering has provided a fix for this potential
  problem for Tru64 UNIX V5.1

  We apologize that this fix is not available from our patch site. If
  you determine that you need this fix please contact your
  normal Compaq  Services support channel and  request a
  patch using the reference SSRT0708U.

  This solution will be included in future releases of Tru64 UNIX
  V5.1 aggregate patch kits.

  management and security procedures.  Compaq will continue to
  review and enhance the security features of its products and work
