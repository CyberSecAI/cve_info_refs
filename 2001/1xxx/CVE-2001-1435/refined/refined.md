Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:**

*   **Root Cause:** The `inetd` service on Compaq Tru64 UNIX V5.1 may stop accepting new connections if one of the services it manages crashes during startup. This issue exists in Tru64 UNIX 5.1 inetd only.

*   **Weaknesses:** The `inetd` daemon does not properly handle service crashes during start-up, leading to a denial of service by not accepting new connections. This behavior is triggered when a service managed by `inetd` "cores" (crashes/aborts).

*   **Impact:**  The primary impact is a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. When `inetd` stops accepting new connections, all services it manages (like ftp, telnet, rsh, rlogin, rexec, pop3, imap, and radius) become inaccessible. This disrupts normal network service operations. The system remains running, but the services provided by `inetd` are unavailable. `netstat` might show many outstanding connections to the same PCB.

*   **Attack Vector:** The vulnerability can be exploited by causing a service managed by `inetd` to crash while it is being started. The provided information does not clarify the method to crash the service, only that such a crash will cause the `inetd` to stop responding to requests.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be able to trigger the failure/crash of one of the services managed by `inetd` during startup. The attacker might also need to have some network connectivity to trigger the service startup by making a network request, or an understanding of how to crash a specific service. The exact exploit details are not provided, but the attacker needs a mechanism to cause a service to core.

**Additional Details:**
* The vulnerability affects only Tru64 UNIX V5.1 (all patch levels).
* A fix is available through Compaq support channels, referencing SSRT0708U.
* The provided advisory indicates that the fix is not available on the public patch site and requires contacting Compaq support. The fix was planned to be included in future aggregate patch kits.
* The severity is rated as medium by Compaq.
* The issue can interfere with intra-cluster communications in Tru64 UNIX V5.1 TruCluster systems during the installation of Open Source Internet Solutions.
