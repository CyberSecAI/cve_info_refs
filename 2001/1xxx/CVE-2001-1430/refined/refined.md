{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Cayman gateways ship with null passwords for both admin and user accounts.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Weak authentication and access control policies.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Unauthorized access, unauthorized monitoring, information leakage, denial of service, and permanent disability of affected devices. Specifically, an attacker could configure and save settings on the gateway with admin access, or view settings with user access.",
  "Attack vectors": "TELNET, HTTP, and FTP.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be on the LAN side of the gateway, as the passwords can only be set from the LAN side if the device is not reachable via WAN."
