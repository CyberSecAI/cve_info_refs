{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Lotus Domino R5 servers do not adequately ensure that generated pages are properly encoded to prevent unintended execution of scripts, and when input is not validated to prevent malicious HTML from being presented to the user.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-site scripting (XSS). The server includes user-supplied input in a dynamically generated error page without proper sanitization or encoding.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious scripts or HTML into the web page, which will execute in the victim's browser with the privileges of the legitimate website. This can be used to steal sensitive data like passwords and credit card numbers.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker crafts a malicious URL that includes a script in a request for a non-existent page on the vulnerable server. The server then includes this script in the 404 error page, which is sent to the victim's browser.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs and have a victim click them or otherwise have their browser request the URL. They do not need any special access to the server."
