# Silly 'script' hardlink bug

---

*From*: Marco van Berkum <m.v.berkum () obit nl>

*Date*: Thu, 13 Dec 2001 00:02:36 +0100

Hi,
I found this, small bug, you might like it :)
tested on a slackware linux.

/*
-------------------------------------------------------
Title: Silly hardlink vulnerability in 'script' command
Software Author: yet unknown
Bug found by: Marco van Berkum (m.v.berkum () obit nl)
Date: 12-12-2001
Priority: low
-------------------------------------------------------

Script command
--------------
The script command which is part of the util-linux
package contains a silly hardlink vulnerability which
could overwrite any file on the harddisk. Script is a
tool to save terminal sessions for later reference.
By default script creates a file called typescript
for its log.

The problem
-----------
Very simple, script (when executed as root) overwrites
hardlinks that could be set by any user to any file on
the harddisk. For instance, a malicious user can place
a hardlink 'typescript' to /etc/passwd (or any other file)
in his home directory. If the root user would execute
script in that directory it would cause script to
overwrite that file. Script does check for symlinks and
asks if the symlink should be overwritten, it lacks
checking hardlinks.

Priority
--------
Low, its not likely that root users execute script
in a user's home directory. They could though, its
a minor problem that must be fixed for that reason.

Author
------
Still looking for the correct person

*/

just my 2 cents,
Marco van Berkum

util-linux and mount security update (RHSA-2005-782)

Original Release Date: January 16, 2006

Last Revised: January 16, 2006

Number: ASA-2006-014

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 1.0

Advisory Status: Interim

---

## 1. Overview:

The util-linux package contains a large variety of low-level system
utilities that are necessary for a Linux system to function.

The mount package contains the mount, umount, swapon and swapoff
programs.

A bug was found in the way the umount command is executed by normal
users.
It may be possible for a user to gain elevated privileges if the user is
able to execute the "umount -r" command on a mounted file system. The
file system will be re-mounted only with the "readonly" flag set,
clearing
flags such as "nosuid" and "noexec". The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CAN-200
5-2876](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-2876) to
this issue.

This update also fixes a hardlink bug in the script command for Red
Hat
Enterprise Linux 2.1. If a local user places a hard linked file named
"typescript" in a directory they have write access to, the file will be
overwritten if the user running script has write permissions to the
destination file. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CAN-200
1-1494](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2001-1494) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the
security advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating
systems. Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the
underlying operating system or applications that come with the operating
system. These vulnerabilities often do not impact the software-only
product directly but may threaten the integrity of the underlying
platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not
affected by the vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform
may be. Customers should determine on which Linux operating system the
product was installed and then follow that vendors guidance:

## 4. Software-Only Products:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Interactive Response(IR) | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected packages may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IR application. The IR application does not require the software described in this advisory. |
| CVLAN | all | Low | See recommended actions below. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite(IMS) | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected packages may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. The IMS application does not require the software described in this advisory. |

**Recommended Actions:**
Please ENTER actions for software
products which use vulnerable versions of util-linux and mount.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
