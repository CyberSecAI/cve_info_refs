## Vandyke Software SecureCRT contains buffer overflow vulnerability in password handling code

#### Vulnerability Note VU#216227

Original Release Date: 2002-09-16 | Last Revised: 2003-04-15

---

### Overview

SecureCRT is vulnerable to buffer overflow from improper handling of long password input.

### Description

| SecureCRT is a terminal emulator and SSH client for Windows. If the SSH1 protocol is used and the user enters a password 300 characters or more in length, SecureCRT will crash, with the following error displayed by Windows:  "SECURECRT caused an invalid page fault in module MSVCRT.DLL..."Since the execution instruction pointer (EIP) register is not overwritten, the crash more likely results from heap overflow than stack overflow.According to VanDyke Software, the vulnerability does not occur when the SSH2 protocol is used. |
| --- |

### Impact

| Local users may be able to execute arbitrary code on the client host by supplying a long password to SecureCRT. |
| --- |

### Solution

| The CERT/CC is currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem. |
