| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=66235#c0)• 24 years ago |
|  | |

When mass editing multiple bugs, the process\_bug.cgi script changes the product
name (ane components) from the old to the new, but it fails to set the
'groupset' bit to the new product's group bit.
There are several places to fix it, I added the following right around line
359/360 (from v2.10, inside the "foreach my $field..." loop):
if (defined $::FORM{'product'}) {
my $name = trim($::FORM{'product'});
if (($name ne $::dontchange) && ($name ne "")) {
ConnectToDatabase();
SendSQL("select bit from groups where name = '$name'");
my $bit = FetchOneColumn();
if (defined $bit) {
DoComma();
$::query .= "groupset = $bit";
}
}
}

I'm willing to take this one if someone tells me kindly if troy's approach is
the better one (special-casing product inside the loops) or if I should break
the loop in a separate way. If nobody complains I'll follow Troy's suggestion.

|  | |

This patch does no checking to find out whether the old bit was set or not, and
it does nothing to preserve non-product group bits.
I wouldn't bother fixing it though, since, as noted, it's going to break when bug
68022 is resolved.

I believe this is fixed by the patch on [bug 84714](/show_bug.cgi?id=84714 "RESOLVED FIXED - Can't change permissions from bug list"), or at least sufficiently so
that the user has the power to do something about it... ([bug 84714](/show_bug.cgi?id=84714 "RESOLVED FIXED - Can't change permissions from bug list")'s patch
enables changing groups on mass-changes)
Depends on: [84714](/show_bug.cgi?id=84714 "RESOLVED FIXED - Can't change permissions from bug list")
No longer depends on: [68022](/show_bug.cgi?id=68022 "RESOLVED FIXED - Need more than 55 groups")

hmm, no this won't be fixed by the patch on [bug 84714](/show_bug.cgi?id=84714 "RESOLVED FIXED - Can't change permissions from bug list")...
what needs to happen is on a product change, check to see if the product group
bit is set, and if so, clear it, and set the product group bit for the product
the bug is moving to, if the new product has a group. What gets into a gray
area is what do we do if the origin product doesn't have a group and the
destination product does?

|  | |

Well, the initial intent (by me, the user) was to move mass amounts of bugs from
one group to the next (e.g., into an "Archives" group for old stuff). At this
point, I'm not really sure it matters if the origin group was empty or not, as
the destination is supposed to be set to the group I choose.
Perhaps I'm missing something (most likely), but it seems to be a
straightforward move from A -> B, regardless of A ?

This is another of those 2.14 milestone bugs that were depending on 68022, which
has jumped to the 2.16 milestone. This bug needs to either be decoupled from
that bug (and thus fixed in this milestone) or moved forward. If it stays in
this milestone, Christian are you still willing and able to work on it or do you
want someone else to take it over?

>destination product does?
When a new bug is created, it gets placed into its product's group by default.
I imagine, then, that if a bug is moved from one product to another, it will be
placed into the new product's group by default as well. The only exceptions to
this are if the user doesn't have access to the new product's group or if they
explicitly request that the bug not be moved.

Multiline if() statements complete with comments... I've never seen that
before. Is that why the comments inside the if() end w/a semi-colon?
The print statements added to process\_bug.cgi seem more like debug than user
explainitory, are the supposed to be removed before the final patch?
I would think that GroupNameToBit() should be able to also tell if the group
exists (return 0 if it doesn't). Then you wouldn't have to call both
GroupExists() and GroupNameToBit() [which would result in two queries instead
of one].
This patch doesn't seem to interact terribly well with with the patch from [bug
39816](/show_bug.cgi?id=39816 "RESOLVED FIXED - Anyone in CC/reporter/QA Contact fields should see restricted bugs") (a mass change clears the additional viewing options [although that's a
bug in the other patch, not this one, as I think about it]).
The interface on the buglist page seems a bit confusing. Perhaps it should all
be done from the table. I'm not sure why we would allow a bug to be added to a
product group for a product that it isn't in. But again, that's not this bug,
that another one (already marked FIXED, I believe).
I would also recommend that in subs such as GroupNameToBit() you do a
PushGlobalSqlState() and PopGlobalSqlState() to avoid sometimes mysterious
dataloss type bugs.

Nope. The semi-colons are strictly semantic.

Yep. They are just debugging statements that I thought would make the patch's
behavior easier to review.

I'm looking into that next.

The latest version of the patch (and the one that is running on landfill) does
not allow the user to keep the bug in the old product group.
I moved the UI for this patch into the "verify" page that appears when you
change products (currently with options for verifying the version, component,
and target milestone). This way it appears for both single and multiple bug
changes and is tied to the specific act of changing products.
I thought this made more sense than putting it on one of the other pages, where
it would take up space and attract attention even though it is irrelevant except
during a product change.
I cleaned up the appearance and code for the "verify" screen in the process.
>I would also recommend that in subs such as GroupNameToBit() you do a
>PushGlobalSqlState() and PopGlobalSqlState() to avoid sometimes mysterious
>dataloss type bugs.
I added this to the two functions in this patch. I can see a few other
functions that could use it, but I'll file a separate bug on those since I don't
want to change anything out of the scope of this patch and possibly introduce
more issues.

The latest patch fixes the problem Jake discovered where you can add the bug to
the group twice (which results in the bug being added to the group with the next
higher groupset bit) by saying "add to group" on both the "change multiple bugs"
and the "confirm product change" forms. The bug only gets added to the group
once if you do this now.

All users of Bugzilla, the bug-tracking system from mozilla.org, are
strongly recommended to update to version 2.14.

Bugzilla 2.14 is a general security update, but not all of the security
issues are serious.

Serious issues include:

    * Multiple instances where data on "confidential" bugs could be
      obtained by valid users of the system who are not authorized to.
    * Multiple instances of security holes where parameters were not being
      checked/escaped properly.

There are many patches that need to be applied to properly close these
holes, so they are not included here.  If you will not be upgrading your
system to 2.14 and instead wish to apply these patches to your existing
system, please consult the bug reports on bugzilla.mozilla.org for the bug
numbers listed below, where you can obtain the patches attached to those
bugs.

Complete bug reports for all bugs can be obtained by visiting the
following URL:  <http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=XXXXX>
where you replace the XXXXX at the end of the URL with a bug number as
listed below.  You may also enter the bug numbers in the "enter a bug#" box
on the main page at <http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/> or in the footer of any
other page on bugzilla.mozilla.org.

*** SECURITY ISSUES RESOLVED ***

- Multiple instances of unauthorized access to confidential
  bugs has been fixed.
  (bug 39524, 39526, 39527, 39531, 39533, 70189, 82781)
- Multiple instances of untrusted parameters not being
  checked/escaped was fixed.  These included definite security
  holes.
  (bug 38854, 38855, 38859, 39536, 87701, 95235)
- After logging in passwords no longer appear in the URL.
  (bug 15980)
- Procedures to prevent unauthorized access to confidential
  files are now simpler.  In particular the shadow directory
  no longer exists and the data/comments file no longer needs
  to be directly accessible, so the entire data directory can
  be blocked.  However, no changes are required here if you
  have a properly secured 2.12 installation as no new files
  must be protected.
  (bug 71552, 73191)
- If they do not already exist, checksetup.pl will attempt to
  write Apache .htaccess files by default, to prevent
  unauthoried access to confidential files.  You can turn this
  off in the localconfig file.
  (bug 76154)
- Sanity check can now only be run by people in the 'editbugs'
  group.  Although it would be better to have a separate
  group, this is not possible until the limitation on the
  number of groups allowed has been removed.
  (bug 54556)
- The password is no longer stored in plaintext form.  It will
  be eradicated next time you run checksetup.pl.  A user must
  now change their password via a password change request that
  gets validated at their e-mail account, rather than have it
  mailed to them.
  (bug 74032)
- When you using product groups and you move a bug between
  products (single or mass change), the bug will no longer be
  restricted to the old product's group (if it was) and will
  be restricted to the new product's group.
  (bug 66235)
- There are now options on a bug to choose whether the
  reporter, assignee, QA and CCs can access a bug even if
  they aren't in groups the bug it is restricted to.
  (bug 39816)
- You can no longer mark a bug as a duplicate of a bug you
  can't see, and if you mark a bug a duplicate of a bug
  the reporter cannot see you will be given options as to
  what to do regarding adding the reporter of the resolved
  bug to the CC of the open bug.
  (bug 96085)
