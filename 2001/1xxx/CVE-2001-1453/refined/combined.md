## MySQL client contains buffer overflow

#### Vulnerability Note VU#123384

Original Release Date: 2001-02-18 | Last Revised: 2001-02-18

---

### Overview

[MySQL](http://www.mysql.com) is a popular open source database package. The MySQL client that ships with the MySQL package contains a buffer overflow.

### Description

| The mysql program, part of the MySQL package, contains a buffer overflow in the ***host*** parameter. An intruder who invokes mysql using a specially crafted hostname can execute arbitrary code. Because mysql is not setuid or setgid, a local attacker is unable to use this vulnerability to gain additional privileges under most circumstances. However, when PHP is compiled with MySQL support, it is linked to the library containing the buffer overflow, libmysqlclient.so. If a PHP script or other program establishes a connection to a MySQL database and accepts the hostname argument from untrusted sources, an intruder may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the web server.  See also [VU#367320](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/367320). |

### Impact

| The impact of this vulnerability depends on the context in which MySQL is used, and may vary on a site-by-site basis. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Upgrade to MySQL version 3.23.33 or later. |
