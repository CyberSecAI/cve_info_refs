Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

*   **CVE ID:** None
*   **Vulnerability:** SurfControl SuperScout Web Filter fails to block HTTP requests fragmented across multiple packets.
*   **Root Cause:** SuperScout analyzes individual packets for HTTP GET requests and the "Host:" header, but it doesn't maintain state across packets.
*   **Weakness:** The web filter does not reassemble fragmented HTTP requests before inspection.
*   **Attack Vector:** Fragmenting an HTTP request so the "Host:" header is in a separate packet.
*   **Impact:** Bypassing the web filter to access blocked content.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker needs to be able to fragment HTTP requests.
*   **Vendor Response:** The vendor released a fix in version 4 (October 15, 2001) that relies on IP addresses when the Host header is missing. However, this fix doesn't work in hosted environments where multiple domains share the same IP address. The vulnerability only affects SuperScout Web Filter Win NT/2000 (Pass-By). Other SuperScout products with Pass-Through architecture are not affected.
