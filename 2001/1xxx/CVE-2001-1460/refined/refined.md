- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient filtering of the "user" CGI variable in the `article.php` component of PostNuke before passing it to a MySQL query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection vulnerability due to inadequate input validation, allowing arbitrary MySQL query execution.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Attackers can execute arbitrary MySQL queries.
    - Attackers can bypass user authentication and log in as other users without knowing their passwords.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation is achieved by manipulating the "user" CGI variable.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Attackers need to know a valid PostNuke username and ID.
    - Attackers can then tamper with the SQL query by manipulating the user CGI variable.
