# On Active Attacks to Kerberos Telnet

**Simon Josefsson, RSA Laboratories**

**August 27, 2001**

### Abstract:

We present a well-known and well-documented
weakness against active attacks in the Telnet Authentication and
Encryption Protocol framework, and discuss the consequences for
Kerberos (version 4 and 5) Telnet. We recognize that the weakness can
ultimately be used by a active attacker to fool Kerberos Telnet users
in some implementations. We briefly describe the protocols involved,
the weakness, and demonstrate how it can be used to impersonate a
server. We conclude with a recommendation on how to solve the
identified problem.

# Introduction

The Telnet Protocol [[1](kerberos-telnet.html#RFC854)] provides a generic communications
facility, primarily used to interface terminal devices with
terminal-oriented processes to each other. Implementations of the
protocol are often used to perform remote work on Unix-like computers
or routers. The core protocol does not support authentication, data
encryption nor data integrity. Two framework documents, Telnet
Authentication Option [[5](kerberos-telnet.html#RFC2941)] and Telnet Data Encryption Option
[[7](kerberos-telnet.html#RFC2946)], describe how the core protocol may be enhanced with
authentication, encryption or data integrity. Several authentication
mechanisms have been specified within the framework, but we will focus
only on the Kerberos version 4 mechanism [[4](kerberos-telnet.html#RFC1411)][1](#foot120) and the Kerberos version 5
[[6](kerberos-telnet.html#RFC2942)] mechanism. Both of these authentication mechanisms
also provide keying material for use by the Telnet Encryption option.

The authentication framework specified in [[5](kerberos-telnet.html#RFC2941)] describes a
three-step authentication process. We will give a brief description
here, using a simplified notation of Telnet commands for legibility.
Readers familiar with the Telnet protocol and the Authentication
Option in particular should note that when we talk about the
**WILL, DO, WONT, DONT** authentication command, we are referring
to the **IAC \* AUTHENTICATE** commands. When we talk about the
**SEND, NAME, IS, REPLY** commands, we refer to the **IAC
SB AUTHENTICATION \* IAC SE** commands. Also, we will talk about these
commands as being sent individually, when in practice they are usually
bundled together with other commands. The three steps of the
authentication protocol are:

* Negotiation of whether authentication is to be used at all.
  This step uses the **WILL**, **DO**, **WONT**, and
  **DONT** authentication commands.
* Transfer of server-supported authentication mechanisms. This
  step uses the **SEND** authentication command.
* Transfer of account name, and mechanism specific data which is
  used to perform the actual authentication. This step uses the
  **NAME**, **IS**, and **REPLY** authentication
  commands.

The client begins by sending the **WILL** authentication command
to signal that it wishes to initiate authentication. It expects a
**DO** or **DONT** command in return. The **DO**
command indicates that authentication is supported by the server and
that the client should proceed with authentication. The **DONT**
command indicates that the server is not willing to negotiate
authentication. If **DO** is not received, the client aborts its
attempts of negotiating authentication. These commands are not
integrity protected.

In the second step, the server sends the **SEND** command which
contain a ordered list of acceptable (to the server) authentication
and encryption options. Each entry include indicators for which
authentication mechanism to use (e.g. Kerberos 4 or Kerberos 5); if
mutual or client-only authentication should be used; and how
encryption should be negotiated. Note that the ordered list is not
integrity protected, an attacker may remove entries or re-order the
list at will. The specification suggest that the ordered list may be
integrity protected by the mechanism, however neither the Kerberos 4
or the Kerberos 5 Telnet Authentication Protocols implement this
feature.

The clients selects one of the authentication mechanisms supported by
the server, and commences step three. In the Kerberos case, the
account name is transferred using a **NAME** command. Then a
Kerberos structure called **KRB\_AP\_REQ** is sent in the
**IS** authentication command. The **KRB\_AP\_REQ**
structure contains authentication information and keying material. It
also contains a check sum calculated on the authentication type chosen
by the client. This indicates that some attempts to protect from
active attackers were made. However, we will see that leaving the
server authentication list unprotected may leave enough room to mount
an attack in practice.

The Telnet Encryption Option [[7](kerberos-telnet.html#RFC2946)] is similar to the Telnet
Authentication Option, the first step negotiate whether encryption
should be used at all or not. It uses the **WILL**, **DO**,
**WONT**, and **DONT** encryption commands. The client
sends a **WILL** encryption command indicating that it is willing
to send encrypted data, and a **DO** encryption command
indicating it is willing to receive encrypted data. The client
expects a **WILL** and **DO** response back from the server,
indicating that the server is also willing to send and receive
encrypted data. The **WONT** and **DONT** commands are sent
when the sender refuses to send or receive encrypted data. Once the
parties has agreed to use encryption, the Telnet Encryption framework
proceeds similar to the authentication framework, by negotiation which
encryption mechanism to use, and then the parameters for that
mechanism.

# Exploiting the weakness

The weaknesses in the negotiation phase, that the list of server
supported authentication and encryption mechanisms is not integrity
protected, can be exploited in current implementations[2](#foot121). We describe the simplest
attack, where we are able to disable the Telnet Encryption option -
which is responsible for negotiating data encryption and optionally
data integrity[3](#foot69) - and
ultimately impersonate a server from the point of view of the end
user.

By intercepting the (unprotected) **WILL** and **DO**
commands sent by the server, the Telnet client is fooled into a state
where it does not proceed to require negotiation of the encryption
option even though this was requested by the user. Once the mutual
authentication is done, it is possible to cover up for the disabled
Encryption option by inserting data into the stream that resembles
those messages inserted by the client to inform the user that
encryption has been enabled. This step is of no theoretical interest,
most users expect that encryption is properly negotiated if she
requests it, and that a error or at least a warning is given if
encryption isn't enabled. There is a lesson to be learned here
though: Never reuse a stream for both insecure data and security
information. The user will not be able to tell whether the security
information was sent by the possibly insecure remote system (which may
be a attacker) or generated by the locally trusted application.

Once any encryption and integrity functionality has been disabled, it
is trivial to hijack the session. The following is a excerpt from a
terminal session where a user requests a remote session, which is
overtaken by a active attacker. The output to the user looks
identical to when a mutual authenticated and encrypted channel is
opened. In the text below, the session is hijacked right after the
mutual authentication, and the active attacker inserts the encryption
status information and removes a security warning from the remote
system. Familiarity with the Kerberos Telnet system is necessary to
appreciate it.

```

alice$ telnet -x bob.example.com
Encryption is verbose
Trying 10.0.0.1...
Connected to bob.example.com.
Escape character is '^]'.
[ Trying mutual KERBEROS5 (host/bob.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM)... ]
[ Kerberos V5 accepts you as ``alice@EXAMPLE.COM'' ]
[ Output is now encrypted with type DES_CFB64 ]
[ Input is now decrypted with type DES_CFB64 ]

eve$

```

Varying this approach, we was able to come up with a similar attack
against Kerberos V4 Telnet. Apparently, tricking the client into
using client-only authentication, by modifying the Authentication
negotiation, disables the attempt to use encryption (even though
encryption was requested by the user). However, the KerberosÂ V4
authentication mechanism actually negotiates a mutually agreed key
during the server authentication phase, so the logic of disabling
encryption when mutual authentication is unsuccessful is not necessary
(and is indeed harmful as it opens up for the attack).

# Conclusions

The attack we have seen is made possible by combining two things:

* Protocol issue: The phase that negotiate which authentication
  and encryption scheme should be used is not protected by the mechanism
  that is eventually chosen.
* Implementation issue: The Kerberos Telnet client should not
  override user requested security level (i.e. requesting encryption)
  based on unprotected network data.

This first is well-known and well-documented weakness in the
Authentication and Encryption Options. The Authentication option
specifications suggests that the entire negotiation phase may be
protected by a check sum by the mechanism. Neither the Kerberos V4 or
the Kerberos V5 Telnet protocols implement this. This results in a
unwanted characteristic in a security negotiation protocol: It is
impossible to know whether the eventually selected authentication and
encryption suite was the strongest one possible. The reasonable
approach in a client, to only accept client-only authentication if
mutual authentication was not available, cannot be securely
implemented in this protocol. The client is not able to distinguish
between the case when no server-side authentication is available and
the case when it is under attack. A prudent Kerberos Telnet client
has to consider an authentication announcement which lacks mutual
authentication as possibly being under attack. Ideally, Kerberos V4
and V5 Telnet Authentication should not leave themselves open to these
attacks. However, the Kerberos Telnet specifications does not claim
to protects from this attack, so we do not claim to have ``broken''
it, but we do feel that this is a unwanted characteristic of a
security protocol that warrant some concern.

To exemplify to what extent the weakness is known, we quote part of
the security considerations for the Telnet Encryption Option
[[7](kerberos-telnet.html#RFC2946)]:

```

   The ENCRYPT option used in isolation provides protection against
   passive attacks, but not against active attacks.  In other words,
   it will provide protection from someone who is just watching the IP
   packets as they pass through the network.  However, a attacker who
   is able to modify packets in flight could prevent the ENCRYPT
   option from being negotiated.

   This flaw can be remedied by using the Telnet Authentication option
   alongside the ENCRYPT option.  Specifically, setting
   ENCRYPT_USING_TELOPT in the authentication-type-pair can be used to
   force that Encryption be negotiated even in the face of active
   attacks.

```

It is not stated explicitly, but the suggested remedy assumes that the
Telnet Authentication option is being integrity protected, otherwise
the active attacker is able to modify the Telnet Authentication option
as well. This is were the Kerberos Telnet Authentication Option
fails, it does protect the Telnet Authentication option from the
client to the server, but the initial list of supported mechanisms
from the server to the client is never protected. Hence whenever a
client and server accepts weaker mechanisms, an attacker is able to
force the weaker mechanism to be used. Since the list sent by the
server is an ordered list, in practice servers include all the
mechanisms they are able to support, thus letting the client (or an
attacker) pick the ``best'' one. This is unlike TLS [[10](kerberos-telnet.html#RFC2246)]
that protects the entire negotiation phase from any tampering.

Since the attack was based on combining two different ideas, we
identify two solutions that prevent the possibility of combining them
into a successful attack:

* The negotiation of the authentication option should be protected
  by a Kerberos check sum. The current specification can be updated as
  follows: If client-only authentication is chosen, we suggest that a
  additional command is sent from the server to the client containing a
  check sum of the initial list of support authentication mechanisms.
  If mutual authentication is chosen, we suggest that the server
  **RESPONSE** command should also contain a Kerberos check sum of
  the initial list. If **ENCRYPT\_MASK** of [[5](kerberos-telnet.html#RFC2941)] is
  used, these changes can be used to protect the encryption negotiation
  as well.
* Correct the implementation to enforce that encryption is
  successfully negotiated if the user requests encryption, and that the
  connection attempt is aborted if encryption cannot be negotiated.
  Also, clients should assume that servers which do not announce mutual
  authentication may be under attack (unless the protocol is updated as
  above). If it is acceptable to continue or not in this case should be
  up to client policy. In many environments it would be better if the
  Telnet client refuse unencrypted or client-only authenticated
  connections by default.

Ideally both solutions should be implemented, but either one of them
will suffice. The first approach is needed to make the Kerberos
authentication protocol more cryptographically sound by itself. We
recognize that keeping backwards compatibility may be the deciding
factor here.

The
implementations are KTH Kerberos 4 version 1.0.9 [[8](kerberos-telnet.html#KTHKRB)] and
Heimdal Kerberos 5 version 0.4d [[9](kerberos-telnet.html#Heimdal)]. They are used in the
FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD operating systems.
... integrity[3](kerberos-telnet.html#tex2html3)
For efficiency reasons, most of the currently
defined encryption mechanisms do not provide data integrity.

## Kerberos Telnet protocol does not adequately protect authentication and encryption options

#### Vulnerability Note VU#774587

Original Release Date: 2002-02-04 | Last Revised: 2002-02-25

---

### Overview

A vulnerability exists in the Telnet Authentication Option and Telnet Data Encryption Option specifications. An ordered list of authentication and encryption options sent from the server to client during negotiation is not cryptographically protected. As a result, an attacker may be able to modify the list and cause less secure authentication and encryption options to be negotiated. An active attacker may be able to disable Telnet data encryption without the client's knowledge.

### Description

| Simon Josefsson has published a [paper](http://josefsson.org/ktelnet/) describing several active man-in-the-middle attacks against the Kerberos Telnet protocol. Kerberos is a trusted third-party authentication protocol that can be used to secure applications that otherwise transmit authentication information in plain text. Kerberos can further be used to establish encrypted communications channels for applications that normally transmit data in plain text. [RFC 1510](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1510.txt) defines the Kerberos V protocol.  Telnet ([RFC 854](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc854.txt)) transmits data in plain text, including authentication information. Two RFCs describe options to secure Telnet communications: the Telnet Authentication Option ([RFC 2941](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2941.txt)) and the Telnet Data Encryption Option ([RFC 2946](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2946.txt)). Kerberos can be used to provide these options for Telnet, as specified in [RFC 1411](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1411.txt) (Kerberos IV) and [RFC 2942 (Kerberos V)](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2942.txt).While establishing a Kerberos Telnet connection, the client and server exchange information about their authentication and encryption preferences. In simplified terms, the client first requests Kerberos authentication and may request data encryption. The server then replies with an ordered list of supported authentication and encryption options. The integrity of this list is not cryptographically protected, and an attacker may be able to modify the list and cause the client to choose less secure authentication or encryption options. For example, a client that requests Telnet data encryption may be directed by an attacker to negotiate a connection with no encryption. In addition, the attacker can intercept warnings from the server that encryption is not enabled. As Josefsson notes, the Telnet Authentication Option specification suggests that the integrity of the data exchanged in the negotiation process *may* be protected, however neither the Kerberos IV or Kerberos V Telnet protocols implement such behavior. [RFC 2941](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2941.txt) describes this vulnerability under the *Security Implications* heading. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker with the ability to modify Kerberos Telnet negotiation commands sent from server to client may be able to cause the connection to negotiate less secure authentication and encryption options, including no encryption. The attacker may then be able to read data that the user presumes to be securely encrypted. This is exacerbated by another vulnerability in KTH Kerberos Telnet clients. When a user requests encryption and the server does not appear to support it, KTH Kerberos Telnet clients continue negotiation and establish a connection with no encryption (VU#390280). |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Modify Protocol Specification**The Kerberos Telnet protocol specification could be modified to require cryptographic protection of the negotiation of authentication and encryption options. Such a solution would necessitate changes in current implementations of the protocol. |
| --- |

| **Enforce Client Encryption Preference**One defense against the attacks described in Josefsson's [paper](http://josefsson.org/ktelnet/) is to strictly enforce the client's preferences and abort the connection if authentication or encryption cannot be negotiated. The following is an excerpt from a man page entry for a BSD-derived telnet command option to enable data encryption:Â  Â  -x Â Turn on encryption of the data stream. Â When this option is turned on, Â tel-Â  Â  Â  Â  net Â will Â exit Â with Â an error if authentication cannot be negotiated or ifÂ  Â  Â  Â  encryption cannot be turned on.Josefsson references a [patch](http://josefsson.org/ktelnet/ktelnet-heimdal04d-patch.diff) for the KTH Kerberos V (Heimdal) implementation that enforces the client's encryption preference. |
