Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2001-1320:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Network Associates PGP Keyserver 7.0 has multiple vulnerabilities in its LDAP request processing code. Specifically, the encoding section failed 12 of 16 test groups and the application section failed 1 of 77 groups when tested with the PROTOS LDAPv3 test suite. The application failure focused on out-of-bounds integer values for the messageID parameter, which may also be an encoding issue.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Multiple vulnerabilities exist related to how the PGP Keyserver handles LDAP requests. These issues include problems in both the encoding and application layers of LDAP processing, especially when dealing with invalid or out-of-bounds integer values within the messageID parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   A remote attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Keyserver, which typically runs with system privileges.
*   The vulnerabilities could also lead to denial-of-service attacks and unauthorized privileged access.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is remote, exploiting the vulnerabilities via crafted LDAP requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send specially crafted LDAP requests to the PGP Keyserver. No specific position within the network is mentioned, but remote exploitation is possible.
