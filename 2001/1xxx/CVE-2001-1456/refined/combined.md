## Network Associates CSMAP and smap/smapd vulnerable to buffer overflow thereby allowing arbitrary command execution

#### Vulnerability Note VU#206723

Original Release Date: 2001-09-06 | Last Revised: 2001-09-06

---

### Overview

A remotely exploitable buffer overflow exists in the [Gauntlet Firewall](http://www.pgp.com/products/gauntlet/default.asp).

### Description

| The buffer overflow occurs in the smap/smapd and CSMAP daemons. According to PGP Security, these daemons are responsible for handling email transactions for both inbound and outbound e-mail.  This vulnerability occurs in smap/smapd on the following products:     + Gauntlet for Unix versions 5.x + PGP e-ppliance 300 series version 1.0 + McAfee e-ppliance 100 and 120 series  This vulnerability occurs in CSMAP on the following products:    + Gauntlet for Unix version 6.0 + PGP e-ppliance 300 series versions 1.5, 2.0 + PGP e-ppliance 1000 series versions 1.5, 2.0 + McAfee WebShield for Solaris v4.1 |
| --- |

### Impact

| An intruder can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the corresponding daemon. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Patchs for this vulnerability are available from the vendor at ftp://ftp.nai.com/pub/security/ and <http://www.pgp.com/naicommon/download/upgrade/upgrades-patch.asp>. |

## History

The CERT Division is the birthplace of cybersecurity. For nearly 30 years, the CERT Division of the SEI has partnered with government, industry, law enforcement, and academia to advance cybersecurity and improve the security and resilience of computer systems and networks.

Originally focused on incident response, we have expanded into cybersecurity areas such as network situational awareness, malicious code analysis, secure coding, resilience management, insider threats, digital investigations and intelligence, workforce development, DevOps, forensics, software assurance, vulnerability discovery and analysis, and risk management.

## Former Director Richard Pethia

[Richard Pethia](/about/leadership/display.cfm?customel_datapageid_2623=3545) was founding director of the SEI's CERT Division. Pethia, who served as director of CERT from 1988 to 2016, guided the organization through tremendous growth and change. Under Pethia's leadership, the unit expanded and evolved from the CERT Coordination Center—a small group focused on computer incident response—to a research organization of more than 200 professionals dedicated to solving problems with widespread cybersecurity implications.
