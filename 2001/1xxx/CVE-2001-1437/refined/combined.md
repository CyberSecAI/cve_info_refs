## Easynews does not adequately validate user input thereby disclosing server installation path via crafted URL request

#### Vulnerability Note VU#597795

Original Release Date: 2002-09-24 | Last Revised: 2002-09-24

---

### Overview

Easynews does not adequately validate user input. Attackers may exploit this vulnerability to learn the filesystem path where the script is installed.

### Description

| Easynews is an open-source CGI script designed to create dynamic news story web pages and listings. Easynews does not properly filter input from an unspecified CGI variable. By setting the value of this variable to a non-number, an attacker can cause the script to crash and display the filesystem path where the script is installed. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker can learn the filesystem path of the Easynews script, which includes the server's web directory. |
| --- |

### Solution

| The CERT/CC is currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem. |
