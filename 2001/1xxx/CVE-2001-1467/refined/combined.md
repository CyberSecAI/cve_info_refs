## mkpasswd uses weak random number generator

#### Vulnerability Note VU#527736

Original Release Date: 2003-04-02 | Last Revised: 2003-04-11

---

### Overview

Mkpasswd generates passwords that are insufficiently random.

### Description

| Mkpasswd is a password generation utility included with Red Hat Linux and possibly other Linux distributions. Mkpasswd generates passwords that are not sufficiently random, which may allow an attacker to predict passwords and consequently gain unauthorized access to other accounts on the system. This vulnerability occurs because mkpasswd uses the current process ID as the seed for the random number generator. Because of this, the number of passwords is limited to the size of the process table on the operating system. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker may be able to predict passwords and consequently gain unauthorized access to other accounts on the system. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Apply a patch from your vendor. |
