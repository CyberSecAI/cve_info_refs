- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `cda` command-line interface to `xmcd` creates insecure temporary files with predictable names in `/tmp`, a world-writable directory, while running with system administrator privileges.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure temporary file creation, predictable file names, usage of world-writable `/tmp` directory, execution with setuid privileges
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local attacker can overwrite arbitrary writable files on the system by creating symbolic links with the predictable temporary file names. By controlling the content of the overwritten files, the attacker can potentially escalate privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: A local attacker can exploit the vulnerability by creating symbolic links in the `/tmp` directory, pointing to files they wish to overwrite. When `cda` creates the temporary files, it will follow the symlinks, effectively writing to the attacker-controlled locations.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs local access to the system and the ability to create files and symlinks in the `/tmp` directory.
