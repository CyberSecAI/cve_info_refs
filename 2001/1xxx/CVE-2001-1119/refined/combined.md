## XMCD vulnerable to arbitrary file overwriting via symlink redirection of temporary file

#### Vulnerability Note VU#105347

Original Release Date: 2001-11-15 | Last Revised: 2001-11-15

---

### Overview

xmcd is an x11/motif CD playing utility, in the public domain. cda, the command line interface to xmcd, executes with system administrator privileges. It is vulnerable to a symbolic link attack that may allow a local user to obtain administrator privileges.

### Description

| cda, the command line interface to xmcd, executes with system administrator privileges. It creates insecure temporary files with predictable names in /tmp, a world-writable directory. |
| --- |

### Impact

| By creating symbolic links with appropriate names, a local attacker may overwrite any writable file on the system. If the attacker can control the content of the overwritten files, elevation of privileges may result. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Apply vendor patches; see the Systems Affected section below. |
| --- |

| Remove the setuid protection from cda. |
