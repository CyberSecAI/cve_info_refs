- Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability lies in the failure to perform URL simplification after decoding, allowing access to files readable by the web server.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Path traversal vulnerability due to improper handling of URLs after decoding.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can potentially read any file accessible by the web server.
- Attack vectors: By crafting specific URLs, attackers can bypass access restrictions.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the webserver.
