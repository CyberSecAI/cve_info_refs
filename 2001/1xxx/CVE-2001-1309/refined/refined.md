Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:**

*   **Root Cause:** Buffer overflow vulnerabilities in the IBM SecureWay Directory server's code that processes LDAP requests. These were discovered using the PROTOS LDAPv3 test suite.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The server is susceptible to buffer overflows when handling LDAP requests. This includes invalid encodings for the length (L) field of BER encoding and large numbers of continuous attributes or substrings offered to filter fields.
*   **Impact:** Remote attackers can crash the affected SecureWay Directory servers, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. The content mentions that arbitrary code execution is not known at the time, but the possibility is not ruled out.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered through specially crafted LDAP requests.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker can trigger the vulnerability remotely over the network using LDAP requests.

**Platforms Affected:**

*   Solaris
*   Windows 2000

**Platforms Not Affected:**

*   Windows NT
*   AIX
*   AIX with SSL

**Additional Technical Details from IBM:**

The provided addendum from IBM details specific test cases from the PROTOS suite that caused crashes on different platforms:

*   **Solaris:**
    *   Test case #136/E0: Invalid encodings for the L field of BER encoding leading to a server crash.
    *   Test case #6119/O7: Large number of continuous attributes offered to attribute field causing a server crash.
*   **Windows 2000:**
    *   Test case #452/E0: Invalid encodings for the L field of BER encoding leading to a server crash.
    *   Test case #5554/O4: Large number of continuous initial substrings offered to substring filter causing a server crash.

**Mitigation:**

*   Apply patches from IBM.
*   Block access to directory services at the network perimeter as a temporary measure.

**CVE IDs:**

*   CVE-2001-1309

**CERT Advisory:**

*   CA-2001-18
