Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the way the IDEA cipher is used within the SSH1 protocol when compression is disabled. Specifically, the Cipher Feedback (CFB) mode of operation, coupled with a weak CRC checksum and the lack of protection on the last block, allows for modification of the last block without detection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Weak CRC:** The CRC checksum used is insufficient to prevent tampering of the last block in an IDEA-encrypted SSH1 stream.
- **Last Block Modification:**  The final block of an SSH stream encrypted with IDEA using CFB is not protected against modification due to the feedback nature of CFB mode.
- **Lack of Integrity Protection on Last Block:** Unlike other blocks, the last block does not have an effective integrity check.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can modify the last block of an SSH packet that is encrypted with the IDEA cipher. This could result in manipulation of the data sent or commands executed.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is performed by intercepting and modifying the last block of an IDEA-encrypted SSH1 packet.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept and modify network traffic of an active SSH1 session that is using the IDEA cipher and has compression disabled. The attacker needs to be able to compute or know the result of the CRC calculation to modify the last block without the modification being detected.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is specific to the SSH1 protocol when using the IDEA cipher in CFB mode and with compression disabled.
- The vulnerability exploits the properties of CRC checksums as previously detailed in another vulnerability note, VU#25309.
- The provided text specifies that the vulnerability only applies to the **last** block of an SSH stream.
- The vulnerability note suggests disabling the IDEA cipher as a solution.
- OpenSSH is listed as "Not Affected."
- SSH Communications Security is listed as "Affected".
- The CVE ID is listed as "None" in the document.

This vulnerability allows an attacker to manipulate data within the last block of an SSH packet, potentially causing significant impact depending on the nature of the communication.
