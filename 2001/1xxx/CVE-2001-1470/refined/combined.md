## Weak CRC allows last block of IDEA-encrypted SSH packet to be changed without notice

#### Vulnerability Note VU#315308

Original Release Date: 2001-01-18 | Last Revised: 2002-03-05

---

### Overview

There is an information integrity vulnerability in the SSH1 protocol that allows the last block of an IDEA-encrypted session to be modified without notice.

### Description

| **Preconditions:**  Session is encrypted using IDEA cipher.Compression is disabled.SSH clients configured to use the IDEA cipher do so in cipher feedback (CFB) mode, in which each block of ciphertext is used to encrypt the next block. Because of this feedback, if any block of the ciphertext is modified, the remaining blocks will be garbled upon decryption. However, the last block of the SSH stream is not protected against modification, which means that it is possible to modify it using the properties of CRC checksumming described in [VU#25309](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/25309).Note that this vulnerability can only be used on the **last** block of an SSH stream. |
| --- |

### Impact

| Attackers can modify the last block of an SSH packet encrypted with IDEA. |
| --- |

### Solution

|  |
| --- |

| Disable the IDEA cipher with SSH1. |
