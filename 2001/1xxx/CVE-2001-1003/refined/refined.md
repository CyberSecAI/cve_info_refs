- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Respondus software stores user IDs and passwords using a weak encryption method. The encryption involves adding a constant to the ASCII value of each character of the password.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Weak encryption algorithm: The simple addition of a constant to ASCII values is easily reversible.
    - Consistent default values: The WEBCT.SVR file uses the same default values across different installations, making decryption easier once these values are known.
    - Inadequate protection of credentials: Usernames and passwords are not adequately protected.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Unauthorized access to user accounts. An attacker who obtains the WEBCT.SVR file can decrypt the stored usernames and passwords and potentially gain access to the user's associated accounts.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Local file access: An attacker with access to the user's local file system where the WEBCT.SVR file is stored can extract the encrypted credentials.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Access to the WEBCT.SVR file, typically located in the "Respondus Projects" directory of the user's machine.
    - Knowledge of the basic encryption algorithm and default values used in the WEBCT.SVR file.
