{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Mac OS X's Find-By-Content indexing feature creates a world-readable '.FBCIndex' file in each directory, containing indexing data derived from the contents of the files within that directory.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The '.FBCIndex' file is created with world-readable permissions.",
      "The file is stored in the same directory as the indexed files, potentially within web server document roots."
    ],
    "impact": "Sensitive file data, including content that was not intended to be publicly accessible, can be exposed to remote users via HTTP if the directory is served by a web server like Apache.",
    "attack_vectors": [
        "Remote access via HTTP to the .FBCIndex file when located within web server document roots."
      ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker requires the ability to access the vulnerable server via HTTP."

    "vulnerable_product": "Mac OS X Find-By-Content indexing",
    "solution": "Disable Find-By-Content indexing in Mac OS X. Use Unix file permissions or Apache runtime configuration directives to limit access to the hidden index data file.",
