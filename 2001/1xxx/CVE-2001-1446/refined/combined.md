## Mac OS X Finder creates world-readable ".FBCIndex" file thereby disclosing sensitive information

#### Vulnerability Note VU#177243

Original Release Date: 2002-08-05 | Last Revised: 2005-03-28

---

### Overview

Mac OS X's Find-By-Content indexing may store file data where it can be served to remote users by Apache.

### Description

| The Find-By-Content feature of Mac OS X generates indexing data from the contents of files in each directory. It then stores the indexing data for each directory in a hidden yet world-readable file named ".FBCIndex" within the same directory. If files in a directory served by the Apache Web server are indexed, the hidden index data file will be stored in the same directory where it can be viewed by remote users via HTTP. |
| --- |

### Impact

| Users may not be aware that their potentially sensitive file data is being indexed and stored where it can be served by Apache to the public. |
| --- |

### Solution

| The CERT/CC is currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem. |
| --- |

| Turn off Find-By-Content indexing in Mac OS X.  Use Unix file permissions or Apache run-time configuration directives to limit access to the hidden index data file. |
