## OpenSSH does not initialize PAM session thereby allowing PAM restrictions to be bypassed

#### Vulnerability Note VU#797027

Original Release Date: 2001-12-07 | Last Revised: 2001-12-12

---

### Overview

[OpenSSH](http://www.openssh.com/) is an implementation of the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol. It can be configured to use Linux [Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM)](http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/pam/) for added authentication. A vulnerability exists in OpenSSH, and perhaps other implementations of SSH, which can allow to potentially bypass PAM restrictions.

### Description

| OpenSSH fails to call pam\_open\_session if no pty (pseudo-terminal driver) is used. This in turn does not activate the security modules specified in */etc/pam.d*. It has been pointed out that if you use pam\_limits.so to set resource limits, then users could bypass these limits by calling ssh in this manner. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker can bypass the PAM security modules specified on the target machine. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Upgrade to [OpenSSH 2.9.9p1](http://www.openssh.com). |
| --- |

| **Restrict access to the SSH service**  You may wish to disable the SSH access until a patch is available from your vendor. If you cannot disable the service, you can limit your exposure to these vulnerabilities by using a router or firewall to restrict access to port 22/TCP (SSH). Implement a TCPWRAPPER. |
