{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "OpenSSH fails to call pam_open_session if no pty (pseudo-terminal driver) is used.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Failure to properly initialize PAM sessions in certain scenarios, leading to bypass of PAM restrictions.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can bypass the PAM security modules specified on the target machine, potentially bypassing resource limits, access controls, and other security policies set through PAM.",
  "Attack vectors": "By establishing an SSH connection without requesting a pty (pseudo-terminal), an attacker can bypass PAM session initialization.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to establish an SSH connection to the target machine. They do not need to be authenticated or have any special privileges before exploiting this vulnerability."
