Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2001-1401:

**Summary:**

The provided content primarily discusses multiple vulnerabilities in Bugzilla versions prior to 2.14 related to unauthorized access to confidential bug information. These issues stem from a lack of permission checks in various `*.cgi` scripts, allowing unauthorized users to view or potentially modify restricted bug data and attachments. The root cause is the failure to properly validate user permissions before displaying or processing bug-related information.

**Specific Vulnerabilities and Root Causes:**

1.  **`process_bug.cgi` (Bug 39524):**
    *   **Root Cause:**  `process_bug.cgi` did not check if a user had permission to view a bug before allowing them to modify it.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of access control, allowing users to potentially modify bug data, even if they are not authorized to view it.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized modification of bugs, potentially including changes to group restrictions, making previously restricted bugs public.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Manipulating the form data of a saved `show_bug.cgi` page to target a restricted bug and then submitting it to `process_bug.cgi`.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires a valid Bugzilla account.

2.  **`show_activity.cgi` (Bug 39526):**
    *   **Root Cause:** `show_activity.cgi` did not verify user permissions before displaying activity logs related to a bug.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of access control, leading to information disclosure of restricted bug activity.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized users could view activity logs for restricted bugs, potentially revealing sensitive information.
    *  **Attack Vector:** Accessing `show_activity.cgi` directly with the ID of a restricted bug.
     *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires a valid Bugzilla account.

3.  **`showvotes.cgi` (Bug 39527):**
    *   **Root Cause:** `showvotes.cgi` did not check permissions before displaying vote summaries of restricted bugs.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of access control, information disclosure about restricted bug votes.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized users could view summaries and vote information for restricted bugs.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Accessing `showvotes.cgi` directly with the ID of a restricted bug.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires a valid Bugzilla account.

4.  **`showdependencytree.cgi` (Bug 39531):**
    *   **Root Cause:**  `showdependencytree.cgi` did not check viewing permissions for the bug when displaying its dependencies.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of access control, leading to information disclosure about dependencies of restricted bugs.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized users could see the dependency tree, revealing information about related restricted bugs.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Accessing `showdependencytree.cgi` directly with the ID of a restricted bug.
    *  **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires a valid Bugzilla account.

5.  **`showdependencygraph.cgi` (Bug 39533):**
    *   **Root Cause:** Similar to `showdependencytree.cgi`, `showdependencygraph.cgi` did not check permissions before displaying a dependency graph.
     *   **Weakness:** Lack of access control, leading to information disclosure about dependencies of restricted bugs.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized users could view dependency graphs of restricted bugs.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Accessing `showdependencygraph.cgi` directly with the ID of a restricted bug.
    *  **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires a valid Bugzilla account.

6.  **`describecomponents.cgi` (Bug 82781):**
    *   **Root Cause:** `describecomponents.cgi` displayed all components regardless of user permissions.
    *  **Weakness:** Lack of access control, leading to information disclosure of hidden components
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized users could see a list of all components, even those they were not supposed to have access to.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Accessing `describecomponents.cgi` directly.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Could be accessed by any user, even those without an account.

7.  **`showattachment.cgi` (Bug 70189):**
    *   **Root Cause:** `showattachment.cgi` did not check if the user had permission to view the bug before serving the attachment.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of access control, enabling unauthorized access to attachments.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized users could download attachments from restricted bugs, potentially gaining access to proprietary code or other sensitive information.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Accessing `showattachment.cgi` directly with the ID of a restricted bug and the attachment ID.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires a valid Bugzilla account.

**General Impact:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:** Sensitive information within restricted bugs could be exposed to unauthorized users.
*   **Integrity Breach:** Unauthorized users could potentially modify bug data, leading to inaccurate tracking or manipulation of security restrictions.

**Mitigation:**

The primary mitigation for these vulnerabilities is to upgrade to Bugzilla 2.14, which includes patches for all the identified issues. Alternatively, patches for individual bugs can be obtained from the Bugzilla bug tracker. The core fix involves implementing proper permission checks within each vulnerable `*.cgi` script to ensure users only access information they are authorized to view.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The `marc.info` content is a security advisory summarizing the multiple security fixes included in Bugzilla 2.14.
*   The bugs are marked with a "security" whiteboard tag indicating their security relevance.
*   Bug 66091 is a meta-bug that tracks all of these individual issues related to information leakage
*   The severity of Bug 39524 is marked as "critical", likely due to the potential for unauthorized modifications of bug data including changing group access.
*   Patches were made to address these issues by adding checks to the CGI scripts using `ValidateBugID()` or similar mechanisms.
