Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The McAfee ASaP VirusScan agent runs a lightweight HTTP server on port 6515/TCP. This server has a vulnerability that allows directory traversal.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper input validation in the HTTP server, which allows for directory traversal via crafted requests. This allows access to files outside of the web root.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can connect to the vulnerable HTTP server (port 6515/TCP) and use directory traversal techniques to access any file on the target host with the privileges of the HTTP server, which is typically SYSTEM. This can lead to sensitive information disclosure or complete system compromise.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based, requiring the attacker to connect to the vulnerable HTTP server on port 6515/TCP. The attacker then sends crafted HTTP requests including directory traversal sequences like `../` to access arbitrary files.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the target machine and must be able to connect to port 6515/TCP on the target system.
