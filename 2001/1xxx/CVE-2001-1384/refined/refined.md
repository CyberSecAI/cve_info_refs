{
  "vulnerability_1": {
    "root_cause": "The kernel spends excessive time dereferencing deep symbolic links.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Excessive resource consumption",
      "Lack of limit on symlink depth"
    ],
    "impact": "Local Denial of Service (DoS). The kernel scheduler is locked, preventing other processes from running.",

  "vulnerability_2": {
    "root_cause": "The ptrace() system call allows a process to trace a setuid binary even after it executes, inheriting the setuid privileges",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect handling of setuid bits with ptrace",
      "Lack of capability checks during ptrace with setuid binaries"
    ],
    "impact": "Local privilege escalation to root. An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary code in the address space of a setuid process, leading to root access.",
    "attack_vectors": "A local user uses ptrace to attach to a setuid binary which then executes a shell or other user controlled binary, and using that to inject code.",
    "required_capabilities": "Local user access, ability to execute setuid root binary like newgrp or su."

   "patch_info": {
        "deep_symlink_fix": "The patch for the deep symlink DoS issue introduces a limit on the number of recursive symlink follows and limits consecutive symlinks. It also resets link_count when not in a symlink.",
        "ptrace_fix": "The patch for the ptrace vulnerability prevents tracing of setuid binaries, regardless of the tracer's capabilities."
