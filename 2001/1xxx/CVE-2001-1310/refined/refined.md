The provided content is related to CVE-2001-1310.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The IBM SecureWay Directory server contains buffer overflow vulnerabilities in the code that processes LDAP requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Buffer overflow vulnerabilities in the LDAP handling code.
- Vulnerable to malformed BER encodings in the L field
- Vulnerable to large numbers of continuous attributes or substrings offered in requests

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial-of-service (DoS) condition due to server crashes.
- Potential for arbitrary code execution (though not confirmed).

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote attackers sending specially crafted LDAP requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to send LDAP requests to the vulnerable server.
- No authentication or specific privileges are mentioned, suggesting the attack can be performed by an unauthenticated remote attacker.

**Specific Vulnerabilities:**
- **Solaris**:
   -  Test Case #136/E0: Invalid encodings for the L field of BER encoding.
   -  Test Case #6119/O7: Large number of continuous attributes.
- **Windows 2000**:
    - Test Case #452/E0: Invalid encodings for the L field of BER encoding.
    - Test Case #5554/O4: Large number of continuous initial substrings offered to substring filter

The vulnerability is present in Solaris and Windows 2000 platforms, but not in Windows NT, AIX, and AIX with SSL.
