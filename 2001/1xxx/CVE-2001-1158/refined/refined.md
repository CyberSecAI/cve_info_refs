Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2001-1158

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the inadequate security controls for Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) data within Check Point VPN-1/FireWall-1 versions 4.0 & 4.1. The software does not properly validate RDP headers, allowing attackers to bypass the firewall.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper validation of RDP headers.
- Lack of adequate security controls for RDP traffic.
- The firewall processes UDP traffic on port 259, interpreting it as RDP data based on a faked header.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Firewall Bypass:** Attackers can bypass the firewall.
- **Arbitrary Traffic Tunneling:** An attacker can create a tunnel and pass traffic through the firewall to arbitrary hosts on either side of the device on port 259.
- **Data Exfiltration/Access:** This allows potential access to internal networks or sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** The attack is initiated by sending UDP traffic with a faked RDP header.
- **Port 259:** The vulnerability is exploited through UDP traffic directed to port 259 on the firewall.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send UDP packets to the firewall.
- **Technical Knowledge:** They need to be able to craft a UDP packet that includes a faked RDP header.

**Summary:**
The vulnerability lies in Check Point FireWall-1 and VPN-1's insufficient handling of RDP data. By crafting a UDP packet with a forged RDP header, an attacker can tunnel arbitrary traffic through the firewall on port 259, circumventing the security measures and potentially accessing internal networks or sensitive systems.
