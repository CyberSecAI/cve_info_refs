## Check Point RDP Bypass Vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#310295

Original Release Date: 2001-07-09 | Last Revised: 2003-04-09

---

### Overview

[Check Point](http://www.checkpoint.com/) [VPN-1/FireWall-1 version 4.0 & 4.1](http://www.checkpoint.com/products/firewall-1/) may allow an intruder to pass traffic through the firewall on port 259.

### Description

| Firewall-1 and VPN-1 include support for RDP, but do not provide adequate security controls for RDP data. By adding a faked RDP header to typical UDP traffic, any content can be passed to port 259 on any host on either side of the device. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker who exploits this vulnerability can build a tunnel to bypass the firewall and pass traffic to and from arbitrary hosts on either side of the firewall on port 259. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Apply patch from vendor. |

## History

The CERT Division is the birthplace of cybersecurity. For nearly 30 years, the CERT Division of the SEI has partnered with government, industry, law enforcement, and academia to advance cybersecurity and improve the security and resilience of computer systems and networks.

Originally focused on incident response, we have expanded into cybersecurity areas such as network situational awareness, malicious code analysis, secure coding, resilience management, insider threats, digital investigations and intelligence, workforce development, DevOps, forensics, software assurance, vulnerability discovery and analysis, and risk management.

## Former Director Richard Pethia

[Richard Pethia](/about/leadership/display.cfm?customel_datapageid_2623=3545) was founding director of the SEI's CERT Division. Pethia, who served as director of CERT from 1988 to 2016, guided the organization through tremendous growth and change. Under Pethia's leadership, the unit expanded and evolved from the CERT Coordination Center—a small group focused on computer incident response—to a research organization of more than 200 professionals dedicated to solving problems with widespread cybersecurity implications.
