Its possible for the bugzilla group security stuff to be bypassed by filing a
duplicate bug. This will add you to the cc list, and so, by default, you'll be
able to see the bug.
To reproduce:
1. Have a restricted bug which is open to people on the cclist
(<http://landfill.tequilarista.org/bugzilla-tip/show_bug.cgi?id=278>)
2. As a user not in that group, file a bug, and dupe it against the bug which
you cannot see (<http://landfill.tequilarista.org/bugzilla-tip/show_bug.cgi?id=279>)
3. You can now view [bug 278](/show_bug.cgi?id=278 "VERIFIED WONTFIX - .exp problem w. CWPro3 when building NSRuntime")

I don't know if [bug 278](/show_bug.cgi?id=278 "VERIFIED WONTFIX - .exp problem w. CWPro3 when building NSRuntime") is open for everyone but I can see that bug.
(foodreplicator....)
I'm not logged in but I can see this bug with NS4.7x and Mozilla but not with IE
(I never used it on bugzilla-> no bugzilla cookies). With IE I get ".exp problem
....)
Maybe I can see this bug because I'm watching Bradley ?

Um, I could see that bug when I wasn't logged in. but I couldn't when logged in
as another user (matti, its a sepatate db, so tyou need a separate account)
This is, like, bad.

OK, what we need to do here is:
a) you can't dupe a bug against a bug you can't see.
b) if someone else dupes the bug, if the reporter can't see the new bug, the CC
should not be added.
For case B it probably wouldn't hurt to put up an intermediate screen warning
the user doing the duping that the reporter can't see it.

The "I can see bugs if I'm not logged in" bug has been filed as [bug 96099](/show_bug.cgi?id=96099 "RESOLVED FIXED - empty QA contact allows users who aren't lgged in to bypass group security").
dave: That sounds fine.

Not sure how well that patch works, although I'm pretty sure it gets the job
done. My database is down right now so I can't test it. Maybe someone else
can? :)

Using ValidateBugID() negates the need for the following block:
707 SendSQL("SELECT bug\_id FROM bugs WHERE bug\_id = " . SqlQuote($num));
708 $num = FetchOneColumn();
709 if (!$num) {
710 PuntTryAgain("You must specify a valid bug number of which this bug " .
711 "is a duplicate. The bug has not been changed.")
712 }
Of course, this patch doesn't do anything towards part b) [and its sub-part].

I have a somewhat functional patch with a few small glitches in it that I need
to work out. I'm posting it for some general feedback and ideas.
1) $::FORM{'knob'} gets set to numeric value '2' in the code somewhere. I need
to figure out why it does that. At that point however, it should always be set
to "duplicate" so for the time being, I hard coded it in there with a print
statement displaying the value of it.
2) If both the reporter and the duper don't have access to the bug, the header
displays twice. I'll have a fix for that shortly but I've been spending most of
my time trying to debug problem 1.
I'm a bit new to the Bugzilla code so I'm sure I've overlooked some stuff but
any help/feedback are definitely welcome. In any case, if you can see a bug and
are duping a bug with a reporter that can't, you get to choose whether to add
them to CC or not. Or throw away changes. This is a start to fixing [bug 92078](/show_bug.cgi?id=92078 "RESOLVED WONTFIX - When marking a duplicate of another bug, confirmation should be displayed before commit").
Attachment on the way...

The patch I just uploaded looks like it will fix everything. Initially I went
about it the wrong way. I realized that when I studied the bugzilla code some
more. Dave just applied the patch on <http://landfill.tequilarista.org/bz96085/>
On IRC, Dave OK'd the CGI.pl part of my patch with the optimization since I am
using similar code in process\_bug.cgiKeywords: [patch](/buglist.cgi?keywords=patch&resolution=---),
[review](/buglist.cgi?keywords=review&resolution=---)

In DuplicateUserConfirm() you have:
+ # Make sure the bug exists in the database.
+ if (!MoreSQLData()) {
+ DisplayError("Bug #$original does not exist.") && exit;
+ }
Which really isn't needed because you already called:
+ ValidateBugID($::FORM{'dup\_id'});
Which made sure both the $::FORM{'dup\_id'} was numeric and exits in the
database. I guess it really doesn't hurt anything because it's not another
database call, but just thought it'd be worth mentioning :)
I'm also not fond of the relying on the words "Do NOT" from the confirm page. I
almost think that be better as option buttons:
Add the user to the CC list so they can see the bug?:
( ) Yes ( ) No
[Commit]
The text should also, IMHO, tell the person who is doing the duping whether
adding the user to the CC list will allow them to immediately see the bug
(cclist\_accessible == 1) or just if it's just a possiblity down the line that
someone will turn on the CC list accessibility.

The initial scan of [attachment 47026](/attachment.cgi?id=47026 "Patch rev4; includes Jakes suggestions and other minor fixes.") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=47026&action=edit "Patch rev4; includes Jakes suggestions and other minor fixes.")

[[review]](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=96085&attachment=47026) looks good (I've only looked at the code, I
haven't tested anything). I think this will probably have a conflict with bug
92266 (not a code conflict, but the changes in the two patches are close enough
together that CVS will probably flag it... it's easy enough to fix, though,
seeing how there isn't a code conflict).

All users of Bugzilla, the bug-tracking system from mozilla.org, are
strongly recommended to update to version 2.14.

Bugzilla 2.14 is a general security update, but not all of the security
issues are serious.

Serious issues include:

    * Multiple instances where data on "confidential" bugs could be
      obtained by valid users of the system who are not authorized to.
    * Multiple instances of security holes where parameters were not being
      checked/escaped properly.

There are many patches that need to be applied to properly close these
holes, so they are not included here.  If you will not be upgrading your
system to 2.14 and instead wish to apply these patches to your existing
system, please consult the bug reports on bugzilla.mozilla.org for the bug
numbers listed below, where you can obtain the patches attached to those
bugs.

Complete bug reports for all bugs can be obtained by visiting the
following URL:  <http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=XXXXX>
where you replace the XXXXX at the end of the URL with a bug number as
listed below.  You may also enter the bug numbers in the "enter a bug#" box
on the main page at <http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/> or in the footer of any
other page on bugzilla.mozilla.org.

*** SECURITY ISSUES RESOLVED ***

- Multiple instances of unauthorized access to confidential
  bugs has been fixed.
  (bug 39524, 39526, 39527, 39531, 39533, 70189, 82781)
- Multiple instances of untrusted parameters not being
  checked/escaped was fixed.  These included definite security
  holes.
  (bug 38854, 38855, 38859, 39536, 87701, 95235)
- After logging in passwords no longer appear in the URL.
  (bug 15980)
- Procedures to prevent unauthorized access to confidential
  files are now simpler.  In particular the shadow directory
  no longer exists and the data/comments file no longer needs
  to be directly accessible, so the entire data directory can
  be blocked.  However, no changes are required here if you
  have a properly secured 2.12 installation as no new files
  must be protected.
  (bug 71552, 73191)
- If they do not already exist, checksetup.pl will attempt to
  write Apache .htaccess files by default, to prevent
  unauthoried access to confidential files.  You can turn this
  off in the localconfig file.
  (bug 76154)
- Sanity check can now only be run by people in the 'editbugs'
  group.  Although it would be better to have a separate
  group, this is not possible until the limitation on the
  number of groups allowed has been removed.
  (bug 54556)
- The password is no longer stored in plaintext form.  It will
  be eradicated next time you run checksetup.pl.  A user must
  now change their password via a password change request that
  gets validated at their e-mail account, rather than have it
  mailed to them.
  (bug 74032)
- When you using product groups and you move a bug between
  products (single or mass change), the bug will no longer be
  restricted to the old product's group (if it was) and will
  be restricted to the new product's group.
  (bug 66235)
- There are now options on a bug to choose whether the
  reporter, assignee, QA and CCs can access a bug even if
  they aren't in groups the bug it is restricted to.
  (bug 39816)
- You can no longer mark a bug as a duplicate of a bug you
  can't see, and if you mark a bug a duplicate of a bug
  the reporter cannot see you will be given options as to
  what to do regarding adding the reporter of the resolved
  bug to the CC of the open bug.
  (bug 96085)
