Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in the context of CVE-2001-1407:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the way Bugzilla handled duplicate bug reports in relation to group-based security restrictions. Specifically, when a user who lacked access to a restricted bug filed a new bug and marked it as a duplicate of the restricted bug, the user was added to the CC list of the restricted bug. This bypassed the intended access controls, giving the unauthorized user visibility of the restricted bug.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Bypass of Access Control:** The core weakness is the ability to bypass group security checks by leveraging the duplicate bug functionality.
- **Unintended CC List Addition:** The automatic addition of the reporter of a duplicate bug to the CC list of the original bug, even when they lack access, is a significant vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** Unauthorized users could gain access to confidential bug reports and related information that they were not supposed to see.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Duplicate Bug Submission:** An attacker could create a new bug report and mark it as a duplicate of a restricted bug.
- **Targeted Vulnerability:** An attacker has to know about the existence of restricted bugs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Bugzilla User Account:** The attacker needs a valid Bugzilla user account.
- **Knowledge of Restricted Bugs:** The attacker needs to know or be able to guess the existence of a restricted bug.

**Additional Details from the Bugzilla Bug Report:**

- The bug report (Bug 96085) on bugzilla.mozilla.org contains specific details about the vulnerability and the proposed fixes.
- The fix involved multiple parts:
    - Preventing users from marking a bug as a duplicate of a bug they cannot see.
    - When a user marks a bug as a duplicate of a bug that the reporter of the original bug cannot see, it provides a confirmation page with options on whether or not to add the reporter to the CC list of the open bug.
- The vulnerability was present in Bugzilla version 2.13 and older.
- The fix was implemented in Bugzilla version 2.14.

This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to gain access to restricted bug reports, by filing a duplicate bug.
