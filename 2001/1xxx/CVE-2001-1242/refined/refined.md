- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input validation in script paths, allowing the use of ".." elements.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insufficient checks for ".." in script paths.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could execute arbitrary applications on the server by manipulating the script path.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting malicious script paths containing "..", an attacker can traverse directories and execute unintended files.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to provide the script path, likely through a web request.
