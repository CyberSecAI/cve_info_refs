## Beck IPC@Chip TelnetD vulnerable to account lockout via idle telnet connection

#### Vulnerability Note VU#756019

Original Release Date: 2001-09-17 | Last Revised: 2003-04-14

---

### Overview

There is a vulnerability in the [Beck IPC@CHIP](http://www.bcl-online.de/mproducts/products.asp?id=1&status=de_products) that allows an attacker to create a denial-of-service condition.

### Description

| The Beck IPC@CHIP is a [single chip embedded webserver](http://www.bcl-online.de/mproducts/lp1.asp?status=en_products). This device contains a telnet server that is configured by default to not have a login timeout. Additionally, this telnet server only pemits one user to connect at any given time. Because there is no timeout set on the telnet server login and only one user can login at a time, a malicious user can connect to the service and remain idle at a login prompt. By sitting idle at the prompt, the attacker is able to keep any other legitimate user or the administrator from logging into the device via telnet. |
| --- |

### Impact

| Unless the administrator changes the default settings on the Beck IPC@CHIP, an attacker can prevent the system administrator or any other valid user from logging into the device via telnet. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Change the default settings on the telnet server to allow for a login timeout. |
