{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Lotus Domino SMTP server improperly handles quoted addresses, allowing attackers to bypass anti-relay safeguards.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability lies in the way Lotus Domino parses and handles recipient addresses. Specifically, by including the target recipient in a quoted string, the anti-relay checks can be bypassed.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Attackers can use vulnerable Lotus Domino SMTP servers to relay emails to arbitrary third-party recipients, effectively using the server as an open mail relay. This can be used to mask the origin of spam or phishing emails.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the SMTP protocol. Attackers send a crafted email with a recipient address formatted in a specific way within quotes, which bypasses the server's relay restrictions.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to send SMTP messages to a vulnerable Lotus Domino server. No prior access to the system is necessary."
