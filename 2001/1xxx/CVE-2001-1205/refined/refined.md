- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input filtering in `lastlines.cgi` allows path traversal and command execution.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - **Path Traversal**: The script does not properly sanitize user input, specifically the `$error_log` variable, allowing attackers to use `../../` sequences to navigate outside the intended directory specified by `$unix_dir`.
    - **Command Execution**: A missing `<` in the `open()` function allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary commands.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - **Path Traversal**: Attackers can read any file accessible to the web server by using directory traversal techniques.
    - **Command Execution**: Attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the server with the permissions of the web server user.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - By manipulating the `$error_log` parameter in the URL, an attacker can supply a path containing "../" sequences to traverse the file system.
    - By including a command in the `$error_log` parameter, an attacker can execute commands on the server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the `lastlines.cgi` script.
