### Overview

FTP Voyager is an FTP client implemented as an ActiveX control. It is incorrectly marked as "safe for scripting" allowing malicious web pages or email messages to upload and download files.

### Description

| FTP Voyager is an FTP client implemented as an ActiveX control. An ActiveX control may be invoked from a script embedded in an email message or web page if it is marked "safe for scripting" or if the IObjectSafety interface permits invocation of the control. As distributed, the control is marked safe for scripting allowing scripts to use the control maliciously.  For additional information on correctly configuring ActiveX controls for security please see the [Results of the Security in ActiveX Workshop](http://www.cert.org/reports/activeX_report.pdf). |
