# Solutions for Known and Unknown Vulnerabilities

[FUZZ TESTING](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/products/bestorm)
[VULNERABILITY MANAGEMENT](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/products/besecure)

## Simplified network and application security testing

[### BeSTORM

A black box fuzzer, a method of dynamic application security testing, that uncovers unknown security weaknesses during the product development stage, so fixes can be made before a product is launched. This chaos testing style requires no source code to run and offers more than 250 pre-built protocols and modules or the option for custom protocols.](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/products/bestorm)

[### BeSECURE

A vulnerability assessment and management solution.  It enables your security team to accurately identify known vulnerabilities, using threat intelligence to prioritize them by risk. This allows the team to focus on the vulnerabilities that pose the highest risk to your infrastructure and cut through the false positives and low-priority weaknesses.](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/products/besecure)

Together, these solutions strengthen a product’s cybersecurity by adding SecOps into DevOps and through continual, automated vulnerability management and security posture reporting.

## **Vulnerability Management for a Variety of Industries**

Nearly every industry relies on applications and networks to conduct business, though some have more stringent security requirements than others. Organizations in the aviation, automotive, healthcare, and financial sectors have some of the strongest security regulations. Layers of security during software and application development as well as after product deployment are necessary to keep consumers safe and organizations compliant.

![airplane icon](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilitiesaviation.png)

### [Aviation](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guides/aviation-software-testing-guide)

Cybersecurity is crucial to the aviation industry. Travelers in the sky need to be protected from any attacks that can prevent airlines from operating normally. Those same customers need to have their payment and sensitive data protected when purchasing a ticket.

### [Automotive](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guide/how-fuzz-testing-helps-secure-automotive-industry)

Wireless connectivity is becoming commonplace inside of new vehicles. Automotive connectivity to WIFI and Bluetooth are making vehicles a bigger target for cybercriminals. One vulnerability can take down any vehicle with that technology. DAST, Black Box Fuzzing, and SAST during development are a solid foundation of security to prevent these attacks.

![](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-automative.png)

![heartbeat](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-healthcare.png)

### [Healthcare and Medical](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guides/security-testing-for-networked-medical-devices)

Wireless technology and application software are being used more in medical devices to automate and monitor individual healthcare needs. Device security is the utmost priority, preventing risks that can directly endanger lives. Application security is needed to prevent cyber attackers from tampering with devices and stealing private healthcare data. SAST and DAST during development can help find vulnerabilities that can compromise these devices.

### Critical Infrastructure and Industrial Facilities

Water, power, and gas are some prime targets for large scale attacks. The best way to keep cyberattackers from taking down an entire city’s water supply is to create a layered cybersecurity portfolio. From the start, vulnerabilities need to be identified, remediated, and constantly monitored to prevent a mass standstill of public utilities.

![lightning bolt icon](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-critical-industries.png)

![factory](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-manufactures.png)

### Discrete Manufacturers

Manufacturing industries keep building and assembling essential pieces for everyday life. Any attack on that automation would create a bottleneck in multiple industries that rely on these products. A disruption in manufacturing has been proven to drive up prices and create a negative workflow ripple worldwide. Using layered security solutions prior to deployment and scanning afterwards will help prevent any shutdown.

### Financial

Financial institutions are still top cyberattacker targets. Monetary apps for banks, credit unions, investment, and retirement firms need the highest cybersecurity measures. Security that prevents cyberattacks should be implemented during development and embedded directly into these applications. Compliance for this industry is only growing with each reported breach.

Hi,

I wish to free this one since it has been made public by some
ppl. libsldap hole has been
known for long. As far as I know, sway () hack co za did actually found the
hole several months
ago and generously let me know about it. All propz goes to him. Thanks
bro.

Exploit is plain simple, tested on an Ultra10 and an Enterprise 3500 with
success.
I usually support the anti-sec movement but I got my reasons to publish
the exploit.
If you want to know why, please do mail me.

$ ./libsldap-exp
libsldap.so.1 $LDAP_OPTIONS enviroment variable buffer overflow
Exploit code: noir () gsu linux org tr
Bug discovery: sway () hack co za

Usage: ./libsldap-exp target#

target#: 0, /usr/bin/passwd Solaris8, Sparc64
target#: 1, /usr/bin/nispasswd Solaris8, Sparc64
target#: 2, /usr/bin/yppasswd Solaris8, Sparc64
target#: 3, /usr/bin/chkey Solaris8, Sparc64
target#: 4, /usr/lib/sendmail Solaris8, Sparc64
$ ./libsldap-exp 0
# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root)
#

PS: t(L)amer sahin kicina oyle bir tekme yiyeceksinki, agzindan cikicak.
Haberin olsun istedim : )

Greetings: sway, anathema, gov-boi, www.hack.co.za, ertan_kurt, cronos

cheers,
noir

# Solaris 8 libsldap buffer overflow

DESCRIPTION

The library implementing LDAP naming services on Solaris 8, libsldap,
contains a buffer overflow in the initialization code. While parsing
the environment variable LDAP_OPTIONS, a fixed size buffer is used to
store its contents which can be of any length. This is a
straightforward buffer overflow and exploitable in conjunction with
privileged programs that use the library. Such programs include
passwd, yppasswd, nispasswd, sendmail, and chkey. The library is only
found on Solaris 8 systems. On vulnerable systems the buffer overflow
can lead to a local root compromise.

Testing for the vulnerability of your system can be done as follows:

$ LDAP_OPTIONS=`perl -e "print 'A'x300"` passwd
Segmentation Fault

A segmentation or other fault indicates you have a problem. If the
program works normally (and asks your password), you're probably not
vulnerable. Other setuid binaries can be tested in the same way. To
check whether a program has been linked against the libsldap library,
you can use the ldd command.

WORKAROUNDS

One workaround is to clear the setuid/setgid bits of the vulnerable
programs (chmod 755 prog), but this will in most cases make them useless.
Another way is to compile a dummy library and replace
/usr/lib/libsldap.so.1 with it. This will disable any LDAP functionality
of the programs using this library, but otherwise they seem to work. A
dummy kludge library can apparently be compiled and installed like this:

$ cp /dev/null dummy.c
$ gcc -shared dummy.c -o dummy.so
$ su
# mv /usr/lib/libsldap.so.1 /usr/lib/orig_libsldap_so
# cp dummy.so /usr/lib/libsldap.so.1

This neutralizes the buffer overflow, but might also break some
things and have other side-effects. If you do this, do it on your own
risk. I haven't tested how the dummy library behaves on different kind
of systems and with different programs.

VENDOR RESPONSE

The vendor was informed on May 31st. According to Sun Microsystems
they had just discovered the vulnerability themselves and it "has
been fixed in the development release of Solaris and patches are being
generated for Solaris 8 presently."
