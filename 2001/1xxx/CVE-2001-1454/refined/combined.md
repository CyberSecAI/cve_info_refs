## MySQL monitor drop database command contains buffer overflow

#### Vulnerability Note VU#367320

Original Release Date: 2001-02-18 | Last Revised: 2001-02-18

---

### Overview

[MySQL](http://www.mysql.com) is a popular open source database package. It contains a buffer overflow in the code that processes **drop database** commands.

### Description

| The MySQL server, mysqld, contains a buffer overflow in the code used to process **drop database** requests***.*** By carefully crafting a MySQL **drop database** request, such as through the mysql client, an intruder may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the MySQL server. If a MySQL database is available over the internet (e.g. through mysqld or through a web page), a remote intruder may be able to exploit this vulnerability.  See also [VU#123384](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/123384). |
| --- |

### Impact

| Attackers able to authenticate to a MySQL database may be able to execute code with the privileges of the mysql server. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Upgrade to MySQL version 3.23.33 or later. |
