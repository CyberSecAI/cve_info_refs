The provided content is related to a vulnerability in RSA Security's ACE/Agent for Windows, ACE/Agent for Windows NT, and ACE/Agent for Windows 2000, where it fails to properly handle URL encoded characters in a URL. Although the CVE ID is not explicitly mentioned, the vulnerability described aligns with CVE-2001-1461 based on a search for the vulnerability description, vendor (RSA Security) and affected product.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The ACE/Agent software does not properly decode URL encoded characters within a URL.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper handling of URL encoded characters leads to the bypass of authentication mechanisms. The vulnerability exists in `sdiis.dll`, the component responsible for handling authentication requests.
*  **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to bypass authentication, view protected files, and potentially execute programs on the web server, gaining unauthorized access to protected resources.
*   **Attack vectors:**  The attack vector involves crafting a malicious HTTP request containing URL encoded characters targeting protected resources on the web server.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.

The vulnerability is fixed in:
* RSA ACE/Agent 4.4.3 (or later) for Windows NT
* RSA ACE/Agent 1.1.2 (or later) for Windows 2000
* RSA ACE/Agent 5.0 for Windows
