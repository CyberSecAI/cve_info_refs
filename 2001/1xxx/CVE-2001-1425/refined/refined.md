Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with Alcatel ADSL modems, specifically focusing on the "EXPERT" account issue, as described in VU#243592 and related content:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Weak Cryptographic Authentication:** The "EXPERT" administrative account uses a challenge-response password authentication mechanism, but the underlying algorithm is weak and easily reversible. The response is generated using a cryptographic function with predictable variables, allowing attackers to compute the correct password from the challenge presented during the login process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Reversible Password:** The core issue is that the algorithm used to generate the password for the EXPERT account is not secure. The response is based on a cryptographic function applied to the challenge which is easily reversible, allowing an attacker to log in using the computed password
*   **Unrestricted Access:** The EXPERT account is accessible via TELNET, HTTP, and FTP.
*   **Open TFTP Server:** The devices ship with an open TFTP server that is accessible via the LAN, WAN (through bouncing), and even directly from the DSLAM (Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer), meaning anyone on the DSL line can access it. This server has no authentication mechanism, enabling the extraction and modification of configuration data and firmware.
*   **Lack of Firmware Validation:** The devices do not validate the authenticity or integrity of firmware before installation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers gain privileged access to the device with the EXPERT account.
*   **Complete Device Control:** Attackers can reconfigure the device, including changing passwords, setting up port forwarding, and altering other settings.
*   **Malicious Firmware Installation:** Attackers can install custom, malicious firmware to:
    *   Create backdoors.
    *   Install packet sniffers to gather local LAN traffic.
    *   Use the device for denial-of-service attacks.
*   **Permanent Device Disablement:** Attackers can disable the device, requiring a return to the manufacturer.
*   **Information Leakage**: Configuration files can be downloaded via TFTP, exposing sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerabilities by directly accessing the modem via TELNET, HTTP, or FTP.
*   **TFTP Exploitation:** The open TFTP server can be abused for configuration changes, firmware replacement, and password theft, and doesn't require any authentication
*   **IP Bouncing:** UDP packets can be "bounced" through other machines to reach the TFTP service.
*  **Direct DSL Access:** An attacker with access to the phone line or the ability to emulate the DSLAM could use TFTP or other mechanisms to exploit the device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** Attackers need network connectivity to the vulnerable modem on the LAN, via bouncing, or by direct access to the DSL.
*   **Knowledge of the Algorithm:** Attackers must know the cryptographic algorithm and variables used in the challenge-response mechanism to calculate the correct password for the EXPERT account.
*   **TFTP client**: An attacker needs a TFTP client to exploit the TFTP service.
*   **Access to DSL line or ability to emulate a DSLAM:** This enables attackers to gain control of the device through the WAN side.

**Additional notes:**

* The advisory mentions that these vulnerabilities were found in various versions of Alcatel Speed Touch Home and 1000 ADSL modems.
*   The devices use the IP address 10.0.0.138 by default, but this is configurable.
*   The vendor (Alcatel) did not provide a patch or a fix at the time of the advisory.
*   The vulnerabilities could not be mitigated other than by using custom firmware to remove the back door.
