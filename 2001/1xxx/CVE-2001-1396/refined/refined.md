  "vulnerability": "Multiple vulnerabilities in Linux kernel versions prior to 2.2.19",
  "description": "Multiple security vulnerabilities have been found in Linux kernel versions prior to 2.2.19. These vulnerabilities can allow local users to gain root privileges, modify kernel memory, or cause a system crash.",
  "root_cause": "Multiple flaws in various kernel components including ptrace, binfmt_misc, CPIA driver, CPUID and MSR drivers, classifier code, getsockopt and setsockopt system calls, sysctl system call, sockfilter code, SYSV shared memory code, masquerading code, x86 assembly code and UDP port allocation.",
  "weaknesses": [
    "Race condition in ptrace/execve",
    "Direct user page usage in binfmt_misc",
    "Off-by-one error in CPIA driver",
    "Module unloading issue in CPUID and MSR drivers",
    "Hang in classifier code",
    "Incorrect sign bit handling in getsockopt and setsockopt",
	"Incorrect sign bit handling in sysctl",
    "Boundary case abuse in sockfilter",
    "Memory overwrite in SYSV shared memory code",
    "Lax packet length checks in masquerading code",
    "x86 assembly bugs leading to incorrect byte copies",
    "Deadlock in UDP port allocation"

  ],
  "impact": "Local users can gain root privileges, modify kernel memory, or cause a denial of service (system crash). A reiserfs race condition could expose raw disk data to unprivileged users.",
  "attack_vectors": "Local access is required to exploit these vulnerabilities.",
    "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs to have local access to the system, ability to execute code."
