Subject: [Announce] Apache 1.3.20 Released

                            Apache 1.3.20 Released

   The Apache Software Foundation and The Apache Server Project are
   pleased to announce the release of version 1.3.20 of the Apache HTTP
   server.

   This version of Apache is principally a security fix release which
   closes a problem under the Windows and OS2 ports that would segfault
   the server in response to a carefully constructed URL.  It also fixes
   some potential configuration quirks present in the 1.3.19 release.
   A summary of the new features is given at the end of this document.

   We consider Apache 1.3.20 to be the best version of Apache available
   and we strongly recommend that users of older versions, especially of
   the 1.1.x and 1.2.x family, upgrade as soon as possible.  No further
   releases will be made in the 1.2.x family.

   Apache 1.3.20 is available for download from

     <http://httpd.apache.org/dist/httpd/>

   Please see the CHANGES_1.3 file in the same directory for a full list
   of changes.

   Binary distributions are available from

     <http://httpd.apache.org/dist/httpd/binaries/>

   The source and binary distributions are also available via any of the
   mirrors listed at

     <http://www.apache.org/mirrors/>

   Apache 1.3.20 for Win32 and OS2 corrects a serious denial of service
   vulnerability, and users are strongly discouraged from using any
   previous versions on those platforms.

   As of Apache 1.3.17, Win32 binary distributions are now based on the
   Microsoft Installer (.MSI) technology.  This change occured in order
   to resolve the many problems WinME and Win2K users experienced with
   the older InstallShield-based installer .exe file.  While development
   continues to make this new installation method more robust, questions
   should be directed at the news:comp.infosystems.www.servers.ms-windows
   newsgroup.

   As of Apache 1.3.12 binary distributions contain all standard Apache
   modules as shared objects (if supported by the platform) and include
   full source code. Installation is easily done by executing the
   included install script. See the README.bindist and INSTALL.bindist
   files for a complete explanation. Please note that the binary
   distributions are only provided for your convenience and current
   distributions for specific platforms are not always available.

   For an overview of new features introduced after 1.2 please see

     <http://httpd.apache.org/docs/new_features_1_3.html>

   In general, Apache 1.3 offers several substantial improvements over
   version 1.2, including better performance, reliability and a wider
   range of supported platforms, including Windows 95/98 and NT (which
   fall under the "Win32" label), OS2, Netware, and TPE threaded platforms.

   Apache is the most popular web server in the known universe; over half
   of the servers on the Internet are running Apache or one of its
   variants.

   IMPORTANT NOTE FOR WIN32 USERS: Over the years, many users have come
   to trust Apache as a secure and stable server. It must be realized
   that the current Win32 code has not yet reached the levels of the Unix
   version, but is of acceptable quality.  Win32 stability or security
   problems do not reflect on the Unix version.

                         Apache 1.3.20  Major changes

   The primary security fix is:
     * A carefully constructed URI could cause the server to segfault on
       Win32 and OS2, denying access to users until the error was cleared.
       This is resolved on both platforms, no server data vulnerability
       was identified for this denial of service exploit.

   The general bug fixes:
     * Eliminate a potential segfault if an invalid floating point value
       is passed to the ap_snprintf() function, on platforms supporting
       isnan() and isinf().
     * Fix a possible segfault at startup in the detection of a default
       ServerName or IP string when no ServerName was specified.
     * Fixed mod_proxy to retain empty headers, as allowed by RFC2068.
     * Properly resolve the location of ndbm on Linux and some glibc2
       builds, where ndbm.h is in the nonstandard db1/ subdir.

   Win32 bug fixes:
     * Win32 now properly handles the SSI exec cmd tag.  Due to argument
       parsing issues with spaces and slashes, cmd is interpreted as an
       executable file, not a long command line string.
     * Resolved a threading problem with WinNT/2K services, allowing
       modules such as mod_jserv and mod_perl to shut down cleanly.
     * Resolved stdin and stdout pipes for the parent Win32 service
       process, solving bugs such as "dup2(stdin) failed" when trying
       to use piped logs.

   Netware specific bug fixes:
     * Netware initial screen allows the -s parameter to switch to the
       system console screen, warning messages during startup are now
       displayed.
     * Netware added '.' and '..' to the directory listing so mod_autoindex
       will now display the parent directory.
     * NetWare now shuts down cleanly in error conditions, such as a failure
       while reading the httpd.conf file.

   The main new features include:
     * Enhanced rotatelogs to allow a UTC offset to be specified, and
       the format logfile names with human-readable date/time stamps.
     * Added the NOESCAPE (NS) flag to RewriteRule, to disable *all*
       normal URI escaping.  Note incautious use can give unexpected
       results or introduce security risks.
     * Added the '\' character to RewriteRule to allow escaping of
       special characters.  Allows embedding of both the '$' and '%'
       characters in the results, so 'foo\$1' translates to 'foo$1'
       rather than 'foo\<value of $1>'.
     * Added the -V flag to suexec, to display the compile-time settings
       with which it was built.  (Only valid for root or the HTTPD_USER
       username.)
     * Introduced EBCDIC conversion configuration options, controlling the
       conversion based on MIME type or file suffix.
     * Support for the Cygwin 1.x platform (a POSIX emulation layer for
       Win32 systems, see <http://www.cygwin.com>).  Note this is an entirely
       different implementation than the native calls in the win32 port.
     * Support for building modules with apxs under Win32.  cygwin builders
       must use a cygwin build of perl to avoid MSVC handling.

It seems likely that the Apache 2.0.18 tarball will be released as "alpha"-level code, due to problems on some Linux platforms, and a mod\_dav configuration issue.  The debate over the future of mod\_proxy in Apache 2.0 continues and sees no sign of resolution. In February of this year, the mod\_proxy code from the Apache 2.0 repository was moved into a separate CVS tree to allow independent development to continue without affecting the stability of the core server code. One option that has been discussed is for the mod\_proxy team to distribute an tarball bundling both the core Apache code and the proxy code.   ---  Featured articles In this section we highlight some of the articles on the web that are of interest to Apache users.  The Developer Shed presents step-by-step instructions for [building Apache, MySQL, WebDAV and PHP on Mac OS X.](http://www.devshed.com/Server_Side/Administration/BuildingOnOSX/) All these programs compile and run on Mac OS X due to its BSD-based UNIX core known as *Darwin*. To avoid confusion, the Apache Web server built is not enhanced with `mod_ssl`.  PHP programmers may be interested in [creating a spell checking tool](http://www.zend.com/zend/spotlight/spellchecking.php) and [setting up an event calendar](http://www.zend.com/zend/tut/calendar-ver7f.php) using PHP. The former shows you how to create a single class that allows you to manage multiple dictionaries and check the spelling of any word quickly and effectively. The second article covers the development of a calendar system that inserts and retrieves relevant event information from a MySQL database.   ---  Apache 1.3.20 Released Apache 1.3.20 was released on 22nd May 2001 and is now the latest version of the Apache server. The previous release was 1.3.19, released on the 28th February 2001. [See what was new in Apache 1.3.19](http://www.apacheweek.com/issues/01-03-02#apache1319).  Apache 1.3.20 is available in source form for compiling on Unix or Windows, for download from the [main Apache site](http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/) or from any [mirror download site](http://www.apache.org/mirrors/).  This is a bug fix and minor upgrade release, with a few new features. Users should upgrade if they have noticed particular bugs mentioned below or would like to use any of the new features. The significant overhaul to the the Apache Bench program, *ab*, which we reported on [in April](http://www.apacheweek.com/issues/01-04-20#dev) were not included in this release due to some portability problems.  Due to security issues, any sites using versions prior to Apache 1.3.14 on Unix, or all versions on Windows or OS2, should upgrade as soon as possible.   Security vulnerabilities    * A vulnerability was found in the Win32 and OS2 ports of   Apache 1.3. A client submitting a carefully constructed URI   could cause a General Protection Fault in a child process,   bringing up a message box which would have to be cleared by   the operator to resume operation. This vulnerability   introduced no identified means to compromise the server   other than introducing a possible denial of service.   New features The main new features in 1.3.20 (compared to 1.3.19) are:   * Enhanced rotatelogs functionality to allow the logfile name   to include customisable date stamps (using the standard   `strftime` syntax) as well as the ability to   specify the time offset from UTC * A new flag, `NOESCAPE (NS)` can be used in   `RewriteRule` directives to disable all normal   URI escaping. Use this flag with caution as it is easy to   introduce security risks.   Selected new features that relate to Windows platforms:   * Integration of support for the [Cygwin](http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/)   platform. Cygwin is a Unix emulation layer for Windows. * The `apxs` tool, used to aid building modules   for Apache, can now be used on Windows platforms.   Selected new features relating to other platforms:   * EBCDIC support has been overhauled and is now configurable.   EBCDIC support is needed for platforms such as   Fujitsu-Siemens' BS2000, the IBM OS/390, and IBM TPF   operating systems. * Various changes for Apache on NetWare including the ability   to shutdown cleanly, properly displaying error and warning   messages, and increasing the hard server limit as NetWare   is able to handle a large number of service request   threads. Directory indexes on NetWare will now also include   "." and ".." entries.   Bugs fixed The following bugs were found in Apache 1.3.19 and have been fixed in Apache 1.3.20   * `mod_proxy` is now able to pass on empty HTTP   headers. These were previously stripped. * Fix a possible segfault at startup when no   `ServerName` is specified * Fix a possible segfault on some platforms if an invalid   floating point value is passed to an internal routine * Properly resolve the location of the ndbm library on Linux   and some glibc2 builds, where headers are not in the   standard locations. This affected builds on Red Hat Linux 7   and SuSe 7. [PR#6929](http://archive.apache.org/gnats/6929) * For server-side includes on Windows, properly handle the   `exec` tag. * Fix a potentially serious threading problem with Windows NT   and Windows 2000 services. Modules such as   `mod_jserv` and `mod_perl` will not   be able to shut down cleanly. * On Windows fix a bug which could cause messages such as   "dup2(stdin) failed" when using piped logs. | | --- | | --- | |  |

We suggest the following location for your download:

[**https://dlcdn.apache.org/**](https://dlcdn.apache.org/)

Alternate download locations are suggested below.

It is essential that you
[verify the integrity](#verify)
of the downloaded file using
the PGP signature (
`.asc`
file) or a hash (
`.md5`
or
`.sha*`
file).

# HTTP [¶](#http "Permanent link")

[**https://dlcdn.apache.org/**](https://dlcdn.apache.org/)

# Backup Sites [¶](#backup "Permanent link")

[**https://dlcdn.apache.org/**](https://dlcdn.apache.org/)

# Verify the integrity of the files [¶](#verify "Permanent link")

It is essential that you verify the integrity of the downloaded file using
the PGP signature (
`.asc`
file) or a hash (
`.md5`
or
`.sha*`
file). Please read
[Verifying Apache Software
Foundation Releases](/info/verification.html)
for more information on why
you should verify our releases.

The PGP signature can be verified using PGP or GPG. First download the
`KEYS`
as well as the
`asc`
signature file for the relevant distribution.
Make sure you get these files from the main distribution site, rather than
from a mirror. Then verify the signatures using

```

        % gpg --import KEYS
        % gpg --verify downloaded_file.asc downloaded_file

```

*or*

```

        % pgpk -a KEYS
        % pgpv downloaded_file.asc

```

*or*

```

        % pgp -ka KEYS
        % pgp downloaded_file.asc

```

Alternatively, you can verify the hash on the file.

Hashes can be calculated using GPG:

```

        % gpg --print-md SHA256 downloaded_file

```

The output should be compared with the contents of the SHA256 file.
Similarly for other hashes (SHA512, SHA1, MD5 etc) which may be provided.

Windows 7 and later systems should all now have certUtil:

```

        % certUtil -hashfile pathToFileToCheck

```

HashAlgorithm choices: MD2 MD4 MD5 SHA1 SHA256 SHA384 SHA512

Unix-like systems (and macOS) will have a utility called
md5, md5sum or shasum
