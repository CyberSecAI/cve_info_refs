- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `lastlines.cgi` script improperly filters user input, specifically the `$error_log` variable, which is used to construct a file path.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - **Path traversal:** The script does not sanitize the `$error_log` input, allowing attackers to use `../` sequences to navigate outside the intended directory specified by `$unix_dir`.
    - **Command execution:** A missing `<` in the `open()` function allows the attacker to inject shell commands via the `$error_log` variable.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - **Path traversal**: An attacker can read any file on the server that is accessible to the webserver user.
    - **Command execution**: An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server with the permissions of the webserver user.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - The attacker crafts a malicious `$error_log` input by sending it to the `lastlines.cgi` script through HTTP request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server running `lastlines.cgi`.
    - The attacker does not require any special privileges.
