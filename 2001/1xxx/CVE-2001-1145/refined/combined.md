Patches for the OpenBSD base system are distributed as unified diffs.
Each patch contains usage instructions.
All the following patches are also available in one
[tar.gz file](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.8.tar.gz)
for convenience.

Patches for supported releases are also incorporated into the
[-stable branch](stable.html).

* **001: RELIABILITY FIX: Nov 10, 2000**

  When running a sparc with a serial console, certain types of interrupts would
  cause great grief.

  [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.8/sparc/001_zsconsole.patch)

  * **002: IMPLEMENTATION FIX: Nov 10, 2000**
      *All architectures*

    In ssh(1), skey support for SSH1 protocol was broken. Some people might consider
    that kind of important.

    [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.8/common/002_sshskey.patch)

    * **003: RELIABILITY FIX: Nov 17, 2000**

      Configuring a qec+qe causes a NMI panic.

      [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.8/sparc/003_qe.patch)

      * **004: RELIABILITY FIX: Nov 17, 2000**
          *All architectures*

        First off, AES (Rijndael) encryption and decryption were broken for IPsec
        and swap encryption.

        Secondly, the AES code did not work properly on big endian machines.

        [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.8/common/004_rijndael.patch)
        This is the second revision of the patch.

        * **005: SECURITY FIX: Dec 4, 2000**
            *All architectures*

          OpenBSD 2.8's ftpd contains a one-byte overflow in the replydirname() function.

          [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.8/common/005_ftpd.patch)
          You can view the [OpenBSD Advisory](advisories/ftpd_replydirname.txt) here.

          * **006: STABILITY FIX: Dec 4, 2000**

            On some machines, a PCIBIOS device driver interrupt allocation bug can cause a
            kernel hang while probing PCI devices. If you have this symptom, you can disable
            PCIBIOS as a workaround. To do this,
            + Enter the User Kernel Configuration by booting with the
              option "boot -c".+ Once at the *UKC>* prompt, enter
                > ```
                >
                > 	UKC> disable pcibios
                > 	UKC> quit
                > ```

                + See [this page](./faq/faq5.html#5.6) after a successful
                  boot for instructions on how to re-write your kernel to disable PCIBIOS
                  permanently.

            * **007: INSTALL PROBLEM: Dec 4, 2000**

              The X packages
              [share28.tgz](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/2.8/sun3/xshare28.tgz)
              and
              [font28.tgz](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/2.8/sun3/xfont28.tgz)
              were not on the CD, and only available via FTP install. These packages can be
              added post-install by using the following command:
              ```

                  # cd /; tar xvfpz xshare28.tgz
                  # cd /; tar xvfpz xfont28.tgz

              ```

              * **008: SECURITY FIX: Dec 7, 2000**
                  *All architectures*

                Two problems have recently been discovered in the KerberosIV code.

                1. A symlink problem was discovered in the KerberosIV password checking
                routines /usr/bin/su and /usr/bin/login, which makes it possible for a
                local user to overwrite any file on the local machine.

                2. It is possible to specify environment variables in telnet
                which will be passed over the to the remote host. This makes it
                possible to set environment variables on the remote side, including
                ones that have special meaning on the server. It is not clear at this
                time what the impact is, but we recommend everyone to upgrade their
                machines immediately.

                [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.8/common/008_kerberos.patch)

                * **009: SECURITY FIX: Dec 10, 2000**
                    *All architectures*

                  Another problem exists in the Kerberos libraries.

                  [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.8/common/009_kerberos2.patch)

                  * **010: RELIABILITY FIX: Dec 11, 2000**
                      *All architectures*

                    A crash could occur during fast routing, if IPSEC was enabled.

                    [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.8/common/010_fastroute.patch)

                    * **011: RELIABILITY FIX: Dec 13, 2000**
                        *All architectures*

                      The crypto subsystem could incorrectly fail to run certain software ciphers,
                      if a hardware card existed in the machine.

                      [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.8/common/011_hwcrypto.patch)

                      * **012: INSTALL PROBLEM: Dec 14, 2000**

                        The IMac DV+ (and probably some other machines) incorrectly identify their video
                        hardware, but it is possible to work around the problem.

                        [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.8/powerpc/012_imacdv.patch)

                        * **013: SECURITY FIX: Dec 18, 2000**
                            *All architectures*

                          [Procfs](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-2.8/mount_procfs.8) contained numerous overflows, which could lead an intruder to root permissions. Procfs is NOT enabled by default in OpenBSD.

                          [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.8/common/013_procfs.patch)

                            Improve xlock(1)'s authentication by authenticating via a pipe in an early forked process. No known vulnerability exists, this is just a precautionary patch.

                            [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.8/common/014_xlock.patch)

                            In addition to a source code patch, new xlock binaries have been created for each architecture listed below. Place these binaries at */usr/X11R6/bin/xlock*
                            and *chmod 4755 /usr/X11R6/bin/xlock*.

                            + [Xlock - i386](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.8/i386/xlock)+ [Xlock - sparc](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.8/sparc/xlock)+ [Xlock - mac68k](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.8/mac68k/xlock)+ [Xlock - powerpc](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.8/powerpc/xlock)+ [Xlock - amiga](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.8/amiga/xlock)+ [Xlock - hp300](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.8/hp300/xlock)+ [Xlock - mvme68k](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.8/mvme68k/xlock)

                              Some machines locked up while trying to use the mouse in console mode. This patch solves that problem.

                                Allow ThunderLAN cards to share interrupts nicely.

                                    with ISC BIND 4.9.8-REL, which fixes some buffer vulnerabilities (actually it appears
                                    that these were already impossible to exploit beforehand).

                                        Client side ident protocol was broken in libwrap, affecting anything using libwrap including [tcpd](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-2.8/tcpd.8). The effect of this was that libwrap would never retrieve and log ident values from remote hosts on connections.

                                            The **USER\_LDT** kernel option allows an attacker to gain access to privileged areas of kernel memory. This option is not on by default.

                                                        The signal handlers in [sendmail(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-2.8/sendmail.8) contain code that is unsafe in the
                                                        context of a signal handler. This leads to potentially serious
                                                        race conditions. At the moment this is a theoretical attack only
                                                        and can only be exploited on the local host (if at all).
