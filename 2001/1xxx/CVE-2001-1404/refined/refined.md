Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2001-1404:

**CVE Description:** PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval

**Analysis of Content:**

The provided content, particularly from the `marc.info` source and the `bugzilla.mozilla.org` bug report, reveals that CVE-2001-1404 relates to a security vulnerability in Bugzilla, specifically the storage of user passwords in plaintext within the MySQL database.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   User passwords were being stored in plaintext in the database.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Plaintext Password Storage:** The primary vulnerability was the direct storage of user passwords in the database without any form of encryption or hashing. This exposed user credentials to anyone with access to the database.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** A malicious actor with access to the database could retrieve user passwords, gaining unauthorized access to Bugzilla accounts.
*   **Lateral Movement:** Users often reuse passwords, therefore compromising Bugzilla passwords could allow access to other systems.
*   **Confidentiality breach:** Sensitive information stored within Bugzilla could be exposed.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Database Access:** The attack vector is primarily gaining access to the underlying MySQL database. This could be achieved through various means, including:
    *   SQL injection vulnerabilities.
    *   Compromise of the database server.
    *   Internal access by malicious users within the organization.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to have the ability to access the MySQL database where Bugzilla stores its data. This could be gained through a compromised webserver, vulnerable application, or unauthorized database access.
*   No network level access is mentioned in this context, therefore the attacker's position is that they have database level access.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was addressed in Bugzilla version 2.14 by encrypting the passwords in the database and migrating to a password change request validated by email instead of email delivery.
*   The bug report indicates that a fix for this vulnerability was included in the patch for another bug related to MySQL encryption (`bug 77473`).
*   The `marc.info` email also mentions that this was a serious issue, highlighting the severity of the plaintext password storage.

The `redhat.com` content is not directly related to the CVE, it is a support landing page for Red Hat products and services.

**Summary**

The content describes a vulnerability where Bugzilla stored user passwords in plain text within its database. This could allow an attacker with access to the database to steal user credentials. The issue was resolved in Bugzilla version 2.14 by storing the password in an encrypted format, and forcing users to reset their password via an email link.
