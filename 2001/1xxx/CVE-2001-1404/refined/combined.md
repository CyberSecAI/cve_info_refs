|  | |

System administrators at my site are concerned about my running bugzilla in one
of their machines since users tend to use the same password for bugzilla and
for their login account in the other machines. This password being plaintext in
the DB mekes it available to the bugzilla admin (me) at any time.
Password should be only stored in it's encrypted form on the DB.

See also [bug 15980](/show_bug.cgi?id=15980 "RESOLVED FIXED - Password shown in the Location-bar and in html"): Password visible in location bar in browser
I agree, this is a concern of mine, too, for my local system.
Do keep in mind that unless you're using SSL, the passwords are transmitting in
cleartext over the network, too (if everyone's inside a firewall, this part might
not be a big deal).
Marking 2.14 since this is a security issue.
Target Milestone: --- → Bugzilla 2.14

Making this bug depend on [bug 77473](/show_bug.cgi?id=77473 "RESOLVED FIXED - mysql's encrypt is not DB independent") because existing installations will have to
re-crypt their user's passwords when that fix is applied, and they need to keep
the plain-text versions of those passwords around until then in order to be able
to do that.
Depends on: [77473](/show_bug.cgi?id=77473 "RESOLVED FIXED - mysql's encrypt is not DB independent")

All users of Bugzilla, the bug-tracking system from mozilla.org, are
strongly recommended to update to version 2.14.

Bugzilla 2.14 is a general security update, but not all of the security
issues are serious.

Serious issues include:

    * Multiple instances where data on "confidential" bugs could be
      obtained by valid users of the system who are not authorized to.
    * Multiple instances of security holes where parameters were not being
      checked/escaped properly.

There are many patches that need to be applied to properly close these
holes, so they are not included here.  If you will not be upgrading your
system to 2.14 and instead wish to apply these patches to your existing
system, please consult the bug reports on bugzilla.mozilla.org for the bug
numbers listed below, where you can obtain the patches attached to those
bugs.

Complete bug reports for all bugs can be obtained by visiting the
following URL:  <http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=XXXXX>
where you replace the XXXXX at the end of the URL with a bug number as
listed below.  You may also enter the bug numbers in the "enter a bug#" box
on the main page at <http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/> or in the footer of any
other page on bugzilla.mozilla.org.

*** SECURITY ISSUES RESOLVED ***

- Multiple instances of unauthorized access to confidential
  bugs has been fixed.
  (bug 39524, 39526, 39527, 39531, 39533, 70189, 82781)
- Multiple instances of untrusted parameters not being
  checked/escaped was fixed.  These included definite security
  holes.
  (bug 38854, 38855, 38859, 39536, 87701, 95235)
- After logging in passwords no longer appear in the URL.
  (bug 15980)
- Procedures to prevent unauthorized access to confidential
  files are now simpler.  In particular the shadow directory
  no longer exists and the data/comments file no longer needs
  to be directly accessible, so the entire data directory can
  be blocked.  However, no changes are required here if you
  have a properly secured 2.12 installation as no new files
  must be protected.
  (bug 71552, 73191)
- If they do not already exist, checksetup.pl will attempt to
  write Apache .htaccess files by default, to prevent
  unauthoried access to confidential files.  You can turn this
  off in the localconfig file.
  (bug 76154)
- Sanity check can now only be run by people in the 'editbugs'
  group.  Although it would be better to have a separate
  group, this is not possible until the limitation on the
  number of groups allowed has been removed.
  (bug 54556)
- The password is no longer stored in plaintext form.  It will
  be eradicated next time you run checksetup.pl.  A user must
  now change their password via a password change request that
  gets validated at their e-mail account, rather than have it
  mailed to them.
  (bug 74032)
- When you using product groups and you move a bug between
  products (single or mass change), the bug will no longer be
  restricted to the old product's group (if it was) and will
  be restricted to the new product's group.
  (bug 66235)
- There are now options on a bug to choose whether the
  reporter, assignee, QA and CCs can access a bug even if
  they aren't in groups the bug it is restricted to.
  (bug 39816)
- You can no longer mark a bug as a duplicate of a bug you
  can't see, and if you mark a bug a duplicate of a bug
  the reporter cannot see you will be given options as to
  what to do regarding adding the reporter of the resolved
  bug to the CC of the open bug.
  (bug 96085)
