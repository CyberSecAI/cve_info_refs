| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=22187#c0)  Shane Kennedy    2000-12-12 22:54:05 UTC  ``` Tcl/Tk supplied with RH7, does not support the -mode option with  fconfigure.  Neither do the supplied libraries.  Libraries (exactly which  one) supplied with RH6.1 are O.K. for compile.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=22187#c1)  Eido Inoue    2001-02-08 04:38:58 UTC  ``` Are you referring to the  fconfigure -translation mode  where mode is for setting the lf/cr raw/cooked aspects?    ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=22187#c2)  Shane Kennedy    2001-02-20 11:53:44 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 10460](attachment.cgi?id=10460 "example of problem") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=10460&action=edit "example of problem") example of problem   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=22187#c3)  Anne Possoz    2001-03-08 13:52:50 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 12083](attachment.cgi?id=12083 "detailed explanation and a way to solve it...") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=12083&action=edit "detailed explanation and a way to solve it...") detailed explanation and a way to solve it...   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=22187#c4)  Shane Kennedy    2001-03-08 14:02:57 UTC  ``` Thanks for the fix.  It will save much tim on next system build.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=22187#c5)  Need Real Name    2001-03-08 16:45:19 UTC  ``` The reason is that Tcl's configure script doesn't detect the systems I/O API (termios, termio or sgtty) if configure's stdin isn't a tty. I guess that Red Hat build the distributions packages for their distributions in an automated environment where stdin is a pipe or /dev/null. Therefore the correct API can't be detected and the option -mode isn't compiled in. When someone rebuilds the package by hand, stdin is a tty and everything works.  The solution is a patch against unix/tcl.m4 I submitted to the Tcl patch manager at SourceForge. It makes configure detect the API even when stdin is no tty.  The patch has not yet been accepted by the Tcl maintainers.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=22187#c6)  Eido Inoue    2001-03-14 10:52:04 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 28224](show_bug.cgi?id=28224 "CLOSED ERRATA - expect searches /var/tmp before /usr/lib") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=22187#c7)  Eido Inoue    2001-03-14 10:54:10 UTC  ``` build scripts need to be patched so /var/tmp doesn't get pulled into the paths and stdin is recognized to be a tty   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=22187#c8)  Need Real Name    2001-03-26 13:01:49 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 13665](attachment.cgi?id=13665&action=diff "Why we need a fix: additional privs exploit for mkpasswd / /var/tmp - trivial...") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=13665&action=edit "Why we need a fix: additional privs exploit for mkpasswd / /var/tmp - trivial...") Why we need a fix: additional privs exploit for mkpasswd / /var/tmp - trivial...   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=22187#c9)  Need Real Name    2001-03-29 08:38:23 UTC  ``` Why have these bugs been marked as duplicates? Though both are related to Tcl/Tk and the buildsystem, they cover totally different areas. There is already a patch that fixes this one and I am working on a fix for #28224 that doesn not depend on changes in the build system.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=22187#c10)  Need Real Name    2001-04-02 09:42:44 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 14424](attachment.cgi?id=14424&action=diff "Quick fix bug #28224") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=14424&action=edit "Quick fix bug #28224") Quick fix [bug #28224](show_bug.cgi?id=28224 "CLOSED ERRATA - expect searches /var/tmp before /usr/lib")   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=22187#c11)  Eido Inoue    2001-06-28 14:35:57 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 42630](show_bug.cgi?id=42630 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - fconfigure doesn't recognize -mode switch") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=22187#c12)  Eido Inoue    2001-07-24 15:39:31 UTC  ``` fixed in release 60.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=22187#c13)  Mark J. Cox    2002-08-12 19:38:50 UTC  ``` An errata has been issued which should help the problem described in this bug report.  This report is therefore being closed with a resolution of ERRATA.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=28224#c0)  Need Real Name    2001-02-18 11:43:26 UTC  ``` /usr/bin/expect searches a series of directories under /var/tmp before looking in the correct location for the library file /usr/lib/libexpect5.31.so , which allows a malicious user to cause commands to be executed as an other user, and in the case of mkpasswd, probably root.  Although I haven't looked at the source, a preliminary investigation (strings `which expect`) suggests that this is due to a path being given in the file of "/var/tmp/tcltk-root/usr/lib:/usr/X11R6/lib" (which may be a remnant from testing?)  [root@clarity /tmp]# strace -o /tmp/twall expect </dev/null [root@clarity /tmp]# grep -n /tmp/ /tmp/twall  5:open("/var/tmp/tcltk-root/usr/lib/i686/mmx/libexpect5.31.so", O_RDONLY) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory) 6:stat64("/var/tmp/tcltk-root/usr/lib/i686/mmx", 0xbfffec4c) = -1 ENOSYS (Function not implemented) 7:stat("/var/tmp/tcltk-root/usr/lib/i686/mmx", 0xbfffeb6c) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory) 8:open("/var/tmp/tcltk-root/usr/lib/i686/libexpect5.31.so", O_RDONLY) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory) 9:stat("/var/tmp/tcltk-root/usr/lib/i686", 0xbfffeb6c) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory) 10:open("/var/tmp/tcltk-root/usr/lib/mmx/libexpect5.31.so", O_RDONLY) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory) 11:stat("/var/tmp/tcltk-root/usr/lib/mmx", 0xbfffeb6c) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory) 12:open("/var/tmp/tcltk-root/usr/lib/libexpect5.31.so", O_RDONLY) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory) 13:stat("/var/tmp/tcltk-root/usr/lib", 0xbfffeb6c) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory) [root@clarity /tmp]#   The utility /usr/bin/mkpasswd is an expect script that is designed to be used by root to change passwords of users to a random string.   If a malicious user were to put a trojan version of libexpect5.31.so in  /var/tmp/tcltk-root/usr/lib/i686/mmx/ or one of the other directories, that would be loaded and executed.  [root@clarity /tmp]# su evil [evil@clarity /tmp]$ mkdirhier /var/tmp/tcltk-root/usr/lib/i686/mmx/            [evil@clarity /tmp]$ touch /var/tmp/tcltk-root/usr/lib/i686/mmx/libexpect5.31.so [evil@clarity /tmp]$ exit                                                   [root@clarity /tmp]# strace -o /tmp/twall expect </dev/null [root@clarity /tmp]# grep -n /tmp/ /tmp/twall  5:open("/var/tmp/tcltk-root/usr/lib/i686/mmx/libexpect5.31.so", O_RDONLY) = 4 [root@clarity /tmp]# more /tmp/twall  execve("/usr/bin/expect", ["expect"], [/* 29 vars */]) = 0 uname({sys="Linux", node="clarity", ...}) = 0 brk(0)                                  = 0x8049c90 open("/etc/ld.so.preload", O_RDONLY)    = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory) open("/var/tmp/tcltk-root/usr/lib/i686/mmx/libexpect5.31.so", O_RDONLY) = 4 read(4, "", 1024)                       = 0 close(4)                                = 0 --- SIGSEGV (Segmentation fault) --- +++ killed by SIGSEGV +++ [root@clarity /tmp]#   If the file had been a valid library, instead of a 0 byte file, it would've loaded instead.  A number of other programs also use this utility, but no others seem to be as likely to be run by root.   --zen-parse   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=28224#c1)  Need Real Name    2001-03-13 14:10:08 UTC  ``` What happened to the severity rating? it appears blank? And is anything being done? (If you want, I'll write a root exploit for it? Would that speed things up?) --zen-parse    ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=28224#c2)  Eido Inoue    2001-03-14 10:52:13 UTC  ``` The problem with /var/tmp getting put in the path is because tcls build script isn't designed to work in properly in non-interactive environments. a set of patches needs to be applied to the build process so that tcl doesn't use the query the current temporary environment.   *** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of [22187](show_bug.cgi?id=22187 "CLOSED ERRATA - Tcl/Tk build env doesn't work well with auto build environment") ***   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=28224#c3)  Mark J.
