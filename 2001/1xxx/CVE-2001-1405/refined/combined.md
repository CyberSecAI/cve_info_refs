Subject:    Security Advisory for Bugzilla v2.13 and older
From:       [David Miller <justdave () syndicomm ! com>](?a=99912907200004&r=1&w=2)
Date:       [2001-08-29 22:55:42](?l=bugtraq&r=1&w=2&b=200108)
[Download RAW [message](?l=bugtraq&m=99912899900567&q=mbox) or [body](?l=bugtraq&m=99912899900567&q=raw)]

All users of Bugzilla, the bug-tracking system from mozilla.org, are
strongly recommended to update to version 2.14.

Bugzilla 2.14 is a general security update, but not all of the security
issues are serious.

Serious issues include:

    * Multiple instances where data on "confidential" bugs could be
      obtained by valid users of the system who are not authorized to.
    * Multiple instances of security holes where parameters were not being
      checked/escaped properly.

There are many patches that need to be applied to properly close these
holes, so they are not included here.  If you will not be upgrading your
system to 2.14 and instead wish to apply these patches to your existing
system, please consult the bug reports on bugzilla.mozilla.org for the bug
numbers listed below, where you can obtain the patches attached to those
bugs.

Complete bug reports for all bugs can be obtained by visiting the
following URL:  <http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=XXXXX>
where you replace the XXXXX at the end of the URL with a bug number as
listed below.  You may also enter the bug numbers in the "enter a bug#" box
on the main page at <http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/> or in the footer of any
other page on bugzilla.mozilla.org.

*** SECURITY ISSUES RESOLVED ***

- Multiple instances of unauthorized access to confidential
  bugs has been fixed.
  (bug 39524, 39526, 39527, 39531, 39533, 70189, 82781)
- Multiple instances of untrusted parameters not being
  checked/escaped was fixed.  These included definite security
  holes.
  (bug 38854, 38855, 38859, 39536, 87701, 95235)
- After logging in passwords no longer appear in the URL.
  (bug 15980)
- Procedures to prevent unauthorized access to confidential
  files are now simpler.  In particular the shadow directory
  no longer exists and the data/comments file no longer needs
  to be directly accessible, so the entire data directory can
  be blocked.  However, no changes are required here if you
  have a properly secured 2.12 installation as no new files
  must be protected.
  (bug 71552, 73191)
- If they do not already exist, checksetup.pl will attempt to
  write Apache .htaccess files by default, to prevent
  unauthoried access to confidential files.  You can turn this
  off in the localconfig file.
  (bug 76154)
- Sanity check can now only be run by people in the 'editbugs'
  group.  Although it would be better to have a separate
  group, this is not possible until the limitation on the
  number of groups allowed has been removed.
  (bug 54556)
- The password is no longer stored in plaintext form.  It will
  be eradicated next time you run checksetup.pl.  A user must
  now change their password via a password change request that
  gets validated at their e-mail account, rather than have it
  mailed to them.
  (bug 74032)
- When you using product groups and you move a bug between
  products (single or mass change), the bug will no longer be
  restricted to the old product's group (if it was) and will
  be restricted to the new product's group.
  (bug 66235)
- There are now options on a bug to choose whether the
  reporter, assignee, QA and CCs can access a bug even if
  they aren't in groups the bug it is restricted to.
  (bug 39816)
- You can no longer mark a bug as a duplicate of a bug you
  can't see, and if you mark a bug a duplicate of a bug
  the reporter cannot see you will be given options as to
  what to do regarding adding the reporter of the resolved
  bug to the CC of the open bug.
  (bug 96085)

<http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/sanitycheck.cgi> can be run from an
ordinary bugzilla account (e.g. mine). On a bugs database
as large as bugzilla.mozilla.org, that effectively counts as
a DoS if done repeatedly.

CCing a couple mozilla.org folks. Any comments on this?

He's got a point. Making it require a logged-in, priviledged account to use
wouldn't be a bad thing. Another reason for doing so is that it makes public
some weird inconsistencies in the database, and it's not inconceivable that
these could somehow be used in a security exploit.
It is worth keeping in mind that it's essentially impossible to prevent DoS
attacks on apps like Bugzilla anyway. All you have to do is construct a
sufficiently complex saved query and run multiple instances simultaneously.

|  | |

The only point I have to add is that people who perhaps might not have not been
"privileged" have in the past used this facility to report bugs (numbers escape
me, Dave I think it was you?). I suspect sanitycheck.cgi has been largely
ignored by mozilla.org. An implementation of [bug #45207](/show_bug.cgi?id=45207 "RESOLVED FIXED - Automated sanity check that can send an e-mail if there are problems") should make this a
non-issue.
We should try to remove as many DoS attacks as possible.
It's possible future versions of Bugzilla could have better indexing to reduce
the load those queries generate, and we could restrict the number of concurrent
queries per IP (3 should be plenty). Not perfect, but many attackers aren't
very advanced. I believe the major thing we've seen so far is the occasional
bug stomping, so we could probably get to 99%.

Interestingly enough, sanity check only appears on the footer if you're in the
"tweakparams" group.

See also [bug 69616](/show_bug.cgi?id=69616 "VERIFIED FIXED - Edit sanity check?") for creating a new group for the ability to run
sanitycheck.cgi.

Possibly a DOS in quantity -> we'll see about this for 2.14.
I'd be inclined against tightening this up too much on b.m.o though, because
some of us run this on b.m.o and file bugs on it.Target Milestone: --- → Bugzilla 2.14

perhaps make you log in for it, and require editbugs privs. I'm sure most of us
that actually use it legitimately have editbugs.

editbugs is easy to get, what about another group? cansanity?

| [Comment 9](/show_bug.cgi?id=54556#c9)• 24 years ago |
|  | |

The problem w/creating a system group (esp. just for sanitycheck) is that it
takes away from the number of available product groups. I think editbugs should
be restrictive enough as it will keep "just anybody" from running it.

I find the &&/|| much harder to understand then a simply if/unless block (esp.
in this instance). Is there a techincal reason for using this syntax?

| [Comment 12](/show_bug.cgi?id=54556#c12)• 24 years ago |
|  | |

There isn't a technical reason for the syntax I used, I just find it cleaner and
more readable in many situations, although I agree that in this case it might be
more logical to break out &confirm\_login since that function always returns
either a true value or stops execution.

[Bug #69616](/show_bug.cgi?id=69616 "VERIFIED FIXED - Edit sanity check?") wasn't about a new group for sanity checks, but I've filed [bug #91761](/show_bug.cgi?id=91761 "RESOLVED FIXED - Sanity Check is too broadly accessible")
on it.
