It's not only Respondus, but many other programs that needs to store
passwords for, let's say, FTP access that use a very weak encryption system.

Two examples I recently discovered are UltraEdit v8.x and CuteFtp v4.2.
Both use a very weak encoding system to store passwords for the FTP
accounts. CuteFtp uses quite a weak system, but when using a password for
the site manager, the sm.dat file is encrypted and it makes access to the
encrypted passwords a little harder..

For some more info about the used encryption methods:

In the help-file from UltraEdit, the following section can be found:

This checkbox determines if UltraEdit will save the password for later
reference.  If not the user will be prompted for the password as
required.  Note  if the password is saved it is stored on the system.  It
is encrypted however the encryption mechanism is unsophisticated and should
not be relied upon as a  method of security.
