Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the use of weak or "unsophisticated" encryption mechanisms for storing passwords. This makes it relatively easy for an attacker to decrypt or recover the stored passwords.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Weak encryption algorithm.
- Passwords are saved to disk using an easily reversible encoding/encryption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthorized access to user accounts, such as FTP accounts.
- Exposure of sensitive information stored in user accounts.
- The severity depends on what those passwords are used for (FTP access, application access etc.).

**Attack Vectors:**
- Direct access to the system where the passwords are stored.
- An attacker could access and read the configuration files where the weakly encrypted passwords are saved.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to the system or to the storage medium where the application stores its configuration and passwords.
- Basic understanding of reverse engineering or known weak encoding methods would be required to decrypt passwords.

**Additional Details:**
The content mentions that this is not unique to Respondus and gives examples of UltraEdit and CuteFtp.
It also notes that UltraEdit itself states in its help file that the encryption is unsophisticated and should not be relied upon for security.
