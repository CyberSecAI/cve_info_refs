	Immunix OS Security Advisory Summary

Date:			January 10, 2000
Advisory ID:		IMNX-2000-70-028-01
Author:			Greg Kroah-Hartman <greg@wirex.com>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

  In an internal audit conducted while preparing Immunix Linux 7.0 we
  noticed a loads of potential temp file race problems in lots of
  different programs.  This came to light due to the "new" linker
  warning message in glibc whenever mktemp(), tempname() or other
  insecure temp file generation functions are used.

  This summary message encompasses 12 different packages that we have
  released updates for in order to try to cut down on the amount of
  different email messages that people get.

  The packages and versions effected are:
        apache       1.3.14 and also 2.0a9, the htpasswd and htdigest helper programs
        tcpdump      arpwatch version 2.1a4
        squid        2.3 STABLE and 2.4
        linuxconf    1.19r through 1.23r, the vpop3d program
        mgetty       1.1.22 and 1.1.23
        gpm          1.19.3
        wu-ftpd      2.6.1, the privatepw program
        inn          2.2.3
        diffutils    2.7, the sdiff program
        getty_ps     2.0.7j
        rdist        6.1.5
        shadow-utils 19990827 and 20000902, the useradd program

  Note that Immunix Linux 7.0 is based off of RedHat 7.0, so it is also
  effected by all of these same problems.  Other Linux distros are also
  probably effected by some of these problems.

  If anyone wants the specific patch used to fix these problems, or
  wants a more detailed explanation of any of the problems, please feel
  free to ask me.

  Thanks go out to Steve Beattie, Chris Wright and Matt Barringer all
  did audits and helped with the patches.  And to our boss, Crispin
  Cowan for working to convince WireX management that it was worth our
  time to help fix these problems.  Also to all of the maintainers who
  responded so quickly with patches and were willing to listen to
  potential problems, a big thanks (the mgetty author, Gert Doering,
  deserves a special thanks, for being so helpful in fixing stuff.)

  And I don't think this is the last of the temp file creation problem
  by any means :)

Description:
  In an internal audit conducted while preparing Immunix Linux 7.0 we
  noticed a potential temp file race problem in the inn program.  This
  is partly due to the way that the inn program is compiled and set up
  on Immunix Linux, and partly due to the lack of information in the inn
  program detailing potential security problems if you do not tell inn
  to use a private temporary directory.  We have applied a patch that
  creates temporary files safely for inn, AND moved all temp file
  creation by inn into it's own private directory which should solve
  this problem.
