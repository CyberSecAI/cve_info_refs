- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Windows Media Unicast Service does not release all resources allocated to a connection when the connection is severed using a specific sequence of TCP/IP packets. Repeatedly making and severing connections in this manner exhausts the server's resources.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Resource exhaustion due to improper resource management when handling specific TCP/IP packet sequences.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Denial of service. The server's performance degrades, potentially to the point where it can no longer provide streaming media services. While ongoing sessions are lost upon service restart, users can immediately reconnect.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a specific sequence of TCP/IP packets to establish and then sever a connection to the Windows Media Unicast Service.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to send specifically crafted TCP/IP packets to the Windows Media server.
