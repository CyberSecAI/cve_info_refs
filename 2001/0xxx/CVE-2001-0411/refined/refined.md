- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of ICMP port unreachable errors in Reliant Unix.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The operating system incorrectly interprets or processes ICMP port unreachable messages, leading to the premature termination of existing connections.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can force the disconnection of all active network connections between a Reliant Unix server and a target host, or even arbitrary hosts by spoofing the source IP address of the ICMP message.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted ICMP port unreachable message to a Reliant Unix server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs the ability to send IP packets, specifically ICMP port unreachable messages, to the vulnerable server. The attacker must be able to spoof the source IP address in the ICMP packet to target arbitrary connections.
