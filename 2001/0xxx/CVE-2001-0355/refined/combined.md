not change or proxy the rights of another user it simply allows them to =
see what policies should be hiding.

This problem was caused when Novell used an API that did not check with OS =
policies that have been applied to the user. This problem has been =
reported and confirmed by Novell Tech Support.

Exploit
Lock down a windows workstation with zen or NT Policies so you're not =
allowed to view local or remote hard drives. open GW. open new message. =
click attach. type in the drive letter you would like to view. You can see =
the whole drive and files. This can be useful for sending a copy of the =
local sam file on NT or browsing log files that are on the machine.

Solution
Contact Novell GroupWise Support for a file fix or GroupWise Client =
release sp3 will fix this issue.
