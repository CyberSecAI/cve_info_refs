- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Novell GroupWise client uses an API that does not properly check operating system policies, allowing users to bypass restrictions on file system access.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper access control; the GroupWise client allows viewing of the file system, despite OS policies restricting access.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthorized viewing of files and directories that should be restricted by OS policies. This includes sensitive information like the local SAM file on NT systems or system log files. Attackers can copy these files.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered via the GroupWise client's file attachment functionality.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker must have access to a machine with the vulnerable GroupWise client installed and be able to log into the client. The user would be subject to the same rights policies as any normal user, but through GroupWise can circumvent these policies.
