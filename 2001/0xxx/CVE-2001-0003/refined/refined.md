- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Web Extender Client (WEC) does not respect Internet Explorer security settings regarding when NTLM authentication should be performed. It performs NTLM authentication with any server that requests it, regardless of security settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the WEC component's failure to adhere to IE security zone settings, leading to automatic NTLM authentication with any server.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious server can capture a user's NTLM credentials by initiating an authentication request with the vulnerable client. The attacker can then use these credentials for offline brute-force attacks to obtain the user's password or submit a variant of these credentials to access protected resources.
- **Attack vectors**: Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by creating a malicious website or HTML email that initiates a session with their server. When a user accesses this malicious content, their client will automatically send NTLM credentials to the attacker's server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to host a web server and lure victims to access it, either by browsing to the site or opening a malicious HTML email. The attacker does not need prior access to the victim's system.
