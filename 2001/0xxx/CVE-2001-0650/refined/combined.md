## Cisco IOS vulnerable to DoS via unrecognized transitive attribute in BGP UPDATE

#### Vulnerability Note VU#106392

Original Release Date: 2001-05-10 | Last Revised: 2003-04-09

---

### Overview

There is a denial-of-service vulnerability in several specific but common configurations of Cisco IOS.

### Description

| There is a problem involving BGP updates on Cisco routers with [BGP4 Prefix Filtering](http://www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/product/software/ios121/121cgcr/ip_c/ipcprt2/1cdbgp.htm#xtocid124918) and [Inbound Route Maps](http://www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/product/software/ios121/121cgcr/ip_c/ipcprt2/1cdbgp.htm#xtocid124934) enabled. A route update with an unrecognized transitive attribute may cause vulnerable routers to crash. This problem does not appear to have been exploited intentionally by attackers, but it has occurred accidentally during normal operation as the result of interaction with another vendor's product.  More information on this problem is available from Cisco at:<http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/ios-bgp-attr-corruption-pub.shtml> |
| --- |

### Impact

| Attackers that are able to send malformed BGP updates can cause vulnerable routers to crash causing network outages. Under certain circumstances, an attacker may be able to use the BGP infrastructure to propogate the bad route update to multiple routers. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Cisco has released an advisory that provides a list of affected products, along with instructions for obtaining fixed software. Because there are many possible combinations of hardware and software configurations, the CERT/CC recommends that all users of IOS and software consult the following Cisco Security Advisory:   | <http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/ios-bgp-attr-corruption-pub.shtml> | | --- | |

Cisco Security Advisory: Cisco IOS BGP Attribute Corruption Vulnerability
=========================================================================
Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2001 May 10 08:00 AM US/Pacific (UTC -0700)

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

A Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) UPDATE contains Network Layer
Reachability  Information (NLRI) and attributes that describe the path to
the destination. An unrecognized transitive attribute can cause failures in
Cisco IOS routers, ranging from a crash upon receipt of the unrecognized
transitive attribute, to a later failure upon attempt to clear the
unrecognized transitive attribute. Specific but common configurations are
affected, and described below.  The failure was discovered  because of a
malfunction in the BGP implementation of another vendor. There is no
workaround.  Affected customers are urged to upgrade to fixed code.

This vulnerability has been assigned Cisco bug ID CSCdt79947.

The complete text of this advisory will be located at
<http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/ios-bgp-attr-corruption-pub.shtml>

Affected Products
=================

Configurations including  BGP4 Prefix Filtering with Inbound Route Maps are
vulnerable.  BGP with prefix or inbound routemap filtering was introduced
in Cisco IOS® Software version 11.2  The following versions of Cisco IOS
Software are affected and listed in the table below: 11.CC and its
derivatives, 11.2 and its  derivaties, 11.3, 11.3T, 12.0, 12.0S and special
branches taken out of 12.0 are all affected. The versions of Cisco IOS
Software based on 12.1, 12.0(5)T, 12.2, 12.0ST, and 12.1(E) are not
affected. The following products are affected if they run a Cisco IOS
software release that has the defect. To determine if a Cisco product is
running an affected IOS, log in to the device and issue the show version
command. Cisco IOS software will identify itself as "Internetwork Operating
System Software" or "IOS (tm)" software and will display a version number.
Other Cisco devices either will not have the show version command, or will
give different output. Compare the version number obtained from the router
with the versions presented in the Software Versions and Fixes section
below.

Cisco devices that may be running with affected Cisco IOS software releases
include:

   \* Cisco routers in the AGS/MGS/CGS/AGS+, IGS, RSM, 800, ubr900, 1000,
     1400, 1500, 1600, 1700, 2500, 2600, 3000, 3600, 3800, 4000, 4500,
     4700, AS5200, AS5300, AS5800, 6400, 7000, 7200, ubr7200, 7500, and
     12000 series.

Cisco devices that may be running Cisco IOS Software, but do NOT support
BGP and are therefore not vulnerable include:

   \* Most recent versions of the LS1010 ATM switch.
   \* The Catalyst 2900XL LAN switch only if it is running IOS.
   \* The Catalyst 1900, 2800, 2900, 3000, and 5000 series LAN switches.
   \* The Cisco DistributedDirector.

If you are not running Cisco IOS software, you are not affected by this
vulnerability.  If you are not running BGP, you are not affected by this
vulnerability.

Cisco products that do not run Cisco IOS software and are not affected by
this defect include, but are not limited to:

   \* 700 series dialup routers (750, 760, and 770 series) are not affected.
   \* The Catalyst 6000 is not affected if it is not running IOS.
   \* WAN switching products in the IGX and BPX lines are not affected.
   \* The MGX (formerly known as the AXIS shelf) is not affected.
   \* No host-based software is affected.
   \* The Cisco PIX Firewall is not affected.
   \* The Cisco LocalDirector is not affected.
   \* The Cisco Cache Engine is not affected.

Details
=======

A Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) UPDATE contains Network Layer Reachability
Information (NLRI) and attributes that describe the path to the
destination. Each path attribute is a type, length, value (TLV) object.
This failure occurs as a result of memory corruption and only in
configurations using specific inbound route filtering. The failure was
discovered because of a malfunction in the BGP implementation of another
vendor. There is no workaround.

Impact
======

The vulnerability can be exercised repeatedly, affecting core routers,
creating widespread network outages. This vulnerability can only be
exercised in configurations that include both BGP and inbound route
filtering on affected software.

Software Versions and Fixes
===========================

The following table summarizes the Cisco IOS software releases that are
known to be affected, and the earliest estimated dates of availability for
the recommended fixed versions. Dates are always tentative and subject to
change.

Each row of the table describes a release train and the platforms or
products for which it is intended. If a given release train is vulnerable,
then the earliest possible releases that contain the fix and the
anticipated date of availability for each are listed in the "Rebuild",
"Interim", and "Maintenance" columns. A device running any release in the
given train that is earlier than the release in a specific column (less
than the earliest fixed release) is known to be vulnerable, and it should
be upgraded at least to the indicated release or a later version (greater
than the earliest fixed release label).

When selecting a release, keep in mind the following definitions:

     Maintenance
          Most heavily tested and highly recommended release of any label
          in a given row of the table.

     Rebuild
          Constructed from the previous maintenance or major release in the
          same train, it contains the fix for a specific defect. Although
          it receives less testing, it contains only the minimal changes
          necessary to effect the repair.

     Interim
          Built at regular intervals between maintenance releases and
          receive less testing. Interims should be selected only if there
          is no other suitable release that addresses the vulnerability,
          and interim images should be upgraded to the next available
          maintenance release as soon as possible. Interim releases are not
          available via manufacturing, and usually they are not available
          for customer download from CCO without prior arrangement with the
          Cisco TAC.

In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the devices
to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current hardware and
software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new
release. If the information is not clear, contact the Cisco TAC for
assistance as shown later in this notice.
