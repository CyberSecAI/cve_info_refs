Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2001-0668:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A buffer overflow exists in the HP-UX line printer daemon (rlpdaemon).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Buffer Overflow: The rlpdaemon does not properly validate the size of input, leading to a buffer overflow vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution: A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the target system with superuser privileges. This effectively grants the attacker complete control over the vulnerable system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network: The vulnerability is exploitable remotely, meaning an attacker can target vulnerable systems over a network.
- Crafted Print Request: The vulnerability is triggered by a crafted print request sent to the rlpdaemon. No prior knowledge or privileges on the target system are required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs to have network access to the target system running the vulnerable rlpdaemon service.
- No Authentication: The attacker does not require any authentication or prior privileges on the target system to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
- The rlpdaemon is installed by default and is active, even if not actively used, increasing the potential attack surface.
- Patches are available from Hewlett-Packard (HPSBUX0108-163) to address the issue. Specific patches vary based on the HP-UX version.
- The vulnerability was discovered and researched by Chris Spencer of Internet Security Systems (ISS).
- This is also identified as Vulnerability Note VU#966075
- The affected platforms are HP9000 Series 700/800 running HP-UX releases 10.01, 10.10, 10.20, 11.00, and 11.11, and 11.20.
- HP-UX 10.24 and 11.04 (VVOS) are NOT vulnerable.
