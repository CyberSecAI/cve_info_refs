Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from two main issues:
1. **Insecure Storage of Admin Credentials:** PhpNuke stores the administrator's username and a base64-encoded password within a cookie. This is problematic because base64 encoding is easily reversible and not a form of encryption.
2. **Microsoft IE 'About:' URL Cookie Exposure:** The vulnerability exploits a known issue in Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE) where `about:` URLs can expose cookies to external scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cleartext Equivalent Storage:** The primary weakness lies in storing the admin password in a base64-encoded format within a cookie. This is not secure, as base64 encoding is easily decoded.
*   **Cross-Site Information Disclosure:** The secondary weakness is the exploitation of the IE `about:` URL vulnerability, allowing an attacker to steal cookies through a specially crafted link.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Admin Account Compromise:** An attacker can steal the administrator's password and gain full administrative access to the PhpNuke installation.
*   **Complete System Control:** With admin access, the attacker can potentially manipulate the site content, install malware, compromise user data, and effectively take complete control of the affected site.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to trick the administrator into clicking a malicious link that uses the `about:` URL scheme. This can be achieved through various social engineering techniques.
*   **Malicious Link:** The attacker crafts a specific link containing the `about:` URL that, when clicked by the administrator, executes JavaScript to gather the cookies and sends them to an attacker-controlled server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Craft a Malicious Link:** The attacker needs the ability to create a link using the `about:` URL format that includes JavaScript to steal the cookie data.
*   **Ability to host a server to receive the stolen cookies:** The attacker must have access to a server capable of receiving and storing the stolen cookie data transmitted by the malicious link.
*   **Ability to Socially Engineer the target:** The attacker must be able to get the administrator to click on the crafted link.
*   **No specific network position required:** The attack relies on getting the target to click the link, meaning no specific position on the network is required.

**Additional Details:**

*   The attack specifically targets PhpNuke version 5.1. Other versions were not tested by the researcher.
*   The researcher provided a link to a base64 decoding tool for verification.
*   The researcher also provided a link to the SecuriTeam article describing the IE about: URL cookie exposure issue.
*   The attack uses a two-step process: creating a malicious link and a PHP script to capture the stolen cookies.
*   The attacker must then decode the base64 encoded password from the stolen cookie.
