The provided content is related to CVE-2001-0131. The content describes a large number of temporary file race conditions found in various packages during an internal audit of Immunix Linux 7.0.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Insecure use of temporary file creation functions like `mktemp()` and `tempname()`, leading to potential race conditions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Temp file race conditions:** The programs use insecure methods to create temporary files, which could allow an attacker to predict the file name and potentially overwrite or read the file.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially overwrite or read temporary files created by the vulnerable programs. This could lead to various impacts, such as:
*   **Data manipulation/corruption:** Overwriting the temporary file could influence the program's behavior, potentially leading to data corruption.
*   **Information disclosure:** Reading the contents of the temporary file could expose sensitive information.
*   **Privilege escalation**: While not explicitly stated in this document, the ability to manipulate temporary files of privileged processes may be a vector for privilege escalation attacks.

**Attack vectors:** Local exploitation of the vulnerable programs. The attack would likely involve a race condition, where an attacker attempts to create a file with the same name as a temporary file used by the target program, before the target program itself does.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   Local access to the vulnerable system.
*   Ability to execute programs and create files.
*   Timing to exploit the race condition
*   Knowledge of the target program's temporary file creation scheme.

**Vulnerable packages:**

The following packages are affected:

*   apache (htpasswd and htdigest helper programs)
*   tcpdump (arpwatch program)
*   squid
*   linuxconf (vpop3d program)
*   mgetty
*   gpm
*   wu-ftpd (privatepw program)
*   inn
*   diffutils (sdiff program)
*   getty\_ps
*   rdist
*   shadow-utils (useradd program)

The advisory also notes that other Linux distributions are likely affected.
