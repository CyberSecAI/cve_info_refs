Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2001-0542:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The primary vulnerability, identified as CAN-2001-0542, stems from a **buffer overflow** in several text formatting functions within Microsoft SQL Server 7.0 and 2000. These functions do not properly validate the size of the text they are processing, leading to a potential buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unchecked Buffers:** The core issue lies in the lack of proper size checks in the SQL Server text formatting functions. These functions don't verify if the provided text will fit into the allocated buffer, resulting in an overflow if the supplied text is larger than the buffer.
*   **Code Execution via Buffer Overflow:** The buffer overflow vulnerability can be exploited to overwrite memory within the SQL Server process. This can lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker who successfully exploits the vulnerability can execute arbitrary code within the security context of the SQL Server service. The precise privileges gained depend on how the service is configured. If the service is configured with high privileges, the attacker could gain significant control over the system.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** If the attacker provides random data to trigger the buffer overflow, the SQL Server process will likely crash, leading to a denial of service.
*   **Data Manipulation:** In the worst-case scenario, an attacker could manipulate data in the database, potentially adding, deleting, or changing data. They might also reconfigure the OS or install new software.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct SQL Query Execution:** The most direct method involves crafting a malicious SQL query that calls one of the vulnerable functions with carefully constructed, oversized text parameters.
*   **Exploitation through Web Applications or Database Front-ends:** If a web application or other interface accepts and processes arbitrary SQL queries, an attacker could potentially inject malicious code into a query which will then be executed against the database. The injected query would call a vulnerable function.
*   **Exploitation via poorly Implemented Queries:** Attackers can exploit poorly implemented database queries that do not validate inputs, which allows injection of malicious commands.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Execute SQL Queries:** An attacker must be able to execute SQL queries on the target SQL Server to directly exploit this vulnerability, or be able to submit queries through an application using the SQL database backend. This is often achieved through compromised user accounts, or vulnerabilities in front-end applications that expose SQL databases.
*  **Knowledge of SQL Syntax and Vulnerable Functions:** Some knowledge of SQL Server is needed in order to target the vulnerable functions.

**Additional Notes:**

*   There is a separate vulnerability (CAN-2001-0879) involving a format string issue in the C runtime, but this only leads to denial of service, and is not related to CVE-2001-0542
*   Microsoft strongly recommends applying the SQL Server patch to all affected systems.
