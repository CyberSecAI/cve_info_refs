- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An unchecked buffer exists in a component of Outlook Express that processes vCards.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Buffer overflow. By sending a vCard with specially crafted, excessively long data in one of the fields, an attacker can cause a buffer overrun when the vCard is opened.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Less serious case: The mail client (Outlook or Outlook Express) may crash, requiring a restart.
    - More serious case: The attacker can execute arbitrary code on the recipient's machine, with the privileges of the recipient user. This could lead to actions such as data modification, communication with web sites, reformatting the disk drive, etc.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a specially crafted vCard as an email attachment to a user of affected Outlook or Outlook Express versions.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to create a malformed vCard with specific data and send it to a victim via email. The attacker also needs to convince the victim to open the malicious vCard attachment.
