Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2001-0664:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how Internet Explorer (IE) handles URLs containing dotless IP addresses. When a website is specified using a dotless IP format (e.g., `https://031713501415` instead of `https://207.46.131.13`) and the request is malformed in a specific way (specifically when an encoded @ sign is present), IE fails to recognize it as an Internet site.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Zone Spoofing:** The primary vulnerability is that IE incorrectly classifies a website using a malformed dotless IP address as belonging to the "Local Intranet Zone" instead of the "Internet Zone." This zone misclassification allows the website to operate with less restrictive security settings.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Inappropriate Security Settings:** A malicious website can be rendered with the lower security settings of the Intranet Zone, potentially gaining more privileges than it should have.
*   **Potential for Malicious Code Execution:** If the user has customized the Intranet Zone settings to be less restrictive, the attacker could potentially execute malicious code on the user's system, read local files, or alter data.
*   **Compromised User Data:** The attacker could take actions on the user's behalf, potentially accessing or deleting data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Website:** An attacker can host a website that uses a crafted URL with a malformed dotless IP address. When a user visits this website, IE will incorrectly classify it as an intranet site.
*   **HTML Email:** An attacker could embed the malicious URL in an HTML email. When the user opens the email, the crafted URL would cause the browser to treat the content as if it were from the intranet.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Host a Website/Send HTML Emails:** The attacker needs to be able to host a website or send HTML emails to deliver the malicious URL.
*   **Understanding of IE's URL Parsing:** The attacker needs to be aware of the specific method of creating a malformed dotless IP address that triggers the vulnerability.

**Additional Details from the Provided Content:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered when a dotless IP address is used in combination with the URL login option including the @ character encoded as %40 (e.g., `http://mike%403475959674`).
*   The vulnerability affects Internet Explorer versions 5.01, 5.5, and 6, except IE 6 is not affected by the zone spoofing issue.
*   The severity of the vulnerability depends on the user's intranet security settings, with default settings not allowing any destructive action. However, users who have customized these settings could be more vulnerable.
*   Microsoft released a patch to address this vulnerability.
