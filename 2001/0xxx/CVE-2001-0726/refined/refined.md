Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2001-0726:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability arises from a flaw in how Outlook Web Access (OWA) for Exchange 5.5 handles inline script within HTML messages. Specifically, OWA's content filtering mechanism fails to detect and block specially formatted script, allowing it to execute when the message is opened in OWA.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate Input Sanitization:** OWA's content filtering is insufficient in detecting obfuscated script within HTML email messages.
*   **Script Execution:** The vulnerability lies in the ability of specially crafted scripts to execute within the context of OWA.
*   **Trust in User Input:** OWA incorrectly trusts that scripts within messages are benign, failing to sanitize or block potentially malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to run arbitrary script within the user's Exchange mailbox.
*   **Data Manipulation:** The attacker can perform any action that the user is capable of within the Exchange mailbox, including sending, moving, or deleting messages, and manipulating folders.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Email Message:** The primary attack vector is an email message that contains specially crafted, malicious script within its HTML body.
*   **OWA as the Target:** The attack is only successful when the victim uses OWA in a web browser to open the email.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker must understand how to create an HTML message with obfuscated script that will bypass OWA's filtering.
*   **Access to Send Email:** The attacker needs to be able to send an email to the targeted user.
*   **Victim's OWA Usage:** The attacker needs to know or assume the victim uses OWA with IE to read email.
*   **Knowledge of OWA Version:** The attacker would need knowledge of the version of OWA being used by the target.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability is specific to OWA in Exchange 5.5 and only when used with Internet Explorer.
*   The vulnerability does not affect Outlook or Outlook Express clients.
*   The attack cannot be used for mass-mailing attacks, as it cannot directly send messages to addresses in the user's address book.
*   A successful attack requires social engineering, as the user needs to open the malicious message in OWA with IE.
