Another reason to limit access to port 2407 on your Navision servers:
the server limits connections to however many licensed sessions you own,
and a connection with no username/password counts against this limit.
Thus, a simple DoS involves merely firing up the Navision Financials
client numerous times, and doing FILE -> SERVER -> CONNECT ->
YourNavisionServer on each client instance.  (Or, if your shortcut
specifies the name of the server in it, you merely have to accidentally
fire off this shortcut several times.  This is what my users often do.)
This will quickly run you out licenses, and legitimate users will be
locked out with a 'no licenses available' message.

This DoS works (far too regularly... :-) on version 2.0 of the AIX
version of Navision Financials.  This version is sorta old, and I don't
know if newer versions behave the same.  And I don't have access to an
NT/2000 version, so I can't see what it does in this situation.
