- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Navision Financials server limits connections based on the number of licensed sessions. A connection attempt without a valid username and password consumes a license.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The server does not properly handle connection attempts without proper authentication, leading to license exhaustion.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A denial-of-service (DoS) condition is created when attackers exhaust all available licenses, preventing legitimate users from connecting.
- **Attack vectors**: Attackers repeatedly connect to the server without providing a username or password. This can be achieved by repeatedly launching the Navision Financials client and attempting a connection.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs network access to the server's port 2407 and the ability to repeatedly initiate connection requests.
