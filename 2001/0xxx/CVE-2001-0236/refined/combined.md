## History

The CERT Division is the birthplace of cybersecurity. For nearly 30 years, the CERT Division of the SEI has partnered with government, industry, law enforcement, and academia to advance cybersecurity and improve the security and resilience of computer systems and networks.

Originally focused on incident response, we have expanded into cybersecurity areas such as network situational awareness, malicious code analysis, secure coding, resilience management, insider threats, digital investigations and intelligence, workforce development, DevOps, forensics, software assurance, vulnerability discovery and analysis, and risk management.

## Former Director Richard Pethia

[Richard Pethia](/about/leadership/display.cfm?customel_datapageid_2623=3545) was founding director of the SEI's CERT Division. Pethia, who served as director of CERT from 1988 to 2016, guided the organization through tremendous growth and change. Under Pethia's leadership, the unit expanded and evolved from the CERT Coordination Center—a small group focused on computer incident response—to a research organization of more than 200 professionals dedicated to solving problems with widespread cybersecurity implications.

Summary
-------

  Title: Solaris SNMP to DMI mapper daemon vulnerability
  Date Published: 2001-03-15
  Bugtraq ID: 2417
  CVE CAN: CAN-2001-0236
  Class: Boundary Error Condition (Buffer Overflow)
  Remotely Exploitable: Yes
  Locally Exploitable: Yes

Description
-----------

  SNMP and DMI are remote management protocols. The snmpXdmid mapper daemon
  is used on Solaris to combine both worlds. This daemon has an
  overflow in a buffer for handling an 'indication'. This 'indication'
  is sent to the daemon over RPC service 1000249.

Impact
------

  The buffer overflow can lead to local and remote root compromise.

Workaround
----------

  For 99% of the cases the daemon can be safely turned off by turning off DMI
  completely. This can be achieved by renaming /etc/rc?.d/S??dmi to
  /etc/rc?.d/K07dmi and calling '/etc/init.d/init.dmi stop'
  (where ? is the appropriate runlevel). It is also wise to remove all
  permissions from the binary: chmod 000 /usr/lib/dmi/snmpXdmid

  The deamon will generally listen on a high port both on TCP and UDP.

Affected systems
----------------

  An exploit has been tested on Solaris 8 sun4u. However it seems likely
  that every previous version is vulnerable including any security
  patches previously created.

  The daemon was bundled with Solaris 2.6, 7 and 8

Vendor notification
-------------------

  Sun Microsystems was notified on February 7, 2001. Patches are expected
  shortly, but no information is available on an actual patch date.

Background
----------

  The Desktop Management Interface (DMI) is a management protocol designed
  by the Desktop Management Task Force (DMTF). More information can be found
  at <http://www.dmtf.org>.

  Sun Microsystems has been providing a daemon based on these specifications
  called 'dmid' since Solaris 2.6. Further, Sun created a coupling between
  SNMP and DMI in the form of a so-called mapper daemon:

    /usr/lib/dmi/snmpXdmid

  This daemon registers itself with both 'snmpdx' and 'dmid' and translates
  SNMP requests to DMI.

  The mapper daemon shows itself to the world in two ways. On one hand it
  registers itself with 'snmpdx' as a subagent using a protocol called DPI.
  It uses the UDP port 6500 for this. On the other hand it registers itself
  with 'dmid' using the RPC based protocol of DMI. This is found on Solaris
  as RPC service 1000249:

  ~> rpcinfo -p
  ...
      100249    1   udp  32785
      100249    1   tcp  32786
  ..

  This service is a callback service that allows 'dmid' to report events
  back to 'snmpXdmid'. These events are called 'indications' and are
  translated into SNMP traps. By using one such event, an overflow is
  triggered.

  More information about the XDR formats used to talk to the 'dmid' daemon
  can be found in the SDK available from Sun (ref. 1):

    /usr/include/dmi/common.h
    /usr/include/dmi/server.h
    /usr/include/dmi/ci_callback.h

  Further the callback specification for reporting back indications can be
  found in:

    /opt/SUNWconn/sea/dmi/sample/miexample.h

  In this case the overflow can be triggered by the event DmiComponentAdded
  with all fields empty except for the name of the component the indication
  is about. This results in a simple overflow in a memcpy in the daemon:

  =>[[1]](#1) __align_cpy_1(0xfea0b590, 0xe15b4, 0x...
    [[2]](#2) generateTrap(0xe0ae8, 0x0, 0x25438, 0x...
    [[3]](#3) handle_CompLangGrpIndication(0x48400, 0xfea0bb70, 0x47b30,...
    [[4]](#4) _dmicomponentadded_0x1_svc(0xfea0bb70, 0x49bb0, 0x...
    [[5]](#5) dmi2_client_0x1(0x44a24, 0x24f58, 0x4443c, 0x...
    [[6]](#6) _svc_prog_dispatch(0x2509c, 0x1, 0x0, 0xff21a...
    [[7]](#7) svc_getreq_common(0xff21ebf0, 0x1, 0xff228778, 0x...
    [[8]](#8) svc_getreq_poll(0x1, 0xb49d8, 0xff21ae30, 0x...
    [[9]](#9) waitForIndication(0x48378, 0x1, 0x...

  From the trace above it can be seen that the indication received from
  'dmid' is translated into an SNMP trap. It is there that the overflow
  occurs.

  From the way the daemon works it looks like it would be sufficient if
  it listened solely on the loopback interface or used another form of
  local transport to communicate. This would make remote attacks on the
  daemon much more difficult. Also important, because it is unknown if
  the daemon provides any authentication at all on messages received on
  both the SNMP interface as the DMI interface.
