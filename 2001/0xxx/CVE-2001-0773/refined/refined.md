- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Cayman gateway crashes when it receives a high number of TCP connect() requests or SYN packets.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The gateway's handling of TCP connection requests is weak, leading to a denial of service. The vulnerability can be triggered by either TCP connect() requests or SYN packets. A "bouncing" vulnerability allows this to be triggered remotely.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A denial of service occurs, rendering the gateway unusable.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack can be launched from the LAN side, or from the WAN side in conjunction with a "bouncing" vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send a high number of TCP connect() requests or SYN packets to the gateway. This could be from the LAN side or remotely from the WAN side in combination with a "bouncing" vulnerability.
