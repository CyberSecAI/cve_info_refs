- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability arises because Internet Explorer (IE) can be tricked into sending HTTP requests to a third-party site by encoding them within a URL. This allows an attacker to send commands as if they originated from the user.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper handling of URLs by IE, specifically when third-party sites and HTTP requests are encoded within a URL.

- **Impact of exploitation**: The impact includes the ability to send commands to a third-party web site in the guise of the user, which could lead to actions such as deleting data, modifying settings, or any action supported by the web application, if the attacker has the required knowledge.

- **Attack vectors**: Embedding a specially crafted URL into a web page or HTML email. When a user clicks on the link, IE establishes a connection to the third-party site and executes the appended HTTP requests.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to create and distribute a crafted URL. In addition, successful exploitation may require the attacker to have specific knowledge about the victim, such as the web services they use, folder structures, and other relevant details.
