-= Mirabilis ICQ WebFront Plug-in Denial of Service =-

Release date: Saturday, April 28, 2001

Introduction:

WebFront is a plugin for Mirabilis' ICQ messaging program which
allows a user to setup a web page through ICQ.

ICQ WebFront is available for ICQ from vendor Mirabilis'
website: <http://www.icq.com>

Problem:

The web server on which this plugin relies is susceptible to a DoS
attack through a malformed GET request. If this request contains
86 or more %'s or combinations of %'s with other characters (for
example ascii encoded dots or backslashes) the ICQ program will
begin consuming 100% cpu and will become unresponsive.

A restart of the program is required to regain full functionality.

(..)

Solution:

This problem has been brought to the vendors attention, however no
fixes appear to be forthcoming at this time, we were only able to get a
"your message has been forwarded to the appropiate address" response.

This was tested against ICQ2000b Build 3278 running on MS Win2k.
