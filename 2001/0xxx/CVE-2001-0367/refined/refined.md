- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A malformed GET request with 86 or more '%' characters or combinations of '%' and other characters (like ascii encoded dots or backslashes) sent to the ICQ WebFront plugin's web server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The ICQ WebFront plugin's web server lacks proper input validation or handling of malformed GET requests containing excessive '%' characters.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The ICQ program will consume 100% CPU and become unresponsive, leading to a denial-of-service. A restart of the program is required to regain functionality.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the ICQ WebFront plugin's web server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected ICQ WebFront plugin's web server. This would require knowledge of the vulnerable server's address and the capability to send HTTP requests, which could likely be done from within a network that the server is accessible from.
