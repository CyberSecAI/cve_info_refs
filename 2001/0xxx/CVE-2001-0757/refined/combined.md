## Cisco 6400 Access Concentrator Node Route Processor 2 (NRP2) module permits telnet access when no password has been set

#### Vulnerability Note VU#516659

Original Release Date: 2001-09-20 | Last Revised: 2003-04-09

---

### Overview

The [Cisco 6400 Access Concentrator Node Route Processor 2 (NRP2) module](http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/cc/pd/as/6400/prodlit/cnrp_ds.htm) permits unauthenticated telnet access when no password has been set.

### Description

| The Access Concentrator Node Route Processor is a router blade for the [Cisco 6400](http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/cc/pd/as/6400/index.shtml). It's purpose is to aggregate and terminate incoming virtual circuits. The Access Concentrator Node Route Processor receives traffic from one or more Node Switch Processor (NSP) Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) switch ports, re-assembles the ATM cells into packets, routes the packets, segments the routed packets, and sends them back to the ATM switch.  The Access Concentrator Node Route Processor module allows Telnet access when no password is set for the vtys on the device. Note that this product ships with no password set. |
| --- |

### Impact

| This vulnerability could allow a remote attacker to gain unauthorized access to the Access Concentrator Node Route Processor. Once the intruder has gained access to the Access Concentrator Node Route Processor, he could inspect or change the configuration of the device, effectively allowing complete control of the device. Since the Access Concentrator Node Route Processor is able to modify permanent and switched virtual circuits, the attacker may be able to re-route or disrupt network traffic as well as gather information about network topology. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Upgrade to Cisco IOS release 12.1(05)DC01 or later. |
| --- |

| Apply a password to all 32 vtys on the Access Concentrator Node Route Processor. To apply the password, execute the following command at the "Enable Prompt":     + **Enable Prompt>  vty 0 31 password "password"** |

Please provide your feedback on this document.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary

The Cisco 6400 Access Concentrator Node Route Processor 2 (NRP2) module allows Telnet access when no password has been set. The correct response is to disallow any remote access to the module until the password has been set. This vulnerability may result in users gaining unintended access to secure systems.

This vulnerability is documented as Cisco bug ID CSCdt65960.

This advisory will be posted at <http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/6400-nrp2-telnet-vuln-pub.shtml>.

Affected Products

Cisco 6400 NRP2 modules running Cisco IOS® release earlier than 12.1(05)DC01 are affected by this vulnerability.

Cisco 6400 NSP and Cisco 6400 NRP1 modules are not affected by this vulnerability. No other Cisco product is currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.

To determine your software revision, type show version at the command line prompt.

Details

The Cisco 6400 Access Concentrator NRP2 module allows Telnet access when no password is set for the vtys on the NRP2. This vulnerability affects the Gigabit Ethernet, ATM and Serial interface on the NRP2. The correct response is to not allow any remote access to the module until the vty password has been set.

This vulnerability is documented as Cisco bug ID CSCdt65960, which requires a CCO account to view.

Impact

A user can gain access to secure systems if the initial vtys have not had their password set.

This vulnerability can be eliminated by applying the workaround or by upgrading the IOS.
