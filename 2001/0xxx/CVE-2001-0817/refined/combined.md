## HP-UX Line Printer Daemon Vulnerable to Directory Traversal

#### Vulnerability Note VU#638011

Original Release Date: 2001-11-21 | Last Revised: 2001-12-06

---

### Overview

A remotely exploitable directory traversal vulnerability exists in the [HP-UX](http://www.hp.com/products1/unix/operating/index.html) line printer daemon.

### Description

| The line printer daemon (rlpdaemon) enables various clients to share printers over a network. By sending a specially crafted print request to an HP-UX host running the rlpdaemon, a local or remote attacker can create arbitrary files or directories on the target host. Intruders may find this vulnerability attractive to exploit because the line printer daemon is enabled by default to provide printing services. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on the target system with the privileges of the line printer daemon, typically superuser. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Contact HP for patches. |
| --- |

| **Workaround**  Disable the line printer daemon until a patch can be applied. |

## History

The CERT Division is the birthplace of cybersecurity. For nearly 30 years, the CERT Division of the SEI has partnered with government, industry, law enforcement, and academia to advance cybersecurity and improve the security and resilience of computer systems and networks.

Originally focused on incident response, we have expanded into cybersecurity areas such as network situational awareness, malicious code analysis, secure coding, resilience management, insider threats, digital investigations and intelligence, workforce development, DevOps, forensics, software assurance, vulnerability discovery and analysis, and risk management.

## Former Director Richard Pethia

[Richard Pethia](/about/leadership/display.cfm?customel_datapageid_2623=3545) was founding director of the SEI's CERT Division. Pethia, who served as director of CERT from 1988 to 2016, guided the organization through tremendous growth and change. Under Pethia's leadership, the unit expanded and evolved from the CERT Coordination Center—a small group focused on computer incident response—to a research organization of more than 200 professionals dedicated to solving problems with widespread cybersecurity implications.
