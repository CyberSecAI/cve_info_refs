#### Vulnerability Note VU#795707

Original Release Date: 2001-06-22 | Last Revised: 2002-12-16

---

### Overview

A vulnerability exists in [ScreamingMedia's](http://www01.screamingmedia.com/en/) [SiteWare](http://www.screamingmedia.com/site_ware/index.php3) Editor's Desktop that allows an intruder to read arbitrary files within the [SiteWare](http://www.screamingmedia.com/site_ware/index.php3) web hierarchy.

### Description

| [SiteWare](http://www.screamingmedia.com/site_ware/index.php3) Editor's Desktop is a web-based administration tool for manipulating [ScreamingMedia](http://www01.screamingmedia.com/en/) content on a [SiteWare](http://www.screamingmedia.com/site_ware/index.php3) web server. While logged into into the [SiteWare](http://www.screamingmedia.com/site_ware/index.php3) application, a malicious user can traverse the directory tree and request any file located within the [SiteWare](http://www.screamingmedia.com/site_ware/index.php3) web root. For more information, please see the [ScreamingMedia advisory](http://www.screamingmedia.com/security/sms1001.php). |
| --- |

### Impact

| An intruder can view information stored in the [SiteWare](http://www.screamingmedia.com/site_ware/index.php3) web root directory, such as [SiteWare](http://www.screamingmedia.com/site_ware/index.php3) access information. This could result an intruder gaining unauthorized access to the [SiteWare](http://www.screamingmedia.com/site_ware/index.php3) application. Once the intruder has gained access to the [SiteWare](http://www.screamingmedia.com/site_ware/index.php3) application, s/he could modify web content and/or disrupt web services. Note that this vulnerability does not expose any files out of the [SiteWare](http://www.screamingmedia.com/site_ware/index.php3) web root directory. |
