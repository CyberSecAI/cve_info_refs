- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A flaw in how Outlook Web Access (OWA) interacts with Internet Explorer (IE) when handling message attachments. When an attachment contains HTML code, including scripts, the script is executed when the attachment is opened within OWA using IE.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper handling of HTML content within attachments by OWA when viewed through Internet Explorer, leading to the execution of embedded scripts without warning.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could execute arbitrary script code against the user's Exchange mailbox, potentially manipulating messages, folders, or performing other actions as if they were the user.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker crafts an email with a malicious attachment containing HTML and script code. The email is sent to a user, who must then open the attachment via OWA using IE to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send emails with crafted attachments to the targeted user. They also rely on the user opening the attachment using OWA within Internet Explorer. Social engineering tactics may be necessary to convince the user to open the attachment, especially since the user would need to utilize OWA, rather than another email client.
