- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The AOLserver web server fails to properly sanitize user-supplied paths, specifically not checking for triple dot sequences (`...`).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The server has inadequate input validation, specifically failing to recognize and block the '...' sequence, which can be used in path traversal attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker can bypass the web root directory and access files outside of the intended web server directory structure, leading to potential unauthorized information disclosure or other security breaches.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through crafted HTTP requests containing `...` sequences in the URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. The vulnerability is accessible remotely, and no specific attacker privileges are mentioned.

The provided content provides more detail than the official CVE description, clarifying that the vulnerability is caused by insufficient input validation, specifically missing a check for triple dots, and only tested on the Win32 platform.
