- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in America Online 5.0 when handling URLs. The software fails to properly validate the length of the URL input, leading to a buffer overflow when an overly long URL is processed.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the URL input field within the America Online 5.0 software. The size of the buffer is not consistent, making it difficult to predict the exact input length required for an overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to a denial-of-service by crashing the application, or potentially to arbitrary command execution if the attacker can precisely control the overflow to overwrite the Extended Instruction Pointer (EIP) register.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a crafted URL to an AOL user, either through a direct link or by embedding it within a HTML email. When the user clicks on the malicious link, the buffer overflow occurs.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send or present a crafted URL to an AOL user. This could be achieved via email, instant messaging or malicious websites. The attacker would also need to craft the oversized URL carefully to achieve code execution, due to the inconsistent nature of the overflow.
