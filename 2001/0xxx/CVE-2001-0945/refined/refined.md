- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in Outlook Express for Macintosh due to improper handling of long strings in email bodies that lack return characters.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary weakness is the lack of proper bounds checking when processing long strings, leading to a buffer overflow. Specifically, the application crashes when encountering long lines without return codes.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - The application crashes.
    - A denial-of-service (DoS) condition occurs, preventing the user from receiving new emails until the problematic email is deleted, because the client can't send the "DELE" command to the pop3 server.
    - The program counter (PC) can be overwritten with attacker-controlled data.
    - While not explicitly stated, the attacker can potentially achieve arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Sending a specially crafted email with a long line without return characters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to be able to send emails to the vulnerable user.
    - The attacker needs to include long lines in the body without return characters (although, the author mentions that SMTP protocol allows only 7bit-clean strings, which could make exploitation difficult).
