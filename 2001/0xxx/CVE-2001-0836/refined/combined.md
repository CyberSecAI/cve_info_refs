## Oracle9iAS Web Cache vulnerable to buffer overflow

#### Vulnerability Note VU#649979

Original Release Date: 2001-10-25 | Last Revised: 2003-04-09

---

### Overview

A remotely exploitable buffer overflow in the [Oracle9iAS Web Cache](http://otn.oracle.com/products/ias/htdocs/9iaswebcache_fov.html) allows intruders to execute arbitrary code or cause the web cache process to hang or exit.

### Description

| [Defcom Labs](http://www.defcom.com/) has discovered a remotely exploitable buffer overflow vulnerability in the Oracle9iAS Web Cache (on all platforms) that allows intruders to either execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the process running the web cache process, or cause the web cache process to hang or crash entirely. The Oracle9iAS Web Cache provides four services that are enabled by default when the software is installed. These services and the associated ports they listen on are given below:  1100/tcp incoming web cache proxy4000/tcp administrative interface4001/tcp web XML invalidation port4002/tcp statistics port**This vulnerability occurs in all four of the services listed above**. For more information, see the [Oracle Security Alert](http://otn.oracle.com/deploy/security/pdf/webcache.pdf) and/or the [Defcom Labs Security Advisory](http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/3BCEE434.F597D815%40defcom.com). It is also important to note that an exploit exists and is publicly available for this vulnerability. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An intruder can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the web cache process and/or cause the web cache process to hang or exit. Additionally, an intruder might be able to intercept and/or modify sensitive data traversing the web cache device such as credentials and other types of sensitive information. |

                   Defcom Labs Advisory def-2001-30

   Oracle9iAS Web Cache/2.0.0.1.0 Multiple DoS and Buffer Overflow

Authors: George Hedfors <george.hedfors@defcom.com>
         Andreas Junestam <andreas.junestam@defcom.com>
Release Date: 2001-10-18
======================================================================
------------------------=[Brief Description]=-------------------------
Release 2.0.0.1.0 and perhaps even previous releases, contain a URL
driven buffer overrun condition which either can cause process exiting,
process hanging or injection of malicious code.

------------------------=[Affected Systems]=--------------------------
Oracle9iAS Web Cache/2.0.0.1.0 on all supported platforms.

----------------------=[Detailed Description]=------------------------
A simple URL driven denial of service or buffer overflow condition
occurs when a very long text string is sent to the web service.
This occurs on all four web services that the Oracle9iAS Web Cache
software provides. The four services are by default run on:
Port 1100 = Incoming web cache proxy.
Port 4000 = Administrative interface.
Port 4001 = Web XML invalidation port.
Port 4002 = Statistics port.

* Buffer overflow condition:
  When sending a request containing / + 'A' x 3095 + 'N' x 4, the
  process terminates with the with the following state dump:

  <....snip>
  State Dump for Thread Id 0x104

  eax=00000c1d ebx=00000000 ecx=00000c1d edx=026f0041
  esi=01baac86 edi=0040deb6
  eip=4e4e4e4e esp=0632fe08 ebp=41414141 iopl=0
  cs=001b  ss=0023  ds=0023  es=0023  fs=0038  gs=0000
  efl=00000216
  <snip....>

* Denial of service:
  Upon sending a string longer then 3570 characters, the process
  simply exists without stack dump:
  'GET /<3571 x A> HTTP/1.0'

  The following three denial of service attacks result in the process
  hanging and the CPU usage of 100% and a reboot is required in order
  to terminate the hanging processes.

  - When sending a string containing approximately 3094 characters.

  - When sending more aproximatly 4000 characters in the HTTP header.
    User-Agent is one of the verified headers where this condition
    exists.
    'GET / HTTP/1.0'
    'User-Agent: <4000 x A>'

  - Sending the following request (this only affects the webcache
    admin interface):
    'GET /. HTTP/1.0'

## History

The CERT Division is the birthplace of cybersecurity. For nearly 30 years, the CERT Division of the SEI has partnered with government, industry, law enforcement, and academia to advance cybersecurity and improve the security and resilience of computer systems and networks.

Originally focused on incident response, we have expanded into cybersecurity areas such as network situational awareness, malicious code analysis, secure coding, resilience management, insider threats, digital investigations and intelligence, workforce development, DevOps, forensics, software assurance, vulnerability discovery and analysis, and risk management.

## Former Director Richard Pethia

[Richard Pethia](/about/leadership/display.cfm?customel_datapageid_2623=3545) was founding director of the SEI's CERT Division. Pethia, who served as director of CERT from 1988 to 2016, guided the organization through tremendous growth and change. Under Pethia's leadership, the unit expanded and evolved from the CERT Coordination Center—a small group focused on computer incident response—to a research organization of more than 200 professionals dedicated to solving problems with widespread cybersecurity implications.
