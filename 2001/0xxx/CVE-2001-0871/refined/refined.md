- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient validation of HTTP requests by the Alchemy Eye HTTP server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The HTTP server component in Alchemy Eye versions 2.0 through 2.6 does not adequately validate user input within HTTP requests. This lack of proper validation allows for the injection of arbitrary commands.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the server. This could lead to a full system compromise, data theft, denial of service, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** Attackers send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable Alchemy Eye HTTP server component.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable server. No special privileges or access to the server are mentioned.
