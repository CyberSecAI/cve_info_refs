- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An implementation flaw in how custom print templates are handled in Internet Explorer 5.5. A website can invoke a custom print template without user approval.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The print template feature in Internet Explorer 5.5 does not properly validate user consent before executing custom print templates.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  A malicious website can execute arbitrary ActiveX controls, including those not marked as safe for scripting, on the user's computer. This can allow the attacker to perform actions such as modifying, adding, or deleting files, or exchanging data with a website.
- **Attack vectors:** A user visits a malicious website that triggers the execution of a custom print template without the user's consent.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to host a malicious website that exploits the vulnerability. The attacker must craft a print template with malicious ActiveX controls. The targeted user needs to visit the attacker's malicious website.
