Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is due to a format string vulnerability in the C runtime functions that SQL Server's text formatting functions call when installed on Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000 or Windows XP. The C runtime's formatted text handling functions do not validate the format strings they process, causing a vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Format String Vulnerability:** The core weakness is the lack of proper validation of format strings passed to the C runtime's formatted text functions. This allows an attacker to manipulate the format string and cause unintended behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability can be exploited to cause a denial of service. Due to the specific nature of this vulnerability, it can't be exploited to run arbitrary code. The C Runtime code would be overrun with the same values regardless of the attacker's input. This overwrite leads to the failure of the SQL Server service.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Direct SQL Query Execution:** An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by directly executing a malicious SQL query containing the vulnerable text formatting functions with crafted format strings.
- **SQL Injection:** If a web application or other database front-end does not properly sanitize user inputs, an attacker could inject malicious SQL queries containing the format string vulnerability through the front-end. This would indirectly lead to the execution of the vulnerable code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **SQL Query Execution Ability:** The attacker must have the ability to execute SQL queries either directly on the server or through a vulnerable application that connects to the database.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Functions:** The attacker needs knowledge of the specific SQL Server functions that use the vulnerable C runtime functions.
- **Windows OS:** The vulnerability is only exploitable on Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000, or Windows XP.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is related to the C runtime, not SQL Server directly.
- Although format string vulnerabilities often enable arbitrary code execution, in this case, the specific way this vulnerability occurs limits the impact to a DoS.
- The provided @stake advisory refers to the related SQL Server buffer overflow vulnerability (CVE-2001-0542) and the SQL injection vulnerability.
