- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A buffer overflow occurs when the Virus Buster 2001 email scanning feature processes email headers with unusually long strings. Specifically, long strings in the "From:" header as defined in RFC 822 can trigger the overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Buffer overflow vulnerability in the email scanning component. The software acts as a proxy between the Mail User Agent (MUA) and the Mail Retrieval Agent (MRA) and does not properly validate the length of email header strings before copying them into a buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can prevent the user from receiving new emails, requiring a computer restart to regain normal functionality. Additionally, an attacker could potentially execute arbitrary commands, indicating the possibility of remote code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered when an email with an excessively long "From:" header is received by the MUA. This header is parsed by the Virus Buster 2001 software, and due to the buffer overflow, can cause the issues outlined in the "Impact of exploitation".
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to send an email with an unusually long "From:" header to a victim who is using the vulnerable version of Virus Buster 2001. The attacker does not need to be on the same network, as the attack vector involves sending an email.
