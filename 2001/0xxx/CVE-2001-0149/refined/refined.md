Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities discussed, focusing on the one relevant to CVE-2001-0149:

**1. Windows Script Host Vulnerability (CVE-2001-0149 / CAN-2001-0149)**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in how Windows Script Host (WSH) handles certain requests, specifically a failure to properly check the domain when certain requests are made of it.

*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:** This flaw allows a malicious web site or HTML email to bypass security restrictions and open a window on the user's local file system.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker could potentially read files from the user's local computer that can be opened in a browser window.  This could expose sensitive information.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The primary attack vector is through a malicious web page viewed in Internet Explorer or through a specially crafted HTML email that executes malicious scripts using WSH.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:**
    *   The attacker needs to host a malicious web site or send a malicious HTML email.
    *   The attacker needs to know the name and location of the file on the user's computer they want to read.
    *   The attacker is limited to viewing files that can be opened in a browser window.
    *   Requires the user to either visit the malicious website or open the crafted email.

**2. Other Vulnerabilities (Not Directly Related to CVE-2001-0149 but are included in the provided bulletin MS01-015)**

*   **IE Cached Content Location Disclosure (CAN-2001-0002):**
    *   **Root Cause:** A flaw in how Internet Explorer (IE) handles cached content. Specifically, it's possible for a web page or HTML email to discover the physical location of cached content.
    *   **Weakness/Vulnerability:** The caching mechanism, intended to obfuscate the location of cached content, can be bypassed.
    *   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker could force cached content to be opened in the Local Computer Zone, allowing for the execution of compiled HTML help (.CHM) files containing shortcuts to executables, enabling arbitrary code execution.
    *  **Attack Vector:** Requires the user to visit an attacker's web site or open a malicious HTML email.
*   **"Frame Domain Verification" Vulnerability Variant (CAN-2001-0148):**
    *   **Root Cause:**  A variant of the "Frame Domain Verification" vulnerability
    *   **Weakness/Vulnerability:** Allows a malicious website to open two browser windows, one on the attacker's domain and one on the local file system, and pass information from the latter to the former.
    *   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker could potentially read files from the user's local computer that can be opened in a browser window.
     *  **Attack Vector:**  Requires the user to visit an attacker's web site.
*   **Telnet Invocation Vulnerability (CAN-2001-0150):**
    *   **Root Cause:** A flaw in how IE invokes Telnet sessions, allowing command-line arguments to be passed to the Telnet client when started via a web page or HTML email.
    *   **Weakness/Vulnerability:** The Telnet client (specifically the one included with Services for Unix 2.0) allows command line logging to a file. The browser allows a remote attacker to specify a command line argument to the telnet client.
    *  **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker could use the logging option to write files to the user's file system and potentially execute code.
    *  **Attack Vector:** Requires the user to visit an attacker's web site or open a malicious HTML email.  Requires that the affected version of telnet (from Services for Unix) is installed.

**Guninski Advisory**

The Georgi Guninski advisory describes a vulnerability related to the `GetObject()` JScript function and the `htmlfile` ActiveX object. This vulnerability is **UNRELATED** to the CVE-2001-0149. It describes a different method of reading local files via Javascript. This specific exploit method is not detailed in the Microsoft bulletin.

**Summary of CVE-2001-0149**

The vulnerability associated with CVE-2001-0149 is a flaw within Windows Script Host that allows for unauthorized file access when exploited through Internet Explorer. An attacker can leverage this flaw to read files on a user's system, potentially exposing sensitive information. This is distinct from the other vulnerabilities mentioned, which involve different components and exploitation methods.
