# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS01-041 - Important

## Malformed RPC Request Can Cause Service Failure

Published: July 26, 2001 | Updated: April 13, 2004

**Version:** 2.0

**Originally posted:** July 26, 2001

**Updated:** April 13, 2004

**Version:** 2.0

#### Summary

**Who should read this bulletin:**

System administrators using MicrosoftÂ® Windows NTÂ® 4.0, WindowsÂ® 2000, SQL Serverâ¢, or Exchange Server.

**Impact of vulnerability:**

Denial of service

**Recommendation:**

System administrators consider applying the patches for any affected products they have installed.

**Affected Software:**

* Microsoft Exchange Server 5.0
* Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5
* Microsoft Exchange 2000 Server
* Microsoft SQL Server 7.0
* Microsoft SQL Server 2000
* Microsoft Windows NT 4.0
* Microsoft Windows 2000

### General Information

## Technical details

**Technical description:**

Subsequent to the release of this bulletin, it was determined that the vulnerability addressed also affects Exchange Server 5.0. Microsoft has updated the bulletin with additional information about Exchange Server 5.0 and also to direct users to a security update for this additional affected platform. This security update for Exchange 5.0 is a cumulative rollup package that also addresses the vulnerabilities discussed in [MS00-082](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/ms00-082) and [MS03-046](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/ms03-046). You need only install this security update once to be protected against all three vulnerabilities.

Several of the RPC servers associated with system services in Microsoft Exchange Server, SQL Server, Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000 do not adequately validate inputs, and in some cases will accept invalid inputs that prevent normal processing. The specific input values at issue here vary from RPC server to RPC server.

An attacker who sent such inputs to an affected RPC server could disrupt its service. The precise type of disruption would depend on the specific service, but could range in effect from minor (e.g., the service temporarily hanging) to major (e.g., the service failing in a way that would require the entire system to be restarted).

**Mitigating factors:**

* Proper firewalling would help minimize an affected system's exposure to attack by Internet-based users. In general, a firewall should block access to all RPC services except those that are specifically intended for use by untrusted users.

**Vulnerability identifier:** [CAN-2001-0509](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=can-2001-0509)

**Tested Versions:**

Microsoft tested the following products to assess whether they are affected by this vulnerability. Previous versions are no longer [supported](https://support.microsoft.com/directory/discontinue.asp) and may or may not be affected by this vulnerability.

* Microsoft Exchange Server 5.0
* Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5

## Frequently asked questions

**Why is Microsoft reissuing this bulletin?**

Subsequent to the release of this bulletin, it was determined that the vulnerability addressed also affects Exchange Server 5.0. Microsoft has updated the bulletin with additional information about Exchange Server 5.0 and also to direct users to an update for this additional affected platform. This update for Exchange 5.0 is a cumulative rollup package that also addresses the vulnerabilities in discussed in [MS00-082](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/ms00-082) and [MS03-046](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/ms03-046). You need only install this security update once to be protected against all three vulnerabilities.

**What's the scope of this vulnerability?**

This is a [denial of service](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/glossary) vulnerability. By sending a specially malformed request to an affected system, an attacker could disrupt its ability to service legitimate users' requests.
The effect of exploiting this vulnerability would vary widely, depending on the particular request, and which of the affected services the attacker could send it to. If best practices have been followed, an attacker on the Internet would be unable to send such a request to any of the affected services.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability results because of mismatches between the interface definitions in several RPC server stubs and the input validation code in the associated servers. In the affected servers, certain inputs aren't validated prior to use, with the result that inputs that are permissible per the interface definitions but which nevertheless are invalid could be used to disrupt the server operation.

**What is RPC?**

[RPC](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/aa378651) (Remote Procedure Call) is a technology that's used extensively to support distributed applications -- that is, applications whose various components are located on different computers. The primary purpose of RPC is to provide a way for the components to communicate with each other. This allows the components to levy requests on each other and communicate the results of these requests.

**What's an RPC server stub?**

The overall goal of RPC is to mask the fact that the client and server components reside on different machines, and instead make it appear that both are running on the local machine. This is accomplished through the use of [stubs](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/aa367285). On the client system, a stub (known as the client stub) makes it appear that the server component resides on the client machine. Likewise, on the server system, a stub (known as the server stub) makes it appear that the client component resides on the server machine.
When the client component levies a request to the client stub, the stub packages the request in an RPC message and sends it to the server machine. The server stub unpackages the request and passes it to the server component, which acts on the request. If the server needs to send a response, it sends it to the server stub, which then packages the response in an RPC message and sends it to the client machine. The client stub then unpackages the response and passes it to the client component.

**What's wrong with RPC?**

The problem doesn't lie in the RPC architecture, but rather in the implementation of several RPC servers. The server stub advertises an interface definition, but the servers don't always validate the inputs they receive correctly.

**What's an interface definition?**

An interface definition can be thought of as a template that all requests to a particular server must conform to. For instance, an interface definition for a particular RPC server might indicate that there are five parameters that must be included in a request, and that all of them must be integers. A request that doesn't adhere to the interface definition won't be accepted by the server stub.
The problem is that even a request that conforms to the interface definition may not be valid. For instance, even though an interface definition may require an integer as an input, there may be values that the server code cannot process. It's the responsibility of the server code to check all inputs to make sure they have acceptable values. This vulnerability results because some RPC servers associated with system services in Exchange, SQL, Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000 don't do this.

**What would be the result if someone sent an invalid request to such a server?**

It would depend on the specific server at issue, and how it handles the specific request included in the RPC message. In some cases, the request might have little or no lasting effect on the system service. In others, the request could cause the service could fail with no effect on the overall system. In others, the service could fail in a way that destabilizes the overall system and requires the machine to be restarted.

**How might an attacker exploit this vulnerability?**

As a general statement, an attacker might exploit this vulnerability as a means of preventing the server from providing useful service. However, the specific effects he could cause would vary dramatically on a machine-by-machine basis. As we discussed above, different services are affected in different ways by this vulnerability.
The damage an attacker could cause via this vulnerability would be heavily dependent on exactly which services he could send malformed requests to. In some cases, the attacker might be able to deny particular services to legitimate users. In others, it could be possible to cause an affected system to fail altogether and require rebooting.

**What would determine which services the attacker could send malformed requests to?**

The most important factor would be which services are installed on the machine. For instance, if neither Exchange Server nor SQL Server were installed on the machine, the attacker clearly wouldnât be able to exploit any of the vulnerabilities in those services.

**Could a firewall prevent an Internet-based attacker from exploiting the vulnerability?**

Yes. If the port on which an affected RPC server listens is blocked, an Internet-based attacker wouldn't be able to deliver requests to the server, and would therefore be unable to exploit the vulnerability.

**What does the patch do?**

The patch eliminates the vulnerability by introducing proper validation checking into the affected RPC servers.
