- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists due to inadequate input validation in several RPC servers associated with system services in Microsoft Exchange Server, SQL Server, Windows NT 4.0, and Windows 2000. These servers do not properly validate inputs received through RPC, potentially accepting invalid data that disrupts normal processing. Specifically, there's a mismatch between interface definitions in RPC server stubs and the input validation code, allowing inputs that conform to the interface definition but are invalid to be processed by the server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insufficient input validation in RPC servers. The servers do not check if the received input values are acceptable for processing, even if the data adheres to the interface definitions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could send malformed RPC requests to an affected server, causing a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. The impact could vary from minor service disruptions to complete service failure, potentially requiring a system restart. The specific outcome depends on the affected service and the nature of the invalid input.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted, malformed RPC requests to vulnerable RPC servers. These requests leverage the inadequate input validation within the servers.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send RPC requests to the targeted server. Typically, this could be an attacker on the same network, but the document notes that proper firewalling should prevent external attackers from reaching the vulnerable services.
