- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Telnet service uses predictable names for named pipes when creating new sessions. If a pipe with the designated name already exists, Telnet will use it.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Predictable named pipe creation leading to potential for hijacking.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Privilege elevation: An attacker can create a named pipe with malicious code, which the Telnet service would execute in the context of the Local System account, gaining full control over the server.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - The attacker needs to have the ability to load and run code on the Telnet server. This generally requires local logon rights to the server.
    - The attacker would need to create the named pipe with the predictable name before the Telnet service starts a new session.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Ability to log onto the server interactively or to execute arbitrary code on the server.
    - Knowledge of the predictable named pipe naming scheme used by the Telnet service.
