## Oracle Internet Directory contains multiple vulnerabilities in LDAP handling code

#### Vulnerability Note VU#869184

Original Release Date: 2001-07-17 | Last Revised: 2002-12-12

---

### Overview

The Oracle Internet Directory server contains vulnerabilities that may allow denial-of-service attacks, unauthorized privileged access, or both. These vulnerabilities were revealed using the [PROTOS LDAPv3 test suite](http://www.ee.oulu.fi/research/ouspg/protos/testing/c06/ldapv3/) and are documented in CERT Advisory [CA-2001-18](http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2001-18.html). If your site uses this product, the CERT/CC encourages you to follow the advice provided below.

### Description

| The Oracle Internet Directory server contains multiple vulnerabilities in the code used to process LDAP requests.  In the encoding section of the test suite, this product failed an indeterminate number of test cases in the group that tests a server's response to invalid encodings of BER OBJECT-IDENTIFIER values. In the application section of the test suite, this product failed 46 of 77 groups. These results suggest that both buffer overflow and format string vulnerabilities are likely to be present in a variety of application components. |
| --- |

### Impact

| One or more of these vulnerabilities allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Oracle server. The server typically runs with system privileges. At least one of these vulnerabilities has been successfully exploited in a laboratory environment. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply a patch from your vendor**Please consult the [Systems Affected](#systems) section for vendor-specific information on addressing this vulnerability. |
| --- |

| **Block access to directory services at network perimeter**  As a temporary measure, it is possible to limit the scope of these vulnerabilities by blocking access to directory services at the network perimeter. Please note that this workaround does not protect vulnerable products from internal attacks.             ldap    389/tcp     # Lightweight Directory Access Protocol             ldap    389/udp     # Lightweight Directory Access Protocol             ldaps   636/tcp     # ldap protocol over TLS/SSL (was sldap)             ldaps   636/udp     # ldap protocol over TLS/SSL (was sldap) |

## History

The CERT Division is the birthplace of cybersecurity. For nearly 30 years, the CERT Division of the SEI has partnered with government, industry, law enforcement, and academia to advance cybersecurity and improve the security and resilience of computer systems and networks.

Originally focused on incident response, we have expanded into cybersecurity areas such as network situational awareness, malicious code analysis, secure coding, resilience management, insider threats, digital investigations and intelligence, workforce development, DevOps, forensics, software assurance, vulnerability discovery and analysis, and risk management.

## Former Director Richard Pethia

[Richard Pethia](/about/leadership/display.cfm?customel_datapageid_2623=3545) was founding director of the SEI's CERT Division. Pethia, who served as director of CERT from 1988 to 2016, guided the organization through tremendous growth and change. Under Pethia's leadership, the unit expanded and evolved from the CERT Coordination Center—a small group focused on computer incident response—to a research organization of more than 200 professionals dedicated to solving problems with widespread cybersecurity implications.
