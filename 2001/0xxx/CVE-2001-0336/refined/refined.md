This document describes multiple vulnerabilities patched by Microsoft Security Bulletin MS01-026. CVE-2001-0336 specifically refers to a denial-of-service vulnerability caused by a flaw in the patches for MS00-060.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2001-0336:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The patch for MS00-060, which aimed to prevent cross-site scripting, introduced a flaw in its character sequence search algorithm. This flaw allowed an attacker to abuse the algorithm, causing it to consume excessive server resources when processing a specific type of invalid request.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability. The flawed search algorithm in the MS00-060 patch can be abused, leading to excessive resource consumption and preventing the server from responding to legitimate requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The server becomes temporarily unresponsive due to excessive resource consumption.
- The server cannot respond to other requests in a timely manner.

**Attack Vectors:**
- By sending a specific type of invalid request to the server, an attacker can trigger the flawed algorithm.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the server. No specific user privileges are required. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
