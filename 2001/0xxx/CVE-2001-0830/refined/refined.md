- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The 6tunnel program does not correctly close sockets after a client disconnects. Specifically, when a client disconnects, the socket remains in a CLOSE state instead of being properly released.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  A resource exhaustion vulnerability due to the failure to properly close sockets after a client disconnects.
- **Impact of exploitation:** By flooding the 6tunnel program with connection attempts and disconnections, an attacker can cause the program to exhaust its resources and crash. This results in a denial of service, preventing new connections from being established, although existing connections may remain active until the crash.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely if the attacker can establish a connection to the 6tunnel server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs the ability to connect to the 6tunnel server to exploit this vulnerability. They don't need any special privileges or knowledge beyond the ability to establish a connection using TCP. The provided `6tunneldos.c` source code demonstrates how to exploit this vulnerability.
