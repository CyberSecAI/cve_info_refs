Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2001-0731:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability occurs when the `Multiviews` feature in Apache is used to negotiate directory indexes.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper handling of `QUERY_STRING` parameters in conjunction with `Multiviews` leading to information disclosure.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A malicious user can bypass the intended index page and obtain a directory listing by sending a crafted request. This may expose files and directories that are not intended to be publicly accessible.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a request with a `QUERY_STRING` of `M=D` to a directory where multiviews is enabled.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the server.
- The server needs to have `Multiviews` enabled.

**Additional details from the content:**
- This vulnerability was present in Apache version 1.3.20 and was fixed in the code base in preparation for the 1.3.21 release.
- The vulnerability is triggered when the query string `M=D` is used in the request URI.
