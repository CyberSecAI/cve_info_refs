Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- A format string vulnerability exists in the NQS daemon (nqsdaemon) on Cray UNICOS systems. This vulnerability is triggered when processing the name of a batch job submitted via the `qsub` command. The vulnerability lies in an unsafe function that processes the job name, taking a variable argument list.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Format String Vulnerability:** The core weakness is the usage of a format string in an unsafe function within the NQS daemon. This function processes user-controlled input (the batch job name) as a format string, leading to arbitrary memory read/write.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Local Root Compromise:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows any unprivileged user on the system to gain root access.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **`qsub` command:** The attacker crafts a malicious batch job with a name containing format string specifiers (e.g., `%x`, `%n`, `%s`).
- **NQS daemon:** When the NQS daemon processes the job, it parses the malicious name and uses the format string specifiers to overwrite critical parts of the process memory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User Access:** The attacker must have an account on the target system.
- **Ability to submit jobs via `qsub`:** The attacker must be able to submit batch jobs using the `qsub` command.
- **Knowledge of format string vulnerabilities:** The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious format string for exploitation.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was successfully tested on a Cray T3E running UNICOS/mk revision 2.0.5.54
- The exploit was found to be easier to perform on RISC architectures like ALPHA processors than on vectorized processors like Y-MP series.
- The advisory mentions that similar vulnerabilities have been exploited successfully on Digital UNIX systems.
- The advisory mentions the possibility of the vulnerability affecting NQSD running in IBM and Solaris environments.

**More Detail Than CVE Description:**
- The content provides significantly more detail than the typical CVE description, which is just a placeholder. It explains the exact root cause (format string bug), the attack vector (`qsub` command), the impact (local root compromise), and some information about the difficulty of exploitation on different architectures, which is very rare for a CVE.
