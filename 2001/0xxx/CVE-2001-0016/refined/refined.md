- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A flaw in the NTLM Security Support Provider (NTLMSSP) service in Windows NT 4.0. The service doesn't correctly handle malformed NTLM authentication requests.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is due to the NTLMSSP service's failure to properly validate a specially crafted request, which leads to arbitrary code execution.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with Local System privileges, granting them complete control over the affected machine. They can add, delete, or modify data, create or delete user accounts, and add accounts to the local administrators group.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves a local, unprivileged user initiating a specially crafted request to the NTLMSSP service.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have the ability to log onto the machine interactively and run code on the system. This implies the attacker needs valid user credentials and the ability to execute custom code on the target machine. The exploit requires local access, it cannot be done remotely.
