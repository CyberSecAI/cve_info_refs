Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The `man` package in SuSe Linux (versions 6.1 through 7.0) and Debian 2.2r2 is vulnerable to a format string vulnerability. This means that user-controlled input (in this case, the `-l` parameter) is passed directly to a function like `printf` without proper sanitization, leading to the format string vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Format string vulnerability:** The `man` utility improperly handles format specifiers in the `-l` argument. By injecting format specifiers like `%x`, an attacker can potentially read from or write to arbitrary memory locations.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   The provided example `man -l %x%x%x%x` demonstrates the ability to cause the program to print memory contents. While the example only demonstrates a crash due to invalid file access after memory display, other format string specifiers could be used for more severe impact.
*   The vulnerability can potentially allow an attacker to read sensitive data from memory, cause a denial of service (DoS), or potentially execute arbitrary code, though the content provided does not give information about arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attacker provides a crafted string containing format specifiers via the `-l` parameter of the `man` command.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker must be able to execute the `man` command with the ability to provide the crafted `-l` parameter. No special privileges are required, since `man` is usually a standard user command.

**Additional notes:**

*   The provided content is a bug report and confirms the vulnerability in SuSe Linux and Debian.
