This document describes two vulnerabilities, one of which is CAN-2001-0245 (CVE-2001-0245).

**Root cause of vulnerability (CAN-2001-0245/CVE-2001-0245):**
A new variant of the "Malformed Hit-Highlighting" vulnerability. This vulnerability is caused by improper handling of search requests which allows the reading of files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present (CAN-2001-0245/CVE-2001-0245):**
The vulnerability allows the reading of files on the web server. Specifically, it exposes "include" files that were not previously vulnerable in the original "Malformed Hit-Highlighting" vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation (CAN-2001-0245/CVE-2001-0245):**
An attacker can read "include" files residing on the web server.

**Attack vectors (CAN-2001-0245/CVE-2001-0245):**
The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted search request to the Index Server or Indexing Service.

**Required attacker capabilities/position (CAN-2001-0245/CVE-2001-0245):**
The attacker needs to be able to send search requests to the affected service.
The vulnerability is limited to reading files on the same logical drive as the server's root directory.
