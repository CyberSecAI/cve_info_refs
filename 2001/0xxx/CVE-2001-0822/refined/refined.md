- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The fpf kernel module, designed to alter the TCP/IP stack for OS emulation, fails to properly handle fragmented packets. This leads to a kernel panic or system freeze when fragmented packets are sent to or received by a machine with the module loaded.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper handling of fragmented packets within the fpf module. The module's interaction with the TCP/IP stack during packet fragmentation is flawed.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Kernel panic or system freeze. This results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, effectively rendering the affected machine unusable until rebooted.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending fragmented TCP/IP packets to a machine with the fpf kernel module loaded. This can be achieved using tools like nmap or hping.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to send fragmented packets to the target machine. This can be achieved locally or remotely.
