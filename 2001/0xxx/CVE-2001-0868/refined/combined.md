Redhat Stronghold Secure Server File System Disclosure Vulnerability
Advisory Code: VIGILANTE-2001002
Release Date: November 23, 2001

Systems affected:
Stronghold/3.0 Apache/1.3.19 RedHat/3014 (Unix) PHP/3.0.18
mod_ssl/2.8.1 OpenSSL/0.9.6 mod_perl/1.25

Systems not affected:
Stronghold/3.0 build 3015

The problem:
In Redhat Stronghold from versions 2.3 up to 3.0 a flaw exists that
allows a remote attacker to disclose sensitive system files including
the httpd.conf file, if a restricted access to the server status
report is not enabled when using those features.
This may assist an attacker in performing further attacks.

By trying the following urls, an attacker can gather sensitive
information :
<http://target/stronghold-info> will give information on configuration
<http://target/stronghold-status> will return among other information
the list of request made

Please note that this attack can be performed after a default
installation. The vulnerabiliy seems to affect all previous version
of Stonghold.

Vendor status:
