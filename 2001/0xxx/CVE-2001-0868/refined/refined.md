- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A flaw in Redhat Stronghold versions 2.3 up to 3.0 allows a remote attacker to disclose sensitive system files, including the `httpd.conf` file, if restricted access to the server status report is not enabled.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Inadequate access controls on the `stronghold-info` and `stronghold-status` URLs.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker can obtain sensitive information about the server's configuration and activity, which can aid in further attacks. This includes disclosure of the `httpd.conf` file.
- **Attack vectors:** By sending HTTP requests to the URLs `/stronghold-info` and `/stronghold-status`, an attacker can gather sensitive information.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target server. No authentication is required, as the vulnerability exists after a default installation.
