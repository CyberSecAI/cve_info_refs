## Services for Unix 2.0 Telnet and NFS Services Contain Memory Leaks

Published: July 23, 2001 | Updated: June 13, 2003

**Version:** 1.1

**Originally posted:** July 23, 2001

**Updated:** June 13, 2003

#### Summary

**Who should read this bulletin:**

System administrators using MicrosoftÂ® Services for Unix 2.0.

**Impact of vulnerability:**

Denial of service

**Recommendation:**

System administrators using the NFS or Telnet services provided in Services for Unix should install the patch.

**Affected Software:**

* Microsoft Services for Unix 2.0

### General Information

## Technical details

**Technical description:**

Among the components provided by Services for Unix (SFU) 2.0 are services that implement the NFS (Network File System) and Telnet protocols. Both services contain memory leaks that could be triggered by a user request. An attacker who repeatedly sent such a request could deplete the kernel memory on the server to the point where performance slowed and the system could potentially fail.

**Mitigating factors:**

* Only the implementations provided in SFU 2.0 are affected. In particular, the Telnet services provided in Windows NTÂ® 4.0 and WindowsÂ® 2000 are not affected by the vulnerability.
* There is no capability via the vulnerability to usurp any administrative control over the server or compromise any data on it.

**Vulnerability identifier:** [CAN-2001-0505](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=can-2001-0505)

**Tested Versions:**

Microsoft tested Services for Unix 1.0 and 2.0 to assess whether they are affected by these vulnerabilities. Previous versions are no longer [supported](https://support.microsoft.com/directory/discontinue.asp), and may or may not be affected by these vulnerabilities.

## Frequently asked questions

**How are the vulnerabilities discussed in this bulletin related to each other?**

The vulnerabilities are only related in the sense that both affect services that are included in Services for Unix 2.0. We've packaged them together to make it more convenient for find and apply them.

**What is Services for Unix?**

[Services for Unix](https://www.microsoft.com/windows2000/sfu/) (SFU) is a set of components that can be installed on Windows NT 4.0 or Windows 2000 and make it easy for customers to integrate Windows into their existing Unix environments. It provides Windows-based implementations of common Unix tools and services, as well as providing tools that enable administrators to more easily manage heterogeneous networks.

**What are the vulnerabilities?**

There are two vulnerabilities:

* A vulnerability that could enable an attacker to cause the NFS service in SFU 2.0 to fail.
* A vulnerability that could enable an attacker to cause the Telnet service in SFU 2.0 to fail.

**What's the scope of the first vulnerability?**

The is a [denial of service](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/glossary) vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited it could prevent an affected system from providing file-sharing services, and potentially cause the system itself to fail and require rebooting. It would not provide any means of usurping control over the system, nor would it enable the attacker to compromise any of the files on the server.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability results because the NFS service in SFU 2.0 contains a memory leak. If a particular type of malformed were repeatedly sent to an affected server, it could exhaust the memory on the server, potentially causing the system to fail.

**What is NFS?**

Network File System (NFS) is an industry standard protocol, defined in [RFC 1094](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1094.txt?number=1094), that provides transparent, remote access to shared files across networks. For instance, suppose that machines A, B and C all contained data that was intended to be shared with all of the users on a network. Using NFS, users wouldn't need to know where the particular data resided in order to navigate and use it. Instead, NFS would make it appear that all of the data resided on a single, fictitious machine.

**What's wrong with NFS service in SFU 2.0?**

The NFS implementation in SFU 2.0 contains a memory leak that can be triggered by a particular type of request to the service.

**What's a memory leak?**

A memory leak is a condition that occurs when a program doesn't properly return memory to the operating system after it's done using it. One of the chief purposes of an operating system is to broker resources like memory among competing programs. When a program needs memory to carry out an operation, the operating system provides it; when the program no longer needs it, it should release the memory so the operating system can allocate it to another program.
A memory leak occurs when a programming flaw prevents the program from returning the memory when it's done using it. Rather than being made available to the operating system again, the memory remains allocated to the other program even though it's no longer using it. If the leak occurs enough times, it can deplete the pool of available memory on the server to the point where the server becomes unresponsive or fails altogether.

**What would this vulnerability enable an attacker to do?**

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability as a means of preventing the system from providing useful service to other users. Not only would the memory leak prevent the NFS service from operating, it would slow the overall performance of the system and could potentially cause it to fail altogether.

**What would be required in order to resume normal service?**

The administrator would need to reboot the machine in order to free the memory and resume normal operation.

**Would the vulnerability allow the attacker to take any more serious action?**

No. Even though the vulnerability involves the NFS service, it wouldn't put any of the data in the file system at risk. The attacker could not use the vulnerability to compromise any of the data, nor to gain any privileges on the system.

**Does the vulnerability affect any versions of SFU other than SFU 2.0?**

No. It only affects the NFS service in SFU 2.0

**How does the patch eliminate the vulnerability?**

The patch causes the NFS service in SFU 2.0 to correctly release all memory when it's finished using it.

**What's the scope of the second vulnerability?**

The is a [denial of service](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/glossary) vulnerability. The scope of this vulnerability is similar to that of the vulnerability discussed above:

* An attacker who successfully exploited it would be able to disrupt normal service on the system, including potentially causing it to fail.
* The vulnerability would not provide the attacker with the ability to usurp any kind of administrative control over the system.
* An affected system could be put back into service by rebooting.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability results because the Telnet service in SFU 2.0 contains a memory leak that could be used to slow the performance of the system or cause it fail altogether.

**Are there any differences between this vulnerability and the one affecting the NFS service?**

No. This vulnerability has exactly the same cause, effect, and remediation as the one affecting the NFS service in SFU 2.0. The sole difference lies in the specific services involved in the vulnerabilities.

**Does this vulnerability affect the Telnet server that ships in Windows NT 4.0 or Windows 2000?**

No. Both Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000 ship with a native Telnet server, which is completely different from the one included in SFU 2.0. Neither are affected by this vulnerability.

**How does the patch eliminate this vulnerability?**

The patch eliminates the vulnerability by removing the memory leak condition and ensuring that all memory is returned to the system when no longer needed.
