- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Resin web server incorrectly validates paths, allowing traversal outside the web root.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Path traversal vulnerability due to insufficient input validation when handling relative paths ("..", "...") combined with backslashes.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can access files and directories outside of the intended web root directory.
- **Attack vectors:** By sending a crafted HTTP request with a URL containing backslashes before ".." or "..." sequences (e.g., `http://localhost:8080/\../readme.txt`).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted HTTP requests to the web server.
