- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A flaw in an LDAP function, specifically when changing a domain user's password via LDAP over SSL, fails to perform proper permission checks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing authorization checks when modifying the password attribute of a user object via LDAP over SSL.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can change the password of any domain user, including domain administrators. This can lead to denial of service (by preventing the user from logging in) or privilege escalation (by logging in with the compromised account).
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation occurs through an LDAP over SSL session to a vulnerable server. The vulnerable function can be called by any user, even anonymous ones.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker must be able to connect to an affected LDAP server via SSL (TCP port 636). They can be any user able to connect to the LDAP server, including those on anonymous sessions, meaning they need to be on the same side of the firewall as the LDAP server.
