- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The VB T-SQL debugger object (vbsdicli.exe) in Visual Studio 6.0 and Visual Basic 6.0 Enterprise Edition has an unchecked buffer in the code that processes parameters for one of its methods.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Buffer overflow vulnerability. The object can be accessed remotely and is vulnerable to a specially crafted parameter that can cause a buffer overrun.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Less serious: The object fails on the hosting machine.
    - More serious: Arbitrary code execution on the hosting machine with the privileges of the interactively logged-on user.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending specially malformed data within a parameter to the vulnerable object.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to be on the same intranet as the target machine.
    - The attacker needs to know the target machine has Visual Studio 6.0 or Visual Basic 6.0 Enterprise Edition installed.
    - An interactive user needs to be logged on to the target machine at the time of the attack.
    - The attacker needs to know the target computer's name.
    - Ports 137-139 and 445 should not be blocked on the organization's router or firewall, or the attacker needs to be on the same network.
