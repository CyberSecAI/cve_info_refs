- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Terminal Services trusts the client-provided IP address instead of using the TCP stack to determine the client's IP address.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: IP address spoofing in Terminal Services Manager and Event Log.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can cause the Terminal Services Manager and Event Log to record a spoofed IP address for Terminal Services connections. This can be used to conceal the attacker's true IP address, potentially hiding their location when used in conjunction with other attacks like brute-forcing passwords. This can also lead to untrustworthy log information, affecting its credibility as evidence.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending traffic through a router that uses Network Address Translation (NAT), and manipulating the client-provided IP address.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to establish a Terminal Services connection and manipulate their client-side reported IP address, typically by being behind a NAT router and potentially adjusting routes.
