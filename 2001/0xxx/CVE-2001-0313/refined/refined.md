- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Borderware firewall server's ping server improperly handles ping requests to the network broadcast address, causing it to continuously send echo requests to the entire network.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper handling of broadcast ping requests, leading to a smurf attack.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A denial-of-service (DoS) attack can be executed on the network, potentially disrupting services and connectivity for machines on the same network as the Borderware's public interface.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a ping to the broadcast address of the network where the Borderware firewall is connected. This can be done using standard ping utilities or other network scanning tools.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker can be located externally if the router does not drop broadcast packets, or on the local network. The attacker needs the ability to send ping requests to the broadcast address of the network where the vulnerable Borderware firewall is connected.
