- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The ibrow NewsDesk Perl CGI script does not properly sanitize user-supplied input from the URL before passing it as an argument to the `open()` function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - **Command injection:** Due to the lack of input sanitization, an attacker can inject shell meta-characters such as "|" (pipe) into the URL, leading to the execution of arbitrary operating system commands with the privileges of the web server.
    - **Directory traversal:**  The vulnerability also allows directory traversal using ".." sequences in the URL, allowing attackers to access files outside of the intended web directory.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Attackers can execute arbitrary operating system commands with the privileges of the web server.
    - Attackers can traverse the file system and read files with the permission of the web server, potentially accessing sensitive data.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - The attack vector is through a specially crafted URL that contains malicious shell meta-characters and directory traversal sequences.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server, and construct malicious URLs containing shell meta-characters and directory traversal sequences.
