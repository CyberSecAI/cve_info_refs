## Oliver Debon Flash plug-in vulnerable to buffer overflow processing incorrectly formatted sound file

#### Vulnerability Note VU#451096

Original Release Date: 2001-05-17 | Last Revised: 2001-06-20

---

### Overview

When passed an incorrectly formatted sound file, the Oliver Debon (freeware) Flash plug-in is reportedly vulnerable to a buffer overflow.

### Description

| The DefineSound tag in a sound file passes data to a Flash plug-in. If this tag specifies fewer samples than are actually present in the data, a buffer overflow may occur in the plug-in produced by Oliver Debon. |
| --- |

### Impact

| The attacker may crash browser or execute commands as the user running the Flash plug-in. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Because the software is unsupported and no patches are available, CERT/CC is unaware of any corrective measures. |
