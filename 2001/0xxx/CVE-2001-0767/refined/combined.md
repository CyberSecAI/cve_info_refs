### [RORRIM](http://www.nitrolic.com/rorrim/)

Rorrim is a nice little puzzle game suitable for all ages. In this game you help a princess who was trapped in a world of mirrors escape from various dungeons. The trick here is it that she has to escape in the real world AND in the mirror world at the same time. The GamePad shows either a mirror image of the map OR inverts the controls of the princess and since you have to navigate on both screens at the same time, it is rather tricky.
