- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The implementation of the Remote Data Protocol (RDP) in the terminal service in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000 does not correctly handle a particular series of data packets.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper handling of a specific sequence of RDP data packets.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Denial of service. A specially crafted sequence of RDP packets sent to the affected server can cause it to fail, requiring a reboot to restore normal service, leading to loss of any unsaved data.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted sequence of packets to the RDP port of the target server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send the specific series of packets to the RDP port on the server; no prior authentication or session establishment is required.
