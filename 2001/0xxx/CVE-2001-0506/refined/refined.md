## Analysis of CVE-2001-0506

The provided content is related to CVE-2001-0506. It describes a buffer overflow vulnerability in the ssinc.dll of Microsoft IIS 4.0/5.0 when processing server-side include (SSI) files.

**Vulnerability:** Buffer Overflow in SSI Processing

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the way IIS handles the `#include` directive within SSI files. When processing this directive, `ssinc.dll` appends the directory name of the `.shtml` file to the included filename to form a new path. A fixed-size buffer of 2052 bytes (0x804) is used to store this new path. The length of the included filename is checked, ensuring it is not longer than 2049 bytes (0x801). However, the combined length of the directory name and included filename is not validated before copying it into the buffer. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the combined length exceeds the buffer size, overwriting the EBP and EIP saved on the stack.

*   **Weakness:** Unchecked buffer when processing SSI directives, specifically the `#include` directive. Lack of proper length validation before copying the combined directory path and filename into a fixed-size buffer.

*   **Impact:**
    *   An attacker can potentially overwrite the EBP (Extended Base Pointer) and EIP (Extended Instruction Pointer) registers. By carefully crafting the overflow data, an attacker can redirect the execution flow to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges. This allows the attacker to gain complete control over the affected server, modify web content, reconfigure the system, or perform any other desired action.

*   **Attack Vector:**
    1.  The attacker requires the ability to create or upload files (specifically `.shtml` files containing the malicious SSI directive) to the web server.
    2.  The attacker crafts an `.shtml` file with an `#include` directive where the included filename, when combined with the directory path, exceeds the buffer size.
    3.  The attacker accesses the crafted `.shtml` file through a web browser, triggering the buffer overflow.

*   **Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

    *   The attacker needs to have the ability to write files to the web server's directory or a directory accessible to the webserver. This often requires the attacker to have some level of privilege on the server, or exploit a misconfiguration that allows file uploads.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to access the created file through the web service (HTTP).

**Mitigating Factors (from MS01-044):**

*   Exploitation requires the ability to install content on the server. Default permissions restrict unprivileged users from doing so.
*   Best practices recommend against granting untrusted users the ability to install content.

**Workarounds (from NSFOCUS advisory):**

1.  Disable write access to the web directory for untrusted users.
2.  Remove `.shtml`, `.shtm`, and `.stm` mappings if SSI service is not needed.

**Patch:** The patch implements proper input checks to prevent the buffer overflow.
