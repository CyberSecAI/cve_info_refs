Hi All,
   I did a little playing with FormMail.pl after a run in with a spammer
abusing our webserver. Apparently ALL FormMail.pl cgi-bin scripts can be
used to spam anonymously.  I found another server with FormMail.pl and
tried the same exploit to send myself an email and it worked.

The email will not show the spammer's real IP.  Only the web servers IP
will show.  The web server logs will however show the true IP address of
the spammer.

Actual example of email sent;

Paste the line below in to your web browser URL box as one long single
line, insert your email in address in place of "email@address-to-spam.com",
and press enter.  Now go check your email.

Begin URL code
================
<http://www.hum.auc.dk/cgi-bin/FormMail.pl?recipient=email@address-to-spam.co>
m&message=Proof%20that%20FormMail.pl%20can%20be%20used%20to%20send%20anonymo
us%20spam.
================

If this technique was not already in use by a spammer I would have kept it
to myself, but it has already been on my server by a spammer.

The address "[www.hum.auc.dk](http://www.hum.auc.dk)" can be replaced with the address of ANY
webserver set up to use FormMail.pl
