Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The WatchGuard SMTP proxy's MIME parsing logic incorrectly handles MIME boundaries that end with two dashes. Specifically, the proxy fails to properly identify and filter attachments when the MIME boundary specifier ends with "--".

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper MIME Boundary Parsing:** The core weakness is the flawed logic for identifying the end of a MIME boundary when it contains two dashes, leading to misinterpretation of the attachment's content.
- **Bypass of Filtering:** This flaw allows attackers to bypass MIME type and file extension-based filtering intended to block malicious attachments.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Malware Delivery:** Attackers can send executable files, scripts, or other prohibited file types via email, bypassing the intended filtering mechanisms of the WatchGuard SMTP proxy.
- **Compromised Systems:** Successful exploitation could lead to malware infections and subsequent compromise of internal network systems.
- **Security Breach:** The vulnerability could potentially allow a breach of the organization's security perimeter.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Email Attachments:** The primary attack vector is through specifically crafted email messages containing malicious attachments. The boundary of these attachments must end in "--"

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Send Email:** The attacker needs the capability to send emails to recipients protected by a vulnerable WatchGuard firewall.
- **Understanding of MIME Structure:**  The attacker needs to be familiar with email MIME encoding and how to craft the malformed MIME boundary.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs knowledge about the vulnerability to craft the attack correctly.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was initially reported by Thomas Boll.
- The issue was confirmed to affect versions 4.5 and 4.6 of the WatchGuard LiveSecurity software.
- A fix was implemented in version 4.61 SP1.
