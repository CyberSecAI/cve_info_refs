- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An unchecked buffer exists in the Windows Media Player 6.4 code that processes Advanced Streaming Format (ASF) files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Buffer overflow in the ASF file processing code. Additionally, multiple other vulnerabilities affecting Windows Media Player 6.4, some of which could be exploited via email or web pages, are also addressed by the patch.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
  - In the simplest case, the vulnerability could cause Windows Media Player to crash.
  - More severely, it could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the user's computer with the privileges of the user. This code could potentially be used to take any action the user is capable of, including adding, creating, or deleting files, communicating with websites, or reformatting the hard drive.
- **Attack vectors**:
  - The primary attack vector involves an attacker creating a specially crafted malformed ASF file and inducing a user to open and play it.
  - Although the primary vector is limited to user-initiated file opening, the patch also addresses vulnerabilities that could be exploited through email or web pages.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
  - The attacker needs to create a specially crafted ASF file.
  - The attacker needs to entice a user to open and play the malicious ASF file.
  - For successful code execution, the attacker would need to know or guess the user's operating system to properly tailor the attack code.
