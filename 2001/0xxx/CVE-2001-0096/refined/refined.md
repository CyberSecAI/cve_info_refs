- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in a component of FrontPage Server Extensions (FPSE) that handles web forms. This component does not properly validate its input before processing it.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insufficient input validation in the FPSE web form handling component.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A specially-crafted form submission can cause the IIS service to fail, leading to a denial-of-service condition. On IIS 4.0, the service needs manual restart, while IIS 5.0 restarts automatically, but active web sessions are lost.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a specially-malformed form submission to an affected server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to send web requests to the targeted server and create a malformed web form submission request.
