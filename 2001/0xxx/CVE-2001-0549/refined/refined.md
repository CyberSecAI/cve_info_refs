The provided content is related to CVE-2001-0549.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Symantec LiveUpdate version 1.5 stores proxy server passwords in plaintext within the Windows registry.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability lies in the insecure storage of proxy server credentials. Specifically, the password is saved as cleartext in the registry. The registry key `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Symantec\LiveUpdate\Preferences\Proxy` is accessible to all users on the local machine.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A local attacker can gain access to the proxy server password. This could allow them to potentially access network resources or other systems if the proxy credentials are reused elsewhere. There is a specific concern that the proxy credentials might be the same as the domain login credentials.

**Attack vectors:**
A local attacker with read access to the registry.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to have local access to the system where Symantec LiveUpdate 1.5 is installed. The attacker must be able to read the Windows Registry.
