- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Passwords used to protect compressed folders in Microsoft Plus! 98 and Windows Me are recorded in a file on the user's system (c:\windows\dynazip.log).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure storage of passwords for compressed folders. The password protection feature was not intended to provide strong security, only protection against casual inspection, but the passwords should not have been recorded on the system at all.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker who gains access to an affected machine can recover the passwords used to protect compressed folders and access the files within them.
- **Attack vectors:** Physical access to the affected system, or if the owner has shared out the c:\windows folder.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs physical access to the affected machine, or access to a shared c:\windows folder, and must know the location of the log file.
