## Entrust GetAccess does not validate user input thereby allowing users to read arbitrary files

#### Vulnerability Note VU#243243

Original Release Date: 2002-09-18 | Last Revised: 2002-09-18

---

### Overview

Entrust GetAccess does not properly validate the CGI variable "LOCALE" and may be exploited to read arbitrary files on the server.

### Description

| Entrust GetAccess is a web software product for identifying users of a web site. Entrust GetAccess takes a CGI variable named "LOCALE" specifying a server directory in which to find international localization files. Entrust GetAccess does not adequately validate the LOCALE value to remove '../' and other character sequences allowing directory traversal. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker can read any file on the server to which the web server process has read privileges. |
