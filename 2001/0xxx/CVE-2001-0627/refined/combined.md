## SCO OpenServer/UnixWare vi creates temporary files insecurely

#### Vulnerability Note VU#747736

Original Release Date: 2001-10-09 | Last Revised: 2001-10-09

---

### Overview

The implementation of vi, a text editor, provided with SCO Openunix creates insecure temporary files with predictable names. Using a symbolic link attack, an intruder can overwrite any file writable by the user of vi.

### Description

| vi is a screen-oriented text editor. The implementation distributed with SCO Openunix creates temporary files in the world-writable directory /tmp with predictable names, and fails to check for prior ownership and protection of these files. |
| --- |

### Impact

| By creating symbolic links named for the files that vi creates, an intruder may overwrite any file writable by the user of vi. Since the intruder cannot control the content of the overwritten files, it does not seem likely that an increase in privilege will result. |

### Solution

| Apply vendor patches; see the Systems Affected section below. |
