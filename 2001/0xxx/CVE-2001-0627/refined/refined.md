- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `vi` text editor in SCO OpenServer/UnixWare creates temporary files in the `/tmp` directory with predictable names and does not check for prior ownership or permissions, leading to a symbolic link vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure creation of temporary files with predictable names in a world-writable directory and a lack of checks for prior ownership/permissions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can create a symbolic link with a name that matches the temporary file created by `vi`. When `vi` attempts to write to the temporary file, it will instead write to the file pointed to by the attacker's symlink, resulting in the attacker being able to overwrite any file writable by the user running `vi`.
- **Attack vectors:** Symbolic link attack. An attacker creates a symbolic link with the same name as the temporary file created by vi before the vi process creates the temporary file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to create files in the `/tmp` directory. The attacker needs to know the naming scheme used by vi for temporary file creation, to be able to predict their names and create a symbolic link before the vi process creates the temporary files. The attacker also needs a target file that is writable by the user of vi.
