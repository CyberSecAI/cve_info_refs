- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The BadBlue web server's `ext.dll` library does not properly handle malformed requests.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - **Path Disclosure:** Sending a request to `ext.dll` without any parameters reveals the server's installation path.
    - **Denial of Service (DoS):** Sending a request with a string of 284 or more characters causes the server to crash.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - **Path Disclosure:** Allows an attacker to gain information about the server's file system, which could be used in further attacks.
    - **DoS:** Causes the server to become unavailable, interrupting service.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending specially crafted HTTP requests to the server through the `ext.dll` file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server. No special privileges are required.
