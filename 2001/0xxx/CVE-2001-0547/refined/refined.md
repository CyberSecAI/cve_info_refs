- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A memory leak in the Winsock Proxy Service of ISA Server 2000. The service doesn't correctly deallocate memory, leading to a gradual depletion of available memory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Memory leak vulnerability within the Winsock Proxy Service
- **Impact of exploitation:** Denial of service. Repeated exploitation degrades the performance of the server, potentially disrupting communications across the server.
- **Attack vectors:** Internal network users can exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed data to the Winsock Proxy Service.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be an internal user within the network. An attacker from the Internet cannot exploit this particular vulnerability.
