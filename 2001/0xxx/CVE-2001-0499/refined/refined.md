Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2001-0499:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the Oracle 8i TNS Listener.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Buffer overflow:  The vulnerability is caused by a section of code executed before authentication in the TNS listener. This allows an attacker to overwrite memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the process running the TNS listener.
- Control of database services: On both Unix and Windows, the attacker can gain control of the database services.
- Administrative control (Windows): On Windows systems, the attacker can gain administrative control of the operating system.
- System compromise: Allows for complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based: The vulnerability is reachable via network connections to the TNS listener on port 1521.
- Unauthenticated: The vulnerability is exploitable without requiring a username or password as it occurs before authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access: The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the vulnerable server.
- Knowledge of vulnerability: The attacker needs to know how to exploit the buffer overflow.

**Additional Notes:**
- Patches are available from Oracle via their Metalink support site under bug number 1489683.
- A temporary mitigation is suggested to block access to port 1521 using a firewall until patching can be completed.
- The vulnerability was discovered by COVERT Labs at PGP Security.
