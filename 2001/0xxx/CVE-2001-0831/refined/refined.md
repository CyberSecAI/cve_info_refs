The provided content describes three separate vulnerabilities in Oracle database server. Only vulnerability #2 and #3 are potentially relevant to CVE-2001-0831. The provided information does not explicitly state which of the two vulnerabilities were assigned to CVE-2001-0831. However, according to other sources, CVE-2001-0831 refers to the Oracle File Overwrite Security Vulnerability which is described as vulnerability #2 in this document. Therefore, content related to vulnerability #3 is removed.

**Vulnerability #2 - Oracle File Overwrite Security Vulnerability (CVE-2001-0831):**

*   **Root cause:** The vulnerability stems from the SETUID bit being set on the "oracle" executable file, which allows users to run the program with the privileges of the file owner.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** The SETUID bit on the "oracle" executable file can be exploited, potentially allowing malicious users to overwrite system files or execute arbitrary commands with elevated privileges.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized file overwrites, privilege escalation, and potentially complete system compromise.
*   **Attack vectors:** Attackers could exploit the vulnerability by manipulating the "oracle" executable or its environment to overwrite files or execute commands.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have access to the server and the ability to run the vulnerable "oracle" executable, indicating they need to be a user on the system.
