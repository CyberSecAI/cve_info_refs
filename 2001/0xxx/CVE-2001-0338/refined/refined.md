- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A flaw in Internet Explorer's handling of digital certificates when CRL (Certificate Revocation List) checking is enabled for web server certificates. When this type of CRL checking is enabled, certain other certificate checks may not be performed.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Failure to perform complete certificate validation: Specifically, when CRL checking for server certificates is enabled, the following checks might be skipped:
        - Verification that the certificate has not expired.
        - Verification that the server name matches the name on the certificate.
        - Verification that the issuer of the certificate is trusted.
    - Web page spoofing: A vulnerability that allows a web page to display the URL of a different website in the Internet Explorer address bar, even within a valid SSL session.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Spoofing of trusted web sites: An attacker could make their web site appear as a trusted site, potentially tricking users into providing sensitive information.
    - URL Spoofing: An attacker can make a page appear to be from a different website, even within an SSL session.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - The certificate validation vulnerability would require the user to have CRL checking enabled for server certificates. The attacker would also need to redirect the user to their site through techniques like DNS poisoning.
    - The web page spoofing vulnerability requires the attacker to have the user visit their website, where they can then spoof a different URL. Techniques like DNS poisoning might be necessary to redirect users.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - For the certificate validation vulnerability, the attacker would need to:
        - Cause users to arrive at their site instead of the intended site using techniques such as DNS poisoning.
        - Have a certificate that could pass the checks that are still performed, likely by using a self-signed certificate or obtaining one with a different name.
    - For the web page spoofing vulnerability, the attacker would need to:
        - Lure the user to their site.
        - Manipulate the page to display the URL of the spoofed site.
        - Potentially, establish an SSL session with the spoofed site for a more convincing display.
    - Both vulnerabilities would likely require DNS poisoning or similar techniques to direct users to the attacker's site initially.
