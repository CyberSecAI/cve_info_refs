Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A buffer overflow occurs in iPlanet Web Servers (Enterprise and FastTrack Editions) when processing "302 Moved Temporarily" redirection errors.
- The vulnerability lies in how the `Location:` header of the 302 response is constructed, specifically how the `Host:` header from the request is used in the construction of the `Location:` header.
- By manipulating the length of the `Host:` header and URL encoding, an attacker can cause the `Location:` header to include data from adjacent memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Buffer Overflow:  The primary vulnerability is a buffer overflow. The lack of proper bounds checking when composing the `Location:` header allows an attacker to write past the allocated buffer.
- Information Disclosure: Due to the overflow, sensitive information can be leaked from server memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Sensitive Information Disclosure: Attackers can read memory contents, potentially exposing user IDs, passwords, cookies, and other authentication data of other users of the web server.
- Unauthorized Access: With the stolen credentials, attackers might be able to falsely authenticate as other users.
- Denial of Service: In some instances, this vulnerability could be used to cause the web server to crash or become unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based: The attack is carried out over the network.
- HTTP Requests:  Attackers craft malicious HTTP requests. Specifically, they can trigger the vulnerability by requesting a URL of a directory without a trailing slash. This will result in a `302 Moved Temporarily` response, and the crafted `Host:` header will trigger the overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Remote Access: Attackers can be located anywhere with network access to the vulnerable web server.
- HTTP Request Manipulation: The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the `Host:` header within their HTTP requests.

The provided document offers more detail than what would typically be found in a standard CVE description, including the specific way to trigger the vulnerability (requesting a directory without a trailing slash) and the exact mechanism of the overflow (manipulating the `Host:` header).
