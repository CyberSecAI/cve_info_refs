The content includes details of three specific vulnerabilities addressed by the patch. Only one of these vulnerabilities is associated with CVE-2001-0874

Here's the breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2001-0874:

**Vulnerability Name:** Frame Domain Verification Variant
**Root Cause:** A flaw in the way Internet Explorer handles frame domain verification, specifically a variant of the vulnerability discussed in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS01-015.
**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**  The vulnerability allows a malicious website to open two browser windows - one within the attacker's domain and the other on the user's local file system - and pass information from the local file system window to the attacker's domain window.
**Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker could read the contents of local files that can be opened in a browser window (e.g., HTML, image, and text files) on a victim's computer.
**Attack Vectors:**
    * A malicious website operator needs to host a web page designed to exploit this vulnerability.
    * The victim must visit the malicious website with a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer.
    * The vulnerability relies on the usage of frames and cross-domain communication to access local files.
**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    * The attacker needs to be able to host a web page.
    * The attacker needs to have a way to entice the victim to visit the malicious website.
    * The attacker needs to know the exact file name and location on the user's system.

**Additional Details:**
   * This vulnerability affects both Internet Explorer 5.5 and 6.0.
   * The vulnerability can only be used to view files, not to modify, delete, or execute them.
   * Only files that can be opened in a browser window are susceptible.
   * Active Scripting must be enabled for the exploit to work.
   * This is described as a variant of an existing "Frame Domain Verification" vulnerability.
