- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Alchemy Eye and Alchemy Network Monitor software includes a built-in HTTP server enabled by default in vulnerable versions, which does not require authentication.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unauthenticated access to the HTTP server, leading to exposure of network monitoring logs. Additionally, if HTTP authentication is enabled, credentials are stored in cleartext in the `eye.ini` configuration file.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthorized remote users can view network monitoring logs, which may contain sensitive information like internal IP addresses and other network details.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote access via HTTP to the web server integrated with the application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server. No authentication is required by default to exploit the vulnerability.
