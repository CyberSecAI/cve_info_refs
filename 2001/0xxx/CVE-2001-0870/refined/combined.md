Rapid 7 Advisory R7-0002: Alchemy Eye Remote Unauthenticated Log Viewing

    Published:  November 30, 2001
    Revision:   1.0
    CVE ID:     CAN-2001-0870
    Bugtraq ID: 3598

1. Affected system(s):

    KNOWN VULNERABLE:
     o Alchemy Eye and Alchemy Network Monitor v1.9x through v2.6.18

    Apparently NOT VULNERABLE:
     o Alchemy Eye v2.6.19 and greater (web access disabled by default)
     o Alchemy Eye v1.7 (has no web access feature)
     o Alchemy Eye v1.8 (has no web access feature)

2. Summary

    Alchemy Eye and Alchemy Network Monitor are network management
    tools for Microsoft Windows.  The product contains a built-in HTTP
    server for remote monitoring and control.  This HTTP server is
    enabled by default in vulnerable versions of the software,
    requiring no authentication.

    The HTTP feature allows remote users to view the network monitoring
    logs. These logs can contain internal IP addresses and other
    information about your network (depending on what monitoring you've
    set up).

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned
    the identifier CAN-2001-0870 to this issue. This is a candidate for
    inclusion in the CVE list (<http://cve.mitre.org>), which standardizes
    names for security problems.

    Bugtraq has assigned the identifier 3598 to this vulnerability.
    More information on Bugtraq can be found at
    <http://www.securityfocus.com> .

3. Vendor status and information

    Alchemy Eye
    Alchemy Labs, Inc.
    <http://www.alchemy-lab.com/products/eye/>

    Alchemy Network Monitor
    DEK Software, Inc.
    <http://www.deksoftware.com/alchemy/>

    Vendors notified 7/25/2001.  HTTP is disabled by default
    starting with version 2.6.19, released in early August 2001.

4. Solution

    If you are using any of the vulnerable versions, we suggest the
    following:

       (a) Disable HTTP access completely via Preferences.  You must
       restart the product for this to take effect.

       or, (b) Require HTTP authentication via Preferences.  You must
       restart the product for this to take effect.  This is only possible
       with versions 2.6.x and later (earlier versions have no
       authentication option).

       (c) Lock down the ACLs of the directory where you installed
       the product. The username and password for HTTP authentication
       are stored in cleartext in the file eye.ini.

5. Detailed analysis

    Vulnerable versions install by default with web access enabled. This
    allows remote users to view the logs. The product stores all its
    settings in a file called eye.ini.

    If you choose to enable HTTP and require authentication, the eye.ini
    file will contain the following section:

       [Web settings]
       Port to listen=80
       Allow web access=1
       Login=webuser
       Password=webpass

    Where "webuser" is the username and "webpass" is the cleartext
    password.
