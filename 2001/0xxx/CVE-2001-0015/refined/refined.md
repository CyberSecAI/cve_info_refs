- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Network DDE Agent in Windows 2000 runs under the Local System security context and processes all requests using this context, rather than the user's context.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The Network DDE Agent accepts requests from local processes to start executables associated with trusted shares. The agent starts these executables using the Local System context, allowing an attacker to run arbitrary code with elevated privileges.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can gain complete control of the local machine by executing arbitrary code in the Local System security context. This allows them to perform any action on the system, such as adding themselves to the local administrators group, installing new operating system components, or reformatting the hard drive.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker needs to be able to run a program on the affected machine, which sends a specially crafted request to the Network DDE Agent, specifying an executable of their choice to run.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have the ability to execute code on the target machine. This could be through another vulnerability or through a user who has the ability to execute code.
