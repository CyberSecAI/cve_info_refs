- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Microsoft Data Access Component Internet Publishing Provider does not properly differentiate between requests made by a user and those made by a script running in the user's browser. It handles all requests in the security context of the user due to an implementation flaw.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper enforcement of domain restrictions, specifically regarding WebDAV requests made by scripts. The provider fails to regulate the actions of scripts, executing them as if the user had requested them directly.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A web-based script could leverage WebDAV requests on the user's behalf, potentially accessing intranet resources, web-based email, and any data the user has privileges to read, change, or add. The specific impact depends on the user's privileges and the resources available to them.
- **Attack vectors**: A user could be enticed to visit a malicious web page or open an HTML email containing a script that exploits the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to possess significant inside information about the target network, including server names, folder structures, and potentially user-specific information. It is likely that this vulnerability would be most easily exploited by an insider. The vulnerability cannot be exploited against stand-alone machines. It also requires that Active Scripting is enabled in the security zone the script is running in.
