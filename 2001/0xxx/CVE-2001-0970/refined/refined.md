Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied data within the TDForum 1.2 message board software. Specifically, the software fails to filter HTML scripting tags from user input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is the susceptibility to XSS attacks. By not filtering HTML tags, malicious users can embed arbitrary scripts within forum posts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Malicious Script Execution:** When other users view forum posts containing malicious scripts, these scripts will be executed in the context of the user's browser.
*   **Potential for Harm:** The embedded scripts can perform various malicious actions, including but not limited to:
    *   Stealing session cookies
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites
    *   Modifying the content of the viewed page
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the victim
    *   Potentially compromising the user's system

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Forum Posts:** Attackers can inject malicious HTML script tags within the body of messages posted on the TDForum.
*   **Client-Side:** The vulnerability is client-side, as the malicious scripts are executed within the victim's web browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Forum Access:** Attackers must have the ability to post messages in the TDForum.
*   **Knowledge of HTML/JavaScript:** Attackers need to craft HTML and JavaScript code to execute their malicious intent.

**Additional Notes:**

* The provided text mentions the existence of a "LIVE messageboard demo" which removes HTML tags, indicating that the demo version does not have this security vulnerability.
* The vendor was notified of the vulnerability but did not issue a patch and instead threatened legal action against the reporter.
* The CERT/CC is not aware of a practical solution to this problem.
* The vulnerability was publicly disclosed on 2001-08-21.
