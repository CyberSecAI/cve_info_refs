The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities related to insecure temporary file creation across various software packages. The advisory, identified as IMNX-2000-70-028-01, highlights that numerous programs were using insecure methods for temporary file generation, specifically citing the use of `mktemp()`, `tempname()`, and similar functions flagged by glibc warnings.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the use of insecure functions for creating temporary files. These functions, like `mktemp()` and `tempname()`, do not guarantee unique file names, leading to potential race conditions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Temp file race conditions:** Multiple processes might attempt to create files with the same name, leading to unexpected overwrites or other issues.
- **Insecure temp file creation:** The identified functions do not create files in a secure manner, opening doors for exploitation through symlink attacks or similar techniques.
- **Lack of a private temp directory:** Some programs didn't use a private temporary directory, potentially leading to clashes or security issues.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information disclosure:**  An attacker could potentially overwrite or access temporary files created by other users or processes.
- **Denial of service:** By exploiting the race condition, an attacker might be able to prevent the intended program from functioning correctly.
- **Privilege escalation:** In some scenarios, an attacker could potentially use a temp file race to overwrite important configuration files or other data, potentially gaining elevated privileges.
- **Arbitrary file overwrite/creation**: An attacker could potentially create or overwrite files if they can win the race condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker needs to be able to trigger the vulnerable program's code path that creates temporary files insecurely.
- The attacker needs to be in a position to win the race condition and create their own file before the legitimate application can.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have a local user account.
- The attacker may need to have knowledge of the timing of the temporary file creation in order to successfully execute a race condition.

**Affected Packages:**

The advisory lists the following packages as being affected:

- apache (htpasswd, htdigest)
- arpwatch (part of tcpdump)
- squid
- linuxconf (vpop3d)
- mgetty
- gpm
- wu-ftpd (privatepw)
- inn
- diffutils (sdiff)
- getty_ps
- rdist
- shadow-utils (useradd)

**Additional details from the advisory:**

The advisory notes that Immunix Linux 7.0 and RedHat 7.0 are affected, as well as potentially other Linux distributions. It also mentions that patches were developed and released to address these problems and that maintainers were responsive. The fixes include using secure methods for temporary file creation and in the case of the "inn" package using a private temporary directory to reduce the risk of temp file race conditions.
