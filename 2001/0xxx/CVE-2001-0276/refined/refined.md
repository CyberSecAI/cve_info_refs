- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `ext.dll` library in the BadBlue web server does not properly handle malformed requests, specifically when the data following `ext.dll?` is either omitted or is a string of 284 bytes or more.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - **Information Disclosure:** Omitting the data following `ext.dll?` reveals the server's installation path.
    - **Denial of Service (DoS):** Providing a string of 284 bytes or more after `ext.dll?` causes the server to crash.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can gain knowledge of the server's file system structure, potentially aiding further attacks.
    - **Denial of Service:** An attacker can cause the web server to become unavailable, disrupting service.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending specially crafted HTTP requests to the BadBlue web server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No specific access or authentication is required.
