- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A malformed request sent to the RPC endpoint mapper service in Windows NT 4.0 causes the service to fail.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The RPC endpoint mapper in Windows NT 4.0 is vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack due to its failure to properly handle certain types of malformed data in requests.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation results in the failure of the RPC service, leading to the loss of all RPC-based services on the affected server, as well as potential loss of some COM functions. Services like Exchange and SQL Server would be made unavailable. The server needs to be rebooted to restore normal services.
- **Attack vectors:**  The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specifically crafted, malformed request to port 135, the port on which the RPC endpoint mapper operates.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send data to port 135 of the target machine. Internal attackers would be more likely to be able to exploit this vulnerability due to firewall configurations often blocking external access to this port.
