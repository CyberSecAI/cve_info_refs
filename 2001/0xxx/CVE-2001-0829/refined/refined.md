Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities addressed in the mentioned Tomcat versions, specifically focusing on CVE-2001-0829:

**Verification:**

The provided content mentions a security vulnerability in Tomcat 3.2.3 related to non-normalized URIs. This matches the description of CVE-2001-0829, which is about the ability to bypass security constraints using non-normalized URIs in Apache Tomcat.

**Vulnerability Analysis:**

*   **Root Cause:** The root cause is the improper handling of non-normalized URIs in Tomcat 3.2.3. Specifically, the web server did not properly canonicalize (normalize) the URI before checking it against security constraints defined in `web.xml`.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **URI Normalization Bypass:** Tomcat 3.2.3 failed to normalize URIs containing sequences like `//`, `../`, and `.` before applying security constraints defined in `web.xml`.
    *   **Security Constraint Bypass:** This flaw allowed attackers to bypass configured security restrictions by manipulating URIs. For example, accessing `/examples/jsp/security//protected/index.jsp` or `/examples/jsp/../jsp/security/protected/index.jsp` would grant access despite the defined constraints.
    *   **URL Encoding Issue:** The vulnerability was also related to URL encoding. The server did not handle URL encoding properly and allowed for bypassing the normalization process by encoding special characters like  `%25`, `%2E`, `%2F`, or `%5c` within the URL.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to:
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Gaining access to resources that are meant to be protected by authentication and authorization rules.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Accessing sensitive information stored in protected areas of web applications.
*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Manipulated URIs:** Attackers could craft malicious URLs containing sequences like `//` or `../` to bypass the intended security constraints.
    *   **URL Encoded Characters:** Attackers could use URL encodings of special characters to circumvent the normalization process, thereby accessing restricted areas.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Tomcat server.
    *   The attacker needs to have knowledge of the application's directory structure and web.xml security configurations to craft malicious URIs.

**Fix:**
The vulnerability was fixed in Tomcat 3.2.3 by implementing proper URI normalization and forbidding URL encoded special characters in request URIs.

**Additional Information:**
*   Tomcat 3.2.3 now normalizes URIs before use by the container.
*   Servlets receive the normalized path through `HttpServletRequest.getRequestURI()`.
*   The behavior of URI normalization is intended to be aligned with the Servlet 2.3 specification.
*  URL encodings for special characters are now forbidden in request URIs.

**Summary:**

The provided content confirms the vulnerability described in CVE-2001-0829. It highlights the improper handling of non-normalized URIs in Tomcat 3.2.3, leading to security constraint bypasses and potential information disclosure. The vulnerability was addressed by implementing proper URI normalization and blocking URL-encoded special characters.
