- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The "MTS Package Administration" registry key, located at `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Transaction Server\Packages`, has overly permissive default permissions, allowing non-administrative users to modify its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Inappropriate default permissions on the "MTS Package Administration" registry key. This key controls which users can install and change MTS packages.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious user could add themselves as an MTS manager, gaining the ability to add, delete, or change MTS packages. This could allow them to modify business logic on a server by replacing existing MTS packages with malicious ones.
- **Attack vectors**:
    -  **Local/Interactive Access:** An attacker with interactive access to the affected machine can modify the registry key directly.
    - **Potential Remote Access:** In some cases, remote registry access might be possible, depending on the configuration of the Winreg key. However, even with remote registry modification, the attacker would still need local access to use MTS Explorer to manage MTS packages.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    -  **Local/Interactive Access:** The attacker needs the ability to log onto the target machine interactively to exploit their new privileges.
    -  **Potential Remote Access:** If remote registry modification is possible, the attacker would still require a way to log onto the machine to use MTS Explorer.
    -  The attacker does not need administrative privileges prior to the exploit.
