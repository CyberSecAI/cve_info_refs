Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the Lotus Domino web server's failure to properly decode URL requests before applying redirection rules for the default navigator (`$defaultNav`). The server attempts to prevent access to the default navigator by redirecting requests with patterns like `*/$defaultNav*`. However, this pattern matching is easily bypassed by two methods:

1.  **Using the database's ReplicaID:** When a request uses the database's ReplicaID instead of the standard path, the pattern matching fails, and the redirection does not occur, allowing access to the default navigator.
2.  **URL Encoding Characters:** URL encoding the characters in the path, such as changing `/` to `%2F` or `$` to `%24`, also breaks the pattern matching, allowing access to the default navigator.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate URL Handling:** The primary weakness is the server's inability to normalize or decode URLs before applying security checks. This allows attackers to use various encoding techniques to bypass redirection rules.
*   **Reliance on Security through Obscurity:** The workaround of using URL redirection to prevent access to the default navigator is a form of security through obscurity, which is inherently weak. The advisory strongly advises against relying on this method and promotes the use of proper access control lists.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** If successful, an attacker can gain access to the default navigator, which exposes a list of visible views to the user. While the default navigator itself may not contain sensitive data, it could potentially reveal database structure and available views, which might then be used for further attacks.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** Although not explicitly stated, an attacker gaining this information could use it to formulate further attacks such as attempting to gain access to certain views.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Requests:** The attack vector is through crafted HTTP requests to the Lotus Domino web server.
*   **Manipulated URLs:** The vulnerability is exploited by manipulating the URLs used in the HTTP requests, using either the database's ReplicaID or URL encoded characters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Lotus Domino server.
*   **Basic URL Knowledge:** The attacker needs basic understanding of how to construct URLs including using a database's ReplicaID and URL encoding.
*   **No Authentication:** The attacker does not require any special privileges, login or authentication to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   The advisory details a method to mitigate this vulnerability which suggests that URL redirects should be in place to handle encoded versions of the default navigator URL.
*   The advisory highlights the importance of access control lists rather than relying on obscurity-based methods.
*   The advisory notes that double URL encoding and UTF-8 encoding were not successful in bypassing the protection, however, more testing may be required.
