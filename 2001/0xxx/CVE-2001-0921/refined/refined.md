- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Netscape browser for MacOS fails to properly mask or handle password input fields when printing a web page, revealing the typed password in clear text.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cleartext storage/display of sensitive data. Password data is exposed in printed output.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthorized disclosure of passwords entered by the user when printing a page.
- **Attack vectors:** A user visits a website, enters a password in a password field and then prints the web page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No attacker required. The vulnerability exists in the browser itself and can be triggered by the user.
