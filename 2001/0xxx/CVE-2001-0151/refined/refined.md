- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A flaw exists in the way WebDAV handles a particular type of malformed request, leading to excessive CPU consumption.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper handling of malformed WebDAV requests.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Denial of service (DoS), where the server becomes unable to provide web services due to CPU exhaustion.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a continuous stream of specifically malformed WebDAV requests to the affected server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Ability to deliver malformed WebDAV requests to the server; no authentication is required.
