- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Mac OS X and Mac IE 5.1 handle downloaded BinHex and MacBinary files. These file types, used for compressing data, can lead to automatic execution of downloaded applications once the download is complete.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary vulnerability is the automatic execution of downloaded applications within BinHex or MacBinary files.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could entice a user to download a malicious program packaged as a BinHex or MacBinary file. Once downloaded, this program would execute automatically, allowing the attacker to run arbitrary code on the victim's machine.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker would need to host a malicious executable file on a website, packaged as either a BinHex or MacBinary file. The attacker would then need to convince a user to visit the site and download the file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to host files on a website and needs to persuade a user to download the malicious file. The user's system must have automatic decoding of BinHex and MacBinary files enabled (though this is not a default setting).
