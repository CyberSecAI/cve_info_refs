- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A flaw in one particular SQL query method allows it to reuse cached connections that belonged to the 'sa' (system administrator) account.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper handling of cached connections in SQL Server when using Mixed Mode authentication. This allows a user's query to potentially execute under the security context of a previously established administrator connection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could gain complete administrative control of the database server, including the ability to execute arbitrary code through extended stored procedures. This would allow the attacker to modify data, take control of the server, and potentially cause significant damage.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited through a specific SQL query method if the server is configured in Mixed Mode and an administrator's connection is cached.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the SQL Server instance and needs to time the attack to coincide with an administrator's cached connection being available. The attacker also needs to know how to use the specific vulnerable query method.
