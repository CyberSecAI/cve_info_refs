- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Hypermail does not sanitize filenames in email attachments, allowing an attacker to create arbitrary files with arbitrary extensions on the server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Unsanitized filename handling from email attachments.
    - Creation of arbitrary files, leading to potential remote command execution through SSI.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Remote code execution: If the server supports SSI, an attacker can inject SSI commands within a file and cause the server to execute them when the file is accessed.
    - Arbitrary file creation: The ability to create files can lead to further vulnerabilities, even on servers that do not support SSI, although these aren't detailed.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Sending an email with a specially crafted attachment containing a malicious filename and SSI commands.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Ability to send emails to a mailing list that is archived with Hypermail.
    - The server must have Hypermail installed and configured to archive email attachments.
    - If remote code execution is the goal, the server must support SSI, and the attachment must have an appropriate extension (e.g. .shtml).
