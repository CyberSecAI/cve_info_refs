Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from improper handling of URL paths containing ".jsp" in the Resin web server. Specifically, inserting ".jsp" before "/WEB-INF/" bypasses the intended access controls, leading to the disclosure of files within the restricted WEB-INF directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Path Traversal/Bypass:** The core weakness is a path traversal vulnerability allowing access to restricted directories by manipulating the URL with ".jsp".
- **Inadequate Access Controls:** The server fails to enforce proper access restrictions when ".jsp" is introduced into the path, particularly around the `/WEB-INF/` directory.
- **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability leads to the disclosure of potentially sensitive Javabean files, such as `Env.java`, which might contain configuration information or other sensitive data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Leakage:** Attackers can access and view the content of Javabean files located in the WEB-INF directory, potentially exposing sensitive data.
- **Potential for Further Attacks:** Information obtained through this vulnerability could be used to launch more targeted attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Network Access:** The attack is performed remotely via HTTP requests to the vulnerable Resin server.
- **URL Manipulation:** Attackers exploit the vulnerability by crafting a specific URL that includes ".jsp" before the "/WEB-INF/" directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable Resin installation.
- **Knowledge of File Locations:** The attacker needs to know (or be able to guess) the location of the files they intend to access, such as the directory structure under `/WEB-INF/classes`.

**Additional Notes:**
- The advisory states this vulnerability was found in Resin versions 1.2.* and 1.3b1 on Windows NT/2000, but may affect other operating systems as well.
- The provided exploit example demonstrates accessing `Env.java`, indicating this file is commonly found and could potentially contain sensitive information.
- The advisory suggests that modifying `resin.conf` may be a potential workaround, although it does not provide specifics.
