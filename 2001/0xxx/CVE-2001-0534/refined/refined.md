This document provides details about vulnerabilities in multiple RADIUS implementations, which aligns with the general scope of CVE-2001-0534.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerabilities stem from inadequate input validation in various RADIUS 'radiusd' daemon implementations. Specifically, the use of functions like `strcpy()` and `sprintf()` without proper bounds checking leads to buffer overflows. Additionally, format string vulnerabilities exist.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Buffer overflows due to the use of `strcpy()` without size limits when handling user\_realm, id, and name input variables.
- Format string vulnerabilities, likely due to the use of `sprintf()` and similar functions.
- Lack of proper input validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers can disrupt RADIUS services, leading to denial of service.
- Attackers can execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the RADIUS user, often administrator level.
- Successful exploitation may allow unauthorized network access by circumventing authentication.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attacks by sending crafted RADIUS packets to vulnerable daemons.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send RADIUS packets to a vulnerable server.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft packets that trigger buffer overflows or format string vulnerabilities.

**Additional Notes:**
- The document mentions specific vulnerable versions including Merit 3.6b, Lucent 2.1-2, and derivatives.
- Patches are available for the affected implementations from the vendors.
- The vulnerabilities were discovered by CERT/CC, Interlink Networks, and Simon Horms.
- The advisory references CVE-2001-0534 and related SecurityFocus BIDs.
- The vulnerability is a result of code inherited from Livingston Enterprises.
- The document mentions a severity metric of 20.11.
