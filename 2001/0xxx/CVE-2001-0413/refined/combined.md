BinTec X4000 locks up after nmap -sS portscan

The BinTec X4000 is a mid-sized multi-purpose, multi-protocol router
meant to fit the needs of small to medium companies. Unfortunately, it
has a bit of a problem.

A simple nmap SYN scan (nmap -sS) will cause
the machine to lock up completely. It can neither be accessed through
LAN nor through a serial connection or the built in, LCD-display-based
MMI (man-machine-interface). The only way of getting it back to life is
to pull the plug and put it back in.

I have contacted BinTec on the 12th of March, informing them of the
problem. One day later I received an answer in which they told me they
were going to try and verify the phenomenon with a test setup. Despite
offering them further information and assistance, I was yet to hear
anything from them.

After a subsequent ultra-necessary 14-day-holiday, I originally
expected the arrival of a message containig results. There was nothing,
niente, nada.

So I phoned them up again, just to hear they've verified the problem
and handed it to their development staff. Asking why they didn't tell
me about this fact they replied the development staff never contacts
the customers directly. Also, in these cases the support staff contacts
the distribution partners and they contact their very own customers. So
I phoned my dealer and he phoned hist distributor, none of which was
informed, despite having submitted own requests for info after I told
them of the vulnerability.

I have not heard anything from them ever since. I consider the fact
that they have a problem with their products which even they decribe as
'escalating' and were not able to clarify it within more than 20 days
somewhat disturbing. What bothers me even more is the kind of
information policy. I thought we were behind the
security-through-obscurity phase.

As far as I know, every firmware version has the vulnerability, though
I've only verified this with 5.1.6 Patch 10 of the bootimage and
logicware 1.05. I've used nmap 2.53.

Ah, and before I forget it: BinTec has introduced a 4-week-money-back
warranty for the X4000 from April 1st onwards. Hardly a coincidence.

Bye, Jan

Kai,

sorry for the less information if've given in the last post. here is the
detailed info.
if've proofed these exploits on two different BIOS Versions again some
minutes ago.

These BIOS are available for download at [www.bintec.de](http://www.bintec.de) for the Bintec X1200
Router.

First Version V5.1 Rev 6

nmap <ip> -sU -p '53-53'

This affects that the Router is booting.

It seems that the Router is vulnerable for a normal Port 53 UDP scan.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Second Version V5.3 Rev 1

nmap <ip>

Halts the System and Power off is nessessary.

Here is the Output :
----------------------

System affected:
---------------
BinTec X4000 Router

All firmware versions [as far as I know, only verified with latest
release 5.1.6 Patch 10]

Machines with activated additional VPN software license are *NOT*
affected, neither are machines which filter 1723/tcp.

Description:
-----------

As mentioned before, under the given circumstances the X4000 will lock
up after sending a SYN portscan to it. Further examination of the
phenomenon at BinTec has shown that sending a SYN flagged TCP packet to
port 1723 (pptp) will cause the machine to behave in the described way.

The pptp daemon should be activated only when the software license key
is entered and it can process incoming packets adequately.
However, it isnt. When the 'dormant' pptpd receives a SYN packet and
cannot process it, the daemon claims 100% CPU usage and the machine
locks up. This, of course, happens when a SYN portscan against the
machine is issued and port 1723 gets hit - you can also easily check it
with 'telnet my.machines.ip 1723' or your favourite packet injector.

Solution:
--------

There are two solutions: One of them is less pricey than the other ;o))
If you wanted to buy the VPN software anyway, just go ahead and enter
the key.

If not, you should include a rule which drops 1723/tcp directed at all
interfaces of your router (as you should do anyway if you don't use
it).

Vendor response:
---------------

Some might remember a little bitter notion with my first mailing.
However, the day after I posted to Bugtraq the development director
contacted me. He was very eager to help and asked for my config file
and a stack trace, which I send them as quick as possible. He reassured
me that the problem was taken seriously, but mentioned that they could
not reproduce the phenomenon, so they would take a look at my config and
see what might have caused it. All this was yesterday.

Today, the leading developer (I assume) for the X4000's firmware called
me and was able to present the above solution. He had tried to
reproduce the DoS on a machine with VPN license first and only after a
long night got the idea that the pptp daemon might be the culprit (I
_did_ pity him).

Comment:
-------

I hope you don't mind a personal comment. The sheer fact that I did not
get any response after first informing support staff of the issue
really upset me quite a bit. I really expected some reaction within
less than almost three weeks. Going public changed the response level
pretty quickly ;o) To be fair I have to state that all the staff I
talked to during the last few days were seeming absolutely competent
and very eager to help. Everyone involved stressed how sorry they were
about the delay and how unusual this was.

From my personal experience I could only say this is probably true,
since we've been using other BinTec products for years and they
generally performed very well, especially compared with products of
another, erm, well-known vendor.

As for my statement about the recently introduced money back warranty,
I could only say that I now do believe this was launched under the
assumption of a totally stable platform. They surely didn't know the
vulnerabilty.

No, I was not bribed to say this ;o))
