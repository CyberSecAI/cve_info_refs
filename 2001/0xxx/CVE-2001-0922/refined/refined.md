- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The NetDynamics session management package does not properly manage its user state table. Specifically, the session ID generated before a user logs in remains valid for a short period (up to 15 seconds) after a legitimate user logs in.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reusable session IDs, inadequate session management.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can hijack a legitimate user's session and execute commands with the victim's privileges.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker must first visit the login page to obtain a session ID. They must then wait for a legitimate user to log in. Finally, they append the captured session ID parameters ('SPIDERSESSION' and 'uniqueValue') to a command request, which allows them to control the session.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to access the login page of the vulnerable NetDynamics application. They also need to understand the application's command mappings to craft the attack URL.
