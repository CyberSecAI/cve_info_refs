- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A buffer overflow exists in several ppp utilities that are linked to `/usr/bin/pppattach`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Buffer overflow vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthorized user could exploit this vulnerability to gain elevated privileges.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is present in the `pppattach` utility, which is accessible to local users. An attacker could exploit this by providing crafted input that overflows a buffer within the application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a local user with the ability to execute `/usr/bin/pppattach`.
