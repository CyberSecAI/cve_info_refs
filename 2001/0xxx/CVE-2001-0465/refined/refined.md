Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to the potential vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** A programming error in TurboTax software caused customer passwords to be inadvertently saved. This occurred when users electronically imported investment tax information from their financial institutions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Password Storage:** Passwords were saved in plain text or an easily recoverable format, either on the user's hard drive or on Intuit's servers. This is a clear violation of secure password handling practices.
    *   For desktop users: Passwords were saved within the tax files on the user's computer hard drive.
    *   For web users: Passwords were temporarily saved on Intuit's servers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Desktop Users:**
    *   An attacker with access to the user's computer could potentially extract the saved financial institution passwords from the TurboTax tax files.
    *   This would grant unauthorized access to the user's investment accounts.
*   **Web Users (before fix):**
    *   An attacker gaining access to Intuit's servers could have potentially extracted the stored passwords.
    *   This could also allow unauthorized access to the affected user's investment accounts.
    *   Web users who downloaded the tax file to their computer were also exposed like the desktop users.
*   **General:** Compromised passwords could lead to unauthorized access to financial accounts, potentially enabling theft, fraud, or other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Desktop Users:**
    *   Local access to the user's computer.
    *   Malware that can steal or access files from the user's hard drive.
*   **Web Users:**
    *   (Before fix) Network/server-based attack targeting Intuit's servers.
    *   Local access to user's computer if a tax file was downloaded.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Desktop Users:**
    *   Physical or remote access to the user's computer.
    *   Basic file system access knowledge.
*   **Web Users:**
    *   (Before fix) Access to Intuit's servers via a network breach.
    *   Local access to user's computer if a tax file was downloaded.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The issue was acknowledged by Intuit, and they took steps to address it, including deleting passwords from their servers and releasing software updates.
*   The impact was limited to users who imported investment data and within specific dates.
*   Intuit claims that no customer tax data was compromised, and the issue only affected the stored passwords.
