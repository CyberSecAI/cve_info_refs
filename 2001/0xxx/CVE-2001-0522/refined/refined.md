  "CVE-2001-0522": {
    "is_related": true,
    "summary": "A format string vulnerability exists in the `do_get()` function within `ttyio.c` of GNU Privacy Guard (GPG). When GPG encounters a filename with an unknown suffix, and it's not in batch mode, it prompts the user for a new filename, including the existing filename in the prompt. If this filename contains format string specifiers, an attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code as the user decrypting the message.",
    "details": [
      {
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the use of a user-supplied string (filename from an encrypted message) directly within a `tty_printf()` call in the `do_get()` function of `ttyio.c`. This allows an attacker to inject format string specifiers.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Format String Vulnerability"
        ],
        "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary code as the user decrypting the GPG message.",
        "attack_vectors": [
          "A malicious GPG message is crafted with an embedded filename containing format string characters. When the recipient attempts to decrypt the message, the vulnerable code is triggered."
        ],
        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a malicious GPG message with the crafted filename. No special privileges are required."
      }
    ],
    "affected_versions": "GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) versions prior to 1.0.6 are vulnerable.",
    "fixed_versions": "GNU Privacy Guard version 1.0.6 corrects this issue.",
     "additional_notes": "Decrypting files in batch mode by specifying `--batch` on the command line will bypass the vulnerable code. The filename is embedded in the encrypted message, making safe filename selection by the recipient insufficient to prevent this attack."
