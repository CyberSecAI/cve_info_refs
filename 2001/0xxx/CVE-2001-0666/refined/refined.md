- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability exists because Exchange 2000 Outlook Web Access (OWA) does not properly validate the complexity of a user's request for an item in their mailbox, specifically the depth of folder nesting.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is a lack of input validation on the depth of folder nesting in OWA requests.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can cause a denial of service by sending a request with an extremely deep folder structure. This can consume most or all of the CPU resources of the server processing the request, slowing or preventing other users from accessing their mail. The vulnerability would not allow the attacker to add, delete, change, or view other user's mail data.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a crafted HTTP request made through Outlook Web Access. An authenticated user sends a request for an item in a deeply nested folder structure, which the server processes without proper validation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be an authenticated user with access to at least one mailbox on the affected server.
