The provided content is a Microsoft Security Bulletin (MS01-058) describing a cumulative patch for Internet Explorer (IE) 5.5 and 6.0, addressing multiple vulnerabilities, including CVE-2001-0875.

Here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2001-0875:

**CVE-2001-0875: File Name Spoofing Vulnerability**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: A flaw in the way the File Download dialog box in Internet Explorer displays file names. Specifically, IE stops displaying the file name upon reaching certain special characters.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of special characters in file names within the File Download dialogue box. An attacker can insert these special characters to truncate the displayed file name, potentially misleading users about the true nature of the file.
*   **Impact of exploitation**:
    *   An attacker could cause the File Download dialogue to display a misleading name for a file, potentially tricking users into accepting and downloading unsafe files.
    *   The vulnerability is more critical in the context of HTML emails, where users cannot easily verify the source of the file and might be more susceptible to the misleading file name.
*  **Attack vectors**:
    *   The attacker can exploit this vulnerability via a malicious webpage that initiates a file download.
    *   The attacker can also send a malicious HTML email containing the malicious file. The vulnerability is present in both cases.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    *   The attacker needs to host the malicious file on a server they control.
    *   The attacker must craft a file name with specific special characters to exploit the display issue.
    *   The attacker must be able to either entice a user to view a malicious webpage or send an HTML email containing the exploit.

**Additional notes from the document:**

*   The user must still actively choose to download the file; the vulnerability does not allow for automatic downloads.
*   The user has the option to cancel the download in the File Download dialogue.
*   The displayed file name is only misleading, it doesn't change the actual file name.
*   The vulnerability does not allow the attacker to force the file to run, the default action is to save the file.
*   Trust decisions should be based on the source, not what's displayed in the dialog box, however, this is not true for email where it's easy to spoof the source of the message.
*   This vulnerability affects both IE 5.5 and IE 6.0.
