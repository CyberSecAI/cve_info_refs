- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A divide-by-zero error in the `igmp_input` kernel function when processing IGMP packets with a specific `igmp_code` value.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The kernel doesn't properly validate the `igmp_code` value in received IGMP packets before using it in a calculation that involves division.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker can send a crafted IGMP packet that triggers a kernel panic and causes a denial of service (DoS).
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted IGMP packet to a FreeBSD system that is listening to multicast traffic. This can be done remotely.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the target system. No special access is needed on the target system. The attacker needs to craft a specific IGMP packet with `igmp_type = 0x11` (QUERY) and `igmp_code = 1`.
