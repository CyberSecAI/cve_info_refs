      "vulnerabilityDetails": {
        "rootCause": "The vulnerability lies in how the TCP/IP stack handles ICMP \"fragmentation needed but DF set\" messages when Path MTU Discovery (PMTUD) is enabled. Specifically, the stack uses a hash table to store MTU values for different destinations. An attacker can manipulate this hash table with spoofed ICMP messages.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Improper handling of ICMP \"fragmentation needed but DF set\" messages.",
          "Manipulation of the MTU hash table with spoofed ICMP messages.",
          "Lack of proper validation of ICMP messages used for MTU discovery."
        ],
        "impact": "An attacker can slow down connections between two arbitrary hosts by injecting spoofed ICMP fragmentation messages with a smaller quoted packet total length, causing the victim to lower their MTU, leading to performance degradation.",
        "attackVectors": [
          "Spoofing ICMP echo request packets.",
          "Spoofing ICMP fragmentation needed but DF set packets."
        ],
        "attackerCapabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to spoof IP packets.",
        "moreDetails": "The vulnerability is described with a detailed explanation of how an attacker can inject ICMP messages to alter the MTU stored in the hash table used for Path MTU Discovery. The lookup in the hash table uses the TOS field in the IP header, allowing different MTUs to be stored based on TOS. The attacker can cause a denial of service by repeatedly injecting such packets, thus lowering the MTU and impacting network performance."

      "vulnerabilityDetails": {
        "rootCause": "The vulnerability is due to an issue within the TCP/IP stack, specifically how it handles ICMP \"fragmentation needed but DF set\" messages.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Improper handling of ICMP messages related to Path MTU Discovery.",
          "Vulnerable to spoofed ICMP packets which can modify the MTU."
        ],
        "impact": "The impact of this vulnerability is that a remote attacker can cause a partial denial of service (availability impact), by forcing the target system to reduce its MTU.",
        "attackVectors": [
          "Sending spoofed ICMP packets."
        ],
       "attackerCapabilities": "The attacker needs to have the ability to send spoofed packets over the network.",
        "moreDetails": "The Oracle advisory mentions this CVE in relation to Solaris systems, where a vulnerability in the handling of TCP/IP packets makes systems vulnerable to spoofed ICMP messages. The CVSS v2 score for this vulnerability is 6.4. It states that it can be exploited over the network without any authentication and leads to partial availability impact (partial DOS) . The affected versions listed are Solaris 8, 9 and 10."
