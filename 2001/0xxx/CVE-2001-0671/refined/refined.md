Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2001-0671:

**Vulnerability Overview:**

The core issue is a buffer overflow vulnerability within the Line Printer Daemon (lpd) on IBM AIX systems. Specifically, three different functions are vulnerable: `chk_fhost()`, `kill_print()`, and `send_status()`. This vulnerability could allow a remote attacker to gain root privileges or cause a denial of service (DoS).

**Root Cause:**
- The root cause is a buffer overflow in the `chk_fhost()`, `kill_print()`, and `send_status()` functions of the lpd daemon.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a buffer overflow, which occurs when a program writes data beyond the allocated buffer, potentially overwriting adjacent memory locations. This can lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Root Privileges:** Successful exploitation can grant an attacker root privileges on the vulnerable system, allowing them complete control over the system.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** If root access cannot be obtained, the attacker can still cause a system crash (DoS).

**Attack Vectors:**
- **chk_fhost()**: Requires the attacker to have control of the DNS server.
- **kill_print()**: Requires the attacker's system to be listed in the victim's `/etc/hosts.lpd` or `/etc/hosts.equiv` file.
- **send_status()**: Requires the attacker's system to be listed in the victim's `/etc/hosts.lpd` or `/etc/hosts.equiv` file.
- All attack vectors are remote.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- For `chk_fhost()`: Requires control over the victim's DNS server.
- For `kill_print()` and `send_status()`: Requires the attacker's system to be listed in either `/etc/hosts.lpd` or `/etc/hosts.equiv` on the target system.

**Affected Systems:**
- IBM AIX 4.3 and 5.1 are affected. Versions prior to 4.3 are also likely affected but are no longer supported by IBM.

**Mitigation:**
- IBM has released emergency fixes (efixes) and official patches (APARs) to address these vulnerabilities. The efixes are available for download via FTP. Users are advised to disable lpd until patches can be installed.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was identified by Internet Security Systems (ISS).
- The advisory mentions that the provided fix was not fully regression tested.
- CERT also mentions that the reference to CERT CA-2001-15 may be misleading as it describes a different vulnerability.
- The vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely by malicious users.
- A common fix is to disable the lpd service until patches are installed, and it's generally good practice to disable unused services.
