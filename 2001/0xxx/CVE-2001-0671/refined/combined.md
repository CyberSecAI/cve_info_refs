Fri Sep 7 11:18:24 CDT 2001
===========================================================================
 VULNERABILITY SUMMARY

VULNERABILITY: Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities in lpd

PLATFORMS: IBM AIX 4.3 and 5.1

SOLUTION: Apply the emergency-fixes described below.

THREAT: Malicious user could obtain root privileges, or cause
 a denial of service (DoS).

 CERT Advisory: See CERT CA-2001-15 for info on
 Solaris vulnerability. Also see the posting,
<http://xforce.iss.net/alerts/advise94.php>, at the
 Internet Security Systems site for info on BSD
 implementations of lpd.

CVE Candidate: CAN-2001-0670
 CAN-2001-0671
===========================================================================
 DETAILED INFORMATION

I. Description

 The Line Printer daemon, lpd, shipped with AIX contains several
 buffer overflow vulnerabilities that potentially allow a malicious
 remote user to gain root privileges.

 Two of the three vulnerabilities found require the attacker's system
 be listed in /etc/hosts.lpd or /etc/hosts.equiv. The third requires
 that the malicious user have control over the victim's domain name
 server (DNS).

II. Impact

 A malicious local or remote user can use a well-crafted exploit code
 to gain root privileges on the attacked system, compromising the
 integrity of the system and its attached local network.

 If the malicious user is unable to gain root access, he or she could
 still cause a system crash (DoS) via this vulnerability.

III. Solutions

 A. Official fix

 IBM is working on the following fixes which will be available soon:

 AIX 4.3: APAR #IY23037
 AIX 5.1: APAR #IY23041

 NOTE: Fix will not be provided for versions prior to 4.3 as these
 are no longer supported by IBM. Affected customers are urged to
 upgrade to 4.3.3 at the latest maintenance level, or to 5.1, when it
 becomes available.

 B. How to minimize the vulnerability

 WORKAROUND

 None recommended.

 IBM advises customers to disable the line printer daemon until an
 efix or official APAR is installed.

 In general, customers are advised to disable all unused daemon
 services as good security practice.

 EMERGENCY FIX (efix):

 Temporary fixes for AIX 4.3.x and 5.1 systems are available.

 The temporary fixes can be downloaded via ftp from:

ftp://aix.software.ibm.com/aix/efixes/security/lpd\_efix.tar.Z

 The efix tarball consists of two patched lpd binaries, one for AIX
 4.3.x systems (lpd.43) and one for AIX 5.1 (scheduled for release
 soon; binary is lpd.51). A copy of this Advisory is also included.

 These temporary fixes have not been fully regression tested; thus,
 IBM does not warrant the fully correct functioning of the efix.
 Customers install the efix and operate the modified version of AIX at
 their own risk.

 To proceed with efix installation:

 First, verify the MD5 cryptographic hash sums of each efix files you
 obtain from unpacking the efix tarball with those given below. These
 should match exactly; if they do not, double check the hash results
 and the download site address. If OK, contact IBM AIX Security at
 security-alert@austin.ibm.com and describe the discrepancy.

 Filename sum md5
 =================================================================
 lpd.43X.tar 11225 20 3c7e6f0ef29b6147835213253de8f1bf
 lpd.51B.tar 35507 80 38bc7f7516d76b8a89914fdab97e1377

 Efix Installation Instructions:
 -------------------------------

 1. Become root, if not already done.

 2. In a scratch or tmp directory, uncompress and untar the efix:

 a. uncompress lpd\_efix.tar.Z
 b. tar -xvf lpd\_efix.tar

 3. If you are running an AIX 4.3.x system, copy the lpd.43 file to
 /usr/sbin. Do the same if you have AIX 5.1 running, except copy the
 lpd.51 file.

 4. Stop the lpd daemon if it is currently running:

 a. stopsrc -s lpd

 5. Make a backup copy of the existing lpd binary package in case
 something goes wrong with the installation of the efix:

 a. cp /usr/sbin/lpd /usr/sbin/lpd.original

 6. Now copy the efix binary to take the place of the original lpd:

 a. cp /usr/sbin/lpd.43 (or lpd.51, as appropriate)
 /usr/sbin/lpd.

 7. Check to be certain that the new lpd is executable by root and is
 assigned proper permissions otherwise.

 8. Restart the lpd daemon:

 a. startsrc -s lpd

IV. Obtaining Fixes

 IBM AIX APARs may be ordered using Electronic Fix Distribution (via
 the FixDist program), or from the IBM Support Center. For more
 information on FixDist, and to obtain fixes via the Internet, please

## IBM AIX line printer daemon contains a buffer overflow in send\_status()

#### Vulnerability Note VU#722143

Original Release Date: 2001-10-16 | Last Revised: 2001-11-09

---

### Overview

The Line Printer daemon (lpd) shipped with AIX systems contains a buffer overflow in send\_status() that potentially allow a malicious remote user to gain root privileges.

### Description

| A buffer overflow exists in the send\_status() function of the line printer daemon (lpd) on AIX systems. An intruder could exploit this vulnerability to obtain root privileges or cause a denial of service (DoS). The intruder would need to be listed in the victim's /etc/hosts.lpd or /etc/hosts.equiv file, however, to exploit this vulnerability. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An intruder could exploit this vulnerability to obtain root privileges, or cause a denial of service (DoS). |
| --- |

### Solution

| IBM has released a [VULNERABILITY SUMMARY](http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/bugtraq/2001-09/0084.html). Please see the vendor statement for patches and instructions. |

IBM SECURITY ADVISORY

Fri Sep 7 11:18:24 CDT 2001
===========================================================================
 VULNERABILITY SUMMARY

VULNERABILITY: Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities in lpd

PLATFORMS: IBM AIX 4.3 and 5.1

SOLUTION: Apply the emergency-fixes described below.

THREAT: Malicious user could obtain root privileges, or cause
 a denial of service (DoS).

 CERT Advisory: See CERT CA-2001-15 for info on
 Solaris vulnerability. Also see the posting,
<http://xforce.iss.net/alerts/advise94.php>, at the
 Internet Security Systems site for info on BSD
 implementations of lpd.

CVE Candidate: CAN-2001-0670
 CAN-2001-0671
===========================================================================
 DETAILED INFORMATION

I. Description

 The Line Printer daemon, lpd, shipped with AIX contains several
 buffer overflow vulnerabilities that potentially allow a malicious
 remote user to gain root privileges.

 Two of the three vulnerabilities found require the attacker's system
 be listed in /etc/hosts.lpd or /etc/hosts.equiv. The third requires
 that the malicious user have control over the victim's domain name
 server (DNS).

II. Impact

 A malicious local or remote user can use a well-crafted exploit code
 to gain root privileges on the attacked system, compromising the
 integrity of the system and its attached local network.

 If the malicious user is unable to gain root access, he or she could
 still cause a system crash (DoS) via this vulnerability.

III. Solutions

 A. Official fix

 IBM is working on the following fixes which will be available soon:

 AIX 4.3: APAR #IY23037
 AIX 5.1: APAR #IY23041

 NOTE: Fix will not be provided for versions prior to 4.3 as these
 are no longer supported by IBM. Affected customers are urged to
 upgrade to 4.3.3 at the latest maintenance level, or to 5.1, when it
 becomes available.

 B. How to minimize the vulnerability

 WORKAROUND

 None recommended.

 IBM advises customers to disable the line printer daemon until an
 efix or official APAR is installed.

 In general, customers are advised to disable all unused daemon
 services as good security practice.

 EMERGENCY FIX (efix):

 Temporary fixes for AIX 4.3.x and 5.1 systems are available.

 The temporary fixes can be downloaded via ftp from:

ftp://aix.software.ibm.com/aix/efixes/security/lpd\_efix.tar.Z

 The efix tarball consists of two patched lpd binaries, one for AIX
 4.3.x systems (lpd.43) and one for AIX 5.1 (scheduled for release
 soon; binary is lpd.51). A copy of this Advisory is also included.

 These temporary fixes have not been fully regression tested; thus,
 IBM does not warrant the fully correct functioning of the efix.
 Customers install the efix and operate the modified version of AIX at
 their own risk.

 To proceed with efix installation:

 First, verify the MD5 cryptographic hash sums of each efix files you
 obtain from unpacking the efix tarball with those given below. These
 should match exactly; if they do not, double check the hash results
 and the download site address. If OK, contact IBM AIX Security at
 security-alert@austin.ibm.com and describe the discrepancy.

 Filename sum md5
 =================================================================
 lpd.43X.tar 11225 20 3c7e6f0ef29b6147835213253de8f1bf
 lpd.51B.tar 35507 80 38bc7f7516d76b8a89914fdab97e1377

 Efix Installation Instructions:
 -------------------------------

 1. Become root, if not already done.

 2. In a scratch or tmp directory, uncompress and untar the efix:

 a. uncompress lpd\_efix.tar.Z
 b. tar -xvf lpd\_efix.tar

 3. If you are running an AIX 4.3.x system, copy the lpd.43 file to
 /usr/sbin. Do the same if you have AIX 5.1 running, except copy the
 lpd.51 file.

 4. Stop the lpd daemon if it is currently running:

 a. stopsrc -s lpd

 5. Make a backup copy of the existing lpd binary package in case
 something goes wrong with the installation of the efix:

 a. cp /usr/sbin/lpd /usr/sbin/lpd.original

 6. Now copy the efix binary to take the place of the original lpd:

 a. cp /usr/sbin/lpd.43 (or lpd.51, as appropriate)
 /usr/sbin/lpd.

 7. Check to be certain that the new lpd is executable by root and is
 assigned proper permissions otherwise.

 8. Restart the lpd daemon:

 a. startsrc -s lpd

IV. Obtaining Fixes

 IBM AIX APARs may be ordered using Electronic Fix Distribution (via
 the FixDist program), or from the IBM Support Center. For more
 information on FixDist, and to obtain fixes via the Internet, please
 reference

<http://techsupport.services.ibm.com/rs6k/fixes.html>

 or send email to "aixserv@austin.ibm.com" with the word "FixDist" in
 the "Subject:" line.

 To facilitate ease of ordering all security related APARs for each
 AIX release, security fixes are periodically bundled into a
 cumulative APAR. For more information on these cumulative APARs
 including last update and list of individual fixes, send email to
 "aixserv@austin.ibm.com" with the word "subscribe Security\_APARs" in
 the "Subject:" line.

## History

The CERT Division is the birthplace of cybersecurity. For nearly 30 years, the CERT Division of the SEI has partnered with government, industry, law enforcement, and academia to advance cybersecurity and improve the security and resilience of computer systems and networks.

Originally focused on incident response, we have expanded into cybersecurity areas such as network situational awareness, malicious code analysis, secure coding, resilience management, insider threats, digital investigations and intelligence, workforce development, DevOps, forensics, software assurance, vulnerability discovery and analysis, and risk management.

## Former Director Richard Pethia

[Richard Pethia](/about/leadership/display.cfm?customel_datapageid_2623=3545) was founding director of the SEI's CERT Division. Pethia, who served as director of CERT from 1988 to 2016, guided the organization through tremendous growth and change. Under Pethia's leadership, the unit expanded and evolved from the CERT Coordination Center—a small group focused on computer incident response—to a research organization of more than 200 professionals dedicated to solving problems with widespread cybersecurity implications.
