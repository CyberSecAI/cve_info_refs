Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The 3Com OfficeConnect 812/840 ADSL routers have a vulnerability that allows for a denial-of-service (DoS) attack through specific HTTP requests.
*   The routers' web management interface is accessible on the WAN interface by default, and this interface is vulnerable to specific crafted HTTP requests that trigger a reset of the device (soft or hard reset).
*   The TCP/IP stack of these routers uses fixed-increment Initial Sequence Numbers (ISNs), making connection hijacking/spoofing attacks relatively simple.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of Access Control:** The web management interface (ports 80, 23, and 53) is accessible from the WAN interface by default.
*   **Vulnerable HTTP Endpoint:** The routers are susceptible to DoS attacks using specific HTTP requests to reset the device.
*   **Predictable TCP ISNs:** The routers utilize predictable TCP ISNs, which makes them vulnerable to connection hijacking/spoofing.
*   **Lack of Security Contact:** The vendor did not have a readily available security contact.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can force the router to perform a soft or hard reset, disrupting network connectivity for all users behind the router.
*   **Connection Hijacking/Spoofing:** Due to predictable TCP ISNs, an attacker can potentially hijack and/or spoof TCP connections.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** An attacker sends specifically crafted HTTP GET or POST requests to the router's web interface over port 80 from the WAN.
*   **TCP Spoofing:** An attacker can exploit the predictable TCP ISNs to inject malicious packets into TCP streams.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send packets to the router's WAN interface (typically from the internet).
*   **HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerable HTTP endpoints on the router.
*   **Understanding of TCP:** For connection hijacking, the attacker needs to understand TCP sequence numbers and the TCP protocol.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vendor suggests using port filtering and access lists to mitigate the vulnerability.
*   The provided exploit code demonstrates how to trigger a soft or hard reset.
*   The issue was reported to affect 3com OfficeConnect DSL Router 812 1.1.7 and 3com OfficeConnect DSL Router 840 1.1.7.
