Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2001-0091:

**Vulnerability:** Scriptlet Rendering Vulnerability (new variant)

**Root Cause:**
- The original vulnerability (MS00-055) involved rendering non-HTML file types using an ActiveX control that acts as an HTML rendering engine, allowing malicious script injection into system files.
- This new variant utilizes a different mechanism using an HTML function called an `OBJECT` tag to render non-HTML files, achieving the same outcome as the original vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper handling of non-HTML file types within Internet Explorer.
- Ability to execute script from a non-HTML file in the Local Computer Zone.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A malicious website operator could read files on a visiting user's computer.
- By injecting script into a file with a known name and rendering that file, the attacker can execute the script in the Local Computer Zone.
- This gives the script access to the user's local file system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A malicious website operator can craft a web page that exploits the vulnerability.
- The user needs to visit this malicious webpage with a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer.
- The attacker would misuse the OBJECT tag to render the injected script from a non-HTML file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to host a website or inject content into a website the user is likely to visit.
- The attacker must know the name and location of a file on the user's computer into which to inject script.
- The attacker must know of a file on the user's machine which can be opened in a browser window to render the injected script.

**Additional Information:**
- This variant, alongside the original variant, are addressed by the same patch in MS00-093.
- The patch prevents the `OBJECT` tag from being used to render non-HTML files.
- The vulnerability affects IE versions 5.0 through 5.5.
- The new variant operates in the same way as the original, but with a different mechanism for rendering the file.
