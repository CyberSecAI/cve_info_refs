This document provides information about multiple vulnerabilities addressed in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS01-044, which includes fixes for five newly discovered security vulnerabilities affecting IIS 4.0 and 5.0.  Only one of the listed vulnerabilities has the identifier CAN-2001-0545 and relates to the specified CVE.

**Vulnerability Details (CAN-2001-0545):**

*   **Root Cause:** A denial-of-service vulnerability exists in IIS 4.0's URL redirection functionality. The vulnerability is triggered when a request's actual length differs from the length specified in the request.
*   **Weakness:** The code within IIS 4.0 that handles URL redirection does not properly handle discrepancies between the actual and specified length of the request.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation of the vulnerability leads to a denial of service, causing the IIS 4.0 service to fail and become unresponsive. The service needs to be restarted to restore normal operations.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker sends a specially crafted web request containing an incorrect length specification to an IIS 4.0 web server that has URL redirection enabled.
*  **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the target server. The server needs to have URL redirection enabled.
*   **Mitigation:** The vulnerability only affects IIS 4.0 with URL redirection enabled, and it does not allow the attacker to gain control of the server or compromise data. Restarting the IIS 4.0 service restores normal operation. The patch eliminates the vulnerability by correctly handling URLs with conflicting length information.
