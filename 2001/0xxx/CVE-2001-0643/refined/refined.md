- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Windows Explorer and Internet Explorer do not properly display file extensions when a file has a CLSID (Class Identifier) appended to its name. This allows an attacker to create a file with a deceptive name, making it appear as a harmless file type (e.g., .txt) while actually being an executable file (e.g., .hta).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper file extension handling, CLSID spoofing
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution. A user can be tricked into executing a malicious program when they believe they are opening a harmless file.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Malicious files placed on shared network resources
    - Malicious files sent as attachments via email
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Ability to create files with specific file names and CLSIDs and ability to distribute them to a target system.
