- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by a misconfiguration or bug in how the IBM WebSphere Commerce Suite (WCS) 4.0.1 and Application Server 3.0.2 on Solaris 2.7 handle requests for JSP files. Specifically, appending a "/" to the end of a JSP file request leads to the server returning the raw source code of the JSP instead of processing it.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is an information disclosure issue, as it reveals the server-side source code of JSP files.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can gain access to sensitive information such as database credentials, business logic, and other proprietary information that is typically embedded within JSP files. This could lead to further compromise of the application or the server.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable server. The attacker appends "/" to a JSP filename in the URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and have knowledge or have guessed valid JSP filenames on the target.
