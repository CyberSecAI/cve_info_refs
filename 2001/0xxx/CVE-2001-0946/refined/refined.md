Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The `apmscript` script, executed with superuser privileges, uses `touch /tmp/LOW_POWER` when a low-battery state is detected and `$LOWPOWER_SERVICES` is not empty. This behavior allows for symlink attacks because the `/tmp` directory is world-writable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Symlink vulnerability:** The script creates a file in `/tmp` without sanitizing the path, allowing an attacker to create a symlink to a different file, which would then be touched by the script with root privileges.
- **Insecure file handling:** The script does not create files in a secure, controlled location.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By creating a symlink to a crucial system file (e.g., `/etc/nologin`), an attacker could disable remote logins when the low-battery signal triggers the `touch` command, leading to a service disruption.
- **Potential for other impacts:** While the content of the touched file is not directly modified, the symlink could cause other impacts depending on which system file is targeted.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Attack:** An attacker with local access to the system can create the malicious symlink in `/tmp`.
- **Triggered by APM Event:** The attack is triggered when the system signals a low-battery state, causing the `apmscript` to execute and perform the `touch` operation on the symlinked file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local User Access:**  The attacker needs to have a user account on the affected system to create the malicious symlink in the `/tmp` directory.
- **Understanding of APM Events:** The attacker needs to be aware that the `apmscript` is triggered by low-battery events, and they would need to induce such an event (e.g., by cutting power to a laptop).

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is specific to Red Hat 7.2 and possibly other systems where the vulnerable script is deployed.
- The vulnerability stems from a non-official apmd package script, not the core apmd itself.
- Red Hat was informed of the issue on 2001-11-16 and the vulnerability was resolved in apmd-3.0.2-6.
- The bug report suggests a fix by placing the temporary file in a secure directory like `/var/run/apmd/`.
