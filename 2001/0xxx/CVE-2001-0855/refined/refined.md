- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A buffer overflow occurs in the `db_loader` binary of Rational ClearCase when reading the `TERM` environment variable.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The `db_loader` program does not properly validate the length of the `TERM` environment variable, leading to a buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit allows a local attacker to gain root privileges.
- **Attack vectors:** A local user can exploit the vulnerability by setting a long string as the value of the `TERM` environment variable before executing the `db_loader` program.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a local user able to execute the `db_loader` binary.
