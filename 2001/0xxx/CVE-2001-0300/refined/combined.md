## Oracle Internet Directory LDAP Daemon does not check write permissions properly

#### Vulnerability Note VU#610904

Original Release Date: 2001-07-09 | Last Revised: 2001-07-09

---

### Overview

The Oracle LDAP Daemon (oidldapd version 2.1.1.1), which ships with Oracle version 8i for Linux version 8.1.7, does not check write permissions properly. This can allow a local user to delete or write to any file on the system.

### Description

| The Oracle LDAP Daemon (oidldapd version 2.1.1.1) does not check write permissions properly. It generates log files in a directory (ldaplog) that has world-writable permissions. This can be used by local users to erase log files. In conjunction with a symlink attack, a local user can write to or delete any file on the local machine. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A local user can write to or delete any file on the system. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Oracle encourages all Linux directory developers to download the upcoming production version of Oracle Internet Directory, v2.1.1, part of the Oracle 8.1.7 (8i Release 3) server media pack, from <http://technet.oracle.com/>. |
| --- |

| Use chmod to set the file permissions to 710 for the oidldapd and oidmon executables. This will restrict access to privileged users only. |
