The content is related to CVE-2001-0300.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Oracle LDAP Daemon (oidldapd version 2.1.1.1) does not properly check write permissions. Specifically, it generates log files in a world-writable directory (ldaplog).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure file permissions on the log directory, which is world-writable. This allows a local user to erase log files.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local user can write to or delete any file on the system by combining the world-writable directory with a symlink attack.
- **Attack vectors**: A local attacker can exploit the world-writable log directory and a symbolic link attack to overwrite arbitrary files.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A local user with the ability to create symlinks and write to world-writable directories.
