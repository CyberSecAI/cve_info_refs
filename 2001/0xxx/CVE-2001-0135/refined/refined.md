- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Incorrect default file permissions on directories within the UltraBoard CGI installation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The directories `./Private/Skins`, `./Private/Database`, and `./Private/Backups` are created with 777 (read, write, and execute for all users) permissions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can upload malicious CGI scripts to these world-writable directories, which will then be executed with the web server's privileges. This can lead to complete compromise of the web server and potentially the underlying system.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker can upload malicious CGI scripts via a web interface or other means to the affected directories.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to write files to the server via web interface or other means.
