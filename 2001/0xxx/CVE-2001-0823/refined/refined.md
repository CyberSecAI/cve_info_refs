- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `pmpost` binary from the pcp suite follows symbolic links when handling log files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Symbolic link following: The `pmpost` program, when running setuid root, will follow symbolic links during its operation, leading to access of arbitrary files.
    - Insufficient privilege separation: The program's operations, even when handling potentially untrusted input (such as symbolic links), are performed with root privileges.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Local root compromise: By creating a symbolic link to a sensitive file like `/etc/passwd`, an attacker can trick `pmpost` into accessing and potentially writing to that file. This grants them the ability to escalate privileges to root.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Local access: The attack requires local access to the vulnerable system.
    - File system manipulation: The attacker must be able to create directories, files, and symbolic links within a location where the `pmpost` program will access data.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to execute code on the local machine where `pmpost` is installed.
    - The attacker needs to be able to create files, directories and symbolic links.
    - The `pmpost` program must be setuid root to be vulnerable.
