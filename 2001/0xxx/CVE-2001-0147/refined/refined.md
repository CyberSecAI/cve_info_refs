- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An unchecked buffer exists in the Windows 2000 Event Viewer snap-in when displaying detailed views of event records. Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered when the Event Viewer attempts to display an event record containing specially malformed data in one of its fields.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Buffer overflow vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Less serious impact: Event Viewer application failure.
    - More serious impact: Arbitrary code execution in the security context of the user viewing the affected record. This could lead to complete system compromise if the user has administrative privileges.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - An attacker needs to create a specially crafted event record with malformed data and insert it into the Windows Event Log (Application, System, or Security).
    - The vulnerable code is triggered when a user opens the details of the malformed record in the Event Viewer. Simply viewing the list of events is not sufficient to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to write to the event logs on the targeted system. Unprivileged processes can write to the Application and System logs. Writing to the Security log requires privileged process access.
    - For remote exploitation, the attacker would need to have network access to the target machine, and this mechanism is often blocked by firewalls.
    - The attacker needs to induce a user to view the details of the malformed event record using the Event Viewer.
