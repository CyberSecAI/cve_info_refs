- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An unchecked buffer exists in a parsing routine executed when PowerPoint opens a file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Buffer overflow vulnerability when processing specially crafted data within a PowerPoint file.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - The less serious impact is that the program fails.
    - The more serious impact is that the attacker can execute arbitrary code on the user's machine with the same privileges as the user.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Opening a specially crafted PowerPoint file.
    - Visiting a malicious website.
    - Viewing a specially crafted HTML email message.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to craft a malicious PowerPoint file with specific data that will cause a buffer overflow.
    - The attacker needs to entice a user to open the malicious file, visit a malicious website, or view a crafted HTML email.
