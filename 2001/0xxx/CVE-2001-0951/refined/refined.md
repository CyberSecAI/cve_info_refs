- **Root cause of vulnerability:**  A denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the Windows 2000 implementation of IKE (Internet Key Exchange).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The IKE service is vulnerable to a UDP flood attack.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  A successful attack can cause the target Windows 2000 machine to lock up, experience 99% CPU utilization, and become unresponsive, effectively denying service.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves sending a continuous flood of UDP packets larger than 800 bytes to port 500 (the IKE port) of the vulnerable Windows 2000 system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to send UDP packets to the target system, meaning they need network connectivity to the vulnerable machine.
