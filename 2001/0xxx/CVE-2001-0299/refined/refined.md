Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by sending a malformed URL with a very large number of characters to the Voyager web-based management interface of a Nokia firewall appliance. This leads to a buffer overflow-like condition within the Voyager-related processes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Buffer overflow or similar memory corruption vulnerability in the Voyager web interface handling of long URLs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS) affecting the Voyager web-based management interface. The web interface becomes inaccessible.
- Potential for arbitrary code execution, although not explicitly demonstrated. An authenticated monitor (read-only administrator) could potentially leverage the vulnerability to gain root access.
- The core firewall functionality (forwarding and filtering) and command-line access remain unaffected.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending a malformed URL with an excessive number of characters to the vulnerable web interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated as an administrator or monitor (read-only administrator) of the Voyager web-based management interface using a valid username and password.
- The attacker needs network access to the Voyager web-based management interface.
- An internal attacker is more likely to exploit this vulnerability

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects Nokia firewall appliances using Voyager web-based management.
- The issue was initially discovered by "K2".
- Nokia considers this a low-priority vulnerability due to the requirement for authentication and limited impact (DoS, but not direct firewall compromise).
- A fix is planned for a future release of Nokia's IPSO OS.
- Workarounds are suggested that include limiting Voyager access to trusted networks and disabling monitor access.
- The issue is tracked by Nokia as Resolution 4097.
