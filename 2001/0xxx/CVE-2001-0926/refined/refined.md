- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A flaw in the JRun server-side component that processes requests for Server Side Includes (SSI) pages. Specifically, when a requested SSI page does not exist, the SSI handler processes the body of the HTTP request as if it were an SSI page.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - The SSI handler processes the HTTP request body when the requested SSI page does not exist.
    - The SSI handler allows user-supplied data to be included in SSI processing.
    - The include directive bypasses normal URL processing and web server access controls, allowing access to protected files.

- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - **Source code disclosure:** An attacker can use crafted HTTP requests with SSI commands in the body to include and reveal the source code of other files on the server, including JSP files, and files in protected directories.
    - **Servlet execution:** An attacker can execute Java servlets using the SSI vulnerability, which could be a problem for sites that have disabled the /servlet/ mapping.

- **Attack vectors:**
    - A remote user can construct HTTP GET requests with a body containing SSI commands, targeting a non-existent .shtml page.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker must be able to send arbitrary HTTP requests to the vulnerable JRun server.
