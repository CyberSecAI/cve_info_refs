- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A flaw in the NetMeeting Remote Desktop Sharing feature that causes high CPU utilization and application hang when a malformed input string is received from a malicious client.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper handling of malformed input strings in NetMeeting's Remote Desktop Sharing feature.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  A successful exploit results in a denial-of-service condition where the NetMeeting application hangs and consumes 100% CPU, preventing the affected machine from providing NetMeeting services and potentially impacting other tasks. Existing NetMeeting sessions would be terminated, causing loss of work.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious client sends a malformed string to the port on which the NetMeeting service is listening.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to send data to the affected machine. This could be achieved via direct internet connection or through an intranet.
