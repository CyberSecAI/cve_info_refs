*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Apache server. No special privileges or internal access to the target is required.

**Additional Information:**

*   The fix for this vulnerability was implemented in the codebase before the 1.3.21 release and consists of returning a `403 Forbidden` error when a very long URI is received.
*   The CVE ID assigned is CAN-2001-0729.
