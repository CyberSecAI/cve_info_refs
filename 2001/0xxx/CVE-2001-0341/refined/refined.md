- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An unchecked buffer in the Visual Studio RAD Remote Deployment Support sub-component of FrontPage Server Extensions. This sub-component processes input information and a specially crafted, malformed packet can trigger a buffer overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Buffer overflow vulnerability in the input processing of the Visual Studio RAD Remote Deployment Support.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server. The code would initially run with the privileges of the IUSR_machinename account, which has similar privileges to a user logged onto the console. Under certain circumstances, it is possible to escalate privileges and execute code in the IWAM_machinename or even the SYSTEM context, allowing the attacker to take any desired actions on the server.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited through a web session. An attacker establishes a web session with the server and sends a specially malformed packet to the server component, causing the buffer overflow.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to establish a web session with the server and send network packets. The attacker does not need to have any prior authentication and can exploit the vulnerability remotely.
