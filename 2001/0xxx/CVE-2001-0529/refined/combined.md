## OpenSSH allows arbitrary file deletion via symlink redirection of temporary file

#### Vulnerability Note VU#655259

Original Release Date: 2001-08-21 | Last Revised: 2001-11-15

---

### Overview

Due to insecure handling of temporary files, some versions of sshd, an encrypted connection program, can delete any file named "cookies" accessible via the computer running sshd.

### Description

| sshd is the server software used to support ssh, a popular encryted connection program. Some versions of OpenSSH fail to handle temporary files in a secure fashion, allowing their removal during an ssh session. This removal may be reflected in the removal of files named "cookies" on the server. Since sshd runs setuid root, ownership and protection of the "cookies" file will be disregarded. |
| --- |

### Impact

| Using this exploit, an attacker may cause loss of data, particularly web location data used in many web sites. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Apply vendor patches; see the Systems Affected section below. |

* **001: SECURITY FIX: May 29, 2001**
    *All architectures*

  The signal handlers in [sendmail(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-2.9/sendmail.8) contain code that is unsafe in the
  context of a signal handler. This leads to potentially serious
  race conditions. At the moment this is a theoretical attack only
  and can only be exploited on the local host (if at all).

  [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.9/common/001_sendmail.patch)

  * **002: SECURITY FIX: May 30, 2001**
      *All architectures*

    Programs using the [fts(3)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-2.9/fts.3)
    routines (such as rm, find, and most programs that take a **-R**
    flag) can be tricked into changing into the wrong directory if the
    parent dir is changed out from underneath it. This is similar to
    the old fts bug but happens when popping out of directories, as
    opposed to descending into them.

    [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.9/common/002_fts.patch)
    This is the second version of the patch.

    * **003: DOCUMENTATION FIX: June 1, 2001**
        *All architectures*

      The 2.9 CD cover states that XFree86 3.3.6-current is included. This is only half-true.
      In fact, the XFree86 included for all architectures is 4.0.3. On the i386, the
      3.3.6 Xservers have also been included, because 4.0.3 still has weak support for
      some devices which 3.3.6 supported better.

      * **004: RELIABILITY FIX: June 5, 2001**
          *All architectures*

        [isakmpd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-2.9/isakmpd.8)
        will fail to use a certificate with an identity string that is
        exactly N \* 8 bytes long.

        [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.9/common/004_isakmpd.patch)

        * **005: RELIABILITY FIX: June 7, 2001**
            *All architectures*

          [pwd\_mkdb(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-2.9/pwd_mkdb.8)
          corrupts /etc/pwd.db when modifying an existing user.

          [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.9/common/005_pwd_mkdb.patch)

          * **006: SECURITY FIX: June 12, 2001**
              *All architectures*

            [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-2.9/sshd.8)
            allows users to delete arbitrary files named "cookies" if X11
            forwarding is enabled. X11 forwarding is disabled by default.

            [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.9/common/006_sshcookie.patch)

            * **007: SECURITY FIX: June 15, 2001**
                *All architectures*

              A race condition exists in the kernel [execve(2)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-2.9/execve.2) implementation that opens a small window of vulnerability for a non-privileged user to [ptrace(2)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-2.9/ptrace.2) attach to a suid/sgid process.

              [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.9/common/007_kernexec.patch)

              * **008: RELIABILITY FIX: June 15, 2001**
                  *All architectures*

                [twe(4)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-2.9/twe.4)
                mishandles the DMA mapping resulting in a kernel panic on unaligned data
                transfers, induced by programs such as
                [disklabel(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-2.9/disklabel.8)
                and
                [dump(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-2.9/dump.8).

                [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.9/common/008_twe.patch)
                This is the second version of the patch.

                * **009: RELIABILITY FIX: Jun 23, 2001**

                  The XF86Setup(1) configuration tool for XFree86 3.3.6 is producing
                  corrupted /etc/XF86Config files.
                  [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.9/i386/009_XF86Setup.patch)
                  It does so by linking XF86Setup against the XFree86 3.3.6 version of libXxf86vm.a.

                  * When using a PS/2 keyboard with an MSI K7T Pro2A motherboard, it may be
                    necessary to disable the "USB Keyboard Support" and
                    "USB Mouse Support" options in the BIOS. Otherwise, the i8042
                    keyboard controller doesn't acknowledge commands, confusing OpenBSD.

                    * **010: RELIABILITY FIX: Jul 9, 2001**

                      The NVIDIA driver for XFree86 4.0.3 is incorrectly restoring the text
                      mode palette upon exit of the X server. [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.9/i386/010_nvidia.patch)
                      To avoid rebuilding the whole XFree86 tree, an updated binary driver
                      is also available
                      [here](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.9/i386/nv_drv.o).
                      Just grab it, copy it to /usr/X11R6/lib/modules/drivers/ and
                      restart your X server.

                      * **011: RELIABILITY FIX: July 15, 2001**
                          *All architectures*

                        The
                        [packages(7)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-2.9/packages.7)
                        subsystem incorrectly accepts some package dependencies as okay (see
                        [packages-specs(7)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-2.9/packages-specs.7)
                        for details).

                        [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.9/common/011_pkg.patch)
                        by forcing `/usr/sbin/pkg` to be more careful in checking
                        version numbers.

                        * **012: SECURITY FIX: July 30, 2001**
                            *All architectures*

                          A kernel buffer overflow exists in the NFS mount code. An attacker may
                          use this overflow to execute arbitrary code in kernel mode. However,
                          only users with [mount(2)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-2.9/mount.2)
                          privileges can initiate this attack. In default installs, only super-user has
                          mount privileges. The kern.usermount [sysctl(3)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-2.9/sysctl.3) controls whether other users have mount privileges.

                          [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.9/common/012_nfs.patch)

                          * **013: SECURITY FIX: August 21, 2001**
                              *All architectures*

                            A security hole exists in [sendmail(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-2.9/sendmail.8)
                            that may allow an attacker on the local host to gain root privileges by
                            specifying out-of-bounds debug parameters.

                            [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.9/common/013_sendmail.patch)

                            * **014: SECURITY FIX: August 29, 2001**
                                *All architectures*

                              A security hole exists in [lpd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-2.9/lpd.8)
                              that may allow an attacker with line printer access to gain root

                                The UUCP execution daemon, uuxqt(8), has a bug in its command line
                                parsing routine that may allow arbitrary commands to be run. Because
                                some UUCP commands are run as root (and daemon) from cron it is possible
                                to leverage compromise of the UUCP user to gain root.
