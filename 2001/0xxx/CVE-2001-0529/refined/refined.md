Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2001-0529:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insecure handling of temporary files within the `sshd` daemon (OpenSSH).
*   **Weakness:**  `sshd` does not properly manage temporary files, allowing for the possibility of symlink redirection. This means an attacker can manipulate temporary file creation to point to a different file.
*   **Impact:**
    *   An attacker can cause the deletion of arbitrary files named "cookies" accessible to the server running `sshd`.
    *   This can lead to loss of data, potentially including web location data used by various websites.
    *  Since `sshd` runs with setuid root privileges, the normal file ownership and protection mechanisms are bypassed.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   The vulnerability is triggered during an SSH session.
    *   The attacker must be able to establish an SSH connection to the vulnerable server.
    * The attacker needs to exploit the insecure handling of temporary files.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to have a valid account to authenticate to the ssh server.
    *  The attacker needs to manipulate the temporary file creation process, presumably by creating a symlink.
    * X11 forwarding must be enabled.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to certain versions of `sshd` (OpenSSH).
*   The issue was initially reported on the Bugtraq discussion list.
*   Patches were released by vendors like Caldera, Conectiva, Immunix, NetBSD, OpenBSD, and OpenSSH to address this vulnerability.
* The provided OpenBSD patch `006_sshcookie.patch` is specifically designed to fix this vulnerability.

**Summary:**
The vulnerability in `sshd` (OpenSSH) allows a remote authenticated attacker to delete any files named "cookies" by exploiting insecure handling of temporary files and utilizing symlink redirection. This is possible due to the `sshd` running setuid root.
