The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in PowerFTP Server v2.03:

**1. Directory Traversal and Information Disclosure:**

*   **Root Cause:** The FTP server improperly handles directory traversal sequences ("..") and allows access to files and directories outside the designated root directory.
*   **Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Directory Traversal:** The server does not correctly restrict access based on relative paths, allowing users to navigate to any directory using ".." sequences.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can list the contents of any drive (C:, D:, A:) including sensitive system files, installed programs, and other user files.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized access to sensitive information on the server.
    *   Exposure of system files and configuration data.
    *   Potential compromise of user data.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Using the `ls` or `NLST` FTP commands combined with relative paths ("../") or absolute paths (e.g., `c:/`).
*   **Attacker Capabilities:**
    *   Requires basic FTP client capabilities.
    *   No authentication bypass is needed to exploit the information disclosure, although credentials may be needed for the FTP service itself.

**2. Remote Denial of Service (DoS):**

*   **Root Cause:** Sending a large string of characters (2048 "A"s) to the server over the FTP control connection causes the FTP server to crash.
*   **Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Buffer Overflow or similar:** The server does not handle excessively long commands, likely due to a buffer overflow or similar vulnerability in the command handling logic.
*   **Impact:**
    *   The FTP server crashes, requiring a manual restart of the service.
    *   Disruption of the FTP service.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Sending an excessively long string through an FTP command.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:**
    *   Requires the ability to establish an FTP connection to the server.

**3. Remote Denial of Service via Floppy Drive Access:**

*   **Root Cause:** The server attempts to list the floppy drive contents, even when no disk is present or when access is denied. This causes delays and hangs the server during the floppy drive operation.
*   **Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Inefficient Resource Handling:** The server doesn't handle errors gracefully when trying to access the floppy drive, leading to resource exhaustion and delays.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Slows down and potentially hangs the server.
    *   Renders the FTP service unusable, even if access to the floppy drive is denied by the OS.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Sending a large number of `NLST a:/` commands to the server over the FTP control connection.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:**
    *   Requires the ability to establish an FTP connection to the server, and authenticate to the service

**Additional Information:**

*   The exploit code for data revealing, DoS, and Floppy drive DoS are provided in the content.
*   The vendor was notified and a temporary patch was made.
*   The affected version is PowerFTP Server v2.03.
*   The affected operating systems are Windows 95/98/NT/2000.
