### CVE-2001-0404 Analysis:

The provided text discusses a directory traversal vulnerability in JavaServer Web Dev Kit (JSWDK) 1.0.1 running on Windows 2000.

**Vulnerable Software:** Microsoft Windows 2000 with JSWDK 1.0.1 installed. Other operating systems might also be affected.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability allows remote attackers to access files outside the intended document root directory.

**Attack Vector:** By using directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) in the URL, attackers can navigate to parent directories and access sensitive files and directories.

**Exploit Examples:**
*   `http://localhost:8080/examples//WEB-INF/` - Lists the contents of the /WEB-INF/ directory.
*   `http://localhost:8080/../examples//WEB-INF/../../../../../` - If JSWDK is installed in `c:\`, this will list the contents of `c:\`.

**Impact:** Attackers can access sensitive information, including configuration files and potentially execute arbitrary code, depending on the files they can access.

**Attacker Capabilities:** Remote attacker.

**Solution:** Update JSWDK.
