- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A memory leak exists in the Windows 2000 Terminal Service and Windows NT 4.0 Terminal Server Edition when processing malformed Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) data. Specifically, the server fails to deallocate memory after processing certain types of invalid RDP packets.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a memory leak in the terminal services' RDP processing function. The service doesn't properly deallocate memory after receiving specific malformed RDP packets.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful attack can lead to denial of service (DoS). By sending a large volume of malformed RDP data, an attacker can deplete the server's memory, causing performance degradation or complete system unavailability. All system services would be affected, including terminal services and other services like file sharing.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is sending malformed RDP packets to the affected server via port 3389.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to send data to the terminal services port (3389) of the target system. No authentication is needed for this vulnerability to be exploited. Firewalls blocking port 3389 can prevent exploitation from external networks.
