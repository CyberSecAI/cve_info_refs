The provided document discusses multiple vulnerabilities, and one of them is related to CVE-2001-0246.

**Vulnerability:** New variants of the "Frame Domain Verification" vulnerability

*   **Root cause:**  The vulnerability occurs because certain functions do not prevent browser windows in different domains from communicating with each other.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The vulnerability allows a malicious website operator to open two browser windows, one in the website's domain and the other on the user's local file system. It's possible to pass information from the local file system window to the website window, violating domain isolation.

*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can read files on the user's local computer that can be opened within a browser window (e.g., .htm, .txt, .doc files). The attacker cannot add, delete, or change the files.

*   **Attack vectors:** A malicious website operator can exploit the vulnerability by opening a browser window in the website's domain and another one on the user's local file system.

*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The attacker needs to operate a website.
    *   The attacker needs to know the exact name and location of the files they want to read.
    *   The attacker can only read files that can be opened in a browser window.

**Additional details:**
*   The vulnerability is a new variant of a previously discussed vulnerability (MS00-033)
*   The specific functions containing the flaw are different from the previous variants, and one of them is only present on Windows 2000 systems.
*   The patch eliminates all variants of the vulnerability.
