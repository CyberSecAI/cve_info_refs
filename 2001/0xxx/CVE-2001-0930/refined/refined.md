- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `sendpage.pl` script executes a user-supplied message within a shell command without proper sanitization. Specifically, the script uses backticks to execute a command where the message is included directly, allowing command injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Command injection vulnerability due to insufficient input sanitization/validation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary command execution with the privileges of the web server. An attacker can create files, execute system commands, and potentially gain full control of the server.
- **Attack vectors:** By submitting a specially crafted message through the HTML form to `sendpage.pl`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to access the web form where `sendpage.pl` is used. No special privileges are required, only the ability to provide input to the form.
