- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A buffer overflow in Navision Financials Server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The server is vulnerable to a buffer overflow when handling specially crafted network packets. Specifically, sending a null character followed by a large number of 'A' characters to TCP port 2407 can trigger the overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  The vulnerability leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition by crashing the SERVER.EXE process. The advisory mentions that the overflow does not appear to be exploitable for arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a malicious network packet to TCP port 2407.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server on port 2407. They must be able to send specially crafted TCP packets to the server.
