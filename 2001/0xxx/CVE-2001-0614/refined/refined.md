- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Carello.dll uses full physical paths instead of relative paths to execute scripts, and it performs insufficient input validation. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insufficient input validation and use of full physical paths for script execution.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary command execution with the privileges of the web server, typically LocalSystem in the case of IIS. This can lead to a denial of service, where the web server becomes unresponsive, requiring a reboot. It can also allow the attacker to gain full control of the system.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a malicious URL with the `CARELLOCODE` and `VBEXE` parameters, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Carello E-Commerce server.
