Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described as CVE-2001-0333:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of this vulnerability is an error in how Microsoft IIS (versions 4.0 and 5.0) processes CGI program filenames. Specifically, IIS decodes the CGI filename twice instead of once.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Double Decoding:** The primary weakness is that after an initial decode of the CGI filename for security checks, IIS performs a second decoding. This is an implementation flaw that allows specially crafted filenames to bypass security checks.
- **Path Traversal:** By encoding directory traversal characters (like `../`, `.\`, etc.) multiple times, attackers can bypass IIS's checks designed to prevent accessing files outside the web root.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Attackers can use the vulnerability to execute arbitrary operating system commands on the affected server. The commands are executed with the privileges of the IUSR_machinename account, which is typically the account used by anonymous visitors.
- **Server Compromise:** This vulnerability could lead to attackers modifying web pages, adding/deleting files, reformatting hard drives, uploading malicious code, and potentially escalating privileges to further compromise the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malformed CGI Filename:** The attack vector involves sending a request to the web server with a specially crafted CGI filename that includes double-encoded directory traversal sequences like `..%255c` (which decodes to `..\`).
- **HTTP Request:** The malicious request is sent via an HTTP request to the webserver.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable IIS server.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerability and how to construct the double-encoded directory traversal sequences.
- **Basic understanding of web servers:** The attacker must understand how web servers handle CGI requests and how directory structures are normally set up.
