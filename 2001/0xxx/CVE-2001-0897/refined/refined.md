Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**Vulnerability:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the way the UBB (Ultimate Bulletin Board) software handles the `IMG` tag. Specifically, it does not properly sanitize or validate the content within the `IMG` tag, allowing for the injection of HTML attributes like `onerror`.

*   **Weakness:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization. The software allows the injection of arbitrary HTML attributes within the `IMG` tag.

*  **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by posting a crafted UBB tag, specifically an `IMG` tag with an `onerror` attribute, in a message on the forum. The `onerror` attribute can then be used to execute arbitrary JavaScript code when the image fails to load (which is guaranteed with the `about:test` url).

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Redirection:** An attacker can redirect users to an arbitrary website by setting the `onerror` attribute to `top.location.href`.
    *   **Cookie Theft:** By setting the `onerror` attribute to load a malicious script on a different domain using `this.src`, an attacker can steal users' cookies.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker only needs the ability to post messages in the forum with UBB tags.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code is located in `ubb_library.cgi`. Specifically, line 767 in version prior to 5.47e, and line 709 of the latest version.
*   The software tries to filter for `ONERROR` by using a case-insensitive regex check: `if ($ThePost =~ /\ONERROR\s*=/i)`. However, the provided exploit can bypass this check by injecting the `onerror` event handler within an `IMG` tag which is not being checked for such attributes.
* The exploit uses the `about:test` URL which is guaranteed to cause an error, thus triggering the `onerror` handler.

**Summary**
The vulnerability in UBB allows for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via a malformed IMG tag. This allows an attacker to redirect users or steal their cookies by using the `onerror` event handler with javascript. The vendor was aware of the issue and fixed it in version 5.47e.
