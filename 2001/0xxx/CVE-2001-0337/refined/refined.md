- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The patch provided in Microsoft Security Bulletins MS01-014 and MS01-016 successfully eliminated the vulnerabilities at issue, but introduced a memory leak.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory leak.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could gradually deplete the available memory on the server to the point where it could become unresponsive, leading to a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can send requests to the server that trigger the memory leak.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the server.
