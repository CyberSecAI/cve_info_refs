- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A memory leak exists in the PPTP service of Windows NT 4.0 when processing malformed data packets. Specifically, the service requests memory but fails to return it to the operating system, leading to memory exhaustion.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is a memory leak caused by the improper handling of malformed PPTP packets.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. The server becomes unresponsive, hangs, or fails, requiring a reboot to restore normal operation. Existing PPTP sessions are lost, and new connections are prevented.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves sending a continuous stream of specially crafted malformed PPTP packets to a vulnerable server. The attacker does not need to establish a valid PPTP session to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the vulnerable server. They do not need to be authenticated or have any special privileges. The vulnerability can be exploited over the internet.
