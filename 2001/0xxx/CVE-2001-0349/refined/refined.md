Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The Microsoft Windows 2000 Telnet Service uses a predictable algorithm for naming the named pipes it creates for each Telnet session.
- The service, upon starting a new session, checks for an existing named pipe using that predictable name. If it finds one, it uses it and executes any code associated with that pipe.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Predictable Named Pipe Names:** The algorithm used to generate named pipe names is easily predictable, allowing an attacker to create a pipe with the same name.
- **Reusing Existing Pipes:** The Telnet service reuses existing named pipes if they exist with the same predictable name, instead of creating a new one with unique and secure name.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The service executes any code attached to the named pipe when it establishes the Telnet session.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Privilege Elevation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Telnet service, which runs in the **Local System** security context. This allows the attacker to take full control of the affected server.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** An attacker needs to be able to load and execute code on the targeted Windows 2000 server. This is typically achieved by gaining interactive logon rights to the server.
- **Named Pipe Creation:** The attacker's code creates a named pipe with the predictably generated name used by the telnet service. It associates the pipe with malicious code that will be executed.
- **Telnet Connection:** The attacker then initiates a Telnet connection to the server. This triggers the vulnerable Telnet service to use the attacker-created named pipe which leads to execution of the attacker's code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local Code Execution:** The attacker must have the ability to execute arbitrary code on the targeted Windows 2000 server.  This usually implies local interactive logon rights.
- **Knowledge of Predictable Pipe Naming Algorithm:** The attacker needs to know or be able to deduce the algorithm used by the Telnet service to name pipes to create the pipe beforehand with the same name.
- **Telnet Service Running:** The Telnet service must be running on the target system.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is similar to the one described in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS00-053.
- The patch eliminates the vulnerability by improving the randomness with which named pipes' names are selected by the Telnet service.
- The CERT/CC vulnerability note (VU#587587) also confirms the information provided in the Microsoft security bulletin MS01-031.
