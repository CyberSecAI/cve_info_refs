Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2001-0550:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a combination of two bugs in the WU-FTPD server:

1.  **Improper Error Handling in Globbing Function:** The `ftpglob()` function, responsible for handling filename globbing (wildcard expansion), fails to properly recognize the string `~{` as a malformed argument. As a result, it does not set the error variable (`globerr`) when this invalid input is encountered.
2.  **Incorrect Error Status Handling:** The calling function in `ftpcmd.y`, responsible for parsing commands, incorrectly handles the error status returned by the `ftpglob()` function. Because `globerr` was not set, the code proceeds to attempt to free an uninitialized memory address.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap Corruption:** Due to the incorrect handling of the error status, the program attempts to free a pointer that doesn't point to allocated memory, leading to memory corruption in the heap. This uninitialized memory address can be influenced by a user, thus making it possible for the user to control the memory being freed.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The `ftpglob` function lacks proper validation, leading to the failure to recognize `~{` as a malformed input.
*   **Missing Error Check:** The calling functions fail to properly check for errors in the globbing process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker who can log into the WU-FTPD server (including anonymous users if enabled) can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the server process (typically root). This can result in complete system compromise.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Any user that can log into the FTP server can gain root privileges.
*   **Potential System Compromise:**  Due to the ability to run arbitrary code as root, an attacker could gain full control of the vulnerable system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely through the FTP protocol, allowing an attacker to send malicious commands to the WU-FTPD server.
*   **Malicious FTP Commands:** The attack is triggered by sending a specially crafted FTP command to the server that includes the invalid globbing pattern (`~{`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:**  The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable WU-FTPD server.
*   **FTP Access:** The attacker must be able to log into the FTP server, which can be achieved through a valid user account or anonymous access if enabled.
*   **Basic Knowledge of FTP Commands:** The attacker needs to be able to send commands to the FTP server.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The `ftpglob()` function is used to expand wildcards in file paths, similar to how a shell does it.
*   When the globbing code fails to handle the `~{` input, the program attempts to `free()` memory at a user-controlled address, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
*   The advisory mentions that unsuccessful attempts to exploit the bug do not crash the server, only the thread handling the request fails, which allows the attacker to try again, until successful.
* The vulnerability was first reported in April 2001 by Matt Power, but was thought to be unexploitable until it was re-discovered and confirmed as exploitable by Core Security Technologies on Nov 1, 2001.

**Vulnerable Software:**

*   All versions of WU-FTPD up to and including 2.6.1 are vulnerable.
*   Version 2.7.0 snapshots were also vulnerable.
*   BeroFTPD, which shares code with WU-FTPD, is also vulnerable.
* Multiple Linux distributions that include vulnerable versions of wu-ftpd, including RedHat, Debian, Mandrake, Conectiva, SuSE, Immunix, and others.

**Mitigation:**

*   Apply the patch provided by WU-FTPD or the security updates released by Linux distributors.
*   Disable anonymous FTP access to prevent unauthenticated users from exploiting the vulnerability.
*   Disable the vulnerable service until a patch is applied.
*   Restrict access to the control port (usually 21/tcp).

The provided text also contains a proof of concept demonstrating the vulnerability, showing that sending the command `ls ~{` while connected to a vulnerable server results in a crash due to an invalid memory free.
