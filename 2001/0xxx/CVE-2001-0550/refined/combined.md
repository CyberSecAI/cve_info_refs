## History

The CERT Division is the birthplace of cybersecurity. For nearly 30 years, the CERT Division of the SEI has partnered with government, industry, law enforcement, and academia to advance cybersecurity and improve the security and resilience of computer systems and networks.

Originally focused on incident response, we have expanded into cybersecurity areas such as network situational awareness, malicious code analysis, secure coding, resilience management, insider threats, digital investigations and intelligence, workforce development, DevOps, forensics, software assurance, vulnerability discovery and analysis, and risk management.

## Former Director Richard Pethia

[Richard Pethia](/about/leadership/display.cfm?customel_datapageid_2623=3545) was founding director of the SEI's CERT Division. Pethia, who served as director of CERT from 1988 to 2016, guided the organization through tremendous growth and change. Under Pethia's leadership, the unit expanded and evolved from the CERT Coordination Center—a small group focused on computer incident response—to a research organization of more than 200 professionals dedicated to solving problems with widespread cybersecurity implications.

                   Vulnerability Report For WU-FTPD Server

Date Published: 2001-11-28

Last Update: 2001-11-28

Advisory ID: CORE-20011001

Bugtraq ID: 3581

CVE CAN: None currently assigned

Title: WU-FTPD Improper Ftpglob Error Handling Vulnerability

Class: Failure to handle exceptional conditions

Remotely Exploitable: Yes

Locally Exploitable: Yes

Release Mode: FORCED RELEASE

Vulnerability Description:

The Washington University FTP daemon (WU-FTPD) is a highly modified and
significantly complex version of FTPD that provides some extra features:
custom logging, limited remote command support, and other enhacements
to the standard BSD version of FTPD.

A problem was found in all versions of Wu-FTPD included by default in all
major Linux distributions. Other platforms that ship wu-ftpd and FTP
server programs derived from it are affected.

By exploiting this problem, any user who is able to log into a vulnerable
version of the WU-FTPD server may be able to execute arbitrary code
remotely with the privileges of the server process (usually root) which
can lead to complete system compromise.

The problem is due to a combination of bugs, one located within the
function responsible for the globbing feature, which fails to properly
signal an error to its caller under certain conditions. The glob function
does not properly handle the string "~{" as an illegal parameter.
The other bug is at the caller, a command parser function, that incorrectly
handles the error status returned by the glob function allowing the
corruption of the process memory space.

For those interested in a technical description and proof of concept follow
towards the end of this advisory.

Vulnerable Packages:

 All versions of wu-ftpd including and up to 2.6.1 are vulnerable.
 Version 2.7.0 snapshots are also vulnerable.

Sun Microsystems Inc.

 The Sun Cobalt Qube1 is vulnerable.

 Solaris is NOT vulnerable to this problem.

 As reported by Brent Paulson from Sun regarding
 Solaris ISP server that ships with a wu-ftpd derived server:
 "The Sun engineering group for the SISP in.ftpd product
  has verified that we are not vulnerable to the issue
  described in the described vulnerability."

Hewlett Packard

 As reported by Dan Grove from HP:

 " HP-UX is immune to this issue. It was fixed
  in conjunction with the last "globbing" issue
  announced in CERT Advisory CA-2001-07, released
  April 10, 2001. The lab did a complete check/scan
  of the globbing software, and fixed this issue then
  as well. Customers should apply the patches listed
  in HP Security Bulletin #162 released July 19,2001:

  HPSBUX0107-162   Security Vulnerability in ftpd and ftp"

Solution/Vendor Information/Workaround:

 Wu-FTPD
  The wu-ftpd development team has devised a patch
  that fixes the problem and its already applied to
  the current wu-ftpd source tree. Current 2.7.0
  snapshots are NOT vulnerable, however 2.7.0 is
  not an official wu-ftpd release and should be thought
  as a version for testing.

  The team will provide patches for the vulnerable
  WU-ftpd releases shortly.

 RedHat

   RedHat Linux had released and advisory and and
   SRPMs to address the problem, they can be obtained

 This vulnerability was initially reported to the vuln-dev mailing list
 at SecurityFocus.com by Matt Power from Bindview Corp. on April 30th, 2001.
 At that moment, it was thought as a not exploitable bug and no further
 research was conducted.

 The bug was re-discovered independantly by Luciano Notarfrancesco and
 Juan Pablo Martinez Kuhn from Core Security Technologies and confirmed to
be
 exploitable on Nov. 1st, 2001

 This advisory was drafted with the aid of the Vulnerability Help team at
 SecurityFocus.com.

 We would like to thank the VulnHelp Team, CERT,the WU-ftpd development
 team and the Linux vendors for their efforts trying to coordinate the
release
 of information and availability of fixes.

Technical Description - Exploit/Concept Code:

 Tests were performed using wu-ftp server versions 2.6.1 and 2.7.0 snapshots

 WU-FTPD server features globbing capabilities, allowing a user to search
 pathnames matching patterns according to the rules used by the shell.
 The feature does not use the glibc implementation of the glob()
 function, instead it implements its own in the the glob.c file

 This implementation fails to set the globerr variable under certain
 circunstances, bypassing error checking after the call, and trying to free
 an uninitialized memory address. This memory address is located in the
 process heap and can be manipulated by the user, issuing especially crafted
 commands beforehand to the server. This issue was found twice in the source
 code.

 The handling of the globbing metacharacters is done by the ftpglob()
 function included in the glob.c file. The function is called for example
 from ftpcmd.y line 1277 and line 1303 while processing pathnames for
 restricted and non-restricted users beggining with a '/' or a '~'
 character respectively.

   if (restricted_user && logged_in && $1 && strncmp($1, "/", 1) == 0){
 [...]
 globlist = ftpglob(t);
 [...]
   }

   else if (logged_in && $1 && strncmp($1, "~", 1) == 0) {
        char **globlist;

        globlist = ftpglob($1);
 [...]
   }

 After that, the variable globerr is checked to handle any possible error
 that could had happened during the globbing process, setting this variable
 is responsability of the ftpglob() function.

 Under certain circunstances not properly handled by the function, globerr
 is not set even though an error condition is present

 Being not initialized explicitly, globlist contains what was in the heap
 before, which can be properly set with specially crafted requests to the
server.

 As the globerr was not set properly, the function attempts to free
 the provided pointer in ftpcmd.y line 1282 and line 1288.

                   if (globerr) {
                        reply(550, globerr);
                        $$ = NULL;
                        if (globlist) {
                            blkfree(globlist);
                            free((char *) globlist);
                        }
                    }
                    else if (globlist) {
                        $$ = *globlist;
                        blkfree(&globlist[[1]](#1));
                        free((char *) globlist);
                    }

 As shown, during the processing of a globbing pattern, the
 Wu-Ftpd implementation creates a list of the files that match.
 The memory where this data is stored is on the heap, allocated using
 malloc().  The globbing function simply returns a pointer to the list.
 It is up to the calling functions to free the allocated memory.

 If an error occurs processing the pattern, memory will not be allocated
 and a variable indicating this should be set.
 The calling functions must check the value of this variable before
 attempting to use the globbed filenames (and later freeing the memory).

 Under certain circumstances, the globbing function does not set this
variable
 when an error occurs.  As a result of this, Wu-Ftpd will eventually attempt
to
 free uninitialized memory.

 If this region of memory contained user-controllable data before the free
 call, it is possible to have an arbitrary word in memory overwritten with
an
 arbitrary value.  This can lead to execution of arbitrary code if function
 pointers or return addresses are overwritten.

 Details of hwo to exploit this type of problems are in the
 public domain and can be found in Phrack Magazine #57 article 9:

  <http://www.phrack.org/show.php?p=57&a=9>

 Unsuccessful explotation of the problem does not lead to denial of service
 attacks as the ftp server continues normal execution, only the thread
 handling the request fails, helping the attacker to success.

 The following excerpt is a sample verification of the existence of
 the problem:

## WU-FTPD does not properly handle file name globbing

#### Vulnerability Note VU#886083

Original Release Date: 2001-11-28 | Last Revised: 2002-03-28

---

### Overview

[SecurityFocus](http://www.securityfocus.com/) and [CORE Security Technologies](http://www.corest.com/) have reported a vulnerability in [WU-FTPD](http://www.wu-ftpd.org/). WU-FTPD does not handle file name globbing properly and may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code. WU-FTPD is a widely-used FTP daemon that is included in many UNIX and Linux distributions. This vulnerability was discussed on SecurityFocus' [vuln-dev](http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/82) mailing list in April 2001.

### Description

| The CERT Coordination Center has received a report from SecurityFocus and CORE Security Technologies about a remote code execution vulnerability in the Washington University FTP daemon, WU-FTPD. The vulnerability manifests in WU-FTPD's handling of file name globbing. The problem is not a typical buffer overflow or format string vulnerability, but a combination of two bugs: WU-FTPD's globbing code does not properly return an error condition when interpreting the string '~{', and later frees memory which may contain user supplied data.  When certain characters are encountered in the file name argument to an FTP command issued by a client, WU-FTPD calls its globbing code, which is implemented in glob.c. The globbing code should parse the argument string, set a variable if it encounters an error condition, and return a pointer to the expanded glob expression. The function that calls glob.c eventually uses free() to free the memory allocated to hold the expanded glob expression. A problem occurs when the globbing code fails to recognize the string '~{' as a malformed argument and does not set the error variable. The pointer returned by the globbing code references memory on the heap that contains arbitrary data instead of the expanded glob expression. If an attacker can place code of their choice in the right position on the heap, WU-FTPD may execute that code when freeing the memory referenced by the pointer that was returned by the globbing code.This vulnerability is potentially exploitable by any user who is able to log in to a vulnerable server, including users with anonymous access. If successful, an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of WU-FTPD, typically root. If unsuccessful, the thread servicing the request will fail, but WU-FTPD will not crash.Note that BeroFTPD, which shares much of its code base with WU-FTPD, is also vulnerable. BeroFTPD is no longer separately maintained. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of WU-FTPD, typically root. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply Patch**Apply the appropriate patch supplied as described in the vendor section below. Alternatively, apply the patch provided by WU-FTPD. |
| --- |

| **Block or Restrict Access**Block or restrict access to the control port used by WU-FTPD, typically 21/tcp. It may be possible to use TCP Wrapper or a similar technology to provide improved access control and logging. Additionally, an application-level firewall may be able to filter requests made to WU-FTPD.**Disable Anonymous Access**Disable anonymous FTP access. Note that this will only prevent unauthenticated users from attempting to exploit this vulnerability.**Disable Vulnerable Service**Disable WU-FTPD until a patch is can be applied. |

DESCRIPTION
 "wu-ftpd" is one of the ftp servers available in Conectiva Linux and
 several other linux distributions.

 CORE Security Technologies[1] reported[2] a vulnerability[3] in the
 wu-ftpd ftp server that can be exploited remotely. The problem is in
 the internal glob function used by wu-ftpd which allows an attacker
 to corrupt memory space and execute arbitrary code remotely. There is
 no need for an user account on the ftp server, this problem can be
 abused by anonymous users as well.
 This vulnerability was first reported[4] by Matt Power but was deemed
 not exploitable at that time.

SOLUTION
 All administrators who deploy wu-ftpd should upgrade immediately. If
 an upgrade is not possible, then the service should be shut down, or
 another ftp server should be used.

 There is no need to restart the service after the upgrade because
 wu-ftpd is started from inetd. The administrator might want to,
 however, shut down all current connections which would still be using
 the vulnerable copy to avoid a possible abuse by currently connected
 users.

=============================================================================
FreeBSD-SA-01:64                                           Security Advisory
                                                                FreeBSD, Inc.

Topic:          wu-ftpd port contains remote root compromise

Category:       ports
Module:         wu-ftpd
Announced:      2001-12-04
Credits:        CORE Security Technologies
                Contact: Ivan Arce (iarce@corest.com)
Affects:        Ports collection prior to the correction date
Corrected:      2001-11-28 10:52:26 UTC
FreeBSD only:   NO

I.   Background

wu-ftpd is a popular full-featured FTP server.

II.  Problem Description

The wu-ftpd port, versions prior to wu-ftpd-2.6.1\_7, contains a
vulnerability which allows FTP users, both anonymous FTP users and
those with valid accounts, to execute arbitrary code as root on
the local machine.  This may be accomplished by inserting invalid
globbing parameters which are incorrectly parsed by the FTP server
into command input.

The wu-ftpd port is not installed by default, nor is it "part of
FreeBSD" as such: it is part of the FreeBSD ports collection, which
contains over 6000 third-party applications in a ready-to-install
format. The ports collection shipped with FreeBSD 4.4 contains this
problem since it was discovered after the release.

FreeBSD makes no claim about the security of these third-party
applications, although an effort is underway to provide a security
audit of the most security-critical ports.

III. Impact

FTP users, including anonymous FTP users, can cause arbitrary commands
to be executed as root on the local machine.

If you have not chosen to install the wu-ftpd port/package, then your
system is not vulnerable to this problem.

IV.  Workaround

Deinstall the wu-ftpd port/package, if you have installed it.

V.   Solution

One of the following:

1) Upgrade your entire ports collection and rebuild the wu-ftpd port.

2) Deinstall the old package and install a new package dated after the
correction date, obtained from:

[i386]
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-4-stable/ftp/wu-ftpd-2.6.1\_7.tgz
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-5-current/ftp/wu-ftpd-2.6.1\_7.tgz

[alpha]
Packages are not automatically generated for the alpha architecture at
this time due to lack of build resources

NOTE: It may be several days before updated packages are available. Be
sure to check the file creation date on the package, because the
version number of the software has not changed.

3) download a new port skeleton for the wu-ftpd port from:

<http://www.freebsd.org/ports/>

and use it to rebuild the port.

4) Use the portcheckout utility to automate option (3) above. The
portcheckout port is available in /usr/ports/devel/portcheckout or the
package can be obtained from:

ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-4-stable/devel/portcheckout-2.0.tgz
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-5-current/devel/portcheckout-2.0.tgz

VI.  Correction details

The following list contains the revision numbers of each file that was
corrected in the FreeBSD ports collection.

Path                                                             Revision
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------
ports/ftp/wu-ftpd/Makefile                                         1.41
ports/ftp/wu-ftpd/files/patch-ap                                   1.2

Affected products:      Immunix 7.0
Bugs fixed:             immunix/1861
Date:                   Wed Nov 28 2001

Author:                 Seth Arnold <sarnold@wirex.com>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Description:
  CORE Security Technologies has found an heap overflow problem in
  wu-ftpd, related to the internal globbing functions. Because this is a
  heap overflow, StackGuard does not prevent any possible exploits from
  working.

  Thomas Biege from SuSE has also discovered several format-string
  problems that may or may not be remotely exploitable; these problems
  were also found independently by someone else, who sadly is unknown to
  WireX.

  The wu-ftpd packages provided here fix these problems, as well as
  other lesser problems.

                   Red Hat, Inc. Red Hat Security Advisory

Synopsis:          Updated wu-ftpd packages are available
Advisory ID:       RHSA-2001:157-06
Issue date:        2001-11-20
Updated on:        2001-11-26
Product:           Red Hat Linux
Keywords:          wu-ftpd buffer overrun glob ftpglob
Cross references:
Obsoletes:         RHSA-2000:039
---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Topic:

Updated wu-ftpd packages are available to fix an overflowable buffer.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 6.2 - alpha, i386, sparc

Red Hat Linux 7.0 - alpha, i386

Red Hat Linux 7.1 - alpha, i386, ia64

Red Hat Linux 7.2 - i386

3. Problem description:

An overflowable buffer exists in earlier versions of wu-ftpd.
An attacker could gain access to the machine by sending malicious
commands.

It is recommended that all users of wu-ftpd upgrade to the lastest
version.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you
can also use wildcards (\*.rpm) if your current directory \*only\* contains the
desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

                        SuSE Security Announcement

        Package:                wuftpd
        Announcement-ID:        SuSE-SA:2001:043
        Date:                   Wednesday, Nov. 28th, 2001 23:45 MET
        Affected SuSE versions: 6.3, 6.4, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3
        Vulnerability Type:     remote root compromise
        Severity (1-10):        7
        SuSE default package:   no
        Other affected systems: all liunx-like systems using wu-ftpd 2.4.x /

1)  problem description, brief discussion, solution, upgrade information

    The wuftpd package as shipped with SuSE Linux distributions comes with
    two versions of wuftpd: wuftpd-2.4.2, installed as /usr/sbin/wuftpd,
    and wuftpd-2.6.0, installed as /usr/sbin/wuftpd-2.6.
    The admin decides which version to use by the inetd/xinetd
    configuration.

    The CORE ST Team had found an exploitable bug in all versions of wuftpd's
    ftpglob() function.
    The glob function overwrites buffer bounds while matching open and closed
    brackets. Due to a missing \0 at the end of the buffer a later call to a
    function that frees allocated memory will feed free(3) with userdefined
    data. This bug could be exploited depending on the implementation of
    the dynmaic allocateable memory API (malloc(3), free(3)) in the libc
    library. Linux and other system are exploitable!

    Some weeks ago, an internal source code audit of wu-ftpd 2.6.0 performed
    by Thomas Biege, SuSE Security, revealed some other security related bugs
    that are fixed in the new RPM packages. Additionally, code from wu-ftpd
    2.6.1 were backported to version 2.6.0 to make it more stable.

    A temporary fix other than using a different server implementation of
    the ftp protocol is not available. We recommend to update the wuftpd
    package on your system.

    We thank the wuftpd team for their work on the bug, particularly because
    the coordination between the vendors and the wuftpd developers lacked
    the necessary discipline for the timely release of the information
    about the problem.

    Please download the update package for your distribution and verify its
    integrity by the methods listed in section 3) of this announcement.
    Then, install the package using the command "rpm -Uhv file.rpm" to apply
    the update.

2)  Pending vulnerabilities in SuSE Distributions and Workarounds:

    - ssh/openssh exploits
      The wrong fix for the crc32-compensation attack is currently actively
      exploited in the internet for both the ssh and the openssh
      implementation of the ssh-1 protocol.
      We urge our users to upgrade their ssh or openssh packages to the
      latest versions that are located on our ftp server at the usual
      directories, referred to via
      <http://www.suse.de/de/support/security/adv004_ssh.txt> from February
      earlier this year.
      Please note, the packages for the SuSE Linux distributions 7.0 and
      older containing cryptographic code are located on the German ftp
      server ftp.suse.de, the distributions 7.1 and newer have their crypto
      updates on ftp.suse.com. There are legal constraints beyond our
      control that lead to this situation.
      Openssh packages of the version 2.9.9p2 ready to download on the ftp
      server ftp.suse.com. They fix the security problems mentioned above,
      along with a set of less serious security problems.
      The announcement is still pending while investigations about the
      status of the package are in progress.

    - libgtop\_daemon
      The libgtop\_daemon, part of the libgtop package for gathering and
      monitoring process and system information, has been found vulnerable
      to a format string error. We are in the process of providing fixes for
      the affected distributions 6.4-7.3. In the meanwhile, we recommend to
      disable the libgtop\_daemon on systems where it is running. This daemon
      is neither installed nor started (if installed) by default on SuSE
      Systems.

    - kernel updates
      A bug in the elf loader of the linux kernels version 2.4 from our
      announcement SSA:2001:036 can cause a system to crash if a user
      executes a vmlinux kernel image. We are preparing another update
      series to workaround this problem and will re-issue the kernel
      announcement as soon as possible.

### Vendor Statement

Sun [Solaris] does not ship WU-FTPD, thus Solaris is not affected by these issues.

The only Sun Cobalt Server Appliance that is vulnerable to this exploit is the Qube1. The Qube1 is no longer a supported appliance, but we do understand the need of having updates available. The following RPM is not officially supported by Sun Cobalt, but offers legacy customers the ability to maintain a limited level of security.

        Vulnerable Packages: Versions previous to wu-ftpd-2.6.1-10
        Date: Wed Jan 23 12:26:21 PST 2002

A security hole was discovered in the package mentioned above.
Please update the package in your installation as soon as possible.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

1. Problem Summary

   CORE ST reports that an exploit has been found for a bug in the wu-ftpd
   glob code. This is the code that handles filename wild card expansion.

2. Impact

   Any logged in user (including anonymous FTP users) can exploit the bug to
   gain root privileges on the server.

3. Solution

  This has been  corrected in version  wu-ftpd-2.6.1-10

  Update the package from our ftp server by running the following command:

  rpm -Uvh ftp://ftp.turbolinux.com/pub/updates/6.0/security/<rpm>

  Where <rpm> are the following:

  wu-ftpd-2.6.1-10.i386.rpm

  The source RPM can be downloaded from:

  ftp://ftp.turbolinux.com/pub/updates/6.0/SRPMS/wu-ftpd-2.6.1-10.src.rpm

  \*\*Note: You must rebuild and install the RPM if you choose to download
  and install the SRPM.  Simply installing the SRPM alone WILL NOT CLOSE
  THE SECURITY HOLE.

 Please verify the MD5 checksums of the updates before you install:

  MD5 sum                               Package Name

These packages are GPG signed by Turbolinux for security. Our key
is available here:

 <http://www.turbolinux.com/security/tlgpgkey2002-01-09.asc>

To verify a package, use the following command:

 rpm --checksig name\_of\_rpm

To examine only the md5sum, use the following command:

 rpm --checksig --nogpg name\_of\_rpm

\*\*Note: Checking GPG keys requires RPM 3.0 or higher.
