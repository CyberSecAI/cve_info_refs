- **Root cause of vulnerability:** BubbleMon, when installed with sgid kmem on FreeBSD, does not drop its effective group ID (egid) before executing programs specified by the user.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is the failure to drop the effective group ID. This allows a user to execute commands with the privileges of the `kmem` group which is not intended.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary programs or shell scripts with the privileges of the `kmem` group, which can lead to privilege escalation.
- **Attack vectors:** The user triggers the vulnerability by providing a program or script as an argument to the `bubblemon` application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a local user who can execute the `bubblemon` application.
