- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A flaw in Internet Explorer allows a web page to display the URL from a different web site in the IE address bar, even within a valid SSL session with the impersonated site.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: URL spoofing in the address bar.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could convince a user that the attacker's website is actually a different, trusted one, potentially leading the user to provide sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious website could manipulate the displayed URL in the browser's address bar to impersonate a trusted website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to convince the user to visit their website. This might require DNS poisoning or other similar techniques to redirect the user to the attacker's site.
