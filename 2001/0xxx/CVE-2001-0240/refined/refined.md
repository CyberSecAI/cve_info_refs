- **Root cause of vulnerability:** When opening a Rich Text Format (RTF) document linked to a Word template, Microsoft Word fails to check the template for embedded macros. This bypasses the standard macro security check.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary vulnerability is the inadequate macro checking in Microsoft Word when handling RTF files linked to templates, leading to a bypass of the security model.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can craft a malicious RTF document that, upon opening, executes a macro from a linked template without the user's knowledge or consent. This allows for arbitrary code execution, potentially leading to data modification, system compromise, or changes to security settings. The macro has the same privileges as the user.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can deliver the malicious RTF file via various means, such as hosting it on a web server, placing it on a network share, sending it via email, or using removable media. The RTF file can link to a template hosted remotely, further facilitating the attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to create an RTF file linked to a template containing a macro and to deliver the RTF file to the target user.
