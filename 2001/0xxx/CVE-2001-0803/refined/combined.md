## Common Desktop Environment (CDE) Subprocess Control Service dtspcd contains buffer overflow

#### Vulnerability Note VU#172583

Original Release Date: 2001-11-12 | Last Revised: 2003-08-11

---

### Overview

A remotely exploitable buffer overflow exists in the Common Desktop Environment (CDE) Subprocess Control Service (dtspcd). An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability can execute arbitrary code as root.

### Description

| Internet Security Systems (ISS) [X-Force](http://xforce.iss.net/) has reported a remotely exploitable buffer overflow in the Common Desktop Environment (CDE) Subprocess Control Service (dtspcd). CDE is an integrated graphical user interface that runs on Unix and Linux operating systems. dtspcd is a network daemon that accepts requests from clients to execute commands and launch applications remotely. On systems running CDE, dtspcd is spawned by the Internet services daemon (typically inetd or xinetd) in response to a CDE client request. dtspcd is typically configured to run on port 6112/tcp with root privileges. dtspcd makes a function call to a shared library, libDTSvc.so.1, that contains a buffer overflow condition in the client connection routine. The buffer overflow can be exploited by a specially crafted CDE client request. Although the buffer overflow occurs in a shared library, the CERT/CC is not aware of any other CDE applications that use the vulnerable function. |

### Impact

| A successful attacker can execute arbitrary code remotely with root privileges. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply Patch**  Apply the appropriate vendor supplied patch as described in the vendor section below. |
| --- |

| **Disable Vulnerable Service**Until a patch can be applied, you may wish to consider disabling dtspcd. Typically, this may be achieved by commenting out the approprate entry in /etc/inetd.conf. As a general practice, CERT/CC recommends disabling any services that are not explicitly required. It is important to carefully consider the consequences of disabling dtspcd in your environment./etc/inetd.confdtspc stream tcp nowait root /usr/dt/bin/dtspcd /usr/dt/bin/dtspcd**Block or Restrict Access**Monitor or block external access to 6112/tcp. It may be possible to use TCP Wrapper or a similar technology to provide improved access control and logging. Additionally, an application-level firewall may be able to filter requests made to dtspcd. |

UPDATE: (SSRTM541)Tru64 UNIX CDE, NFS and NIS related Potential
         Security Vulnerabilities

Posted at <http://ftp.support.compaq.com/patches/.new/security.shtml>

NOTICE: There are no restrictions for distribution of this Bulletin
provided that it remains complete and intact.

RELEASE DATE: 17 April, 2002 (SSRT-541)
LAST UPDATED: 22 May, 2002   (SSRTM541) New Patches

SEVERITY:  1

SOURCE:  Compaq Computer Corporation
         Compaq Services
         Software Security Response Team

REFERENCE:  [security bulletin posted 17 April, 2002]
            (SSRT-541) Tru64 UNIX CDE, NFS and NIS related Potential
            Security Vulnerabilities

PROBLEM SUMMARY:
A number of potential security vulnerabilities in Tru64 UNIX V4.0F,
V4.0G, V5.0A, V5.1 and V5.1A, have recently been reported for CDE,
libc, and NFS where, under certain circumstances, system integrity
may be compromised by a malicious user.

 o CDE (severity high)
   o dtaction potential buffer overflow (SSRT0752U)
   o ttsession potential buffer overflow (SSRT0753U)
   o dtprintinfo potential buffer overflow (SSRT0757U, SSRT0788U)
   o dtspcd potential buffer overflow. (SSRT0782U)
     NOTE: cross-reference : (CVE CVE-2001-0803,CERT CA-2001-31,
     CA-2002-01)
     Compaq has not been able to reproduce the problem identified
     in the CERT advisory for any Compaq OS. However with the
     information available, we are including a code change for
     dtspcd that will further reduce any potential buffer overflow
     vulnerability.
       o Buffer overflow attacks are commonly used to attempt to
         subvert the function of a privileged program and
         possibly execute commands at the elevated privileges if
         the program file has the setuid privilege.

 o Environment Variable LANG and LOCPATH (severity high)
   o libc (SSRT0771U)
       A libc environment variable corruption with LANG and
       LOCPATH , may cause a potential buffer overflow

 o NIS Network Information Service (severity moderate)
    o ypbind may core during nmap portscan (SSRT0781U)
       o Core: A file that is a copy of the contents of a
          processes memory, that can be produced when that
          process is aborted by certain kinds of internal error.

 o NFS Network File System (severity moderate)
    o NFS Potential packet flood denial of service (DoS) (SSRT1-26)
       NOTE: Applies to V4.0g PK3 (BL17) & V5.0a PK3 (BL17) only
       A remote user with malicious intent may cause a potential
       denial of service (DoS) with portmap server.

       o Network DoS attacks make computer systems inaccessible
         by flooding a service, server or network with useless
         traffic.

VERSIONS IMPACTED:

 TRU64 UNIX Versions Impacted

 V5.1A PK1 (BL1)
 V5.1  PK4 (BL18)
 V5.0A PK3 (BL17)
 V4.0F PK7 (BL18)
 V4.0G PK3 (BL17)

RESOLUTION:

The potential vulnerabilities noted below have been corrected and
newly released patches are now available for TRU64 UNIX.

Compaq strongly recommends that systems be updated to at least the
prerequisite version of TRU64 UNIX and PK release, then install the
previously released security patches identified in the security
bulletin
<http://ftp.support.compaq.com/patches/.new/html/SSRT0742U-59U.shtml>
prior to installing the following ERP (Early Release Patch).

 UPDATE: 5/22/2002  Updated ERPs are now available for all supported
 versions of Tru64 UNIX and will be available in the next aggregate
 patch kits for each supported product version.  Until these Tru64
 UNIX fixes are available in mainstream patch kits, Compaq recommends
 use of the following ERP kits:

  NOTE:  Please review the README file(s) for each patch prior to
         installation.

  The Early Release Patch kits use dupatch to install and will not
  install over any installed Customer-Specific-Patches (CSPs) which
  have file intersections with the ERPs.  Contact your normal support
  channel for assistance if the installation of the ERPs are blocked
  by any of your installed CSPs.

1.  Bulletins Topics

    Sun announces the release of patches for Solaris(tm) 8, 7, 2.6,
    and 2.5.1 (SunOS(tm) 5.8, 5.7, 5.6, and 5.5.1) which relate to a
    buffer overflow in dtspcd.

    Sun recommends that you install the patches listed in section 4
    immediately on systems running the CDE Subprocess control service,
    dtspcd, on SunOS 5.8, 5.7, 5.6, and 5.5.1.

2.  Who is Affected

    Vulnerable:SunOS 5.8, 5.8\_x86, 5.7, 5.7\_x86, 5.6,
               5.6\_x86, 5.5.1, and 5.5.1\_x86

3.  Understanding the Vulnerability

    The CDE Subprocess Control Service (dtspcd) daemon accepts requests
    from CDE clients to execute commands and launch applications on the
    local system running the dtspcd daemon.  The dtspcd daemon is spawned
    by the inetd daemon (see inetd(1M)) in response to a CDE client
    request. dtspcd is normally configured to run on port 6112/tcp with
    root privileges.

    A buffer overflow has been discovered in dtspcd which may be
    exploited by a local or a remote attacker to gain root access on the
    affected system.  Any system that does not run the CDE Subprocess
    Control service, dtspcd, is not vulnerable to this problem.  This
    issue was discovered by ISS X-Force who published an advisory at:

    <http://xforce.iss.net/alerts/advise101.php>

    CERT Advisory CA-2001-31 is available from:

    <http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2001-31.html>

## History

The CERT Division is the birthplace of cybersecurity. For nearly 30 years, the CERT Division of the SEI has partnered with government, industry, law enforcement, and academia to advance cybersecurity and improve the security and resilience of computer systems and networks.

Originally focused on incident response, we have expanded into cybersecurity areas such as network situational awareness, malicious code analysis, secure coding, resilience management, insider threats, digital investigations and intelligence, workforce development, DevOps, forensics, software assurance, vulnerability discovery and analysis, and risk management.

## Former Director Richard Pethia

[Richard Pethia](/about/leadership/display.cfm?customel_datapageid_2623=3545) was founding director of the SEI's CERT Division. Pethia, who served as director of CERT from 1988 to 2016, guided the organization through tremendous growth and change. Under Pethia's leadership, the unit expanded and evolved from the CERT Coordination Center—a small group focused on computer incident response—to a research organization of more than 200 professionals dedicated to solving problems with widespread cybersecurity implications.

## History

The CERT Division is the birthplace of cybersecurity. For nearly 30 years, the CERT Division of the SEI has partnered with government, industry, law enforcement, and academia to advance cybersecurity and improve the security and resilience of computer systems and networks.

Originally focused on incident response, we have expanded into cybersecurity areas such as network situational awareness, malicious code analysis, secure coding, resilience management, insider threats, digital investigations and intelligence, workforce development, DevOps, forensics, software assurance, vulnerability discovery and analysis, and risk management.

## Former Director Richard Pethia

[Richard Pethia](/about/leadership/display.cfm?customel_datapageid_2623=3545) was founding director of the SEI's CERT Division. Pethia, who served as director of CERT from 1988 to 2016, guided the organization through tremendous growth and change. Under Pethia's leadership, the unit expanded and evolved from the CERT Coordination Center—a small group focused on computer incident response—to a research organization of more than 200 professionals dedicated to solving problems with widespread cybersecurity implications.
