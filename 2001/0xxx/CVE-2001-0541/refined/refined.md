- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An unchecked buffer exists in the functionality used to process Windows Media Station (.NSC) files in Windows Media Player.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Buffer overflow vulnerability in the processing of .NSC files.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine with the privileges of the user running Windows Media Player. This could include adding, creating, or deleting files, communicating with websites, or even reformatting the hard drive.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Sending a specially crafted .NSC file to a user via email, enticing them to open or preview it.
    - Hosting a malicious .NSC file on a website, causing it to launch automatically when a user visits the site.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Ability to craft a malformed .NSC file that exploits the buffer overflow.
    - Ability to send the file to a victim or host it on a website.
    - Knowledge of the victim's operating system to tailor the attack.
