Windows 2000 IIS 5.0 Remote buffer overflow vulnerability (Remote SYSTEM
Level Access)

Release Date:
May 01, 2001

Severity:
High (Remote SYSTEM level code execution)

Systems Affected:
Microsoft Windows 2000 Internet Information Services 5.0
Microsoft Windows 2000 Internet Information Services 5.0 + Service Pack 1

Description:
A wise man once said, "When a single exploit is released, it's a good hack.
When you are the first to hack each successive version of a product run on
millions of computers all over the internet, you create a dynasty."

It seems sometimes the greatest discoveries are the ones that are the
hardest to share with the world. Its not about a lack of wanting to tell
everyone but a lack of not knowing exactly how to put it so that peoples
jaws do not drop so fast that their head snaps back as they realize just how
fragile our world is becoming as we slowly push society into the digital
world people only dreamed about years ago. A world in which everything is
being connected and little is being done to shore up the large looming gaps
that are in existance in todays networked systems.

And without further ado... eEye Digital Security Presents, "Remote SYSTEM
level Access to any default Windows 2000 IIS 5.0 web server."

The Discovery:
This bug was first discovered while Riley Hassel, of eEye Digital Security,
was updating Retina's CHAM (Common Hacking Attack Methods) techonology to
look for unknown vulnerabilities within some of the new features that
Windows 2000 IIS 5.0 provides. One of the features that was added to be
audited by CHAM was the .printer ISAPI filter extension. Once the .printer
ISAPI filter was added to the list of ISAPI's to audit, as well as various
aspects of the new Web DAV functionality within IIS, the latest Retina
development code was let loose against a test server in our lab. Within a
matter of minutes a debugger kicked in on inetinfo.exe because of a "buffer
overflow error."

The Explanation:
It turns out the latest development code of Retina was able to find a buffer
overflow within the .printer ISAPI filter (C:\WINNT\System32\msw3prt.dll)
which provides Windows 2000 with support for the Internet Printing Protocol
(IPP) which allows for the web based control of various aspects of networked
printers.

The vulnerability arises when a buffer of aprox. 420 bytes is sent within
the HTTP Host: header for a .printer ISAPI request.

Example:
GET /NULL.printer HTTP/1.0
Host: [buffer]

Where [buffer] is aprox. 420 characters.

At this point an attacker has sucessfully caused a buffer overflow within
IIS and has overwritten EIP. Now normally the web server would stop
responding once you have "buffer overflowed" it. However, Windows 2000 will
automatically restart the web server if it notices that the web server has
crashed. While the feature is nice to help create a longer period of "up
time" it is actually a feature that makes it easier for remote attacks to
execute code against Windows 2000 IIS 5.0 web servers.

As we stated earlier our overflow is able to overwrite the EIP register with
whatever we want. That basically means we can overwrite EIP with a location
in memory that jumps to our "exploit" code, in memory, and then executes our
code with SYSTEM level access.

The Exploit:
Ryan Permeh, resident shellcode ninja, of eEye Digital Security has created
an example exploit to be used as a "proof of concept." Our proof of concept
exploit will, when run against an IIS 5 web server, create a text document
on the remote server with instructions directing readers to a webpage on
eeye.com that has information on how to patch the system so that the web
server is no longer vulnerable to this flaw. This exploit is to only be
considered a proof of concept exploit and any one with Windows 2000 should
install the Microsoft supplied patch ASAP.

Check back to our website later today as we posted a link to our proof of
concept code.

We would like to note that eEye Digital Security did provide Microsoft with
a working example exploit that when ran against a web server would, in a
matter of a few seconds, bind a cmd.exe command prompt to a port on a remote
IIS 5.0 web server so that a remote attacker could then execute commands
with SYSTEM level access and therefore have full control of the vulnerable
machine.

The Log:
Actually there is no log because this vulnerability, like most IIS buffer
overflows, does not go logged. That means some of the largest web servers on
the Internet running Windows 2000 are vulnerable to this attack and when
exploited, there will be no IIS log anywhere that records the attack.

The Fallout:
As with our first remote SYSTEM level exploit for IIS 4.0 2 years ago, the
fallout from this second IIS remote overflow is also rather large. Once
again it does not matter what kind of security systems you have in place,
Firewalls, IDS's, etc.. because all of those systems can be bypassed and
your web server CAN be broken into via this vulnerability. To quote our last
advisory "Even a server that's locked in a guarded room behind a Cisco Pix
can be broken into with this hole. This is a reminder to all software
vendors that testing for common security holes in your software is a must.
Demand more from your software vendors." There are millions of Windows 2000
web servers on the Internet right now that are wide open to this
vulnerability.

The Magic:
About two weeks ago eEye Digital Security released, SecureIIS which stops
both known and unknown IIS web server vulnerabilities. Our SecureIIS code
base from about 4 weeks ago actually stopped this latest IIS 5.0 buffer
overflow vulnerability without actually knowing anything about it. It is
this power to stop both known and unknown vulnerabilities that sets
SecureIIS apart from every other security product in the market. Visit
<http://www.eeye.com/SecureIIS> to learn more about this ground breaking
product.

Vendor Status:
We would like to thank Microsoft for working hard with us to create a patch
for this vulnerability.
You can download the Microsoft supplied patch from:
<http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms01-023.asp>
Also eEye Digital Security recommends removing the .printer ISAPI filter
from your web server if it does not provide your web server with any
_needed_ functionality.

# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS01-023 - Critical

## Unchecked Buffer in ISAPI Extension Could Enable Compromise of IIS 5.0 Server

Published: May 01, 2001 | Updated: June 23, 2003

**Version:** 1.4

**Originally posted:** May 01, 2001

**Updated:** June 23, 2003

Summary

**Who should read this bulletin:**

All web server administrators using MicrosoftÂ® WindowsÂ® 2000

**Impact of vulnerability:**

Run code of attacker's choice in system context.

**Recommendation:**

Microsoft strongly urges all IIS 5.0 server administrators to install the patch immediately.

**Affected Software:**

* Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional
* Microsoft Windows 2000 Server
* Microsoft Windows 2000 Advanced Server
* Microsoft Windows 2000 Datacenter Server

**Note:** The vulnerability is only exposed if IIS 5.0 is running.

General Information

## Technical details

**Technical description:**

Windows 2000 introduced native support for the Internet Printing Protocol (IPP), an industry-standard protocol for submitting and controlling print jobs over HTTP. The protocol is implemented in Windows 2000 via an ISAPI extension that is installed by default as part of Windows 2000 but which can only be accessed via IIS 5.0.

A security vulnerability results because the ISAPI extension contains an unchecked buffer in a section of code that handles input parameters. This could enable a remote attacker to conduct a buffer overrun attack and cause code of her choice to run on the server. Such code would run in the Local System security context. This would give the attacker complete control of the server, and would enable her to take virtually any action she chose.

The attacker could exploit the vulnerability against any server with which she could conduct a web session. No other services would need to be available, and only port 80 (HTTP) or 443 (HTTPS) would need to be open. Clearly, this is a very serious vulnerability, and Microsoft strongly recommends that all IIS 5.0 administrators install the patch immediately.

Customers who cannot install the patch can protect their systems by disabling Internet Printing. Although this can in theory be done by unmapping the Internet Printing ISAPI extension in the Internet Services Manager, it is important to understand that Group Policy overrides the settings made in the Internet Services Manager. As the FAQ discusses in more detail, the preferred way to disable Internet Printing is via Group Policy.

**Mitigating factors:**

* Servers on which the mapping for the Internet Printing ISAPI extension has been removed are not at risk from this vulnerability. The process for removing the mapping is discussed in the [IIS 5.0 Security Checklist](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windows2000serv/technologies/iis/tips/iis5chk.mspx). The High Security template provided in the checklist removes the mapping, as does the [Windows 2000 Internet Security Tool](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/tools/default.mspx) unless the user explicitly chose to retain Internet Printing.
* The attacker's ability to extend her control from a compromised web server to other machines would be heavily dependent on the specific configuration of the network. Best practices recommend that the network architecture reflect the position of special risk occupied by network-edge machines like web servers and use measures like DMZs and limited domain memberships to isolate such machines from the rest of the network. Taking such measures would impede an attacker's ability to broaden the scope of the compromise.

**Vulnerability identifier:** [CAN-2001-0241](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=can-2001-0241)

**Tested Versions:**

Microsoft tested Windows 2000 to assess whether it is affected by this vulnerability. The feature at issue in this vulnerability was not present in any previous version of Windows, or in any version of Windows NTÂ®.

## Frequently asked questions

**What's the scope of this vulnerability?**

This is a [buffer overrun](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/glossary) vulnerability. While buffer overrun vulnerabilities typically are serious, this one poses an even greater threat than usual, for two reasons:

* Under default conditions, it could be exploited by an attacker on the Internet.
* It could enable an attacker to gain complete control over an affected web server. This would enable her to take any desired action, including installing and running programs; reconfiguring the server; adding, changing or deleting files and web pages; or taking other actions.

This is an extremely serious vulnerability, and Microsoft recommends that all IIS 5.0 web server administrators apply the patch immediately. IIS 4.0 servers are not affected by the vulnerability.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability results because the Internet Printing ISAPI extension in Windows 2000 contains an unchecked buffer. By sending a specially constructed request to the extension, an attacker could cause code to run in the Local System context.

**What's an ISAPI extension?**

ISAPI (Internet Services Application Programming Interface) is a technology that enables web developers to extend the functionality of their web servers by writing custom code that provides new services for a web server. The custom code can either be implemented in an ISAPI filter, if the new functionality provides a low-level service, or an ISAPI extension, if the new functionality provides a high-level service. In this case, the affected code is an ISAPI extension.

**What's the ISAPI extension at issue here?**

The affected ISAPI extension is one that implements the Internet Printing Protocol (IPP), an industry standard defined in RFCs [2910](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2910.txt?number=2910) and [2911](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2911.txt?number=2911). IPP provides a way to request printing services and learn the status of print jobs across the Internet via HTTP. For instance, using IPP, a traveling user could send a print job across the Internet, to be printed on a printer on his corporate network. He also could find out whether the print request had completed without error.

Windows 2000 introduces native support for [Internet Printing](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windows2000serv/default.mspx?url=/windows2000/en/server/help/sag_printconcepts_internet_printing.htm). The Windows 2000 implementation enables users to print directly to an URL, and to view information about print jobs via their browsers. Support for Internet Printing is enabled by default in Windows 2000.

**What's wrong with the Internet Printing ISAPI extension in Windows 2000?**

The extension has an unchecked buffer in a part of the code that processes users' print requests. If a specially malformed print request were sent to it, a buffer overrun would result.

**What's a buffer overrun?**

Let's start by discussing what a buffer is. A buffer is an area of memory within a program that's used to store data of some kind - for instance, information on the program's status, intermediate computational results, or input parameters. Before placing any data into a buffer, the program should always verify that the buffer is large enough to accommodate all of the data. Otherwise, the data can overrun the buffer and overwrite neighboring data, having the effect of modifying the program while it's running.

If the data that overruns the buffer is random data, it won't be valid program code, and the program will fail when it tries to execute the random data. On the other hand, if the data is valid program code, the program will execute the new code and perform some new function - one chosen by whoever supplied the data.

**How could an attacker exploit this vulnerability?**

By sending a specially malformed Internet Printing request to an affected web server, an attacker could exploit the buffer overrun and change the functionality of the Internet Printing ISAPI extension. This would enable her to take any desired action on the server.

**How serious is this vulnerability?**

This is an extremely serious vulnerability, and we **strongly** encourage all users to immediately apply the patch. An attacker could use this vulnerability to gain complete control of an affected web server. Worse, the vulnerability could be exploited from the Internet in most cases.
For instance, in working with Microsoft on this issue, eEye Digital Security, the company that discovered the vulnerability, demonstrated a scenario in which it could be used to open a command prompt on an affected web server. Through such a scenario, an attacker on the Internet could execute any desired command on the server.

**Why does the vulnerability allow the attacker to gain such high privileges?**

The Internet Printing ISAPI extension runs in the security context of the Local System - the operating system itself. Because the attacker's code would, for all practical purposes, be part of the Internet Printing ISAPI extension, it would run in the same context.

**What would gaining Local System privileges on the web server enable the attacker to do?**

It would give the attacker complete control of the server. She could load and execute any program she chose on the machine; add, change or delete any data on it, including web pages; execute system commands on it; reconfigure it; add new users or delete existing ones; reformat the hard drive; or take any other action she chose.

**Would a firewall prevent the attacker from exploiting the vulnerability?**

It's very important to fully understand the protection that a firewall could - and could not - provide. Internet Printing operates over HTTP or HTTPS, as part of a web session. As a result, if an attacker could start a web session with an affected server, she could exploit the vulnerability. The key question with regard to a firewall is whether it would prevent a web session or not.

If a firewall were configured to block HTTP and HTTPS requests, an Internet-based attacker could not exploit the vulnerability on a server behind it, because she would be unable to start a web session. On the other hand, if the firewall allowed web sessions, the servers behind it would be vulnerable - even if the firewall blocked all other ports and services.

**Could an attacker use this vulnerability to compromise an entire domain?**

Best practices would help limit the scope of the compromise. Because of their exposed position, web servers - especially public ones - are always special targets for attack, and the network design should reflect this fact. Indeed, one of the network architect's principal objectives should be to ensure that the network design limits what could be done using a compromised web server. Two practices in particular that should be followed are:

* Web servers should be isolated within a DMZ. This not only separates the servers from the Internet, but also separates them from the rest of the network.
* If possible, web servers should be configured as stand-alone machines. If it's absolutely necessary to make them part of a domain, the domain should only encompass machines that reside on the DMZ. Web servers should never be members of the larger network's domain.

Even if these precautions have been followed, however, it is important not to underestimate the damage that could be done via this vulnerability. Even if the network design denied the attacker an easy means of using normal system operations to extend her control, she could nevertheless use the compromised server as a launching point from which she could try to attack additional machines via other known vulnerabilities.

**You said that buffer overruns can also be used to cause the affected software to fail. Is that the case here as well?**

If the attacker chose not to provide a printing request that would cause code to run as part of the ISAPI extension, she might instead provide a request that overran the buffer with random data. However, this couldn't be used to conduct an effective [denial of service](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/glossary) attack, as the IIS 5.0 service automatically restarts itself after a failure.

**Is the Internet Printing ISAPI extension part of Window 2000 or part of IIS 5.0?**

It's a component of Windows 2000, and installs by default. However, because requests to it can only be levied via HTTP or HTTPS, the vulnerability can only be exploited if IIS 5.0 were enabled.

**I used the IIS 5.0 Security Checklist when I deployed my server, and I followed its recommendation to remove all unneeded ISAPI mappings. Am I vulnerable?**

If the mapping for the Internet Printing ISAPI extension has been removed, internet printing requests cannot be levied, and the vulnerability cannot be exploited. As a result, if you followed the [checklist's](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windows2000serv/technologies/iis/tips/iis5chk.mspx) recommendations and removed the mapping for the Internet Printing ISAPI, you are not affected by this vulnerability.

**I used the Security Template provided in the IIS 5.0 Security Checklist. Am I vulnerable?**

The security template (hisecweb.inf) provided in the [checklist](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windows2000serv/technologies/iis/tips/iis5chk.mspx) removes the mapping for the Internet Printing ISAPI extension, so if you applied it you are not affected by the vulnerability.

**I used the Windows 2000 Internet Server Security tool to configure my web server. Would that help protect me against the vulnerability?**

Yes. The tool includes a questionnaire regarding the services you need to provide via the web server. Unless you specifically indicated that you wanted to retain Internet Printing, the [tool](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/tools/default.mspx) disables the mapping for the Internet Printing ISAPI extension.

**Does this vulnerability affect IIS 4.0 web servers?**

No. Support for internet printing was introduced in Windows 2000. It isn't present in Windows NT 4.0, so the vulnerability doesn't affect IIS 4.0 servers.

**What does the patch do?**

The patch eliminates the vulnerability by instituting proper input checking in the ISAPI extension.

**I don't want to install the patch. Is there any other way to protect my web server?**

The best way to protect your web server is to install the patch. However, if you can't do this for some reason, you also can protect your server by disabling Internet Printing. As discussed in the [IIS 5.0 security checklist](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windows2000serv/technologies/iis/tips/iis5chk.mspx), the procedure for doing this is:

1. Launch the Microsoft Management Console and load the snap-in for Group Policy.
2. Select Computer Configuration, then Administrative Templates, then Printers.
3. Check the setting for Web-based Printing, and ensure that it is set to disabled.

   **Note:** If the server is part of a domain, ensure that Web-based Printing also is disabled in the domain group policy.

**You used to recommend that Internet Printing be disabled by unmapping the Internet Printing ISAPI extension in the Internet Services Manager. Why have you changed your recommendation?**

We've changed our recommendation for two reasons:

* Group policy can override the settings in the Internet Services Manager, so disabling Internet Printing via group policy provides greater certainty.
* Disabling Internet Printing via the Internet Services Manager can interfere with the operation of Outlook Web Access. Specifically, when you unmap the Internet Printing ISAPI extension via the Internet Services Manager on an Exchange 2000 server, you're prompted whether or not to apply the changes to the child folders, including Exchange, Public, and ExAdmin. If you choose to apply the setting to these child folders, Outlook Web Access will stop functioning until you restart the Exchange System Attendant.

**I'm not sure whether Internet Printing is enabled on my system. Can I send a print request to the server and use the results to determine whether it's enabled?**

No. The response you'll receive from the server depends on many factors, and as a result sending a print request to a server is not a reliable way to tell whether Internet Printing is enabled. The only way to reliably determine whether it's enabled is to log onto the server and check the group policy settings. (See the previous Q&A; for specific instructions).

## History

The CERT Division is the birthplace of cybersecurity. For nearly 30 years, the CERT Division of the SEI has partnered with government, industry, law enforcement, and academia to advance cybersecurity and improve the security and resilience of computer systems and networks.

Originally focused on incident response, we have expanded into cybersecurity areas such as network situational awareness, malicious code analysis, secure coding, resilience management, insider threats, digital investigations and intelligence, workforce development, DevOps, forensics, software assurance, vulnerability discovery and analysis, and risk management.

## Former Director Richard Pethia

[Richard Pethia](/about/leadership/display.cfm?customel_datapageid_2623=3545) was founding director of the SEI's CERT Division. Pethia, who served as director of CERT from 1988 to 2016, guided the organization through tremendous growth and change. Under Pethia's leadership, the unit expanded and evolved from the CERT Coordination Center—a small group focused on computer incident response—to a research organization of more than 200 professionals dedicated to solving problems with widespread cybersecurity implications.
