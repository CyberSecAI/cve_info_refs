The content is related to CVE-2001-0513.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Oracle Database Server on Windows NT creates a new thread listening on a new port when a connection request is made. This thread remains in memory until the client connects to the new port or the server restarts. If the client does not connect to the redirected port, the thread remains in memory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Resource exhaustion: The server does not properly clean up threads when connection attempts are not completed, leading to memory consumption.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): An attacker can send multiple connection requests without completing the connection, leading to memory exhaustion. Once all memory is consumed, the next console login attempt will crash the server.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending multiple connection requests to the Oracle Database Server without completing the connection to the redirected port.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network connection requests to the vulnerable Oracle Database Server.
