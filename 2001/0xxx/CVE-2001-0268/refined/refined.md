{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `i386_set_ldt` syscall in BSD operating systems does not properly validate call gate targets, specifically when accessing local descriptor tables (LDTs). It fails to check if a ring transition to a more privileged segment in the LDT is appropriate.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper privilege checking when accessing local descriptor tables (LDTs)",
      "Insufficient validation of call gate target's DPL (Descriptor Privilege Level)"
    ],
    "impact": "A local user can potentially gain kernel-level privileges.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access to an account",
       "Exploitation of the `i386_set_ldt` syscall"
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": [
      "Local access to a user account."
    ],
    "additional_notes": "The vulnerability is not restricted to Intel processors; it applies to other x86 architecture implementations. The `USER_LDT` kernel option is not enabled by default in OpenBSD, and is only suggested for users running the WINE port."
