Original Release Date: 2001-05-04 | Last Revised: 2001-05-04

---

### Overview

A buffer overflow in the mailx program on Solaris systems can allow an intruder to execute code with the privileges of the mail group.

### Description

| A buffer overflow in the -F option of the mailx program on Solaris systems may allow an intruder to execute code with the privileges of the group of the owner of the file (i.e. mailx is setgid mail). An exploit is publicly available that reportedly works against Solaris on Intel systems. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A local intruder can execute code with the privileges of the mail group. |
| --- |

### Solution
