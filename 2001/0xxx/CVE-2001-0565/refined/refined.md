- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A buffer overflow exists in the `-F` option of the `mailx` program on Solaris systems.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Buffer overflow vulnerability in the handling of the `-F` option within the `mailx` program.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local attacker can execute code with the privileges of the mail group (due to `mailx` being setgid mail).
- **Attack vectors:** Local exploitation of the `mailx` program. Specifically, by providing a crafted input through the `-F` option.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A local user with the ability to execute the `mailx` program.
