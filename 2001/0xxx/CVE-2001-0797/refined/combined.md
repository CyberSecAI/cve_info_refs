## Former Director Richard Pethia

[Richard Pethia](/about/leadership/display.cfm?customel_datapageid_2623=3545) was founding director of the SEI's CERT Division. Pethia, who served as director of CERT from 1988 to 2016, guided the organization through tremendous growth and change. Under Pethia's leadership, the unit expanded and evolved from the CERT Coordination Center—a small group focused on computer incident response—to a research organization of more than 200 professionals dedicated to solving problems with widespread cybersecurity implications.

## System V derived login contains a remotely exploitable buffer overflow

#### Vulnerability Note VU#569272

Original Release Date: 2001-12-12 | Last Revised: 2002-04-11

---

### Overview

A remotely exploitable buffer overflow exists in implementations of *login*, derived from System V. An attacker can use this vulnerability to gain the privileges of the process that invoked *login*, user root in the cases of in.telnetd, or in.rlogind. We have been able to determine that several vendors are affected.

### Description

| Implementations of *login*, derived from System V, use a fixed-size buffer to store environment and argument variables that are received from other programs. This buffer can be overflowed by inputing numerous variables. An attacker can use this vulnerability to gain the privileges of the process that invoked *login*. If an attacker with a local shell invokes *login* directly, they can only gain the privileges of the shell they already have. However, if the attacker can invoke login via a suid root program, such as the in.telnetd or in.rlogind daemons, they can gain the privileges of the invoking suid program, typically root. And of course, because in.telnetd and in.rlogind are available over the network, an attacker without any previous access to the system could use this vulnerability to gain root access directly.  An exploit exists and may be circulating. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote intruder can gain a root shell. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Apply a patch when one becomes available. If patches are not available for your version, upgrade to a supported version and apply all patches. |
| --- |

| Disable telnet, rlogin, and other programs that use *login* for authentication. Use programs that use SSH instead and do not use *login* by default. |

### [IBM](#JARL-53UKAX) Affected

Notified:  October 24, 2001  Updated: December 21, 2001

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

IBM's AIX operating system, versions 4.3 and 5.1, are susceptible to this vulnerability. We have prepared an emergency fix ("efix"), "tsmlogin\_efix.tar.Z", and it is available for downloading from:

ftp://aix.software.ibm.com/aix/efixes/security

The APAR assignment for AIX 5.1 is IY26221. The APAR for AIX 4.3 is IY26443. Both will be available soon. The "README" file at the above FTP site will be updated to provide the official fix information and availability.

Update: Incomplete installation instructions were included in the first posting of the efix on Wednesday, 12 December 2001. The installation instructions were rewritten and tarballed with the efixes. The efix tarball was then reposted to the FTP download site on the afternoon of Thursday, 13 December. An amended advisory reflecting the correct instructions has also been issued. Customers may wish to consult the amended advisory, or download the most recent efix, to obtain the new instructions.

IBM is developing an emergency fix for AIX 4.2.1 at Maintenance Level 06 (the last ML done). Also, we are developing efixes for AIX 4.3.3 at maintenance levels 06 and 08.

1. Bulletins Topics

 Sun announces the release of patches for Solaris(tm) 8, 7, 2.6,
 and 2.5.1 (SunOS(tm) 5.8, 5.7, 5.6, and 5.5.1) which
 relate to a buffer overflow vulnerability in /bin/login.

 Sun recommends that you install the patches listed in section 4
 immediately on systems running SunOS 5.8, 5.7, 5.6, and 5.5.1.

2. Who is Affected

 Vulnerable: SunOS 5.8, 5.8\_x86, 5.7, 5.7\_x86, 5.6,
 5.6\_x86, 5.5.1, and 5.5.1\_x86

3. Understanding the Vulnerability

 The login command is used at the beginning of each terminal
 session to identify oneself to the system. login is invoked
 by the system when a connection is first established, after
 the previous user has terminated the login shell by issuing
 the exit command.

 A buffer overflow has been discovered in login which may be
 exploited by a local or a remote attacker to gain root access
 on the affected system. This issue was discovered by ISS
 X-Force who published an advisory at:

<http://xforce.iss.net/alerts/advise105.php>

 CERT Advisory CA-2001-34 is available from:

<http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2001-34.html>

4. List of Patches

 A Sun Security Bulletin is usually issued after patches are
 available on SunSolve. In this case, while the patches are
 not yet available, they are in the process of being pushed
 to external servers and should be downloadable in a very
 short time.

I got several replies which I'd like to summarize, as not all were cc'd
to the list.

1) The best solution, Sun has released patches today for this bug.  Frank
Pellegrino replied with the most complete list:

  111085-02 SunOS 5.8: /usr/bin/login patch
  111086-02 SunOS 5.8_x86: /usr/bin/login patch
  112300-01 SunOS 5.7:: usr/bin/login Patch
  112301-01 SunOS 5.7_x86:: usr/bin/login Patch
  105665-04 SunOS 5.6: /usr/bin/login patch
  105666-04 SunOS 5.6_x86: /usr/bin/login patch
  106160-02 SunOS 5.5.1: /usr/bin/login patch

(There doesn't appear to be a 5.5.1_x86 patch.)

Patches are available by ftp from ftp://sunsolve1.sun.com/pub/patches/

Several others replied along the same lines, but Frank's reply was most
complete.

2) Reg Quinton has written a wrapper to login which he believes will
block an exploit: <http://ist.uwaterloo.ca/~reggers/drafts/login.wrapper>

3) Several people replied that I should only use ssh, even though I said
this wasn't an option.  Also ssh versions have had numerous security
patches in the last year, so it's not clear how much better ssh is
overall.  (Mark Addy did include something interesting though, his site
uses a web-based ssh tool: <http://tiger.towson.edu/ssh>)

4) Ben Tetu-Pappas pointed out that some versions of ssh may still use
login, depending on the way it is compiled or configured, so turning off
telnet and rlogin might not even solve the problem.  So even if you only
run ssh, you should probably install the above patches anyways.

5) Several people suggested using tcp wrappers.  Some seemed to imply that
this alone would solve the problem, which I don't believe is true.  Others
suggested using this to limit exposure by only allowing in certain hosts.
I already use tcp wrappers, but am unable to restrict access to a certain
hosts or addresses.

6) Support <support@cyberramp.net> sent me a copy of the badtrans virus
in reply.  I would have thought people on this list would be smart enough
to at least run anti-virus software on their peecees.

Thanks for all the help!
