Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2001-0797

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a buffer overflow in the `login` program, specifically in System V-derived implementations. This program uses a fixed-size buffer to store environment and argument variables passed to it from other programs. Inputting a large number of variables can overflow this buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The core issue is the lack of proper bounds checking when processing environment and argument variables, allowing an attacker to write past the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can gain the privileges of the process that invoked `login`.
    - If `login` is invoked by a setuid root program like `in.telnetd` or `in.rlogind`, the attacker can gain root privileges, potentially leading to full system compromise.
    - This can be done remotely via the network if the vulnerable login is used by telnet or rlogin.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote:** Exploiting `login` through network services like `in.telnetd` and `in.rlogind` allows remote attackers to gain root access without prior access to the system.
- **Local:** While a local attacker with a shell can also exploit this, they only gain the privileges of their existing shell. This attack vector is only relevant if the attacker can invoke login via a setuid root program, such as the daemons mentioned above

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access (Remote):** For remote exploitation, the attacker needs network access to a service using the vulnerable `login` program (e.g., telnet or rlogin).
- **Local Access (Local):** For local exploitation, an attacker needs a shell on the vulnerable system and the ability to invoke login via a setuid program.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in multiple vendorsâ€™ implementations derived from System V, including Cisco, HP, IBM, SCO, SGI, and Sun.
- Patches and workarounds were made available by affected vendors after the vulnerability was disclosed.
- Some vendors (Apple, BSDI, Caldera, Compaq, Cray, MandrakeSoft, NetBSD, Red Hat) were found to be not vulnerable as they didn't use the affected System V derived implementation of `login`.
- The CERT advisory for this vulnerability is CA-2001-34.
- An exploit was known to exist and potentially circulating during the time of disclosure.
