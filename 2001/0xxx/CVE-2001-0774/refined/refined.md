- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Tripwire opens temporary files in `/tmp` with predictable names without checking for prior existence or ownership.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure temporary file creation, predictable file names, lack of ownership checks, and usage of a publicly writable directory (`/tmp`).
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local attacker can overwrite arbitrary files by creating symbolic links with the same name as the temporary files within a tight time window. This can lead to disabling system services, crashing the machine, or disabling system protections due to Tripwire's elevated privileges.
- **Attack vectors:** A local attacker with the ability to create symlinks in `/tmp`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Local access to create symbolic links within `/tmp` and the ability to execute commands within a small time window.
