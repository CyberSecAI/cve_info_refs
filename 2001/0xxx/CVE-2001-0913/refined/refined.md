The provided content relates to CVE-2001-0913.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `rwhoisd` daemon uses a user-supplied format string as input to the `syslog()` function when the `use-syslog` option is enabled in the configuration file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Format string vulnerability in the `log()` function, which utilizes `syslog()`.
- Unsanitized user input is directly passed to the `syslog()` function as a format string.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can overwrite arbitrary memory locations through the format string vulnerability.
- This could lead to arbitrary code execution on the affected host.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote exploitation via network connection to the `rwhoisd` service, usually on port 4321.
- Sending specially crafted input containing format string specifiers to the server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to connect to the `rwhoisd` service.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges to send the crafted input.
- The `use-syslog` option must be enabled in `rwhoisd.conf` for the vulnerability to be exploitable.
