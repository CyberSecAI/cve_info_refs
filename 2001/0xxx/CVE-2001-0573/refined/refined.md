- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `lsfs` utility in IBM AIX uses relative pathnames when executing `grep` and `lslv`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Usage of relative pathnames when invoking external programs (`grep`, `lslv`).
    - Setuid bit enabled on `lsfs` binary in default installations of some AIX versions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local attacker can execute arbitrary code with root privileges by manipulating the `PATH` environment variable to redirect the calls made by `lsfs` to malicious versions of `grep` or `lslv`.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Local user modifies the `PATH` environment variable.
    - The attacker places a malicious executable named `grep` or `lslv` in a directory that appears earlier in the modified `PATH`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker must be a local user with the ability to modify their environment variables.
    - The attacker needs to be able to write files to the file system
