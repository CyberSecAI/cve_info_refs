Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS01-047, which corresponds to CVE-2001-0660:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the implementation of the Outlook Web Access (OWA) feature in Microsoft Exchange 5.5. Specifically, the back-end function responsible for searching the Global Address List (GAL) does not perform authentication checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authentication:** The back-end function of the GAL search feature in OWA does not require authentication, even though the front-end user interface does.
- **Trust Assumption:** The back-end function assumes that all requests have been authenticated by the front-end tier. This assumption is incorrect, as attackers can bypass the UI and send requests directly to the back-end function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An unauthenticated attacker can enumerate email addresses of users listed in the GAL.
- The vulnerability does not allow the attacker to read, write, change or delete email or to gain any privileges on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct Request:** The attacker sends a specially crafted request directly to the vulnerable back-end function, bypassing the authenticated front-end UI.
- **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the Exchange server hosting the vulnerable OWA service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Exchange server hosting the vulnerable OWA component.
- The attacker does not need any prior authentication or credentials on the server.
- The attacker can be remote/internet based.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is specific to OWA in Exchange 5.5 and does not affect Exchange 2000.
- The primary risk is that the disclosed information can aid reconnaissance for other attacks.
- The vulnerability is resolved by patching the back-end function to enforce authentication.
