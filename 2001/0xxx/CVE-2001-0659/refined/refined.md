- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An unchecked buffer in the Windows 2000 IrDA driver when handling certain IrDA packets.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the IrDA device handling software.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful attack can cause an access violation, forcing the system to reboot, resulting in a denial of service. The vulnerability cannot be used to run malicious code.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a specially crafted IrDA packet to the victim's system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be within the range of the victim's IrDA device (usually within arm's length), and there must be a direct line of sight or the attacker must be able to reflect the IrDA packets directly to the victim's IrDA port. The attacker also requires a device capable of transmitting IrDA packets.
