- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by the way Windows 2000 Terminal Services handles specific sequences of Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) data packets. The RDP implementation doesn't correctly process these malformed packets, leading to a server failure.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of specific RDP packets within the Terminal Services implementation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition on the Windows 2000 terminal server. This leads to the server crashing and requiring a reboot to restore normal service, resulting in the loss of any unsaved data.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is performed by sending a specific sequence of malformed data packets to the RDP port of the targeted server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send packets to the RDP port of the server. They do not need to establish a valid terminal session to exploit this vulnerability.
