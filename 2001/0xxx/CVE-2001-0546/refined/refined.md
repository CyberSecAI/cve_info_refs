- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A memory leak in the H.323 Gatekeeper Service.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory leak leading to denial of service.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Repeatedly sending malformed H.323 data depletes server memory, leading to performance degradation and potentially disrupting all communications across the firewall.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending malformed H.323 data to the vulnerable service.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability either internally or externally (via the internet), if the H.323 Gatekeeper Service is enabled on the ISA server.
