Regarding Peter Guendl's discovery of DoS attacks against iWS 4.1:

1) Peter G. reports that disabling the cache with cache-init is not
   an effective workaround for the FastTrack problem.

2) I wrote that iWS 4.1 has "at least one huge hole (remote code execution
   via SSL/TLS implementation bug)". Another reader has pointed out that
   the SSL/TLS problem was announced as a Denial of Service vulnerability.

3) The note about Service Pack levels for iPlanet Enterprise 4.1 in
   Peter Gruendl's "Netscape Enterprise Server Dot-Dot DoS" was somewhat
   confusing. The iPlanet URL he refers to correctly states that the
   latest supported iPlanet Web servers[[0]](#0) are 4.0sp6 and 4.1sp5. 4.1sp6
   has not been released or officially announced by iPlanet.

Thanks,

-Peter
