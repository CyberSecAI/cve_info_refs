- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The CrushFTP server does not adequately filter user input, specifically allowing directory traversal sequences like "../" in file paths.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Inadequate input validation and filtering, leading to directory traversal vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can access files outside the designated FTP root directory, potentially viewing sensitive system files.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting malicious file paths containing "../" sequences in FTP requests.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to make FTP requests to the CrushFTP server. No specific position within the network is specified.
