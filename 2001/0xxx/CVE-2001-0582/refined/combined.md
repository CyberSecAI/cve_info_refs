## CrushFTP Server does not adequately filter user input thereby permitting directory traversal

#### Vulnerability Note VU#110803

Original Release Date: 2001-12-20 | Last Revised: 2001-12-20

---

### Overview

CrushFTP allows access to files outside the FTP root directory through directory traversal.

### Description

| CrushFTP is a Java-based FTP server available for Linux, Mac OS, and Windows. CrushFTP can be configured to limit access to files under a designated FTP root directory. However, CrushFTP allows an attacker to get files outside this directory through '../' directory traversal. |
| --- |

### Impact

| CrushFTP allows an attacker to see any file in the filesystem, including potentially sensitive and critical system files. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Upgrade to version 2.1.7 or later of CrushFTP at:  <http://www.crushftp.com> |
| --- |

| Use chroot if available on your system, to limit the scope of CrushFTP's access to the filesystem. |
