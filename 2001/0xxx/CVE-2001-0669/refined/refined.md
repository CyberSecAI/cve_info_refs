Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the use of `%u` encoding, a non-standard encoding scheme employed by Microsoft's IIS web server to represent Unicode/wide character strings. Most Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) were not designed to decode this specific encoding.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Lack of `%u` Encoding Support:** IDS products generally decode standard URL encoding methods like UTF and hex encoding, but lack support for Microsoft IIS's `%u` encoding.
*   **Bypass of Pattern Matching:** Due to the lack of `%u` decoding, malicious attack strings that would typically be detected by IDS are missed if they are `%u` encoded.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **IDS Bypass:** Attackers can bypass IDS by encoding their malicious web requests using `%u` encoding.
*   **Unseen Attacks:** Malicious traffic, including reconnaissance scans and direct attacks against IIS web servers, can pass through the IDS undetected.
*   **"Stealth" Attacks:**  Exploits, such as the CodeRed worm (which targeted the .ida vulnerability), could have been delivered without detection if encoded using this method.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** The attack vector is through HTTP requests sent to vulnerable IIS servers.
*   **%u Encoding:**  Attackers encode malicious strings within the HTTP request using the `%u` encoding.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to send HTTP requests to a target IIS server.
*   **Knowledge of %u Encoding:** The attacker must be aware of the `%u` encoding scheme and how to apply it to their malicious payloads.

**Additional Details:**

*   The advisory mentions specific products that were known to be affected, including Cisco Secure Intrusion Detection System, ISS RealSecure Network/Server Sensor, Dragon Sensor, and Snort.
*   The advisory notes that NFR (Network Flight Record) was also believed to be vulnerable and that other Network based pattern matching IDS products were also likely affected.
*   The vulnerability was highlighted as a way to potentially bypass IDS systems during exploitation of IIS servers, even allowing for stealth propagation of malware
*   The vulnerability was initially identified by an exploit written by HSJ that used the encoding in the .ida buffer overflow exploit.
