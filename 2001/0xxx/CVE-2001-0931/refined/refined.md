The provided content relates to CVE-2001-0931.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The PowerFTP server allows users to traverse directories outside of their intended root directory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
1.  **Directory Traversal:** The server does not properly restrict directory traversal, allowing users to access files and directories outside their permitted scope. This includes accessing sensitive data on the C drive, CD-ROM, and floppy drives. The vulnerability can be exploited using relative paths like `../../../../` or absolute paths like `c:/`, `d:/`, `a:/`
2.  **Denial of Service (DoS):** The server is vulnerable to a DoS attack by sending an oversized command. Additionally, sending repeated `NLST a:/` commands can cause the server to hang due to the slow floppy drive.

**Impact of exploitation:**
1.  **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to sensitive files and directories on the server, including system files, user data, and files on connected drives.
2.  **Denial of Service:** Attackers can crash the server, making it unavailable to legitimate users. The floppy drive DoS attack can cause the system to hang.

**Attack vectors:**
The attacks are performed remotely using the FTP protocol.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable FTP server. No authentication is required for the DoS attacks. For the information disclosure, the attacker would require valid, or possibly default, user credentials.
