This document describes multiple vulnerabilities, one of which is related to CVE-2001-0150.

**CVE-2001-0150**

*   **Root Cause:**  The vulnerability lies in how Internet Explorer handles Telnet sessions. Specifically, it allows a web page or HTML email to launch a Telnet session with arbitrary command-line arguments. The Telnet client included with Services for Unix 2.0 has an option to create a verbatim transcript of a session.
*   **Vulnerability:**  IE allows remote invocation of Telnet with command-line arguments which, when combined with the logging feature of the Telnet client from SFU 2.0, can be exploited.
*   **Impact:** An attacker could use this vulnerability to write arbitrary files to the user's system.  By logging an executable to the system, the attacker could achieve arbitrary code execution. This could be achieved by placing a program onto the user's system that would then be made to run automatically each time the user logged on.
*   **Attack Vector:** A user visits a malicious website or opens a specially crafted HTML email. The malicious content will then attempt to launch a telnet session with specific command line arguments.
*   **Required Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to host a website or send an HTML email. The user must have Services for Unix 2.0 installed, which is not installed by default on any platform. This vulnerability affects Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000 systems.

**Additional Vulnerabilities (Not related to CVE-2001-0150):**

1.  **Cached Content Location Disclosure:**
    *   **Root Cause:** IE's caching mechanism obfuscates the location of cached content, but a flaw allows web pages or HTML emails to learn the physical location.
    *   **Vulnerability:**  By knowing the location of cached content, an attacker can cause it to be opened in the Local Computer Zone.
    *   **Impact:**  Attackers could launch compiled HTML help (.CHM) files containing shortcuts to executables, enabling arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Attack Vector:**  A user visits a malicious website or opens a specially crafted HTML email.
    *   **Required Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to host a website or send an HTML email.

2.  **"Frame Domain Verification" Vulnerability (variant):**
    *   **Root Cause:** A flaw exists within IE.
    *   **Vulnerability:** Allows a malicious website operator to open two browser windows, one in the web site's domain, and another on the user's local file system and pass information from the latter to the former.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers could read local files that could be opened in a browser window.
    *   **Attack Vector:**  User visits a malicious web site.
    *   **Required Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to host a website.

3.  **Windows Script Host Vulnerability:**
    *   **Root Cause:** A flaw in Windows Script Host (WSH) causes it to improperly check the domain when certain requests are made.
    *   **Vulnerability:**  This could allow a malicious web site to open a window on the user's local file system and read the data.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers could read local files that can be opened in a browser window.
    *   **Attack Vector:**  User visits a malicious website.
    *   **Required Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to host a website.
