                                        [Cgi Security Advisory #3.1]
                                          admin@cgisecurity.com
                                               bbs_forum.cgi

Found
January 3rd 2001

Vendor Contacted
January 3rd 2001

Public Release
January 7th 2001

Script Effected: bbs_forum.cgi
Free

Versions Effected:
1.0
(Others unknown)

Platforms
UNIX

Vendor
<http://www.extropia.com>
Patch
<http://www.extropia.com/hacks/bbs_security0.html>

1. Impact

Any file can be read with the permissions of user nobody(or webserver).
Possible root comprimise in bbs_forum.cgi script. Command execution is
allowed and therefore shell spawning is possible. This has been tested on
unix and linux systems only and it is unknown if windows versions exist
and/or are effected.

One thing to be noted about this hole is that perl was in taint mode, and
still allowed files to be read, and commands to be executed. This was
not originally intended. This is proof that perl -t is not always
enough.

Example:

[www.host.com/cgi-bin/bbs_forum.cgi?forum=](http://www.host.com/cgi-bin/bbs_forum.cgi?forum=)<valid forum
name>&read=../bbs_forum.cgi
Will grab the scripts own sourcecode.
Note: In order for this hole to work a valid forum name must be used,
so simply trying to call read= only may not work.

2. Fixes

The vendor has been contacted about this serious security problem.
Please visit the vendor's website for patches and other important
information.

3. Attached Vendor Patch

Note: This is a patch for people who know what they are doing.
Please visit <http://www.extropia.com/hacks/bbs_security0.html>
for information on upgrading.

********************* Vendor patch snippet **************************

If you have made extensive modifications to bbs_forum.cgi and do not wish
to start over from scratch, search for the line at the start of
bbs_forum.cgi that says

                      &ReadParse;

                      And insert afterwards the following:

                      if ($in{'read'} && $in{'read'} !~ /^\d+-\d+\.msg$/i)
{
                          print "Invalid Message #";
                          die("Invalid Message # provided: " .
                                  $in{'read'});
                      }
                      if ($in{'reply_to_message'} &&
$in{'reply_to_message'} !~ /^\d+-\d+\.msg$/i) {
                          print "Invalid Reply To Message #";
                          die("Invalid Reply To Message # provided: " .
                                  $in{'reply_to_message'});
                      }

This code assures the script that the message file
form variables can only consist of the strict filename format of digits
followed by a hyphen followed by some digits followed by the literal
string ".msg".

We recommend updating your script as soon as possible.
Special thanks to cgisecurity.com for pointing our the issue.

| | |  | | welcome to eXtropia | | --- | | **What you'll find here...**  eXtropia is an open source resource for web application development. Contained within this site are free software applications (Perl and Java), free software application development tools (Perl and Java), [free tutorials](https://www.theblogstarter.com), and other related resources. Note that this is not a commercial site. Other than being fairly old, the code and work here is no longer supported. However, while not everything here is cutting edge, polished, bug-free, or 'ready-to-run', everything here should be interesting and educational for all users (even the more out of date sections), even today. We also hope that the technology found here will be easy to use and useful to web development professionals either as examples of how to solve different types of problems, or as the foundations upon which to build final projects. **What happened to the Selena Sol's Script Archive?** In 1997, the Selena Sol Script Archive was renamed eXtropia. The name change was meant to reflect the fact that the technology on the site had gone way beyond any one programmer and had evolved into, and had been developed by, a global open source community. **What happened to eXtropia, the company?** In 1999, eXtropia was incorporated in Singapore in order to provide international banks with proprietary enterprise banking software based upon the free open source application development tools within this website. After a few successful years of operation, in 2002, the company and all of its proprietary IP was sold to a much larger, listed software company. However, this new company was not interested in contributing to the open source technology and so the original eXtropia website was resurrected.
