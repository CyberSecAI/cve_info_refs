      "details": {
        "root_cause": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in XFree86 when handling long strings, specifically in the context of window titles or other text-based fields.",
        "vulnerability": "The vulnerability is a buffer overflow, triggered by providing overly long strings to the X server, potentially while setting window names via the -name parameter of xterm or in other contexts such as HTML titles.",
        "impact": "Exploitation of this vulnerability leads to a crash of the X server, causing all X applications to terminate, resulting in a denial of service. It can also lead to arbitrary code execution if the attacker crafts the malicious string correctly.",
        "attack_vector": "Attack vectors include local exploitation by using long strings in commands like `xterm -name <long string>` and remote exploitation through HTML content containing long title strings that are processed by an X client, such as a web browser.",
        "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to control the input to an X client either locally via command-line arguments, or remotely, for example through a web page or via some X-based application."

      "details": {
        "root_cause": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists when processing long input strings within KDE's Konqueror web browser. This vulnerability occurs when excessive text is entered into search boxes or text input fields.",
        "vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from inadequate bounds checking when handling long strings within the Konqueror browser, leading to a buffer overflow.",
        "impact": "Exploitation of this vulnerability results in the crashing of the X server, and thus a denial-of-service condition.",
        "attack_vector": "Attack vectors include providing long strings into a text input field in Konqueror, such as a web search field. The overflow can occur when the input is displayed or when the input is sent to a search engine.",
        "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to get a user to input a long string into Konqueror."

      "details": {
        "root_cause": "A buffer overflow vulnerability related to glyph clipping exists within the fbglyph.c file of XFree86. This occurs due to insufficient bounds checking when handling glyph rendering with large origins, potentially resulting in out-of-bounds memory access.",
        "vulnerability": "The vulnerability involves missing or inadequate checks on the bounds of glyph clipping operations, which allows an attacker to write beyond allocated buffer space.",
         "impact": "Exploitation results in a crash of the X server.",
        "attack_vector": "Attack vector involves crafted glyph rendering operations that cause memory corruption when handling large glyph origins.",
        "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would need a means to control glyph rendering in X."
