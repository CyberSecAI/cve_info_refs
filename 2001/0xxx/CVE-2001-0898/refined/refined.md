Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of these vulnerabilities lies in Opera's insufficient enforcement of the Same Origin Policy for JavaScript. This allows scripts from one domain to access properties (like cookies, links, and even file system information) of pages from other domains or the local file system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Cross-Domain Information Disclosure:** JavaScript code can access cookies, links, and potentially other sensitive information from arbitrary domains the user has accessed.
*   **Local File System Access:** Scripts can access and enumerate files and directories on the user's local hard drive by treating `file://` URLs as HTML pages.
*   **Cache and History Snooping:**  Scripts can read links from the user's browser cache and history, potentially revealing sensitive information.
*   **Insecure `document.location` Modification:** The `document.location` property of iframes can be modified by a script to execute javascript from another domain or local file system

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privacy Violation:** Attackers can steal cookies, potentially gaining unauthorized access to user accounts on other websites.
*   **Information Theft:** Sensitive data, such as usernames, passwords, and cached web content can be exposed.
*   **Local File System Exposure:** An attacker could potentially discover files and directories on the victim's system.
*   **Arbitrary code execution:** The attack using file:// scheme could potentially lead to remote code execution

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Web Pages:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into a website that the user visits.
*   **Compromised Websites:** If a legitimate website is compromised, it could be used to host the malicious script.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** An attacker intercepting the user's traffic could inject the malicious script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Serve HTML/JavaScript:** The attacker needs to be able to deliver HTML pages containing the malicious JavaScript code to the victim's browser. This could be through a website they control, or by compromising another site.
*   **User Interaction:** The user must visit the malicious website or a compromised website, or have traffic that gets intercepted.

**Specific Examples Provided:**

1.  **Cookie Theft from Yahoo Mail:** The provided code demonstrates how a script can open a Yahoo Mail page and retrieve its cookies.
2.  **Cache and History Access:** Another script shows how to access links from the browser's cache.
3.  **Local File System Enumeration:**  An iframe is used to load a file system path (`file://c:/`) which can then be parsed to list directories and files.
4.  **Cookie theft from a web page using iframes:** An iframe is used to load a URL which is then accessed to retrieve the cookie.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is reported to affect Opera versions 5.0 and 5.12 (and likely others) and also the 6.0 beta version.
*   The vendor initially suggested a workaround involving disabling caching of password-protected documents, which is not a proper fix but a user-controlled mitigation.
*   The advisory mentions that a HotJava exploit also works on the same browser.
*   The disclosure includes proof of concept scripts that can be used to test the vulnerability.
