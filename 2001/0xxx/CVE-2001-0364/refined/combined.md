Topic:              Remote DoS attack against SSH Secure Shell for
Windows Servers Vulnerability
USSR Advisory Code: USSR-2001001
Announced:          2001-03-16
Credits:            Luciano Martins <luck@ussrback.com>
Affects:            SSH Secure Shell for Windows Server 2.4
Corrected:          SSH Secure Shell for Windows Server 2.5 available

Vendors Affected:   SSH Communications Security Corp

1. Discussion

UssrLabs has recently discovered a problem with Windows versions of
sshd.
The problem lies with adjacent connection handling where the sshd is
unable to handle 64 simulataneous connections. As a result the sshd
will
crash, and no services to the sshd will be accepted.

The problem lies in ssheloop.c where the assertion test fails.

The Event Log displays the following code after 64 connections are
spawned:

  FATAL ERROR: E:\src\lib\sshutil\ssheloop\win32\ssheloop.c:1597
SshEventLoop
  (function name unavailable) Assertion failed:
ssh_adt_num_objects(ssh_eloop_events) < 64

No doubt, proper error handling techniques have not been implemented
for
the SshEventLoop which ultimately causes the crash.

This results in a Denial of Service against the service in question.

2. Vendor Status:
Informed, Contacted.

3. Fix:
official fix will be available soon.
