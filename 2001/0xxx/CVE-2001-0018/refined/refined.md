- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A core service on Windows 2000 domain controllers does not properly validate service requests. Instead of discarding invalid requests, it attempts to process them, which consumes significant resources.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper input validation, leading to resource exhaustion. The service should discard invalid requests but instead processes them.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A continuous stream of malformed requests can consume most or all of the domain controller's CPU resources, causing denial of service. This can slow down or prevent the processing of legitimate requests, limit new logons, and hinder the issuance of Kerberos tickets.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a continuous stream of specifically crafted, invalid requests to the vulnerable service on a Windows 2000 domain controller.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the domain controller. While the vulnerability could theoretically cause a complete denial of service, practical attacks are unlikely to consume more than 75% of available CPU resources. It's recommended that best practices should prevent the attack from being exploited from the Internet.
