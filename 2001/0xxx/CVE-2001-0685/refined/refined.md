- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to the insecure handling of temporary files by `fcrontab` when updating a user's crontab. Specifically, `fcrontab` creates a temporary file in `/tmp` (named `fcrontab*`) and then updates the user's crontab based on this file. An attacker can exploit this by creating a symbolic link to a sensitive file, such as `/etc/shadow`, that has the same name as the temporary file created by `fcrontab` after the file is created but before it's processed by fcrontab.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  - **Symlink vulnerability:** `fcrontab` does not properly validate the temporary file before processing it, making it susceptible to symlink attacks.
  - **Race condition:** The vulnerability relies on a race condition where an attacker can create a symlink after the temporary file in `/tmp` is created, but before the root process opens the file to update the crontab.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can overwrite a sensitive file (e.g., `/etc/shadow`) with the content of their crontab file or any arbitrary data. This can lead to privilege escalation or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:**
  - The attacker needs to be a local user who can run commands on the system.
  - The attacker needs to be able to monitor the creation of `/tmp/fcrontab*` temporary files, likely by iterating through `/tmp` directory.
  - The attacker needs to be able to create a symlink to a chosen file in `/tmp` after a temporary file is created by the root fcrontab process.
  - A root user needs to run `fcrontab -u <user> -e` command to update the user's crontab after the symlink has been placed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
  - The attacker needs to be a local user with the ability to execute code and create symbolic links on the system.
  - The attacker requires the root user to update their crontab file using the `fcrontab` command.
