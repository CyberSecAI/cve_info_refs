Hi there dunno if this is a correct post to this list but i discovered a
lil dos for rf gamers. This is a lil old but never read about it on any
topics or boards so i decided to post it here. So what i found some weeks
ago is if u do:

nmap -sU -p 7755 <ip>

The Red Faction game/server crashes and the user is back on his desktop 8)
Working on Client/Server even on Dedicated Servers. Port 7755 is the
standart Game port if the server runs on diffrent port a nmap on that port
is working too. Dunno where really the problem is but i think its an
illegal connection the game cant handle. A firewall would help on that.

If someone knows more reply and give me the detail
tnx
