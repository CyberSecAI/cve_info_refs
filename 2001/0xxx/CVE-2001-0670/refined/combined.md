## BSD Line Printer Daemon vulnerable to buffer overflow via crafted print request

#### Vulnerability Note VU#274043

Original Release Date: 2001-09-10 | Last Revised: 2001-11-30

---

### Overview

The line printer daemon enables various clients to share printers over a network. There exists a buffer overflow vulnerability in this daemon that permits remote execution of arbitrary commands with elevated privileges.

### Description

| There is a buffer overflow in several implementations of in.lpd, a BSD line printer daemon. An intruder can send a specially crafted print job to the target and then request a display of the print queue to trigger the buffer overflow. The intruder may be able use this overflow to execute arbitrary commands on the system with superuser privileges.  The line printer daemon must be enabled and configured properly in order for an intruder to exploit this vulnerability. This is, however, trivial as the line printer daemon is commonly enabled to provide printing functionality. In order to exploit the buffer overflow, the intruder must launch his attack from a system that is listed in the "/etc/hosts.equiv" or "/etc/hosts.lpd" file of the target system. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An intruder can remotely execute arbitrary commands on the system with the privileges of the line printer daemon, usually root or a superuser. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Apply a patch, if available, from your vendor. |
| --- |

| Disable the line printer daemon if there is not a patch available from your vendor. |

NetBSD Security Advisory 2001-018
 =================================

Topic:Remote Buffer Overflow Vulnerability in BSD Line Printer Daemon

Version:NetBSD-current: prior to August 28, 2001
NetBSD-1.5.2:affected
NetBSD-1.5.1:affected
NetBSD-1.5:affected
NetBSD-1.4.\*:affected

Severity:Remote root compromise from any host which can connect to lpd(8)

Fixed:NetBSD-current:August 28, 2001
NetBSD-1.5 branch:September 30, 2001
NetBSD-1.4 branch: not yet

Abstract
========

There is an remotely exploitable buffer overrun in the printer daemon,
/usr/sbin/lpd.

Technical Details
=================

<http://msgs.securepoint.com/cgi-bin/get/bugtraq0108/259.html>

Solutions and Workarounds
=========================

NetBSD 1.3 and later install with lpd disabled by default. A system is
vulnerable to this security hole only if it is running /usr/sbin/lpd,
and access to lpd is allowed by entries in /etc/hosts.lpd. Updating
the binary for safety is recommended.

Quick workaround:
If you are running /usr/sbin/lpd, and you do not need it, stop it.
If you have /etc/hosts.lpd which is open to everyone, you will want to
tighten the setup so that no malicious parties can access your remote printer.

Solutions:

\* NetBSD -current, 1.5, 1.5.1, 1.5.2:

Systems running NetBSD-current dated from before 2001-08-28
should be upgraded to NetBSD-current dated 2001-08-28 or later.

Systems running NetBSD 1.5, 1.5.1 or 1.5.2 dated from before
2001-09-30 should be upgraded to NetBSD-1.5 branch sources dated
2001-09-30 or later.

The following directory needs to be updated from the
netbsd-current CVS branch (aka HEAD) for NetBSD-current,
or netbsd-1-5 CVS branch for NetBSD 1.5, 1.5.1 or 1.5.2:
src/usr.sbin/lpr

To update from CVS, re-build, and re-install lpd(8):
# cd src/usr.sbin/lpr
# cvs update -d -P
# make cleandir dependall install

Alternatively, apply the following patch (with potential offset
differences) and rebuild & re-install lpd(8):
ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/security/patches/SA2001-018-lpd.patch

To patch, re-build and re-install lpd(8):
# cd src/usr.sbin/lpr/common\_sources
# patch < /path/to/SA2001-012-lpd.patch
# make cleandir dependall install

\* NetBSD 1.4, 1.4.x:

Systems running NetBSD-1.4.x releases should apply the following
patch (with potential offset differences):
ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/security/patches/SA2001-018-lpd.patch

To patch, re-build and re-install lpd(8):
# cd src/usr.sbin/lpr/common\_sources
# patch < /path/to/SA2001-012-lpd.patch
# make cleandir dependall install

The anonymous CVS branch netbsd-1-4 should be updated with a
fix in the near future.

Thanks To
=========

Jun-ichiro Hagino for the original patches to -current, from a fix in
OpenBSD

- -----------------------
- --- Issue Specifics ---
- -----------------------

Issue #1: lpd

ISS X-Force has discovered a buffer overflow in BSD-based line
printer daemons (lpd) that may allow a remote or local attacker
to crash the daemon or execute arbitrary code with super user
privilege. Although lpd is part of the IRIX print.sw.bsdlpr
system and is not installed by default, if it is installed it
runs with root privileges by default on all current IRIX
versions.

Issue #2: lpsched

Last Stage of Delirium has reported vulnerabilities in the
lpsched program which allow remote attackers with sufficient
control of their remote network to obtain 'root' and 'lp'
privileges remotely. lpsched is installed by default on all
current IRIX versions.

Issue #3: lpstat

Last Stage of Delirium has reported a vulnerability in the
lpstat command in the way it loads and executes code from user
supplied net-type shared library objects. When appropriately
exploited it can lead to a local root compromise on a
vulnerable system. lpstat is installed by default on all
current IRIX versions.

- --------------
- --- Impact ---
- --------------

lpsched and lpstat are installed by default on IRIX.

lpd is part of the optional print.sw.bsdlpr subsystem and is not
installed by default on IRIX.

A local user account on the vulnerable system is not required
in order to exploit these vulnerabilities. Vulnerable systems
can be exploited remotely over an untrusted network.

These vulnerabilities can lead to a root compromise.

ISS X-Force reported the lpd vulnerability:
<http://xforce.iss.net/alerts/advise80.php>

The lpd vulnerability was also reported by CERT® Advisory CA-2001-15:
<http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2001-15.html>

The lpd vulnerability was assigned the following CVE:
<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2001-0353>

Last Stage of Delirium reported the lpstat and lpsched vulnerabilities:
<http://www.lsd-pl.net/files/get?IRIX/irx_lpstat2>
<http://www.lsd-pl.net/files/get?IRIX/irx_lpsched>
<http://www.lsd-pl.net/files/get?IRIX/irx_lpsched2>

These vulnerabilities have been publicly discussed in Usenet
newsgroups and security mailing lists.

- ----------------------
- --- Recommendation ---
- ----------------------

SGI has investigated the issues and recommends the following
steps for neutralizing the exposures. It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
that these measures be implemented on ALL vulnerable SGI
systems. This issue has been corrected in future releases of
IRIX.

- --------------------------
- --- Temporary Solution ---
- --------------------------

Although patches are available for this issue, it is realized that
there may be situations where installing the patches immediately may
not be possible.

The steps below can be used to remove the print.sw subsystems
to prevent exploitation of these vulnerabilities until patches
can be installed.

 =================
 \*\*\*\* WARNING \*\*\*\*
 =================

 These steps will disable printing capabilities.

 1) Become the root user on the system.

 % /bin/su -
 Password:
 #

 2) Stop the printing services

 # /etc/init.d/bsdlpr stop
 # /etc/init.d/lp stop

 3) Use the "versions" command to remove the printing
 subsystems:

 # versions remove print.sw.\*

 5) Return to previous level.

 # exit
 %

 6) It is not necessary to reboot the system.

 SuSE Security Announcement

 Package: lprold
 Announcement-ID: SuSE-SA:2001:033
 Date: Wed Oct 10 11:03:12 GMT 2001
 Affected SuSE versions: [6.1, 6.2,] 6.3, 6.4, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2
 Vulnerability Type: bufferoverflow/local privilege escalation
 Severity (1-10): 6
 SuSE default package: yes
 Other affected systems: Other Linux distributions, \*BSD

 Content of this advisory:
 1) security vulnerability resolved: Several problems in lprold
 problem description, discussion, solution and upgrade information
 2) pending vulnerabilities, solutions, workarounds
 3) standard appendix (further information)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

1) problem description, brief discussion, solution, upgrade information

 ISS X-Force reported an overflow in BSD's lineprinter daemon shipped with
 the lprold package in SuSE Linux. Due to missing bounds checks in the
 lockfile processing function, internal buffers may overflow. Bounds checks
 have been added to fix that problem.
 Additionally the SuSE Security Team uncovered other security releated bugs
 in lpd while analyzing lpd source after receiving the X-Force advisory.
 These bugs allows users on machines listed in /etc/hosts.lpd or
 /etc/hosts.equiv to chown any file on the system running lpd to any user.
 In order to trigger any of the fixed bugs (including the overflow) the
 attackers machine must be listed in one of these two access-files and the
 attacker usually needs root on these machines due to the privileged-port
 requirement.
 Please download the packages and verify them as described in section 3.
 After successful authentication you can update your packages with
 the command `rpm -Uhv file.rpm'.
 As root invoke the command "/etc/rc.d/lpd stop" to shutdown the old lpd
 daemon and "/etc/rc.d/lpd start" afterwards to start the patched daemon.

2) Pending vulnerabilities in SuSE Distributions and Workarounds:

 - sftp/openssh:
 Our last announcement SuSE-SA:2001:032 about WindowMaker claimed
 that the openssh packages on SuSE distributions do not contain the
 sftp-server as described by Peter W <peterw@usa.net> on the bugtraq
 mailing list. This is wrong: The program is indeed included on all
 recent openssh packages of SuSE Linux distributions, starting with
 SuSE Linux 6.4 where the openssh package appeared first.
 We will provide fixes for the distributions 6.4 through 7.2 as soon as
 possible on our ftp server (ftp.suse.de for 6.4-7.0, ftp.suse.com for
 7.1 and newer) and announce these fixes in the section 2) of an
 upcoming security announcement.
 Please note that this error has been corrected shortly before the
 release of the upcoming SuSE Linux 7.3 which will arrive in the stores
 by the end of this week.
 We apologize for this error (Roman Drahtmueller, SuSE Security).

 - squid
 Malformed requests on the client side can cause the squid proxy server
 to die, resulting in a denial of service attack that can be launched
 from the internal network if squid is used at the edge of an internal
 network to proxy requests to the internet.
 We are in the process of testing the update packages that are
 available on the ftp server shortly. SuSE Security will issue a
 dedicated announcement for this issue shortly.

 - devfs/kernel
 SuSE Linux ships the userspace utilities for the use of the devfs
 filesystem in the linux kernel, but neither the utilities nor the
 filesystem interface for device files itself have been used in SuSE
 Linux up to date. The decision to not actively use devfsd in the
 distribution framework is based on security considerations.
 For these reasons, SuSE products are not susceptible to the lately
 found security problems in the devfs implementation.

3) standard appendix: authenticity verification, additional information

 - Package authenticity verification:

 SuSE update packages are available on many mirror ftp servers all over
 the world. While this service is being considered valuable and important
 to the free and open source software community, many users wish to be
 sure about the origin of the package and its content before installing
 the package. There are two verification methods that can be used
 independently from each other to prove the authenticity of a downloaded
 file or rpm package:
 1) md5sums as provided in the (cryptographically signed) announcement.
 2) using the internal gpg signatures of the rpm package.

 1) execute the command
 md5sum <name-of-the-file.rpm>
 after you downloaded the file from a SuSE ftp server or its mirrors.
 Then, compare the resulting md5sum with the one that is listed in the
 announcement. Since the announcement containing the checksums is
 cryptographically signed (usually using the key security@suse.de),
 the checksums show proof of the authenticity of the package.
 We disrecommend to subscribe to security lists which cause the
 email message containing the announcement to be modified so that
 the signature does not match after transport through the mailing
 list software.
 Downsides: You must be able to verify the authenticity of the
 announcement in the first place. If RPM packages are being rebuilt
 and a new version of a package is published on the ftp server, all
 md5 sums for the files are useless.

 2) rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the authenticity
 of an rpm package. Use the command
 rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
 to verify the signature of the package, where <file.rpm> is the
 filename of the rpm package that you have downloaded. Of course,
 package authenticity verification can only target an uninstalled rpm
 package file.
 Prerequisites:
 a) gpg is installed
 b) The package is signed using a certain key. The public part of this
 key must be installed by the gpg program in the directory
 ~/.gnupg/ under the user's home directory who performs the
 signature verification (usually root). You can import the key
 that is used by SuSE in rpm packages for SuSE Linux by saving
 this announcement to a file ("announcement.txt") and
 running the command (do "su -" to be root):
 gpg --batch; gpg < announcement.txt | gpg --import
 SuSE Linux distributions version 7.1 and thereafter install the
 key "build@suse.de" upon installation or upgrade, provided that
 the package gpg is installed. The file containing the public key
 is placed at the toplevel directory of the first CD (pubring.gpg)
 and at ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/suse/pubring.gpg-build.suse.de .

          * **006: STABILITY FIX: Dec 4, 2000**

            On some machines, a PCIBIOS device driver interrupt allocation bug can cause a
            kernel hang while probing PCI devices. If you have this symptom, you can disable
            PCIBIOS as a workaround. To do this,
            + Enter the User Kernel Configuration by booting with the
              option "boot -c".+ Once at the *UKC>* prompt, enter
                > ```
                >
                > 	UKC> disable pcibios
                > 	UKC> quit
                > ```

                + See [this page](./faq/faq5.html#5.6) after a successful
                  boot for instructions on how to re-write your kernel to disable PCIBIOS
                  permanently.

                  *All architectures*

                Two problems have recently been discovered in the KerberosIV code.

                1. A symlink problem was discovered in the KerberosIV password checking
                routines /usr/bin/su and /usr/bin/login, which makes it possible for a
                local user to overwrite any file on the local machine.

                2. It is possible to specify environment variables in telnet
                which will be passed over the to the remote host. This makes it
                possible to set environment variables on the remote side, including
                ones that have special meaning on the server. It is not clear at this
                time what the impact is, but we recommend everyone to upgrade their
                machines immediately.

## History

The CERT Division is the birthplace of cybersecurity. For nearly 30 years, the CERT Division of the SEI has partnered with government, industry, law enforcement, and academia to advance cybersecurity and improve the security and resilience of computer systems and networks.

Originally focused on incident response, we have expanded into cybersecurity areas such as network situational awareness, malicious code analysis, secure coding, resilience management, insider threats, digital investigations and intelligence, workforce development, DevOps, forensics, software assurance, vulnerability discovery and analysis, and risk management.

## Former Director Richard Pethia

[Richard Pethia](/about/leadership/display.cfm?customel_datapageid_2623=3545) was founding director of the SEI's CERT Division. Pethia, who served as director of CERT from 1988 to 2016, guided the organization through tremendous growth and change. Under Pethia's leadership, the unit expanded and evolved from the CERT Coordination Center—a small group focused on computer incident response—to a research organization of more than 200 professionals dedicated to solving problems with widespread cybersecurity implications.
