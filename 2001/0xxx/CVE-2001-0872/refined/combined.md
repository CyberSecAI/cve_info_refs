OpenSSH 3.0.2 has just been released. It will be available from the
mirrors listed at <http://www.openssh.com/> shortly.

OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol version 1.3, 1.5 and 2.0
implementation and includes sftp client and server support.

We would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their continued
support and encouragement.

Important Changes:
==================

        This release fixes a vulnerability in the UseLogin option
        of OpenSSH.  This option is not enabled in the default
        installation of OpenSSH.

        However, if UseLogin is enabled by the administrator, all
        versions of OpenSSH prior to 3.0.2 may be vulnerable to
        local attacks.

        The vulnerability allows local users to pass environment
        variables (e.g. LD_PRELOAD) to the login process.  The login
        process is run with the same privilege as sshd (usually
        with root privilege).

        Do not enable UseLogin on your machines or disable UseLogin
        again in /etc/sshd_config:
		UseLogin no

We also have received many reports about attacks against the crc32
bug.  This bug has been fixed about 12 months ago in OpenSSH 2.3.0.
However, these attacks cause non-vulnerable daemons to chew a lot
of cpu since the crc32 attack sends a tremendously large amount of
data which must be processed.

OpenSSH is brought to you by Markus Friedl, Niels Provos, Theo de Raadt,
Kevin Steves, Damien Miller and Ben Lindstrom.

The following patch fixes the UseLogin vulnerability in OpenSSH 3.0.1 and
earlier releases.

## OpenSSH UseLogin directive permits privilege escalation

#### Vulnerability Note VU#157447

Original Release Date: 2001-12-04 | Last Revised: 2002-01-02

---

### Overview

OpenSSH is an implementation of the Secure Shell protocol. When OpenSSH is configured with the *UseLogin* directive equal to "yes", an intruder can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of OpenSSH, usually root.

### Description

| [OpenSSH](http://www.openssh.com) contains a vulnerability that permits an intruder to execute arbitrary code. When the *UseLogin* directive is enabled, a user can set environment variables that are used by login. An intruder can use this vulnerability to execute commands with the privileges of OpenSSH, usually root. *UseLogin* is not enabled by default; however, it is a common configuration. The intruder must be able to authenticate to the system using public key authentication.  This vulnerability is not related to VU#40327 (<https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/40327>). |
| --- |

### Impact

| An intruder can use this vulnerability to execute commands with the privileges of OpenSSH, usually root. |
| --- |

### Solution

| OpenSSH 3.0.2 resolves this vulnerability and is available at ftp://ftp.openbsd.com/pub/OpenBSD/OpenSSH/openssh-3.0.2.tgz. |
| --- |

| We strongly encourage you to review your configuration to determine whether or not *UseLogin* is enabled. If the use of UseLogin is required at your site, you may wish to temporarily disable access to the SSH service until a patch can be applied. |

 Caldera International, Inc. Security Advisory

Subject:Linux - Local vulnerability in OpenSSH
Advisory number: CSSA-2001-042.1
Issue date: 2001, December 14
Cross reference:CSSA-2001-042.0
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

1. Problem Description

 This is a revised advisory for the 'UseLogin' vulnerability.
 The original advisory declared the vulnerability as a remote
 vulnerability, which is not the case. The vulnerability requires the
 attacker to have a local account, making it a local vulnerability.

 The OpenSSH team has reported a vulnerability in the OpenSSH server
 that allows local users to obtain root privilege if the server
 has the UseLogin option enabled. This option is off by default on
 OpenLinux, so a default installation is not vulnerable.

 We nevertheless recommend to our customers to upgrade to the fixed
 package.

2. Vulnerable Versions

 System Package
 -----------------------------------------------------------
 OpenLinux 2.3 not vulnerable

 OpenLinux eServer 2.3.1 All packages previous to
 and OpenLinux eBuilder openssh-2.9p2-4

 OpenLinux eDesktop 2.4 All packages previous to
 openssh-2.9p2-4

 OpenLinux Server 3.1 All packages previous to
 openssh-2.9p2-4

 OpenLinux Workstation 3.1 All packages previous to
 openssh-2.9p2-4

3. Solution

 Workaround

 Make sure that you do not have the UseLogin option enabled.
 In /etc/ssh/sshd\_config, the UseLogin option should either
 be commended out, or should be set to "no".

 The proper solution is to upgrade to the latest packages.

Updated:  December 04, 2001

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

IBM makes available OpenSSH for AIX customers as a software package under the AIX-Linux Affinity initiative. This package is included on the AIX Toolbox for Linux Applications CD, and can be downloaded via the IBM Linux Affinity website. The currently available version of OpenSSH is susceptible to the vulnerability described here. We will update our OpenSSH offering soon to a version that is not vulnerable; this update will be made available for downloading by accessing this URL:

<http://www6.software.ibm.com/dl/aixtbx/aixtbx-p>

and following the instructions presented there.

Please note that OpenSSH, and all Linux Affinity software, is offered on an "as-is" basis. IBM does not own the source code for this software, nor has it developed and fully tested this code. IBM does not support these software packages.

Customers may wish to obtain and install a non-vulnerable version of OpenSSH (ver. 3.0.2) from other sites, pending the posting of our updated version. However, other sites may not offer recompiled
packages for AIX, making necessary the customer having to build the binaries.

### Vendor Information

The vendor has not provided us with any further information regarding this vulnerability.

        Announcement-ID:        SuSE-SA:2001:045
        Date:                   Thursday, Dec 6th 2001 21:30 MET
        Affected SuSE versions: 6.4, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3
        Vulnerability Type:     local privilege escalation
        Severity (1-10):        5
        SuSE default package:   yes
        Other affected systems: systems running openssh

    Content of this advisory:
        1) security vulnerability resolved: openssh
           problem description, discussion, solution and upgrade information
        2) pending vulnerabilities, solutions, workarounds
        3) standard appendix (further information)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

1)  Re-release of SuSE Security Announcement SuSE-SA:2001:044, brief history,
    Clarification, new problem fixed, upgrade information.

    This is a re-release of the SuSE Security Announcement SuSE-SA:2001:044,
    adding another bugfix for the openssh package as well as more detailed
    information about the vulnerabilities to prevent misunderstandings.

    The currently supported SuSE distributions 6.4 and newer come with two
    implementations of the secure shell protocol: The package names are
    "ssh" and "openssh".

    Brief history:
    In 1998, a vulnerability of the secure shell protocol in version 1 has
    been discovered and named "crc32 compensation attack". The vulnerability
    allows an attacker to insert arbitrary sequences into the ssh-1 protocol
    layer. At that time, an added patch fixed the problem in the ssh
    implementation (visible in the client-side verbose output of the ssh
    command (-v): "Installing crc compensation attack detector.").
    In early 2001, Michal Zalewski discovered that the widely used patch
    was defective and opened another security hole which is being actively
    exploited today. SuSE Security announcement SuSE-SA:2001:004, published
    February 16th 2001, available at \*[1], addresses this defective patch,
    among other issues.

    Clarification/Apology:
    Our last openssh security announcement SuSE-SA:2001:044 (\*[3]) may falsely
    lead to assume that the openssh-2.9.9p2 update packages on our ftp
    server fix the vulnerabilities known as crc32 compensation attack.
    This is incorrect since the openssh-2.3.0 packages released with SuSE
    Security announcement SuSE-SA:2000:047 in November 2000, available at
    \*[2], already fixed the mentioned (among other) problems. The release
    of the openssh-2.9.9p2 update packages obsoletes the openssh-2.3.0 update
    packages.
    We explicitly regret the used wording and apologize to the openssh
    development team, in particular Markus Friedl and Theo De Raadt, and
    thank them for their excellent work on the project.

    Scanning utilities that can be found on the internet connect to port 22
    of a server and read the version string. It should be noted that the bare
    knowlege of the secure shell protocol version string does not allow to
    determine whether a running secure shell daemon is actually vulnerable
    to the defective fix for the crc32 compensation attack.
    SuSE security receive dozens of requests about statements if the daemons
    in use are vulnerable or not. Please see reference \*[1].

    New problem fixed:
    This re-release of SuSE Security Announcement SuSE-SA:2001:044 (please
    see reference \*[3] below) adds another patch to the openssh-2.9.9p2
    packages: A bug allows a local attacker on the server to specify
    environment variables that can influence the login process if the
    "UseLogin" configuration option on the server side is set to "yes".
    If exploited, the local attacker on the secure shell server can execute
    arbitrary commands as root.
    In the default configuration of the package, the UseLogin option is set
    to "no", which means that the administrator of the server must have set
    the option to "yes" manually before the bug can be exploited.

    Users who upgraded their SuSE openssh package before December 6th 2001
    should upgrade their package again. Use the command "rpm -q openssh"
    to see which version/release of the package you have installed, and
    compare this version with the one as listed below.

    Upgrade information:
    You can find out which implementation of the ssh protocol you are using
    with the command "rpm -qf /usr/bin/ssh".
    If you use the ssh-1.2.\* package, please read Reference \*[1].
    If you use the openssh-\* package, please download the rpm package for
    your distribution from the URL list below, verify its integrity using
    the methods as described in section 3) of this security announcement
    and install the package using the command

        rpm -Uhv file.rpm

    where file.rpm is the filename of the package that you have downloaded.

    References:
    \*[1]: <http://www.suse.de/de/support/security/adv004_ssh.txt>
    \*[2]: <http://www.suse.de/de/support/security/2000_047_openssh_txt.txt>
    \*[3]: <http://www.suse.de/de/support/security/2001_044_openssh_txt.txt>

    SPECIAL INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS:
    The sshd secure shell daemon on the server side has to be restarted for
    the new package to become active. If you are logged on on the console,
    the simple command "rcsshd restart" should do this for you.
    If you are logged on via secure shell, you should make sure that you
    do not terminate the connections that are established through the running
    secure shell daemon/its children. In this case, kill the daemon after
    package installation using the command
        kill -TERM `cat /var/run/sshd.pid`
    and then restart the daemon with the command
        /usr/sbin/sshd
    as root.

    Then, verify that the login procedure works as before. One of the main
    changes in the new openssh package is that the file
    $HOME/.ssh/authorized\_keys2 is only read by the server if the file
    $HOME/.ssh/authorized\_keys does not exist and if protocol version 2 is
    being used. The file $HOME/.ssh/authorized\_keys2 can be removed after
    its contents have been added to $HOME/.ssh/authorized\_keys.
    The two configuration files /etc/ssh/sshd\_config (server side) and
    /etc/ssh/ssh\_config (client side) contained in the openssh package
    do not get overwritten upon installation or upgrade, if you have changed
    them manually. Instead, the new configuration files are written with a
    .rpmnew suffix. The defaults as provided in the SuSE package make an
    effort to establish both convenience as well as security.

    NOTE: Packages for SuSE Linux distributions 7.0 and older containing
    cryptographic software are located on our German ftp server ftp.suse.de
    for legal reasons. Packages for all other distributions (7.1 and newer)
    can be found at their regular path at ftp.suse.com.

2)  Pending vulnerabilities in SuSE Distributions and Workarounds:

  - We are currently testing kernel update packages for the recently
    found local security flaw in the ELF binary loader in the Linux
    kernel of all v2.4 versions and expect to be able to announce these
    update rpm packages soon with a re-release of our kernel security
    announcement.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

3)  standard appendix: authenticity verification, additional information

  - Package authenticity verification:

    SuSE update packages are available on many mirror ftp servers all over
    the world. While this service is being considered valuable and important
    to the free and open source software community, many users wish to be
    sure about the origin of the package and its content before installing
    the package. There are two verification methods that can be used
    independently from each other to prove the authenticity of a downloaded
    file or rpm package:
    1) md5sums as provided in the (cryptographically signed) announcement.
    2) using the internal gpg signatures of the rpm package.

    1) execute the command
        md5sum <name-of-the-file.rpm>
       after you downloaded the file from a SuSE ftp server or its mirrors.
       Then, compare the resulting md5sum with the one that is listed in the
       announcement. Since the announcement containing the checksums is
       cryptographically signed (usually using the key security@suse.de),
       the checksums show proof of the authenticity of the package.
       We disrecommend to subscribe to security lists which cause the
       email message containing the announcement to be modified so that
       the signature does not match after transport through the mailing
       list software.
       Downsides: You must be able to verify the authenticity of the
       announcement in the first place. If RPM packages are being rebuilt
       and a new version of a package is published on the ftp server, all
       md5 sums for the files are useless.

    2) rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the authenticity
       of an rpm package. Use the command
        rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
       to verify the signature of the package, where <file.rpm> is the
       filename of the rpm package that you have downloaded. Of course,
       package authenticity verification can only target an uninstalled rpm
       package file.
       Prerequisites:
        a) gpg is installed
        b) The package is signed using a certain key. The public part of this
           key must be installed by the gpg program in the directory
           ~/.gnupg/ under the user's home directory who performs the
           signature verification (usually root). You can import the key
           that is used by SuSE in rpm packages for SuSE Linux by saving
           this announcement to a file ("announcement.txt") and
           running the command (do "su -" to be root):
            gpg --batch; gpg < announcement.txt | gpg --import
           SuSE Linux distributions version 7.1 and thereafter install the
           key "build@suse.de" upon installation or upgrade, provided that
           the package gpg is installed. The file containing the public key
           is placed at the toplevel directory of the first CD (pubring.gpg)
           and at ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/suse/pubring.gpg-build.suse.de .

### [F-Secure](#JARL-55BJYP) Not Affected

Updated:  December 11, 2001

### Status

Not Affected

### Vendor Statement

The F-Secure SSH versions 2.x - 3.x doesn't have UseLogin option, nor any means to use 'login' to perform user session setup. Since environmental variables are set only after we're running on user uid, we don't see other exploits of this sort either. Furthermore, administrator is able to control which environmental variables the client is able to set in ssh daemon config file.

The F-Secure SSH 1.x versions don't provide means for the client to set environmental variables on the server. Also, while a valid user is able to set environmental variables on the server via pubkey authentication options, these are actually not set in case of 'UseLogin' and use of 'login' to handle user logon.

### Vendor Information

The vendor has not provided us with any further information regarding this vulnerability.

 Title: Security vulnerability in OpenSSH

TEXT

---------------------------------------------------------------
 HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY SECURITY BULLETIN: #005
 Originally issued: 12 December '01
---------------------------------------------------------------

The information in the following Security Bulletin should be acted
upon as soon as possible. Hewlett-Packard Company will not be
liable for any consequences to any customer resulting from the
customer's failure to fully implement instructions in this Security
Bulletin as soon as possible.

Because the vulnerability does not require a Hewlett-Packard Secure OS
1.0 patch or re-packaging of the RPM affected by the advisory, the
RPMs have not been produced or tested by Hewlett-Packard.

---------------------------------------------------------------
PROBLEM: Security vulnerability in OpenSSH.

PLATFORM: Any system running HP Secure OS software for Linux Release 1.0

DAMAGE: Potential execution of commands by an intruder.

SOLUTION: Apply the appropriate RPMs (see section B below).

MANUAL ACTIONS: None

AVAILABILITY: The RPMs are available now.
 ---------------------------------------------------------------
 A. Background

 OpenSSH contains a vulnerability that permits an intruder to
 execute arbitrary code if the UseLogin directive is enabled.
 UseLogin is not enabled by default on HP Secure OS Software
 for Linux.

 B. Fixing the problem

 Hewlett-Packard recommends that customers download the RPMs
 listed in the following Red Hat Security Advisory:
<http://www.redhat.com/support/errata/RHSA-2001-161.html>

 To install the security advisory RPMs, use the following sequence
 of commands:

 1. If you use the tripwire product, we recommend that you run a
 a consistency check and fix any violations before installing
 the security advisory RPM.

 tripwire --check --interactive

 2. Install the advisory RPM from the root account.

 rpm -F <advisory RPM name>

 3. Update the tripwire database

 tripwire --check --interactive

 NOTE:
 The rpm -q <package name> command can be used to determine if the
 product is installed. Hewlett-Packard recommends applying the
 security advisory fixes to installed packages only. The -F option
 to the RPM installer will only apply the fix if the package is
 currently installed on the system. Dependent RPMs can be found by
 using the "Find Latest RPMs" search facility at
<http://www.redhat.com/apps/download>. To find the latest dependent
 RPM enter the RPM's name in the "By Keyword" box.
