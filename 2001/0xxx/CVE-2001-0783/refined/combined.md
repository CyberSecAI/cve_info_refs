# Highscores 2000-2001

Here is a small list of CVE's from my very early security days, as bug hunting was still for fun and not
profit. This was what the 18 yrs old me used to have fun with after school.

[CVE-2000-0262](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2000-0262/) - Score 5.0

The AVM KEN! ISDN Proxy server allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via a malformed
request.

[CVE-2000-0261](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2000-0261/) - Score 5.0

The AVM KEN! web server allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files via a .. (dot dot) attack.

[CVE-2001-0698](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2001-0698/) - Score 5.0

Directory traversal vulnerability in NetWin SurgeFTP 2.0a and 1.0b allows a remote attacker to list
arbitrary files and directories via the 'nlist ...' command.

[CVE-2001-0749](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2001-0749/) - Score 7.5
