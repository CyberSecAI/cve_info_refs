Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the IP Filter vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how IP Filter handles fragmented packets and its decision caching mechanism. When a fragmented packet is processed, IP Filter caches the "pass" or "block" decision based on the fragment's IP ID, protocol, source and destination addresses. This cached decision is then applied to subsequent fragments with matching attributes. The vulnerability arises from the fact that an attacker can manipulate the order in which fragments are sent to bypass the firewall rules.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Fragment Handling Logic Flaw:** The core issue lies in how IP Filter caches decisions for fragmented packets. The cache lookup only checks IP ID, protocol, source, and destination address, not the destination port.
2.  **Out-of-Order Fragment Processing:**  The optimization that discards the cache entry after the last fragment is received in order can be bypassed by sending fragments out of order.
3.  **State Table Bypass:**  Even if a rule blocks all fragmented traffic ("block in quick all with frag"), IP Filter prioritizes state table entries over rule-base evaluation which can be exploited with a non-fragmented packet.
4. **Lack of Destination Port Check in Cache:** IP Filter's cache mechanism does not include destination ports when making decisions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Firewall Bypass:** An attacker can bypass the firewall's filtering rules, gaining access to TCP/UDP ports that should otherwise be blocked.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** This vulnerability could allow an attacker to connect to services that are supposed to be protected, such as a vulnerable FTP server (port 21 in the example) even if the attacker only has access to a service such as a webserver on port 80.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Fragment Manipulation:** The attacker crafts a series of fragmented packets to manipulate the IP Filter's decision cache and state table
2.  **Out-of-Order Fragment Delivery:**  By sending the fragments out of sequence, the attacker maintains the cached "pass" decision longer than intended.
3.  **State Table Exploitation:** The attacker first sends a non-fragmented packet to a permitted port to create an entry in the state table. Subsequently, the crafted fragmented packets bypass the filter rule.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to a host protected by IP Filter.
*   **Ability to Send Packets:** The attacker needs the ability to send IP packets with specific source and destination addresses, as well as control over fragmentation.
*   **Knowledge of Open Ports:** The attacker needs to know an open port on the target machine to exploit the state table bypass.
*   **Packet Crafting:** The attacker needs to be able to craft specific packets, including fragmented packets and TCP or UDP packets with modified destination ports.
*   **Tooling:** The content provides a modified version of fragrouter 1.6 to carry out the attack

**Summary of Attack Steps:**

1.  **Create a decoy packet (B)**: make a copy of a packet (A) to a blocked port, and modify the destination port to an open port.
2.  **Send decoy packet (B)**: which creates a state table entry.
3.  **Fragment decoy packet (B):**  into three fragments (B1, B2, and B3).
4.  **Send fragment B1 first:** It matches the state table and passes the filter and also caches the decision.
5.  **Send B3, then B2:**  out of order, causing the cached decision to persist.
6.  **Send the original packet (A):** It will match the cache entry and pass the firewall.
