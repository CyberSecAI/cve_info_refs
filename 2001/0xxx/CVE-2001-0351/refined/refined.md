This document provides details for multiple vulnerabilities affecting the Windows 2000 Telnet service, and CVE-2001-0351 is one of them.

**CVE-2001-0351 Details:**

*   **Root cause:** This is one of four denial-of-service vulnerabilities caused by a system call that can be made using only normal user privileges, which has the effect of terminating a Telnet session.
*   **Weakness:** A program running with normal user privileges can make system calls to terminate a Telnet session.
*  **Impact:** An attacker with the ability to load and run a program on the Telnet server can terminate any Telnet session.
*   **Attack vector:** The attacker needs to be able to execute code on the target server with normal user privileges.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have the ability to load and run a program on the Telnet server. This would likely require interactive logon rights.
