Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2001-0815:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the `perlIS.dll` ISAPI extension of ActivePerl when handling overlong filenames in HTTP requests. The DLL does not properly check the length of the URL before copying it to a stack buffer using `strcpy()`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a classic stack-based buffer overflow. The lack of input length validation when handling the URL allows an attacker to write beyond the boundaries of the buffer allocated on the stack.
- **Insecure Function:** The use of `strcpy()` without bounds checking makes the code vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code remotely on the server.
- **Privilege Escalation:** On IIS 5.0, an attacker might gain access to the `IWAM_machinename` account, while on IIS 4.0, they could obtain `Local SYSTEM` privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** The attack vector is through a specially crafted HTTP request containing an overlong URL.
- **Overlong Filename/URL:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending an excessively long filename as part of the URL to the web server hosting the vulnerable `perlIS.dll`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- **Understanding of the Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to craft a specific overlong URL that will overflow the buffer.

**Additional Details:**
- The advisory provides a specific example of how to exploit this vulnerability using the `lynx` command.
- It also notes a workaround, which is to enable the "Check that file exists" option for the `perlIS.dll` ISAPI extension in the Internet Service Manager.
- The vendor (ActiveState) has released a patch (version 5.6.1.630) that addresses this vulnerability.
