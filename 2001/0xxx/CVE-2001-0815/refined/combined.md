## FAQs

 What languages, platforms, and systems does the ActiveState platform support and integrate with?

The ActiveState platform supports the most recent versions, and one version prior, of Perl, Python, Tcl, Ruby, Java, and Go at the Free tier and above. When a language community ends their support for a version, that version will no longer be available for free, but will remain available at Business Tier and will be eligible for Extended Support on Enterprise Tier for a period that is generally five years past End of Life.

Currently, the ActiveState platform supports Linux for x86 at Glibc 2.17 and newer, Windows 10 18H2 and newer on x86, Windows Server 2019 and newer on x86, and OS X 11 and newer on x86 and emulation of x86.

The ActiveState platform offers integrations with GitHub and PyPI, Cloudera ML and custom Docker images, JFrog Artifactory, Jupyter Notebooks, and popular IDEs such as PyCharm, Eclipse, and Visual Studio Code. [Learn more](https://docs.activestate.com/platform/ide_integrations/) about our integrations today.

 What is the ActiveState State Tool?

The State Tool is ActiveState’s Command Line Interface that is designed to help developers create, share, and manage language-specific runtime environments and packages across a variety of supported languages. [Learn more](https://docs.activestate.com/platform/state/).

 Do you have a quick reference for using the ActiveState State Tool?

Reference our [handy guide](https://platform.activestate.com/state-tool-cheat-sheet) with all the most important State Tool CLI commands to get you started with your ActiveState runtime.

 Are there other resources available for free?

Definitely! Every language has a community of developers, documentation aimed at those developers, and some way for them to talk with each other. Sites like [CPAN](https://www.cpan.org/), [PerlMonks](https://www.perlmonks.org/), [the Tcler’s Wiki](https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/) [Python discussion](https://discuss.python.org), [Java Programming forums](https://www.javaprogrammingforums.com/), and [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) are available for users at all levels. Popular general forums like [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) also host discussions on programming.

 How can I import and manage requirements with the ActiveState platform?

Platform build projects can be represented as a file. Python projects can use requirements.txt, pipfile, pipfile.lock, pyproject.toml, or poetry.lock file formats. Perl projects can use CPAN file or meta.json format. Ruby projects can use gemlock.file format. Read [more details](https://docs.activestate.com/platform/projects/managing_requirements/) in our documentation.

NSFOCUS Security Advisory(SA2001-07)

Topic:  ActivePerl PerlIS.dll Remote Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

Release Date£º 2001-11-15

CVE CAN ID : CAN-2001-0815
BUGTRAQ ID : 3526

Affected system:
================

Activestate ActivePerl 5.6.1.629 and earlier versions
 - Microsoft IIS 4.0
 - Microsoft IIS 5.0

Not affected system:
====================

Activestate ActivePerl 5.6.1.630
 - Microsoft IIS 4.0
 - Microsoft IIS 5.0

Impact:
=========

NSFOCUS Security Team has found a exploited buffer overflow vulnerability in
a dynamic link library (perlIS.dll) of ActivePerl when handling overlong
filename. Exploit of it, an attacker could remotely execute arbitrary code.

Description£º
============

ActivePerl is a binary package of perl for Linux, Solaris or Windows system
developed by ActiveState. ActivePerl for windows has a dynamic link library,
perlIS.dll, which is a ISAPI extension to provide high-performance perl
interface for Microsoft IIS server.

PerlIS.dl was discovered to handle perl script request sent by user without
correct length check of the URL. In case that an attacker send an overlong URL
request, PerlIS would call strcpy() and copy it to a stack buffer, which would
trigger a buffer overflow. Attacker could overwrite some sensitive data in the
stack like returned address. With well-crafted URL request, the attacker might
be able to execute arbitrary code remotely.

Exploiting this vulnerability successfully, an attack might access
IWAM_machinename account in IIS 5.0 and Local SYSTEM privilege in IIS 4.0.

Exploit:
==========

$ lynx [http://host/cgi-bin/`perl](http://host/cgi-bin/%60perl) -e 'print "A" x 360'`.pl

The remote procedure call failed.

Workaround:
===================

Edit "perlIS.dll" ISAPI extension in Internet Service Manager and check "Check
that file exists" option.

Vendor Status:
==============

2001.10.15  We reported this vulnerability to ActiveState.
2001.10.23  ActiveState informed that the vulnerability has been eliminated in
            build 630.

Latest version of ActivePerl is available at

<http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActivePerl/download.plex>

Additional Information:
========================

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has
assigned the name CAN-2001-0815 to this issue. This is a
candidate for inclusion in the CVE list (<http://cve.mitre.org>),
which standardizes names for security problems.  Candidates
may change significantly before they become official CVE entries.
