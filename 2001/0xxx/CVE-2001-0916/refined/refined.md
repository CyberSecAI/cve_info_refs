The provided content describes a vulnerability in Berkeley pmake versions 2.1.33 and below.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a format string bug in `src/job.c` and a buffer overflow in `src/str.c`. Specifically, the `DBPRINTF` function uses user-controlled data (`commandShell->errCheck`) as the format string, allowing for arbitrary memory reads and writes through format string specifiers. Additionally, a buffer overflow can occur in `tstring` if the format string is too long.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Format String Vulnerability:** User-controlled input used as format string in `DBPRINTF`.
- **Buffer Overflow:**  A 512-byte buffer `tstring` in `src/str.c` can be overflowed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Local Root Compromise:**  The format string vulnerability can be exploited to overwrite memory locations, potentially including return addresses, leading to arbitrary code execution with root privileges since pmake is setuid root. The buffer overflow, when combined with the format string vulnerability, also leads to local root compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- By crafting a malicious Makefile that defines a custom shell with a format string in the `check` variable, an attacker can control the format string passed to `DBPRINTF` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create/modify Makefiles.
- The attacker needs to have local access to the system where pmake is installed with setuid bit enabled.
