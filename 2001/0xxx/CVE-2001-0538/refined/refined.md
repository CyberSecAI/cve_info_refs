Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an unsafe ActiveX control called "Microsoft Outlook View Control" that is installed with Microsoft Outlook. This control exposes a function that allows manipulation of Outlook data and execution of arbitrary code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Unsafe ActiveX Control:** The "Microsoft Outlook View Control" exposes a "selection" property which provides access to user's mail messages.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The control exposes the Outlook "Application" object, which can be used to execute arbitrary programs on the user's computer.
*   **Data Manipulation:** The control can read, modify, and delete messages in a user's Outlook folders.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Outlook 2002:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Outlook. They can also read, modify, or delete email, calendar, and contact information.
*   **Outlook 2000 and 98:** An attacker can manipulate the user's folder view but cannot read, change, or delete data, or run code on the user's machine.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Web Pages:** An attacker can host a web page with malicious script (e.g., JavaScript or VBScript) or HTML that invokes the vulnerable ActiveX control when the user visits the page.
*   **HTML Email:** An attacker can send an HTML email that contains malicious script code that invokes the control when the user opens the email.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to create a malicious web page or craft a malicious HTML email with the exploit code.
*   The attacker must convince the user to either visit the malicious web page or open the malicious HTML email to trigger the exploit.
*   The attacker does not need any special privileges or access to the user's computer.

**Additional Details (beyond the basic CVE description):**

*   The vulnerable ActiveX control is identified by the CLSID: `0006F063-0000-0000-C000-000000000046`.
*   The vulnerability can be triggered by script code (ECMAScript/JavaScript, VBScript) or Java code delivered via HTML.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Georgi Guninski.
*   The "Outlook Email Security Update" (included with Outlook 2002 and available for older versions) mitigates the risk from HTML email attacks by disabling ActiveX controls in the Restricted Sites zone, where HTML emails are handled by default.
*   Patches are available for Outlook 2002 and 2000, but there is no patch for Outlook 98.
*   The severity is significantly higher for Outlook 2002, where arbitrary code execution is possible, compared to older versions.

This vulnerability allows for a significant compromise of user data and system control depending on the Outlook version used, posing a critical risk.
