- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A buffer overflow exists in the `rpc.yppasswd` service on Solaris due to inadequate input checks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code with superuser privileges on an NIS master server.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploiting the `rpc.yppasswd` service remotely.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Remote network access to the vulnerable `rpc.yppasswd` service on an NIS master server.
