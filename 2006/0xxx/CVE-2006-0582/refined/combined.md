How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# USN-253-1: heimdal vulnerability

18 February 2006

heimdal vulnerability

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 5.10](/security/notices?release=breezy)
* [Ubuntu 5.04](/security/notices?release=hoary)
* [Ubuntu 4.10](/security/notices?release=warty)

## Details

A remote Denial of Service vulnerability was discovered in the heimdal

implementation of the telnet daemon. A remote attacker could force the

server to crash due to a NULL de-reference before the user logged in,

resulting in inetd turning telnetd off because it forked too fast.

Please note that the heimdal-servers package is not officially

supported in Ubuntu (it is in the 'universe' component of the

archive). However, this affects you if you use a customized version

built from the heimdal source package (which is supported).

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 5.10

* heimdal-servers
  -

##### Ubuntu 5.04

* heimdal-servers
  -

##### Ubuntu 4.10

* heimdal-servers
  -

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

# Heimdal 0.7.2 and 0.6.6

```

A twin is forked into the world, Heimdal 0.7.2 and Heimdal 0.6.6, both are
healthy and represent an improvement over their older siblings.

You can find the source code here:

	ftp://ftp.pdc.kth.se/pub/heimdal/src/heimdal-0.7.2.tar.gz
	ftp://ftp.pdc.kth.se/pub/heimdal/src/heimdal-0.6.6.tar.gz

Both are signed by the Heimdal signing key:
     Heimdal Signing Key <heimdal@pdc.kth.se> keyid: 45D901D8

Heimdal 0.7.2 includes the following changes

* Fix security problem in rshd that enable an attacker to overwrite
  and change ownership of any file that root could write.

* Fix a DOS in telnetd. The attacker could force the server to crash
  in a NULL de-reference before the user logged in, resulting in inetd
  turning telnetd off because it forked too fast.

* Make gss_acquire_cred(GSS_C_ACCEPT) check that the requested name
  exists in the keytab before returning success. This allows servers
  to check if its even possible to use GSSAPI.

* Fix receiving end of token delegation for GSS-API. It still wrongly
  uses subkey for sending for compatibility reasons, this will change
  in 0.8.

* telnetd, login and rshd are now more verbose in logging failed and
  successful logins.

* Bug fixes

Heimdal 0.6.6 includes the following changes

* Fix security problem in rshd that enable an attacker to overwrite
  and change ownership of any file that root could write.

* Fix a DOS in telnetd. The attacker could force the server to crash
  in a NULL de-reference before the user logged in, resulting in inetd
  turning telnetd off because it forked too fast.

Thanks to those reporting bugs and waiting peacefully for the release,

Enjoy,
Assar, Jacques, Johan, Love, Luke

CERT advisory  :
BugTraq ID     :
Debian Bug     :

Two vulnerabilities have been discovered in heimdal, a free
implementation of Kerberos 5.  The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following vulnerabilities:

CVE-2006-0582

    Privilege escalation in the rsh server allows an authenticated
    attacker to overwrite arbitrary files and gain ownership of them.

CVE-2006-0677

    A remote attacker could force the telnet server to crash before
    the user logged in, resulting in inetd turning telnetd off because
    it forked too fast.

The old stable distribution (woody) does not expose rsh and telnet servers.

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.6.3-10sarge2.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your heimdal packages.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.
