The provided content discusses the results of a DNS survey conducted by The Measurement Factory. While it highlights several security misconfigurations and vulnerabilities in DNS servers, it does not specifically relate to CVE-2006-0987. The survey focuses on general issues like:

*   **Recursive name service:** Allowing arbitrary queriers, which can lead to cache poisoning and denial-of-service attacks.
*   **Zone transfers:** Allowing unauthorized zone transfers, which exposes information about internal networks and allows for denial-of-service attacks.
*   **Authoritative nameservers on the same subnet:** Making the network vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks.
*   **Mismatched nameserver records:** Can lead to decreased server availability and denial-of-service issues.
*   **Outdated BIND versions:** Exposing systems to known vulnerabilities.

These findings are not specific to any one CVE.
