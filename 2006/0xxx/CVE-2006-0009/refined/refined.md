  "cve": "CVE-2006-0009",
  "description": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Microsoft Office. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted routing slip within an Office document that could allow remote code execution. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system.",
  "affected_products": [
    "Microsoft Office 2000",
    "Microsoft Office XP",
    "Microsoft Office 2003"
  ],
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a buffer overflow in the handling of routing slips within Microsoft Office applications.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system, potentially taking complete control of the system.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Opening a specially crafted Office document (e.g., Word, Excel, PowerPoint) containing a malicious routing slip.",
       "Web-based attacks where a user is tricked into visiting a malicious website hosting the exploit."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a specially crafted Office document containing a malicious routing slip. They must then convince a user to open this document or visit a malicious website. If successful, they can gain the same user rights as the local user.",
     "required_attacker_position": "The attacker can be remote and unauthenticated."
  },
  "additional_notes": "The vulnerability can be triggered automatically in Office 2000. Office XP and 2003 require user interaction to open the malicious document or visit a malicious website."
