    "vulnerability": {
      "root_cause": "The Oracle PLSQL Gateway's PLSQLExclusionList, intended to restrict access to certain PLSQL packages, could be bypassed. The exclusion list was implemented as a blacklist, which is inherently difficult to maintain as all potentially dangerous items need to be known in advance.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The PLSQLExclusionList can be bypassed due to inadequate input validation and filtering.",
        "The blacklist approach to security is inherently flawed as it requires prior knowledge of all potentially harmful items."
      ],
      "impact": "A remote attacker can bypass the exclusion list and execute arbitrary PLSQL procedures with the privileges of the database user that the PL/SQL gateway is running under. This could lead to complete control over the database server.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Bypassing the exclusion list using newline characters before the package name.",
        "Bypassing the exclusion list using a character (0xFF) that gets converted to a 'Y' by the database server but not the gateway.",

    "vulnerability": {
        "root_cause": "The original workaround to prevent exploitation of the PLSQL Gateway flaw was too broad, breaking some applications. The fix was to narrow the workaround to only trigger on brackets in query string parameter names and not values.",

          "The initial workaround was overzealous, leading to denial of service for some legitimate requests."
