How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

In the past few days Oracle has criticized me for publishing a workaround
for a critical flaw in their PLSQL Gateway. This email will show that after
4 years of waiting for Oracle to try to get it right, I eventually decided
to take matters into my own hands and provide Oracle customers with more
help than Oracle is currently doing. Oracle - shame on you:
The Oracle PLSQL Gateway sits on a web server and allows web users to
execute PLSQL applications in an Oracle database server. When first
introduced, as long as a web user had the permission to execute the PLSQL
procedure and knew its name then they could execute it through the PLSQL
gateway. This clearly opens up a massive security risk and Oracle introduced
what is known as the PLSQLExclusionList to help limit exposure. Essentially,
if a web user attempts to access any plsql package listed in the exclusion
list then the Gateway rejects the user's request with a "forbidden" message.
So access to anything that started with "SYS.", for example, would be
blocked.
Or that's what's supposed to happen, anyway. There are two distinct problems
with this solution. Firstly, it's never worked and the exclusion list can be
totally bypassed and secondly, it's a half baked idea to begin with. Let's
delve deeper and examine both of these
When Oracle first introduced the exclusion list in 2001 it could be
trivially bypassed by preceding the plsql package name with a newline
character
http://www.example.com/pls/dad/%0ASYS.PACKAGE.PROCEDURE
I advised Oracle about this bypass problem in 2001 and, once Oracle
"patched" this, I published details in "Hackproofing Oracle Application
Server" (http://www.ngssoftware.com/papers/hpoas.pdf)
It didn't take long to discover that this patch could be bypassed using the
following techinque: due to internationalization, an Oracle database server
will convert the ? character (value 0xFF) to a capital Y. The PLSQL Gateway
will not. Thus, if we request
http://www.example.com/pls/dad/S%FFS.PACKAGE.PROCEDURE
the gateway will happily pass it over to the database server where the ? is
conveted to a Y and we can gain access again.
Oracle issued a patch for this but this patch was broken, too. What's
interesting is the story behind how I found the next bypass technique. I had
just reported some flaws in a few PLSQL applications in the database server
but there was only a risk if an attacker could bypass the exclusion list. As
Oracle had just released a "fix" for the bypass problem they stated they
were not going to fix the backend flaws. This is from the email they sent me
informing me that they weren't going to fix these issues
"We feel that our latest fix to security alert #68 will now correctly block
any request that matches the patterns defined in the exclusion list. The
OWA\_OPT\_LOCK package falls under the OWA\_\* pattern. Therefore, this request
will be blocked by the exclusion list feature. Since the exclusion list
cannot be bypassed anymore, we are not allowing anyone to call this package
from the browser, and thereby, blocking this PL/SQL injection from
happening."
This angered me as it was clear laziness on Oracle's part and they were
deliberately leaving their customers at risk. I then set out to find a new
bypass technique and eleven minutes after reading this mail I found what I
was looking for. This new bypass technique simplly involved enquoting -
putting SYS in double quotes:
http://www.example.com/pls/dad/"SYS".PACKAGE.PROCEDURE
Whilst this bypass worked on Oracle Application Server 9 - it didn't on 10g.
The technical reason for this is as follows. 10g App Server converts the
upper case SYS to the lower case sys - and if something is enquoted - it
needs to match the right case. However, a bypass trick that did work with
10g was to use angle brackets - these form a label in PLSQL.
http://www.example.com/pls/dad/<<LABEL>>SYS.PACKAGE.PROCEDURE
So come July 2005 Oracle had really made a mess of all this and introduced
their next patch. This can be bypassed too - this is the one I posted a
workaround for and we're all currently waiting on Oracle fixing.
Going back to the second problem - that is - the PLSQL Exclusion List is a
half baked idea to begin with. The exclusion list, by default, attempts to
block access to the following
SYS.\*
DBMS\_\*
UTL\_\*
OWA\_\*
OWA.\*
HTP.\*
HTF.\*
Thus, by default, access to packages owned by accounts such as CTXSYS or
MDSYS is not blocked. These two accounts are both DBAs and, what's more,
many of the PLSQL applications owned by these accounts have suffered from
security flaws. As the exclusion list doesn't block access to these
accounts, these flaws can be exploited via the web server to gain complete
control of the database server. The point is the exlusion list is a "black
list" solution and the problem with black lists is that you need to know in
advance everything that is bad and should be black listed. It's a much
easier proposition to know what is not bad though and only allow access to
this. This is a "white list" solution and I've been asking Oracle to give us
a white list solution to this problem for four years now - but they still
haven't done it. Explaining this further - let's say my web plsql
application consists of one package called "banking" and this package has a
number of procedures that implement typical banking tasks such as
"transfer", "pay", "show\_balance", etc, etc. If I had a white list solution
then I could say allow access if and only if the web users request starts
with "banking" and reject everything else. This is an entirely much more
secure and robust solution than the "black list" approach.
Will we ever be given this as a solution? Who knows. As it seems providing a
decent security solution is beyond Oracle at the moment - I'm not holding my
breath.
Come on Oracle - get your stuff together!
Cheers,
David Litchfield

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Oracle PL/SQL Gateway fails to properly validate HTTP requests

#### Vulnerability Note VU#169164

Original Release Date: 2006-01-27 | Last Revised: 2006-04-19

---

### Overview

The Oracle PL/SQL Gateway fails to properly validate HTTP requests. This may allow a remote attacker to execute SQL commands on an Oracle database.

### Description

| Oracle uses the Oracle PL/SQL Gateway to access Oracle databases over HTTP. A lack of validation in the Oracle PL/SQL Gateway may allow a remote attacker to bypass Oracle's security restrictions and gain access to critical packages and procedures. The Oracle PL/SQL Gateway uses a list of keywords to restrict access to powerful packages and procedures. Upon receiving a request to execute a procedure, the PL/SQL Gateway compares the request to the list to determine if that procedure attempts to access any restricted procedures or packages. However, a remote attacker may be able to bypass this check by sending a specially crafted HTTP request to the Oracle PL/SQL Gateway.  Note that all Oracle installations with the HTTP Server (Apache) enabled may be affected by this vulnerability. For more information see Oracle [Metalink](https://metalink.oracle.com/) Note 311536.1.According to public [reports](http://www.red-database-security.com/advisory/oracle_cpu_apr_2006.html), this issue is identified as PLSQL01 in the [Oracle Critical Patch Update for April 2006](http://www.oracle.com/technology/deploy/security/pdf/cpuapr2006.html). |
| --- |

### Impact

| If a remote attacker sends a specially crafted HTTP request to a vulnerable Oracle installation, that attacker may be able to execute SQL commands with elevated privileges. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply a patch**This issue is corrected by the [Oracle Critical Patch Update for April 2006](http://www.oracle.com/technology/deploy/security/pdf/cpuapr2006.html). |
| --- |

| **Set always\_describe or PlsqlAlwaysDescribeProcedure parameters to ON**  Set the always\_describe or PlsqlAlwaysDescribeProcedure to ON in the dads.conf file. According to [red database security](http://www.red-database-security.com/advisory/oracle_modplsql_injection.html): *PlsqlAlwaysDescribeProcedure specifies whether mod\_plsql should describe a procedure before trying to execute it. If this is set to "On", then mod\_plsql will always describe a procedure before invoking it. Otherwise, mod\_plsql will only describe a procedure when its internal heuristics have interpreted a parameter type incorrectly. If PlsqlAlwaysDescribeProcedure is enabled, Oracle tries to describe every PL/SQL procedure. If a hacker injects pl/sql code, Oracle tries to describe this specially crafted string but fails because this procedure does not exist.* **Disable Oracle's HTTP Server**As a general rule, disable or remove any nonessential software. In this case, the Oracle HTTP Server (Apache) should be disabled on any Oracle installations that do need to be accessible via HTTP. **Limit Access to HTTP Server**You may wish to block access to the vulnerable software from outside your network perimeter, specifically by blocking access to the ports used by the Apache HTTP server (typically 80/tcp). This will limit your exposure to attacks. However, blocking at the network perimeter would still allow attackers within the perimeter of your network to exploit the vulnerability. The use of host-based firewalls in addition to network-based firewalls can help restrict access to specific hosts within the network. It is important to understand your network's configuration and service requirements before deciding what changes are appropriate. |

|  |  | | **More on the workaround for the unpatched Oracle PLSQL Gateway flaw** **2006.02.03** Credit:  **[David Litchfield](https://cxsecurity.com/author/David%2BLitchfield/1/)**  Risk: **Medium** Local: ****Yes**** Remote: ****Yes**** CVE: **[CVE-2006-0435](https://cxsecurity.com/cveshow/CVE-2006-0435/ "Click to see CVE-2006-0435")** CWE: **[CWE-89](https://cxsecurity.com/cwe/CWE-89 "Click to see CWE-89")**  CVSS Base Score: **7.5/10** Impact Subscore: **6.4/10** Exploitability Subscore: **10/10** Exploit range: **Remote** Attack complexity: **Low** Authentication: **No required** Confidentiality impact: **Partial** Integrity impact: **Partial** Availability impact: **Partial** | | --- | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

According to Oracle, the workaround I posted, that prevents exploitation of
a critical vulnerability that Oracle has so far failed to fix, breaks
certain applications that sits atop their PLSQL Gateway. Though my
workaround prevents exploitation of the critical flaw and thus protects
vulnerable systems against attack, Oracle has made no effort to furnish me,
or anyone else for that matter, with more information on how the workaround
breaks some of their applications. As such, improving the workaround so it
doesn't break these few applications has been mildy annoying. But I think
I've tracked it down. The workaround as is
RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{QUERY\_STRING} ^.\*).\*|.\*%29.\*$
RewriteRule ^.\*$ http://127.0.0.1/denied.htm?attempted-attack
RewriteRule ^.\*).\*|.\*%29.\*$ http://127.0.0.1/denied.htm?attempted-attack
will trigger if a right facing bracket ')' appears in the PATH\_INFO or
\_anywhere\_ in the query string. Thus, if the value of a query string
parameter contains a bracket the workaround will trigger. As far as the flaw
is concerned, we need only concern ourselves with brackets that appear in
the query string parameter name - not in the value for the parameter name.
As such, if we modify the workaround to
RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{QUERY\_STRING} ^.\*).\*=|.\*%29.\*=$
RewriteRule ^.\*$ http://127.0.0.1/denied.htm?attempted-attack
RewriteRule ^.\*).\*|.\*%29.\*$ http://127.0.0.1/denied.htm?attempted-attack
we can prevent exploitation if the query string parameter name has a bracket
whilst still allowing brackets it the paramter value. This can be tidied up
to read
RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{QUERY\_STRING} ).\*=|%29.\*=
RewriteRule .? http://127.0.0.1/denied.htm?attempted-attack
RewriteRule )|%29 http://127.0.0.1/denied.htm?attempted-attack
# Thanks, Mike Pomraning!
For those that haven't been able to adopt the workaround because it would
break their specific application, then the modified workaround should work
in your situation.
Cheers,
David Litchfield
