  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2006-0183",
      "root_cause": "The ACal forum software uses only a cookie variable, `ACalAuthenticate`, for user authentication and does not perform password comparisons.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Authentication Bypass",
        "PHP Code Injection"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can bypass authentication and gain system access by setting the `ACalAuthenticate` cookie to `inside`. Registered users can then modify header.php and footer.php files, allowing them to inject arbitrary PHP code, leading to full system compromise.",
      "attack_vectors": "By manipulating the `ACalAuthenticate` cookie.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to set HTTP cookies. Registered users can leverage the ability to modify header.php and footer.php.",
       "additional_information": "This vulnerability allows for arbitrary PHP code execution by authenticated users who can modify header/footer PHP files. The provided proof-of-concept sets a cookie to bypass authentication, which is then leveraged for further attacks."
