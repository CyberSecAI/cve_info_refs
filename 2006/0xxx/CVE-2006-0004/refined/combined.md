# Security Update Severity Rating System

Attacks that impact customers' systems rarely result from attackers' exploitation of previously unknown vulnerabilities. Rather, they exploit vulnerabilities for which patches are available but not applied. For this reason, Microsoft recommends that customers make patching a priority. Currently available updates are listed in the [Security Update Guide](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/).

However, not all vulnerabilities are equally severe. To help customers understand the risk associated with each vulnerability we patch, we have published a severity rating system that rates each vulnerability according to the worst theoretical outcome were that vulnerability to be exploited.

| Rating | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Critical | A vulnerability whose exploitation could allow code execution ***without*** user interaction. These scenarios include self-propagating malware (e.g. network worms), or unavoidable common use scenarios where code execution occurs without warnings or prompts. This could mean browsing to a web page or opening email.  Microsoft recommends that customers apply Critical updates immediately. |
| Important | A vulnerability whose exploitation could result in compromise of the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of user data, or of the integrity or availability of processing resources. These scenarios include common use scenarios where client is compromised ***with***warnings or prompts regardless of the prompt's provenance, quality, or usability. Sequences of user actions that do not generate prompts or warnings are also covered.  Microsoft recommends that customers apply Important updates at the earliest opportunity. |
| Moderate | Impact of the vulnerability is mitigated to a significant degree by factors such as authentication requirements or applicability only to non-default configurations.  Microsoft recommends that customers consider applying the security update. |
| Low | Impact of the vulnerability is comprehensively mitigated by the characteristics of the affected component. Microsoft recommends that customers evaluate whether to apply the security update to the affected systems. |

The measure of a vulnerability’s severity is distinct from the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited. To assess that likelihood, the [Microsoft Exploitability Index](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/cc998259) provides additional information to help customers better prioritize the deployment of Microsoft security updates. This index provides customers with guidance on the likelihood of functioning exploit code being developed for vulnerabilities addressed by Microsoft security updates, within the first thirty days of that update's release.

While this severity rating system is intended to provide a broadly objective assessment of each issue, we strongly encourage customers to evaluate their own environments and make decisions about which updates are required to protect their systems.

## Frequently asked questions (FAQ) related to this security update

**Can I use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) 1.2.1 to determine whether this update is required?**

Yes, but for local scans only. MBSA uses an integrated version of the Office Detection Tool (ODT) which does not support remote scans of this issue. For more information about MBSA, visit the[MBSA Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134). For more information about MBSA support, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer 1.2 Q&A; Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33332).

**Can I use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) 2.0 to determine whether this update is required?**

No. MBSA 2.0 does not currently support the detection of PowerPoint 2000. You should use either the Office Detection Tool or MBSA 1.2.1 to determine if this update is required. MBSA 2.0 can detect security updates for products that Microsoft Update supports. For more information about the programs that Microsoft Update and MBSA 2.0 currently do not detect, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 895660](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/895660).
**Can I use Systems Management Server (SMS) to determine whether this update is required?**

Yes. SMS can help detect and deploy this security update. SMS uses MBSA for detection; therefore, SMS has the same limitation listed earlier in this bulletin related to programs that MBSA does not detect.
The Security Update Inventory Tool can be used by SMS for detecting security updates that are offered by [Windows Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21130), that are supported by [Software Update Services](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21133), and other security updates that are supported by MBSA 1.2.1. For more information about the Security Update Inventory Tool, see the following [Microsoft Web site](https://www.microsoft.com/smserver/downloads/2003/featurepacks/suspack). For more information about the limitations of the Security Update Inventory Tool, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 306460](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/306460).

SMS can also use the Office Inventory Tool to detect for required updates for Microsoft Office applications.

#### Workarounds for PowerPoint Temporary Internet Files Information Disclosure Vulnerability - CVE-2006-0004:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

* **Back up and remove the vnd.ms-powerpoint MIME type**
  Removing the vnd.ms-powerpoint registry key helps protect the affected system from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. To backup and remove the vnd.ms-powerpoint registry key, follow these steps:

  **Note** Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in Regedt32.exe.

  **Note** We recommend backing up the registry before you edit it.

  1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type â**regedit**" (without the quotation marks), and then click **OK**.
  2. Expand **HKEY\_CLASSES\_ROOT\MIME\Database\Content Type**, and then click**application/vnd.ms-powerpoint**.
  3. Click **File**, and then click **Export**.
  4. In the **Export Registry File** dialog box, type a file name in the **File Name** box, and then click **Save**.
  5. Click **Edit**, and then click **Delete** to remove the registry key.
  6. In the **Confirm Key Delete** dialog box, you receive an **âAre you sure you want to delete this key and all of its subkeys**â message. Click **Yes**.

**Impact of Workaround:** This workaround removes the MIME entry point for PowerPoint.

* **Configuration of Internet Explorer to open Office documents in the appropriate Office program instead of in Internet Explorer**

  1. Open **My Computer**.
  2. On the **Tools** menu (or the **View** menu), click **Folder Options** (or click **Options**).
  3. Click the **File Types** tab.
  4. In the **Registered file types** list, click the specific Office document type (for example\*\*, Microsoft Excel Worksheet\*\*), and then click **Advanced** (or click **Edit**).
  5. In the **Edit File Type** dialog box, click to clear the **Browse in same window** check box (or click to clear the **Open Web documentsin place** check box).
  6. Click **OK**.

  **Note** If you are running Terminal Server on Windows 2000 or Windows Server 2003, you may not be able to click **Advanced** to open the **Edit File Type** dialog box in step 4 of this procedure. This issue occurs if the NoFileAssociate policy is enabled. Enabling this policy prevents users (including administrators) from changing file type associations for all users. For additional information about this behavior, click the following article number to view the article in the [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 257592](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/257592/).
