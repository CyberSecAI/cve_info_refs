  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2006-0439",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by the lack of directory protection using htaccess in the default installation of Text Rider, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive data.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Sensitive Information Disclosure",
        "Insecure Default Configuration"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can retrieve registered user's information, including usernames and password's MD5 hashes. This can lead to cookie-based authentication compromise. An attacker gaining access to the admin user can edit \"config.php\" and upload arbitrary files, potentially leading to full system compromise.",
      "attack_vectors": "By accessing the unprotected directory containing sensitive files via a URL, an attacker can retrieve the data. Example URL: http://host/textrider/data/userlist.txt",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to know the URL of the vulnerable directory, typically a public URL of a Text Rider installation."
