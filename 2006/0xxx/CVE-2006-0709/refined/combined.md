How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2006-0709
BugTraq ID     : 16611
Debian Bug     : 352482

Ulf Harnhammar discoverd a buffer overflow in metamail, an
implementation of MIME (Multi-purpose Internet Mail Extensions), that
could lead to a denial of service or potentially execute arbitrary
code when processing messages.

For the old stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.7-45woody.4.

For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.7-47sarge1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.7-51.

We recommend that you upgrade your metamail package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: metamail: crashes with very long boundaries in messages
Package: metamail
Version: 2.7-50
Severity: important
Tags: patch

Hello,

I have found that metamail crashes when processing messages with very long
boundaries. They cause a buffer overflow, which doesn't seem to be exploitable:

metaur@metaur:~$ /usr/bin/metamail < metamail.txt
From: <metaur@localhost>
To: <metaur@localhost>
Subject: metamail crash bug

*** glibc detected *** free(): invalid next size (normal): 0x0805fc30 ***
Aborted
metaur@metaur:~$

I have attached a test message, as well as a patch.

BTW, what is in ./metamail, rather than ./src/metamail/??

Is it a different source version??  It has, instead, on line 447:

	LineBuf = malloc(LINE_BUF_SIZE);
	if (!LineBuf) ExitWithError(nomem);
	sprintf(LineBuf, "--%s", boundary);

How is this not [potentially] exploitable?

I don't know. I noticed that the source is included twice, but I haven't looked into why that is the case. FWIW, if you just patch the source in src and not in ., the resulting binaries seem to be fixed.

Well, because of the error message that it prints, and because of the way things look in gdb (if I remember correctly, it crashes in strtok() or some similar function).  I've been taught that this signifies not being exploitable, but I may be wrong.

What do the others in the Debian Security Audit Project think about this?

In my quick test with 2.7-50 from sid, it's the safety checks
in _int_free() that abort the process.

| *** glibc detected *** free(): invalid next size (normal): 0x0805fc30 ***
| Aborted
| metaur@metaur:~$

This may in fact be exploitable. The error indicates that a
malloc chunk header has been corrupted. Depending on the exact
circumstances - the version of glibc and the order of memory
allocations/frees in metamail - this may (or may not) be possible
to use for writing to arbitrary memory locations. Without having
looked at it in detail, I would consider this bug exploitable
unless it's proven not to be.

cheers,
Max

This is [CVE-2006-0709](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-0709) now.

Additionally, Red Hat sound confident that this is exploitable:

"This issue is a pretty standard heap based buffer overflow."

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](#c0)  Chad Huneycutt (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-03-20 12:11:53 UTC  ``` I noticed that after /etc/init.d/net.eth1 stop, dhcpcd was still running.  Upon perusal of the init script I see why -- there is no attempt to stop it.  Was this left out on purpose or just an oversight.  There is a test to check the iface_eth1 line in start(), so I guess we just need a similar test in stop() to determine if this is a dhcp interface and then just kill it in whatever means dhcpcd recommends (maybe dhcpcd -k?). ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Martin Schlemmer (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-03-20 23:15:45 UTC  ``` this is already fixed on cvs, due to a earlier report. ``` |  |
