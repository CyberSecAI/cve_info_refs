      "vulnerability": "File overwrite vulnerability in Oracle Reports",
      "description": "By specifying a special value for the parameter `desname`, Oracle Reports can overwrite any file on the application server. On Windows systems, an attacker can overwrite any file (e.g. boot.ini). On UNIX systems, an attacker can overwrite all files (e.g., opmn.xml) that belong to the Oracle Application Server user.",
      "root_cause": "Improper handling of the `desname` parameter in Oracle Reports allows for arbitrary file overwrites.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper input validation",
        "Path traversal vulnerability"
      ],
      "impact": "Arbitrary file overwrite, potentially leading to complete compromise of the application server (e.g., overwriting boot.ini on Windows or critical configuration files on Unix).",
      "attack_vectors": "HTTP requests with a crafted URL containing the `desname` parameter.",
       "required_capabilities": "Ability to send HTTP requests to the Oracle Reports server."

      "description": "Multiple vulnerabilities exist in numerous Oracle products, including Oracle Database, Application Server, Collaboration Suite, E-Business Suite, and more. The vulnerabilities may lead to remote execution of arbitrary code, the disclosure of sensitive information, and denial-of-service conditions.",
