{
  "vulnerability_1": {
    "title": "Register Globals Security Exploit",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by the PHP server setting 'register_globals' being enabled. When 'register_globals' is ON, it allows external user input to directly overwrite variables within the PHP script. This creates an opportunity for attackers to manipulate program flow and potentially inject malicious code.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use of PHP 'register_globals' setting, which is a deprecated feature due to its inherent security risks."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially inject malicious code, manipulate variables, and bypass security checks. The exact impact is not detailed but could lead to a compromise of the application and potentially the server.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "HTTP request parameter manipulation"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker only needs to send a crafted HTTP request."
  },
  "vulnerability_2": {
    "title": "Unauthorised Access to Admin File Manager",
    "root_cause": "The /admin/filemanager/upload.php script was accessible without an active admin session. This was due to the absence of proper authentication checks within the script itself.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Missing authentication check in `/admin/filemanager/upload.php`."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially upload malicious files to the server, leading to a full compromise of the application or server.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Direct access to the /admin/filemanager/upload.php URL"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker does not need any authentication to reach the vulnerability"
  },
  "vulnerability_3": {
    "title": "Remote Scripting Vulnerability",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a lack of input validation or sanitization in several include files of CubeCart, allowing arbitrary code execution when an include file is directly called by HTTP request.",
    "weaknesses": [
       "Lack of input validation or sanitization on include files.",
      "Direct execution of include files by HTTP requests"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could execute arbitrary code, potentially gaining full control of the application and the server.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Directly accessing include files through HTTP requests (e.g., includes/orderSuccess.inc.php)"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker does not need any authentication to reach the vulnerability"
  }
