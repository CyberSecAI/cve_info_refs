{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `vis.pl` script does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when constructing file paths. Specifically, it fails to check for and remove directory traversal characters like '..' and '/'.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Path traversal vulnerability",
      "Lack of input sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server, potentially including sensitive information such as password files or account details.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited through HTTP GET requests by manipulating the `s` parameter in the URL.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely with no authentication requirements. They only need the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server."
  },
  "additional_notes": "The provided content includes a suggested fix, which involves sanitizing the input by removing '..' characters. The content also indicates that all variables that open files are vulnerable."
