How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

From Andreas Sandblad, Secunia Research
-- SA15907: Mozilla Thunderbird Attachment Spoofing Vulnerability --
Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in Thunderbird, which can be
exploited by malicious people to trick users into downloading malicious attachments.
The vulnerability is caused due to attachments not being displayed correctly in
mails. This can be exploited to spoof the file extension and the associated file
type icon via a combination of overly long filenames containing whitespaces and
"Content-Type" headers not matching the file extension.
Successful exploitation may lead to malware being saved to e.g. the desktop.
NOTE: Attachments can be saved by dragging the attachment or using the "Save
As..." or "Save All..." functionality. For files on the desktop the icon can be
spoofed if it e.g. is a ".exe" or ".lnk" file.
-- PoC (Proof of Concept) --
The raw mail source to be sent can be found in mail.txt (in poc.zip). It is
recommended to send it manually via a telnet session.
E.g:
telnet <SMTP server> 25
HELO <SMTP server>
MAIL FROM: <FROM>
RCPT TO: <TO>
DATA
<mail.txt>
.
QUIT
Open mail, drag attachment to desktop and double click on it (see attached
screendumps). "You are vulnerable!" should be displayed in a dos window.
--
The vulnerability has been confirmed in Thunderbird 1.0.2 for Windows. Other
versions may also be affected.

If you "Open" the attachment (double-click) you get the helper-app dialog which
truncates on the left and strips out extra spaces to show the true .lnk
extension, although it does say "which is a: Text Document" because of the
Content-Type: text/plain. The dialog defaults to "Save", but the "Open" choice
is not disabled as it should be for executable types, but is harmless because
we'll open it in the default text handler (e.g. notepad).
But if you drag it you never see that, and by default the windos OS is going to
hide the .lnk extension
There's some similarity to the Michael Krax "firedragging" [bug 279945](/show_bug.cgi?id=279945 "VERIFIED FIXED - Image drag and drop allows to create executable files"). That fix
was specific to image dragging code, though, and that approach probably doesn't
work here: we can't just neuter executable extensions because it might actually
be a legitimate executable the user wants.
If we kept the true extension from getting pushed off the side that would go a
long way toward preventing this type of spoofing. Like the helper app dialog we
need to squeeze out runs of spaces, and truncate on the left if necessary to
keep the end of the filename visible.Whiteboard: [sg:spoof]

Attached patch

[the fix](attachment.cgi?id=190485&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=190485&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=300246&attachment=190485)

It looks like crop="center" now works! So I backed out our change to [Bug
#245331](/show_bug.cgi?id=245331 "RESOLVED FIXED - truncatting long filename of attachment") which allowed the attachment name to have an arbitrary width so we
would never truncate off the extension. Now each attachment name is given 15em
again. We then crop long names in the middle. I copied the code the external
helper app dialog is using to strip down chunks of white space into a single
space.
All of these issues are desireable UI changes.
The plus side is that fixing them the way we wanted them all along also fixes
this security issue.

Dan, I've checked this in and we now get rid of the extra white space and we
crop the file name so you always see the extension. Let me know if there's more
work you'd like to see here. Status: ASSIGNED → RESOLVEDClosed: 19 years agoResolution: --- → FIXED

Changes needed for SeaMonkey's attachment box. I did only strip trailing whitespace to avoid Windows dropping them in filename extensions; inner whitespace will be caught by the crop attribute anyway.
The patch is against trunk, but should apply to branch with no real changes.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
