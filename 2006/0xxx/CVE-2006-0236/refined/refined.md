CVE-2006-0236
```
The provided content describes a vulnerability in Mozilla Thunderbird related to attachment handling, specifically during drag-and-drop operations.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from how Thunderbird displays attachment filenames. By crafting an email with an attachment that has an excessively long filename containing spaces and a mismatched "Content-Type" header, an attacker can spoof the file extension and associated file type icon.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Inadequate filename handling: Thunderbird does not properly truncate or sanitize long filenames, particularly those with multiple spaces.
- Mismatched Content-Type: The "Content-Type" header does not always match the actual file extension, which can mislead users about the file's nature.
- Lack of proper visual cues: When dragging an attachment, users do not receive clear indicators of the actual file type, especially when the file extension is hidden by the operating system.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation can trick users into downloading and executing malicious attachments disguised as harmless files. For example, a malicious executable file (.exe) or shortcut (.lnk) could be disguised as a text file. This could lead to malware infection when the user drags the attachment to the desktop and double-clicks it.

**Attack vectors:**
- Email attachment: An attacker sends a specially crafted email with a malicious attachment.
- Drag-and-drop: The user drags the attachment from the email to a location on their computer (e.g., the desktop).
- Exploitation of OS file handling: The operating system, by default, might hide certain file extensions (like .lnk), further aiding the spoofing.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to craft emails: The attacker needs to be able to send emails with custom headers and attachments.
- Basic understanding of email protocols (e.g., SMTP): Telnet could be used to manually send the crafted email.

The vulnerability was discovered by Secunia Research.
