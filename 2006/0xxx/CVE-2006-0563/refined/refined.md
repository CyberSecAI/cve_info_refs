{
  "CVE-2006-0563": {
    "Description": "SQL injection vulnerability in exec.php in PluggedOut Blog 1.9.9c allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the entryid parameter in a comment_add action.",
    "Root cause": "The `entryid` parameter in the `comment_add` action within `exec.php` is not properly sanitized before being used in a SQL query.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection (CWE-89)"
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to data modification, data exfiltration, or complete database compromise.",
      "Attack vector": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted request to `exec.php` with the `action` parameter set to `comment_add` and a malicious `entryid` parameter.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable PluggedOut Blog instance and does not need any authentication.",
     "Additional details": [
        "The `db_sql_comment_add` function in `database.php` does not escape the `entryid` variable.",
         "The `comment_add` function in `exec.php` calls `db_sql_comment_add` without escaping the `entryid` parameter from the `$_REQUEST` array.",
          "The `entryid` parameter is directly used in an SQL query without proper sanitization."
      ]
