## Microsoft Windows TCP/IP fails to properly validate IGMP packets

#### Vulnerability Note VU#839284

Original Release Date: 2006-02-14 | Last Revised: 2006-02-19

---

### Overview

Microsoft Windows implementations of the TCP/IP protocol fail to properly validate IGMP packets, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

### Description

| **TCP and IGMP**  The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is defined in [RFC 793](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc793.txt) as a means to provide reliable host-to-host transmission between hosts in a packet-switched computer network. The Internet Group Management Protocol version 3 (IGMPv3) is defined in [RFC 3376](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3376.txt) as a protocol to help manage multicast connections over the internet. **The Vulnerability**The Microsoft implementation of TCP/IP fails to properly handle specially crafted IGMPv3 packets, possibly leading to a denial-of-service condition. For more information, including a list of vulnerable systems, please refer to Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS06-007](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS06-007.mspx). |
| --- |

### Impact

| By sending a specially crafted IGMPv3 packet to a vulnerable system, an unauthenticated, remote attacker could cause that system to stop responding. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an Update**  Microsoft has addressed this issue in Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS06-007](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS06-007.mspx). |

## **Vulnerability Management for a Variety of Industries**

Nearly every industry relies on applications and networks to conduct business, though some have more stringent security requirements than others. Organizations in the aviation, automotive, healthcare, and financial sectors have some of the strongest security regulations. Layers of security during software and application development as well as after product deployment are necessary to keep consumers safe and organizations compliant.

![airplane icon](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilitiesaviation.png)

### [Aviation](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guides/aviation-software-testing-guide)

Cybersecurity is crucial to the aviation industry. Travelers in the sky need to be protected from any attacks that can prevent airlines from operating normally. Those same customers need to have their payment and sensitive data protected when purchasing a ticket.

### [Automotive](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guide/how-fuzz-testing-helps-secure-automotive-industry)

Wireless connectivity is becoming commonplace inside of new vehicles. Automotive connectivity to WIFI and Bluetooth are making vehicles a bigger target for cybercriminals. One vulnerability can take down any vehicle with that technology. DAST, Black Box Fuzzing, and SAST during development are a solid foundation of security to prevent these attacks.

![](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-automative.png)

![heartbeat](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-healthcare.png)

### [Healthcare and Medical](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guides/security-testing-for-networked-medical-devices)

Wireless technology and application software are being used more in medical devices to automate and monitor individual healthcare needs. Device security is the utmost priority, preventing risks that can directly endanger lives. Application security is needed to prevent cyber attackers from tampering with devices and stealing private healthcare data. SAST and DAST during development can help find vulnerabilities that can compromise these devices.

### Critical Infrastructure and Industrial Facilities

Water, power, and gas are some prime targets for large scale attacks. The best way to keep cyberattackers from taking down an entire city’s water supply is to create a layered cybersecurity portfolio. From the start, vulnerabilities need to be identified, remediated, and constantly monitored to prevent a mass standstill of public utilities.

![lightning bolt icon](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-critical-industries.png)

![factory](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-manufactures.png)

### Discrete Manufacturers

Manufacturing industries keep building and assembling essential pieces for everyday life. Any attack on that automation would create a bottleneck in multiple industries that rely on these products. A disruption in manufacturing has been proven to drive up prices and create a negative workflow ripple worldwide. Using layered security solutions prior to deployment and scanning afterwards will help prevent any shutdown.

### Financial

Financial institutions are still top cyberattacker targets. Monetary apps for banks, credit unions, investment, and retirement firms need the highest cybersecurity measures. Security that prevents cyberattacks should be implemented during development and embedded directly into these applications. Compliance for this industry is only growing with each reported breach.

## Vulnerability Details

#### IGMP v3 DoS Vulnerability - CVE-2006-0021:

A [denial of service](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21142x) vulnerability exists that could allow an attacker to send a specially crafted IGMP packet to an affected system. An attacker could cause the affected system to stop responding.

#### Mitigating Factors for IGMP v3 DoS Vulnerability - CVE-2006-0021:

* Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.
  **Note** Windows Firewall will help protect against attacks utilizing a unicast IGMP v3 packet, however, it will not help protect against an attack utilizing a multicast IGMP v3 packet.

#### Workarounds for IGMP v3 DoS Vulnerability - CVE-2006-0021:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

* **Disable IGMP**

  Disabling IGMP will prevent an affected host from processing IGMP related packets that could cause a system to stop responding. IGMP processing can be disabled by following these steps:
  **Note** Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in Regedt32.exe.
  **Note** We recommend backing up the registry before you edit it.

  1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type "**regedit32** " (without the quotation marks), and then click **OK**.
  2. In Registry Editor, locate the following registry key: HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters\
  3. Add the DWORD Value: **IGMPLevel**. Set the value to **0**. This value disables IGMP processing. By default, this key does not exist.
  4. You must restart your system for this change to take effect.
* **Block all IGMP network packets at the firewall or router**

  Blocking IGMP packets at the firewall or at the router will help protect systems that are behind that firewall or router from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. We recommend that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet. ISA Server 2000 and ISA Server 2004 can be used to block the affected types of traffic.

  **Impact of Workaround:** These changes will help prevent attacks by restricting the ability of an attacker to send malformed IGMP packets to the affected host. This setting can also negatively impact network performance and communication by preventing the ability of routers to properly forward packets between subnets.

  **Note** Windows Firewall will help protect against attacks utilizing a unicast IGMP v3 packet, however, it will not help protect against an attack utilizing a multicast IGMP v3 packet.

#### FAQ for IGMP v3 DoS Vulnerability - CVE-2006-0021:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

**This is a** [denial of service](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21142) vulnerability. An attacker who exploited this vulnerability could cause the affected system to stop responding. During that time, the server cannot respond to requests. Note that the denial of service vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate their user rights, but it could cause the affected system to stop accepting requests.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The affected messages are not being ignored in certain cases that allow an attacker to send a malformed packet which may cause affected system to stop responding.

**What is IGMP?**

Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) is a TCP/IP standard defined in RFC 1112 "Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP)." In addition to defining address and host extensions for how IP hosts support multicasting, this RFC also defines the Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) version 1. RFC 2236, "Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP), version 2" defines IGMP version 2. Both versions of IGMP provide a protocol to exchange and update information about host membership in specific multicast groups. Additionally, the Windows Server 2003 family supports IGMP version 3, described in the Internet Draft titled "Internet Group Management Protocol, version 3." With IGMP version 3, hosts can specify interest in receiving multicast traffic from specified sources or from all but a specific set of sources. For more information about IGMP, visit the Microsoft Tech Net [Web site](https://technet.microsoft.com/windowsserver/en/library/ffa6231a-bf9b-4691-a63d-81c9cf66a34e).

**Who could exploit the vulnerability?**

Any anonymous user who could deliver a specially crafted message to the affected system could try to exploit this vulnerability.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could try to exploit the vulnerability by creating a specially crafted message and sending the message to an affected system. The message could then cause the affected system to stop responding.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations and Servers are both potentially at risk from this vulnerability.

**Could the vulnerability be exploited over the Internet?**

Yes. An attacker could try to exploit this vulnerability over the Internet. Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect against attacks that originate from the Internet. Microsoft has provided information about how you can help protect your PC. End users can visit the [Protect Your PC Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21169).

When you view the file information, it is converted to local time. To find the difference between UTC and local time, use the **Time Zone** tab in the Date and Time tool in Control Panel.

Windows XP Home Edition Service Pack 1, Windows XP Professional Service Pack 1, Windows XP Tablet PC Edition, Windows XP Media Center Edition, Windows XP Home Edition Service Pack 2, Windows XP Professional Service Pack 2, Windows XP Tablet PC Edition 2005, and Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005:

| File Name | Version | Date | Time | Size | Folder |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Tcpip.sys | 5.1.2600.1792 | 13-Jan-2006 | 01:13 | 340,480 | SP1QFE |
| Tcpip.sys | 5.1.2600.2827 | 13-Jan-2006 | 02:28 | 359,808 | SP2GDR |
| Tcpip.sys | 5.1.2600.2827 | 13-Jan-2006 | 17:07 | 360,448 | SP2QFE |

Windows XP Professional x64:

| File Name | Version | Date | Time | Size | Folder |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Tcpip.sys | 5.2.3790.2617 | 13-Jan-2006 | 04:13 | 702,976 | SP1GDR |
| Tcpip.sys | 5.2.3790.2617 | 13-Jan-2006 | 04:06 | 702,976 | SP1QFE |

**Notes** When you install these security updates, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.
If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the SP1QFE or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the SP1GDR or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the Update.exe installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you can use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. MBSA allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).
* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry keys.

  For Windows XP Home Edition Service Pack 1, Windows XP Professional Service Pack 1, Windows XP Tablet PC Edition, Windows XP Media Center Edition, Windows XP Home Edition Service Pack 2, Windows XP Professional Service Pack 2, Windows XP Tablet PC Edition 2005, and Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005:

  HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows XP\SP3\KB913446\Filelist

  For Windows XP Professional x64 Edition:

  HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows XP Version 2003\SP2\KB913446\Filelist

  **Note** These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly if an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams the 913446 security update into the Windows installation source files.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
