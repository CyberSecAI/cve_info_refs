# KARMA Attacks Radioed Machines Automatically

KARMA is a set of tools for assessing the security of wireless clients
at multiple layers. Wireless sniffing tools discover clients and their
preferred/trusted networks by passively listening for 802.11 Probe
Request frames. From there, individual clients can be targetted by
creating a Rogue AP for one of their probed networks (which they may
join automatically) or using a custom driver that responds to probes
and association requests for any SSID. Higher-level fake services can
then capture credentials or exploit client-side vulnerabilities on the
host.

KARMA includes patches for the Linux MADWifi driver to allow the
creation of an 802.11 Access Point that responds to any probed
SSID. So if a client looks for ‘linksys’, it is ‘linksys’ to them
(even while it may be ‘tmobile’ to someone else). Operating in this
fashion has revealed vulnerabilities in how Windows XP and MacOS X
look for networks, so clients may join even if their preferred
networks list is empty.

## **Vulnerability Management for a Variety of Industries**

Nearly every industry relies on applications and networks to conduct business, though some have more stringent security requirements than others. Organizations in the aviation, automotive, healthcare, and financial sectors have some of the strongest security regulations. Layers of security during software and application development as well as after product deployment are necessary to keep consumers safe and organizations compliant.

![airplane icon](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilitiesaviation.png)

### [Aviation](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guides/aviation-software-testing-guide)

Cybersecurity is crucial to the aviation industry. Travelers in the sky need to be protected from any attacks that can prevent airlines from operating normally. Those same customers need to have their payment and sensitive data protected when purchasing a ticket.

### [Automotive](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guide/how-fuzz-testing-helps-secure-automotive-industry)

Wireless connectivity is becoming commonplace inside of new vehicles. Automotive connectivity to WIFI and Bluetooth are making vehicles a bigger target for cybercriminals. One vulnerability can take down any vehicle with that technology. DAST, Black Box Fuzzing, and SAST during development are a solid foundation of security to prevent these attacks.

![](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-automative.png)

![heartbeat](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-healthcare.png)

### [Healthcare and Medical](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guides/security-testing-for-networked-medical-devices)

Wireless technology and application software are being used more in medical devices to automate and monitor individual healthcare needs. Device security is the utmost priority, preventing risks that can directly endanger lives. Application security is needed to prevent cyber attackers from tampering with devices and stealing private healthcare data. SAST and DAST during development can help find vulnerabilities that can compromise these devices.

### Critical Infrastructure and Industrial Facilities

Water, power, and gas are some prime targets for large scale attacks. The best way to keep cyberattackers from taking down an entire city’s water supply is to create a layered cybersecurity portfolio. From the start, vulnerabilities need to be identified, remediated, and constantly monitored to prevent a mass standstill of public utilities.

![lightning bolt icon](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-critical-industries.png)

![factory](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-manufactures.png)

### Discrete Manufacturers

Manufacturing industries keep building and assembling essential pieces for everyday life. Any attack on that automation would create a bottleneck in multiple industries that rely on these products. A disruption in manufacturing has been proven to drive up prices and create a negative workflow ripple worldwide. Using layered security solutions prior to deployment and scanning afterwards will help prevent any shutdown.

### Financial

Financial institutions are still top cyberattacker targets. Monetary apps for banks, credit unions, investment, and retirement firms need the highest cybersecurity measures. Security that prevents cyberattacks should be implemented during development and embedded directly into these applications. Compliance for this industry is only growing with each reported breach.

Microsoft Windows Silent Adhoc Network Advertisement
Platforms : Windows 2000/XP/2003
Application: Wireless Network Connection
(aka Microsoft Wireless Client)
Severity : High (albeit lame)
Synopsis
--------
This advisory documents an anomaly involving Microsoft's Wireless Network
Connection. If a laptop connects to an ad-hoc network it can later start
beaconing the ad-hoc network's SSID as its own ad-hoc network without the
laptop owner's knowledge. This can allow an attacker to attach to the laptop
as a prelude to further attack.
Details
-------
The following is a sample scenario:
- Alice has a wireless access point at home with an SSID of "linksys", which
she has successfully set up and connected to with her laptop.
- Alice goes to the airport (or train station or coffee shop) and opens her
laptop.
- Bob, who is sitting next to Alice, has a laptop configured with an ad-hoc
network advertising an SSID of "linksys".
- Alice's laptop when started looks for the SSID of "linksys", and attachs to
Bob's ad-hoc network.
- The next time Alice boots up the laptop when the Ethernet cable is not
attached and there is no "linksys" SSID in range, Alice starts advertising
an ad-hoc network with an SSID of "linksys".
This is basically a configuration error that spreads virus-like from laptop to
laptop. In field tests, numerous ad-hoc SSIDs such as "linksys", "dlink",
"tmobile", "hpsetup", and others have been documented.
The issue is compounded with a few additional caveats. Laptops with built-in
wireless connectivity are usually left with the wireless active. Additionally,
by default most wireless connections use DHCP to acquire an IP address. If
the DHCP request fails, Microsoft has implemented RFC 3927 [1] to provide an IP
address via APIPA (Automated Private IP Address) [2] in the 169.254.0.0/16
range [3]. This is known as a Link-Local address, and by default Link-Local is
turned on on all Windows platforms on all interfaces, including wireless
interfaces. Details of Microsoft's Link-Local implementation is in RFC 3927,
appendix A.4 (Microsoft is a co-author of RFC 3927).
Essentially this assigns the advertising ad-hoc network an IP address. On
Windows 2000 and Windows XP SP0 and SP1, this all happens in the background
without the user's knowledge -- on Windows XP SP2, the user is notified it has
"attached" to an ad-hoc network, when in fact it has simply started
advertising the ad-hoc network and the Link-Local address has been assigned. An
attacker can attach to the ad-hoc SSID and either manually assign an IP address
in the 169.254 class B or simply DHCP and await a time-out that assigns the
attacker's laptop an IP address via a Link-Local configuration. After passively
sniffing and awaiting the usual NetBIOS traffic and/or by running a ping sweep,
the victim's IP address can be discovered. The attacker can then perform the
various probes and attacks to gain access to the system.
If the attacker is impatient in waiting for determining the IP address of the
victim computer, the attacker can attach to the advertising SSID and offer up
a DHCP server. Windows systems running Link-Local addresses periodically probe
for a DHCP address, so the victim will eventually get the DHCP address and
switch to the new address supplied by the DHCP as opposed to continue using the
APIPA number. By tracking what IP addresses are being served by the DHCP
server, the attacker can spend more time on an attack and less time solving the
connectivity issue.
There is a warning about using Link-Local with wireless LANs due to the lack of
physical security in RFC 3927 section 5 paragraph 3, but unfortunately
Microsoft failed to properly heed this warning in spite of co-authoring the
RFC.
Tested configurations
---------------------
Field tests were conducted and the following systems were either positively
identified (sometimes via "shoulder surfing") or approximated based upon
passive fingerprinting of network traffic:
Windows 2000 SP 2
Windows 2000 SP 3
Windows 2000 SP 4
Windows XP Home Edition Gold
Windows XP Professional Gold
Windows XP Professional SP 1
Windows XP Professional SP 2
Windows 2003 (unknown patch level)
Lab tests were conducted with 2 laptops with the following configuration:
Windows XP Professional Gold
Windows XP Professional SP 2
Vendor Response
---------------
Microsoft was contacted on October 13, 2005. After numerous exchanges of emails
and a conference call, Microsoft was able to reproduce and isolate the issue
within their software. As there are multiple and easy-to-implement workarounds
for the issue, Microsoft has scheduled to include the fix in the next service
packs.
Solution/Workaround
-------------------
Until Microsoft releases Service Packs for the affected platforms, use one of
the following three workarounds:
Workaround #1:
Disable wireless when not in use. Simple, eh?
Workaround #2:
Use an alternate Wireless Client Manager, (e.g. for an integrated Intel Wifi
connector, use Intel PROSet/Wireless) as all others tested do not seem to
have the problem (this testing was not all-inclusive).
Workaround #3 (recommended):
1. Click on the Wireless option in the System Tray and open the Wireless
Network Connection window.
2. Click on "Change advanced settings".
3. In the Wireless Network Connection Properties window, click on the Wireless
Networks tab.
4. Click on the Advanced button.
5. Click on "Access point (infrastructure) networks only"
This workaround prevents you from connecting to any ad-hoc network in the
first place.
Comments
--------
Yes this is lame. I know this, don't email me with that info. However I deem it
serious due to the exposure in laptops with wireless.
In field tests, it became apparent that if the laptop user fired up their
laptop in the airport terminal and was advertising an ad-hoc network, when the
same laptop user fired up their laptop during the flight, they would in fact
be advertising the ad-hoc network during flight. This has a couple of
ramifications.
The first is that if wireless laptops with the wireless adapter enabled were
capable of interfering with the navigational systems as claimed by the airlines
then we would be having numerous in-flight incidents due to the high
proliferation of wifi-enabled laptops used by business people on flights. The
second ramification is that users sitting on a plane at 35,000 feet are not
going to be suspecting a network attack against the laptop in the lap, and so
any odd "side effects" from probe and attack attempts (service crashing, blue
screen or a restart) will be dismissed as a local system anomaly and not an
attack, allowing the attacker to be a little more aggressive.
Here is collected data from 4 domestic flights within the U.S. conducted during
September and October 2005. The data was collected using NetStumbler, NMap,
and Metasploit Framework [4] from a laptop running Windows XP:
Aircraft Laptops\* Ad-hoc Nets\*\* Live Targets Vulnerable\*\*\*

MD80 14 4 4 3
\* Number of laptops out and running at approximately the halfway point of the
flight.
\*\* In some cases, an ad-hoc network would form and other laptops would attach
to it instead of advertising their own ad-hoc network.
\*\*\* A system was classified as vulnerable if it could be remotely compromised
or it was open enough to allow files to be copied to or from the hard
drive. Vulnerabilities included CVE-2005-0059 (MS05-017), CVE-2005-1983

Microsoft Windows Silent Adhoc Network Advertisement
Platforms : Windows 2000/XP/2003
Application: Wireless Network Connection
(aka Microsoft Wireless Client)
Severity : High (albeit lame)
Synopsis
--------
This advisory documents an anomaly involving Microsoft's Wireless Network
Connection. If a laptop connects to an ad-hoc network it can later start
beaconing the ad-hoc network's SSID as its own ad-hoc network without the
laptop owner's knowledge. This can allow an attacker to attach to the laptop
as a prelude to further attack.
Details
-------
The following is a sample scenario:
- Alice has a wireless access point at home with an SSID of "linksys", which
she has successfully set up and connected to with her laptop.
- Alice goes to the airport (or train station or coffee shop) and opens her
laptop.
- Bob, who is sitting next to Alice, has a laptop configured with an ad-hoc
network advertising an SSID of "linksys".
- Alice's laptop when started looks for the SSID of "linksys", and attachs to
Bob's ad-hoc network.
- The next time Alice boots up the laptop when the Ethernet cable is not
attached and there is no "linksys" SSID in range, Alice starts advertising
an ad-hoc network with an SSID of "linksys".
This is basically a configuration error that spreads virus-like from laptop to
laptop. In field tests, numerous ad-hoc SSIDs such as "linksys", "dlink",
"tmobile", "hpsetup", and others have been documented.
The issue is compounded with a few additional caveats. Laptops with built-in
wireless connectivity are usually left with the wireless active. Additionally,
by default most wireless connections use DHCP to acquire an IP address. If
the DHCP request fails, Microsoft has implemented RFC 3927 [1] to provide an IP
address via APIPA (Automated Private IP Address) [2] in the 169.254.0.0/16
range [3]. This is known as a Link-Local address, and by default Link-Local is
turned on on all Windows platforms on all interfaces, including wireless
interfaces. Details of Microsoft's Link-Local implementation is in RFC 3927,
appendix A.4 (Microsoft is a co-author of RFC 3927).
Essentially this assigns the advertising ad-hoc network an IP address. On
Windows 2000 and Windows XP SP0 and SP1, this all happens in the background
without the user's knowledge -- on Windows XP SP2, the user is notified it has
"attached" to an ad-hoc network, when in fact it has simply started
advertising the ad-hoc network and the Link-Local address has been assigned. An
attacker can attach to the ad-hoc SSID and either manually assign an IP address
in the 169.254 class B or simply DHCP and await a time-out that assigns the
attacker's laptop an IP address via a Link-Local configuration. After passively
sniffing and awaiting the usual NetBIOS traffic and/or by running a ping sweep,
the victim's IP address can be discovered. The attacker can then perform the
various probes and attacks to gain access to the system.
If the attacker is impatient in waiting for determining the IP address of the
victim computer, the attacker can attach to the advertising SSID and offer up
a DHCP server. Windows systems running Link-Local addresses periodically probe
for a DHCP address, so the victim will eventually get the DHCP address and
switch to the new address supplied by the DHCP as opposed to continue using the
APIPA number. By tracking what IP addresses are being served by the DHCP
server, the attacker can spend more time on an attack and less time solving the
connectivity issue.
There is a warning about using Link-Local with wireless LANs due to the lack of
physical security in RFC 3927 section 5 paragraph 3, but unfortunately
Microsoft failed to properly heed this warning in spite of co-authoring the
RFC.
Tested configurations
---------------------
Field tests were conducted and the following systems were either positively
identified (sometimes via "shoulder surfing") or approximated based upon
passive fingerprinting of network traffic:
Windows 2000 SP 2
Windows 2000 SP 3
Windows 2000 SP 4
Windows XP Home Edition Gold
Windows XP Professional Gold
Windows XP Professional SP 1
Windows XP Professional SP 2
Windows 2003 (unknown patch level)
Lab tests were conducted with 2 laptops with the following configuration:
Windows XP Professional Gold
Windows XP Professional SP 2
Vendor Response
---------------
Microsoft was contacted on October 13, 2005. After numerous exchanges of emails
and a conference call, Microsoft was able to reproduce and isolate the issue
within their software. As there are multiple and easy-to-implement workarounds
for the issue, Microsoft has scheduled to include the fix in the next service
packs.
Solution/Workaround
-------------------
Until Microsoft releases Service Packs for the affected platforms, use one of
the following three workarounds:
Workaround #1:
Disable wireless when not in use. Simple, eh?
Workaround #2:
Use an alternate Wireless Client Manager, (e.g. for an integrated Intel Wifi
connector, use Intel PROSet/Wireless) as all others tested do not seem to
have the problem (this testing was not all-inclusive).
Workaround #3 (recommended):
1. Click on the Wireless option in the System Tray and open the Wireless
Network Connection window.
2. Click on "Change advanced settings".
3. In the Wireless Network Connection Properties window, click on the Wireless
Networks tab.
4. Click on the Advanced button.
5. Click on "Access point (infrastructure) networks only"
This workaround prevents you from connecting to any ad-hoc network in the
first place.
Comments
--------
Yes this is lame. I know this, don't email me with that info. However I deem it
serious due to the exposure in laptops with wireless.
In field tests, it became apparent that if the laptop user fired up their
laptop in the airport terminal and was advertising an ad-hoc network, when the
same laptop user fired up their laptop during the flight, they would in fact
be advertising the ad-hoc network during flight. This has a couple of
ramifications.
The first is that if wireless laptops with the wireless adapter enabled were
capable of interfering with the navigational systems as claimed by the airlines
then we would be having numerous in-flight incidents due to the high
proliferation of wifi-enabled laptops used by business people on flights. The
second ramification is that users sitting on a plane at 35,000 feet are not
going to be suspecting a network attack against the laptop in the lap, and so
any odd "side effects" from probe and attack attempts (service crashing, blue
screen or a restart) will be dismissed as a local system anomaly and not an
attack, allowing the attacker to be a little more aggressive.
Here is collected data from 4 domestic flights within the U.S. conducted during
September and October 2005. The data was collected using NetStumbler, NMap,
and Metasploit Framework [4] from a laptop running Windows XP:
Aircraft Laptops\* Ad-hoc Nets\*\* Live Targets Vulnerable\*\*\*
-------- -------- ------------- ------------ -------------
MD80 8 2 3 1
MD80 12 5 5 4
757 22 1 3 3
MD80 14 4 4 3
\* Number of laptops out and running at approximately the halfway point of the
flight.
\*\* In some cases, an ad-hoc network would form and other laptops would attach
to it instead of advertising their own ad-hoc network.
\*\*\* A system was classified as vulnerable if it could be remotely compromised
or it was open enough to allow files to be copied to or from the hard
drive. Vulnerabilities included CVE-2005-0059 (MS05-017), CVE-2005-1983
(MS05-039), open shares, and NULL access.
It should also be noted that while visiting Charlotte, NC (whose airport at
the time had no commercial wireless offering like TMobile or anything else) --
walking the terminal during massive eastcoast rain delays with most flights
delayed by a couple of hours -- I counted no less than 62 ad-hoc devices. The
novelty of collecting data during flight was the focus of the table above, but
a conservative estimate would put have of those ad-hoc devices at risk.
