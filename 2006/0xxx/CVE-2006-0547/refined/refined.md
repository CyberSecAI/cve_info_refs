        "source": "www.red-database-security.com_b58f41bd_20250125_103125.html",
        "vulnerability": "SQL Injection vulnerabilities in multiple Oracle packages",
        "details": "The document lists numerous SQL Injection vulnerabilities in various Oracle PL/SQL packages and Java classes. These vulnerabilities occur due to improper sanitization of user-supplied parameters in several functions and procedures within packages like KUPV$FT, DBMS_DATAPUMP, DBMS_REGISTRY, DBMS_CDC_UTILITY, DBMS_CDC_PUBLISH, DBMS_METADATA_UTIL, CTXSYS, CATINDEXMETHODS, and DBMS_XMLSCHEMA. Specifically, these parameters are vulnerable to SQL Injection: user_name, job_name, linkname, operation, job_mode, jobid, handle, master_objid, event_number, level, remote_link, SYS_CONTEXT('REGISTRY$CTX','NAMESPACE'), TRIGGER_NAME, path, comp_id, root_directory, col, tab, I_MF, name, text_value, OBJNUM_FUNCTION, SORTOBJNUM_FUNCTION, sqlstmt, username, tablename, P_IDX (Record), RESTAB, IA.INDEXSCHEMA, IA.INDEXNAME, SCHEMANAME, and TYPENAME. Also notes that the most dangerous bug is DB18 due to ease of exploit and wide affected versions. Exploits are already available for DB18.",
        "impact": "Successful exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary SQL statements with elevated privileges, potentially leading to data breaches, privilege escalation, and denial of service.",
        "attack_vector": "The attack vector is through crafted SQL statements injected via vulnerable parameters of stored procedures.",
         "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would need to be able to interact with the affected Oracle database and call these procedures, meaning access to network and database."

        "source": "www.kb.cert.org_602f7f59_20250125_103124.html",
        "vulnerability": "Oracle TNS protocol authentication bypass",
        "details": "The Oracle TNS protocol fails to properly sanitize authentication requests. Specifically, the 'AUTH_ALTER_SESSION' parameter, intended for setting session attributes, can be used to inject arbitrary SQL statements. This is because the value of this parameter is not sanitized and is executed in the context of the SYS user. The issue is identified as Oracle vuln# DB18, and requires valid login credentials to exploit.",
        "impact": "A remote attacker with valid login credentials can execute arbitrary SQL statements with elevated privileges, including creating new database accounts with DBA privileges.",
         "attack_vector": "The attack vector is through a crafted 'AUTH_ALTER_SESSION' parameter within the TNS authentication request.",
         "attacker_capabilities": "A remote attacker needs valid login credentials to exploit this vulnerability."
