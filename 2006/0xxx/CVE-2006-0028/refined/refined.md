  "CVE-2006-0028": {
    "Description": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Excel using a malformed parsing format file. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Excel file that could allow remote code execution.",
    "Root cause": "Improper handling of malformed BOOLERR records during the parsing of the BIFF file format used by Microsoft Excel.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insecure reference to user-supplied data during the processing of malformed BOOLERR records.",
       "Vulnerable parsing of the BIFF file format"
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system with the privileges of the user opening the malicious file. Complete control of the client workstation could be achieved if the user has administrative privileges.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Opening a specially crafted .XLS file.",
       "Web-based attacks require hosting a malicious website and persuading a user to visit it."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
      "The attacker needs to create a malicious .XLS file.",
      "The attacker needs to trick the target into opening the malicious .XLS file."
    ],
     "Additional Information": "The vulnerability can be exploited automatically in Office 2000, but requires user interaction in Office XP and Office 2003."
