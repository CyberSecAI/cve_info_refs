Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2006-0015:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by how FrontPage Server Extensions handle parameter validation, leading to a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject malicious script into a user's session with a website.
- The script would execute in the security context of the user and perform actions on behalf of the user on the website.
- Actions could include monitoring the web session, forwarding information, running code on the user's system, and reading/writing cookies.
- If the user has administrative rights on the Front Page Server Extensions 2002 or SharePoint Team Services 2002 server, a successful exploit could grant complete control of the affected system to the attacker.
- Attackers could install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts.

**Attack vectors:**
- Web-based attack: An attacker would need to know the name of the Front Page Server Extensions 2002 or SharePoint Team Services 2002 server to inject the malicious script. They would also need to persuade users to visit a malicious website, often by tricking them into clicking a link.
- E-mail based attack: An attacker could send a specially crafted e-mail message to a user of a server running the vulnerable software, persuading the user to click a malicious link.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attackers need to be able to craft malicious URLs and/or emails
- Attackers need to convince a user to visit the malicious URL/site or click a malicious link.
- The attacker would have to know the name of the Front Page Server Extensions 2002 or SharePoint Team Services 2002 server to be successful in a web based attack scenario.

**Additional notes:**
- User interaction is required to exploit the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is rated as "Moderate" severity.
- The security update modifies the way FrontPage Server Extensions handles HTML validation to remove the vulnerability.
- Microsoft recommends applying the security update.
