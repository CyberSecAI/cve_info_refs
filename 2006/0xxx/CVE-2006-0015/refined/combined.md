# Security Update Severity Rating System

Attacks that impact customers' systems rarely result from attackers' exploitation of previously unknown vulnerabilities. Rather, they exploit vulnerabilities for which patches are available but not applied. For this reason, Microsoft recommends that customers make patching a priority. Currently available updates are listed in the [Security Update Guide](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/).

However, not all vulnerabilities are equally severe. To help customers understand the risk associated with each vulnerability we patch, we have published a severity rating system that rates each vulnerability according to the worst theoretical outcome were that vulnerability to be exploited.

| Rating | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Critical | A vulnerability whose exploitation could allow code execution ***without*** user interaction. These scenarios include self-propagating malware (e.g. network worms), or unavoidable common use scenarios where code execution occurs without warnings or prompts. This could mean browsing to a web page or opening email.  Microsoft recommends that customers apply Critical updates immediately. |
| Important | A vulnerability whose exploitation could result in compromise of the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of user data, or of the integrity or availability of processing resources. These scenarios include common use scenarios where client is compromised ***with***warnings or prompts regardless of the prompt's provenance, quality, or usability. Sequences of user actions that do not generate prompts or warnings are also covered.  Microsoft recommends that customers apply Important updates at the earliest opportunity. |
| Moderate | Impact of the vulnerability is mitigated to a significant degree by factors such as authentication requirements or applicability only to non-default configurations.  Microsoft recommends that customers consider applying the security update. |
| Low | Impact of the vulnerability is comprehensively mitigated by the characteristics of the affected component. Microsoft recommends that customers evaluate whether to apply the security update to the affected systems. |

The measure of a vulnerability’s severity is distinct from the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited. To assess that likelihood, the [Microsoft Exploitability Index](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/cc998259) provides additional information to help customers better prioritize the deployment of Microsoft security updates. This index provides customers with guidance on the likelihood of functioning exploit code being developed for vulnerabilities addressed by Microsoft security updates, within the first thirty days of that update's release.

While this severity rating system is intended to provide a broadly objective assessment of each issue, we strongly encourage customers to evaluate their own environments and make decisions about which updates are required to protect their systems.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

In addition, please read [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 917138](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/917138) for instructions on how to deploy this specific security update using SMS.

**I have FrontPage 2002 installed, but it is not listed in the affected software section. Why am I being offered the security update?**

FrontPage 2002 is not vulnerable to the vulnerability. However, because FrontPage 2002 uses some of the updated files, the security update will be recommended through Office Update and through MBSA to customers who have FrontPage 2002 installed.

**How can I determine if I am running FrontPage Server Extensions 2002 or SharePoint Team Services?**

To determine the version of FrontPage Server Extensions that is installed on your computer, follow these steps.

**Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
2. In the **Search Results pane**, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type **fpadmdll.dll** and then click **Search**.
4. If you find the **fpadmdll.dll** file, you have either FrontPage Server Extensions 2002 installed or SharePoint Team Services installed.

To determine which of these programs you have installed, follow these steps:

1. In Control Panel, open **Add or Remove Programs**.
2. See if "Microsoft SharePoint" as appears in the list of installed software.

If a list entry called "Microsoft SharePoint" exists, then you do have SharePoint Team Services installed.

**What updates does this release replace?**

This security update replaces a prior security update. The security bulletin ID and affected operating systems are listed in the following table.

| Bulletin ID | Microsoft FrontPage Server Extensions 2002 shipped on Microsoft Windows Server 2003 and Microsoft Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 | Microsoft FrontPage Server Extensions 2002 downloaded and installed on Microsoft Windows Server 2000 Service Pack 4, Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 1, and Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 2 | Microsoft SharePoint Team Services 2002 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [**MS03-051**](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/ms03-051) | Not Applicable | Replaced | Not Applicable |
| [**MS05-006**](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/ms05-006) | Not Applicable | Not Applicable | Replaced\ |

**Can I use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) 1.2.1 to determine whether this update is required?**

Yes, MBSA 1.2.1 will support SharePoint Team Services for Local Scans only. MBSA uses an integrated version of the Office Detection Tool (ODT) which does not support remote scans of this issue. For more information about MBSA, visit the MBSA Website. For more information about MBSA support, visit the following [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer 1.2 Q&A; Website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33332).
MBSA 1.2.1 does not support the detection of support Web downloadable FrontPage Server Extensions 2002. For more information about MBSA, visit the [MBSA Website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).

For more information about the programs that MBSA 1.2.1 currently does not detect, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 306460](https://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=306460). However, Microsoft has developed a version of the [Enterprise Scan Tool (EST)](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/894193) that will help customers determine whether the security updates provided in this security bulletin are required. For more information, see the "Can I use a version of the [Enterprise Scan Tool (EST)](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/894193) to determine whether this update is required?" question in this section.

**Can I use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) 2.0 to determine whether this update is required?**

Yes. MBSA 2.0 will determine whether this update is required for SharePoint Team Services. MBSA 2.0 can detect security updates for products that Microsoft Update supports. For more information about MBSA, visit the [MBSA Website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).
MBSA 2.0 does not currently support the detection of Web downloadable FrontPage Server Extensions. However, Microsoft has developed a version of the Enterprise Scan Tool (EST) that will help customers determine whether the security updates provided in this security bulletin are required. For more information, see the "Can I use a version of the Enterprise Scan Tool (EST) to determine whether this update is required?" question in this section. For more information about the programs that Microsoft Update and MBSA 2.0 currently do not detect, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 895660](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/895660).

**What is the Enterprise Update Scanning Tool (EST)?**

As part of an ongoing commitment to provide detection tools for bulletin-class security updates, Microsoft delivers a stand-alone detection tool whenever the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) and the Office Detection Tool (ODT) cannot detect whether the update is required for an MSRC release cycle. This stand-alone tool is called the [Enterprise Scan Tool (EST](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/894193)) and is designed for enterprise administrators. When a version of the Enterprise Update Scanning Tool is created for a specific bulletin, customers can run the tool from a command line interface (CLI) and view the results of the XML output file. To help customers better utilize the tool, detailed documentation will be provided with the tool. There is also a version of the tool that offers an integrated experience for SMS administrators.

**Note** The Enterprise Scan Tool (EST) will only be able to detect not deploy for the Web downloaded Front Page Server Extensions 2002 on Windows Server 2000 Service Pack 4, Windows XP Service Pack 1, or Windows XP Service Pack 2.

**Can I use a version of the** **Enterprise** **Scan Tool (EST) to determine whether this update is required?**

Yes. Microsoft has created a version of the EST that will determine if you have to apply this update. For download links and more information about the version of the EST that is being released this month, visit the following [Microsoft Web site](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/894193). SMS customers should review the "Can I use Systems Management Server (SMS) to determine whether this update is required?" FAQ for more information about SMS and EST.

**Can I use Systems Management Server (SMS) to determine whether this update is required?**

Yes. SMS can help detect and deploy this security update. SMS uses MBSA for detection; therefore, SMS has the same limitation listed earlier in this bulletin related to programs that MBSA does not detect. However, there is a version of the EST that SMS customers can obtain that offers an integrated experience for SMS administrators. To obtain this version of the EST, visit the following [Microsoft Web site](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/894194).

**Note** If you are using SMS to deploy the security update for FrontPage Server Extensions 2002 when downloaded and installed on Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 4, Microsoft XP Service Pack 1, or Microsoft XP Service Pack 2, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 917138](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/917138) for more information.

SMS can use the SMS Software Update Services (SUS) Feature Pack to detect security updates. The SMS SUS Feature Pack includes the Security Update Inventory Tool (SUIT).

## Vulnerability Details

#### Cross-site Scripting FrontPage Server Extensions Vulnerability - CVE-2006-0015

The cross-site scripting vulnerability could allow an attacker to run client-side script on behalf of an FPSE user. The script could spoof content, disclose information, or take any action that the user could take on the affected web site. Attempts to exploit this vulnerability require user interaction. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability against an administrator could take complete control of a Front Page Server Extensions 2002 server.

#### Mitigating Factors for Cross-site Scripting FrontPage Server Extensions Vulnerability - CVE-2006-0015:

* By default, Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) 6.0 is not enabled on Microsoft Windows Server 2003.
* By default, FrontPage Server Extensions are not enabled on Microsoft Windows Server 2003.
* You are not vulnerable if you have installed Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) 5.0 on Windows Server 2000 Service Pack 4. You are also not vulnerable if you have installed Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) 5.1 on Windows XP Service Pack 1 or on Windows XP Service Pack2 and if you have the default installation of FrontPage Server Extensions 2000.
* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to know the name of the Front Page Server Extensions 2002 or SharePoint Team Services 2002 server to inject the malicious script. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site.
* The vulnerability could not be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful, a user must click a Web link that is sent in an e-mail message.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same rights as the userâs rights on the Front Page Server Extensions 2002 or SharePoint Team Services 2002 server. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

#### Workarounds for Cross-site Scripting FrontPage Server Extensions Vulnerability - CVE-2006-0015:

We have not identified any workarounds for this vulnerability.

#### FAQ for FrontPage Server Extensions Vulnerability - CVE-2006-0015:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a cross-site scripting vulnerability that could allow an attacker to convince a user to run a malicious script. If this malicious script is run, it would execute in the security context of the user. Attempts to exploit this vulnerability require user interaction.

The script could take any action on the user's behalf that the Web site is authorized to take. This could include monitoring the Web session and forwarding information to a third party, running other code on the user's system, and reading or writing cookies.

If a user has administrative user rights on the Front Page Server Extensions 2002 or SharePoint Team Services 2002 server, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability is caused by the way that FrontPage Server Extensions handles parameter validation.

**What are the FrontPage Server Extensions?**

FrontPage Server Extensions is a set of tools that can be installed on a Web site. They allow authorized personnel to manage the server, add or change content, and perform other tasks. They also add functions that Web pages frequently use, such as search and forms support.

**What is cross-site scripting?**

[Cross-site scripting (XSS)](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/archive/security/news/crssite.mspx) is a security vulnerability that could enable an attacker to "inject" code into a user's session with a Website. The attack involves Web servers that dynamically generate HTML pages. If these servers embed browser input in the dynamic pages that they send back to the browser, these servers can be manipulated to include content in the dynamic pages. This will allow malicious script to be executed. Web browsers may perpetuate this problem through their basic assumptions of "trusted" sites and their use of cookies to maintain persistent state with the Websites that they frequent. This attack does not modify Website content. Instead, it inserts new, malicious script that can execute at the browser level in the information context that is associated with a trusted server.

**How does cross-site scripting work?**

Web pages contain text and HTML markup. Text and HTML markup are generated by the server and are interpreted by the client. Servers that generate static pages have full control over the way that the client interprets the pages that the server sends. However, servers that generate dynamic pages do not have control over the way that the client interprets the serversâ output. If untrusted content is introduced into a dynamic page, neither the server nor the client has sufficient information to recognize that this action has occurred and to take protective measures.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

**An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could perform actions on the behalf of the user on the Web site.**

**Who could exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could create an e-mail message that is specially crafted to try to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending this specially crafted e-mail message to a user of a server that is running an affected software application. An attacker could then persuade the user to click a link in the e-mail message.

In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to know the name of the Front Page Server Extensions 2002 or SharePoint Team Services 2002 server to be successful which the user has access to in order to inject the malicious script. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Website. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Website, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations and servers that have Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS), FrontPage Server Extensions 2002 or SharePoint Team Services installed are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if users who do not have sufficient administrative permissions are given the ability to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**Could the vulnerability be exploited over the Internet?**

Yes. An attacker could try to exploit this vulnerability over the Internet.

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that FrontPage Server Extensions handles HTML validation.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued
