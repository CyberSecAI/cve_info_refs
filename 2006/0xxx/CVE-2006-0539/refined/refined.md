**fcron Vulnerability Information**

The provided text is a changelog and news archive for the `fcron` software. While it doesn't explicitly detail a vulnerability corresponding to CVE-2006-0539, it does provide a history of security-related fixes in fcron versions. Here's a breakdown of relevant points:

*   **Vulnerabilities Fixed:** The changelog and news entries mention several security vulnerabilities fixed in various `fcron` versions:
    *   **fcron 3.0.5**: Fixed a security issue allowing malicious users to read fcron configuration files and non-root user's fcrontabs.
    *  **fcron 2.9.5.1:** Fixed security vulnerabilities in `fcronsighup`.
    *   **fcron 2.9.3**: Fixed an issue where fcron didn't check root-installed fcrontabs for standard users, potentially allowing unintended execution of jobs as root.
    *   **fcron 2.0.0**: Fixed a symlink attack vulnerability in `fcrontab`.
    *   **fcron 1.0.1**: A user could read a root file via `fcrontab -u user -e`.
    *   **fcron 0.9.5**: Jobs in fcrontabs reinstalled by root were run as root until the next action of the owner.
    *   **fcron 0.9.3**: Contained a bug that allowed any user to run tasks as root.

*   **Types of Vulnerabilities:** These fixes indicate the presence of various vulnerabilities:
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Several bugs enabled users to gain root privileges or run jobs as root when they shouldn't have been able to.
    *   **File Access:** Some vulnerabilities allowed reading of sensitive files (configuration, other users' cron jobs).
    *   **Symlink Attack:** A symlink attack was possible against fcrontab.
    *   **Buffer Overflow**: A buffer overflow was identified in the `convert-fcrontab` program (though reported as non-exploitable).

*   **Impact:** The impact of these vulnerabilities could range from unauthorized access to sensitive information to complete compromise of the system through privilege escalation.

*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vectors often involve:
    *   Manipulating fcrontab entries.
    *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in `fcrontab` or `fcronsighup`.
    *   Exploiting issues with how fcron handles file permissions or user privileges.

*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    * A standard user account on the system is often sufficient.
    * The attacker usually needs to be able to modify or create `fcrontab` entries.
    *  For some vulnerabilities, the attacker may need to trick root into running specific commands.

**Missing Information:**

*   **Specific CVE-2006-0539 Details:** The provided content doesn't specify what the nature of CVE-2006-0539 is.
*   **Exact Vulnerability Details:** While a pattern emerges of privilege escalation and file access issues, the content is a changelog, not a technical analysis of a specific vulnerability.

**Conclusion:**

The content provides a good overview of historical security fixes in `fcron` but does not specifically address CVE-2006-0539. However, it does demonstrate a history of security issues, including privilege escalation, unauthorized file access, and symlink attacks. This highlights the importance of keeping the software up to date to address known vulnerabilities.
