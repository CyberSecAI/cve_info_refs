# 1.3. Changes

**From version 3.3.1 to 3.3.2**

* Add compilation option (configure's '--with-max-fcrontab-reload-delay-seconds') to allow faster or even instant reload for non-root users (thanks Elliot Wolk).
* Added fcron.conf option 'maildisplayname', to configure the displayname fcron uses when sending email. This allows fcron to be configured ot be RFC5322-compliant (thanks Marco Emilio "sphakka" Poleggi)
* Fixed fcrondyn output issue where two lines would be joined due to a long shell command.
* Improve documentation wording (thanks Michael Kopp)

**From version 3.3.0 to 3.3.1**

* Updated SELinux code to stop using deprecated headers (fixes build on more recent systems)
* Install programs with R/W perms for the owner
* Fixed @reboot when using systemd
* Various other fixes and improvements in doc, install and boot scripts (in particular under systemd)

**From version 3.2.1 to 3.3.0**

* fcron now handles computer suspend/resume. On Linux systems, fcron can detect resumes and measure the suspend time. On other OSes, a script must be run at suspend and resume via system hooks.
* Added a new option 'runatresume' (as well as a Vixie-cron-style '@resume' shortcut), to run a job when the system resumes from suspend/hibernation.
* Refactored the socket (for fcrondyn), suspend and select code.

**From version 3.2.0 to 3.2.1**

* @-line can now be run every second (minimum every 10s previously)
* Fixed occasional 1s slippage. This was due to a race condition between when time\_to\_sleep is run and when we compute how long to sleep for, which could happen in the following second: if that happened we end up sleeping for 1s instead of not sleeping at all. The fix was to replace time\_to\_sleep() by next\_wake\_time().
* add From: header to emails. Similarly to other crons, use: "From: %s (fcron)" with %s
  being either the user the job is run as or the value of MAILFROM.
* The installation script now supports systemd fully.

**From version 3.1.3 to 3.2.0**

* Print date as %Y-%m-%d (the ISO 8601 date format), to avoid being ambiguous in international context. Also always use the ':' as hour:minute separator (there was a couple of 'h' instead).
* Don't fully disable a @-line when something goes wrong (e.g. fcron didn't shut down cleanly). The idea was to prevent infinite loops, but this was overkill. Instead set its next execution to now+frequency.`
* Cosmetic changes in the log lines (quote the job shell commands) and fcrondyn (use the pipe char "|" as a column separator).
* Fixed file descriptor leak when executing jobs in case of NSS failures (thanks Pavel Stano).

**From version 3.1.2 to 3.1.3**

* Fixed compilation on Solaris 10, and fixed fcrondyn authentication without a password on that platform.
* Fixed bug where LONG\_MAX could potentially be used in functions like localtime(), which is too big for localtime(). This was unlikely to happen unless there was another problem in the first place.
* fcrondyn -x no longer adds null characters at the end of the output. This would cause problems if the output was piped to something as grep. Thanks Dimitri Semitsoglou-Tsiapos for pointing this out.
* Fixed minor bug in fcronsighup resulting in log errors about closing the signal file
* fcrondyn no longer crashes when receiving an EOF when using readline (thanks Wade Carpenter for the patch)
* fcrontab no longer crash if mailto is empty (thanks Olaf for reporting the issue)
* Fixed SELinux issue with Linux user being used instead of the SELinux user (thanks Sven Vermeulen for the patch)

**From version 3.1.1 to 3.1.2**

* bug fix: fixed fcron crash bug when using fcrondyn
* bug fix: the configure option --without-sendmail was not working correctly.
* bug fix: inline runas wouldn't work with Vixie-cron style shortcut lines.
* bug fix: fixed bug in the code to log to a file.
* systemd: fixed the installation on systems using systemd, and also don't kill jobs when killing fcron.
* Made file closures more robust to prevent bugs difficult to troubleshoot to creep in.

**From version 3.1.0 to 3.1.1**

* Added readline support for fcrondyn
* tweaked 'make indent' options and applied
* Fcron can now log to a file (without syslog) - thanks Matthew Signorini.
* fixed fcrontab edition of \*ly lines (hourly, daily, etc)
* fixed fcron crashes when noticenotrun was triggered

**From version 3.0.6 to 3.1.0**

* Vixie cron compatibility: added options @reboot, @daily, @hourly, etc. Also added more generic options runatreboot, rebootreset and runonce.
* Pass fcrondyn client credentials through the socket when possible so as the user doesn't need to type their password when using fcrondyn.
* added audit (libaudit) support
* Better validation of string arguments of fcrontab options. In particular for timezones, previously a space could be added at the beginning or the end of the timezone with no warning, and this led fcron to use an unexpected timezone, which could cause confusion.
* Allow tasks to run every seconds
* don't inherit fcron's environment when running a job but build the environment from scratch (cleaner, and this is what Vixie cron does)
* fcron now sets the email headers X-Cron-Env and Auto-Submitted (as described in RFC 3834).
* email encoding: fcron now sets the email headers Content-Type and Content-Transfer-Encoding. They can be controlled by setting the CONTENT\_TYPE and CONTENT\_TRANSFER\_ENCODING variables in fcrontabs.
* Added systemd service definition (thank you Reiner)
* Allow Makefile parallelism (e.g. make -j 4)
* bug fix: fcrontab: don't alert about invalid character when correcting fcrontab twice
* bug fix: fixed free\_safe() function (replaced by macro).
* bug fix: configure script: usage of sendmail couldn't be disabled
* bug fix: fixed a potential (unlikely) 1 byte overflow in strncat() in socket.c
* Quite a lot of code clean-up and refactoring -- e.g. implemented generic unordred list for lavgq / exeq.

**From version 3.0.5 to 3.0.6**

* Fixed bug preventing normal user from running fcrontab -l if fcron's uid!=gid
* Fixed fcrontab's PAM initialization when working on the systab user.
* Added check\_system\_crontabs.sh which is to replace the less portable check\_system\_crontabs.bash.
* Added option -c to check\_system\_crontabs.sh to specify a fcron.conf file to use
* Fixed Makefile bug preventing installation when building from a different folder than the sources (wrong fcron.conf path)

**From version 3.0.4 to 3.0.5**

* Security issue: fixed security issue that allowed malicious user to read any file readable by group 'fcron' (in particular fcron's config files and the fcrontabs of non-root users). On systems without seteuid() (i.e. quite exotic systems) then the bug is harder to exploit but any file could be read.
* Improved general security of fcrontab and fcrondyn by dropping more privileges.
* Work on portability (aix, hpux, irix, tru64 unix, solaris). Thanks Peter O'Gorman for his patch!
* Patched startup script to make it more compliant to the LSB.
* Increased maximum number of fcrontab entries from 256 to 1024.
* bug fix: if fcron could not fork() to run a job, then the job would still appear to be running until fcron is restarted (thanks Alexander Y. Fomichev for noticing this bug).
* bug fix: fcrontab used to accept MAXENTRIES+1 fcrontab entries
* chdir to /tmp before executing the editor (as some editor needs to be able to read information on the current folder).

**From version 3.0.3 to 3.0.4**

* Initialize the random number generator with some values specific to the machine so as two fcron started exactly at the same time on two different machines run their random jobs at different time. This is useful for clusters for instance.
* Added option erroronlymail so as the output of a job is emailed only when the job exited with a non-zero status.
* Bug fix: in certain conditions, jobs could be executed outside their interval of execution when using option random on %-lines.
* Fixed bug which prevented the pid of the job to be written to the (grand-)parent process. This was not a major issue but would prevent fcrondyn from working well with the concerned jobs. This bug was caused by a close() function applied twice on a file descriptor, which would trigger the bug in some rare occasions (only one affected linux system reported).
* Fixed bug which would stop fcron from running any job any more on the affected system and until fcron was restarted if the bug above occured.
* Cleaned-up the closures of file descriptors (check for errors, etc).

**From version 3.0.3-rc1 to 3.0.3**

* The configure script now check that the make command is GNU make (which is required to build fcron).

  Bug fix: better handling of getpwnam() errors (we cannot rely on errno to spot an error). This was causing problems for AIX for instance.

**From version 3.0.2 to 3.0.3-rc1**

* New configure scripts, with more standard default values for paths, etc. This aims at simplifying the packaging of fcron. Thanks go to Patrice Dumas for his patch!
* New make targets: perms and strip. This aims at simplifying the packaging of fcron. Thanks go to Patrice Dumas for his patch!
* Set environment variable LOGNAME when running a job (as Vixie Cron does: thanks Martin McGreal for pointing that out).
* Portability work for AIX 5.2 and Solaris 8 and 10 (thanks Martin McGreal).
* Chmod()ed fcron's fifo file to 777. It was 666 previously, but the exec bit is needed for AIX and apparently ignored on other platforms, so we now set it to.
* Set TZ environment variable for lines which uses fcron option timezone.
* A file was closed twice by fcrontab: removed the duplicate close().
* Replaced include sys/termios.h by termios.h.
* Fixed a fcrontab bug cause by an return value not handled and resulting in many useless (but pretty much harmless) iteration in a loop.

**From version 3.0.1 to 3.0.2**

* Use sockaddr's field sa\_len/sun\_len on system defining it (BSD, ...). It should allow fcrondyn to connect to fcron on these systems.
* Non-SELinux systems: run each job in a different session by calling setuid() for each one of them. This is to improve compatibility with Vixie cron.
* Don't use the shell defined in /etc/passwd by default, but use the default value from fcron.conf instead. This is for compatibility with Vixie cron.
* Use root name and group instead of root uid and gid. This seems more logical since the configure scripts asks for the name and group and not the uid and gid.
* Added an init file for Suse in script/ (contribution from Alex: thanks!).
* Minor spelling fixes in the French documentation.

**From version 3.0.0 to 3.0.1**

* fcrontab: access user's directory with user's rights (necessary if user/group fcron has not the right to read the directory).
* improvement in check\_system\_crontabs: more comments, added some help messages, added command line options, cleaner, safer code.
* Improved English documentation: clarified some previously-unclear points.
* Added French translation of the manual pages (thanks go to Alain Portal)
* Removed old documentation from the package.
* Better handling of the pipes in job.c: this should remove some problems encountered on BSD systems.
* bug fix: do not use a tv\_usec > 999999: should fix the problem encountered on BSD systems with select().
* bug fix: fixed a bug in make\_msg(): the size of a string written to a buffer was not controlled correctly in some cases. This could result in buffer overflow and thus this was security problem. However the bug seems not exploitable as the part of the string which could overflow the buffer could not be freely defined by an attacker (it was either ": " or one of the strings returned by strerror()).
* Bug fix: set the FDs correctly for select().

**From version 2.9.7 to 3.0.0**

* Added a missing entry in changelog (changes from 2.9.6 to 2.9.7, bug fix for NetBSD).
* Merged a patch for the check\_system\_crontabs script (Security enhancements and cleanups).

**From version 2.9.6 to 2.9.7**

* Added time zone support (option timezone).
* Better support FreeBSD's users and groups modifications in
  fcron's install scripts.
* Fixed a bug which used to make fcron send empty mails on very
  recent systems.
* Fixed a bug which prevented fcrondyn to being used on NetBSD (thanks go to Gabor Z. Papp).
* Added some casts in fileconf.c and save.c (to avoid some
  warnings when compiling on HP-UX).
* Added a FAQ entry on how to emulate an anacron entry.

**From version 2.9.5.1 to 2.9.6**

* fixed the bug which made jobs run an hour too early after a
  daylight saving time change.

  Added detailed explanations about when a job will run when
  there is a DST change in the FAQ.
* fixed fcrondyn's "Unknown command" bug on x86\_64 (thanks go to
  Georgi Georgiev).
* made fcrontab behave better when there is no space left in the
  spool directory (used to truncate the fcrontab source file).
* Added a script, check\_system\_crontabs, to emulate Vixie cron's
  behavior about /etc/crontab and /etc/cron.d. Please have a look
  at the top of script/check\_system\_crontabs for more information.
* HP-UX support (needs more tests).
* bug fix: restore umask even if fcron runs
  unprivileged.

**From version 2.9.5 to 2.9.5.1**

* Fixed serious security vulnerabilities in fcronsighup, and
  improved fcronsighup's overall security (drop privileges, better
  check user inputs, etc).
* Fixed several typos in the doc.
* Updated debian package scripts (patch from debian
  maintainer).

**From version 2.9.4 to 2.9.5**

* Ported to HP-UX (thanks go to Scott Tinsley)
* Implemented fcrondyn commands run and runnow.
* Merged patch from Russell Coker for new SE Linux.
* Merged debian/ dir for debian package.
* Mail reports: put the same username in the To: field than the
  one we give as recipient to the MTA. mailto can now also be a
  fully qualified email address.
* changed a log message: a job which has ended without error is
  reported has "completed" (which is more appropriated than
  "terminated").
* Internal changes in log.c: code is more segmented, and code
  has been added to be able to send log message to fcrondyn. Syslog
  messages are now never longer than MAX\_MSG (even with string from
  strerror()).
* Fixed a bug which happened on Daylight Saving Time change on
  some systems. It would make fcron run into a nasty infinite loop.
  Added a sanity check in set\_nextexe() to avoid such
  things.
* Fixed a crash bug: in 2.9.4, if a user run ls\_exeq when a job
  is running and has been removed from its fcrontab, it makes fcron
  crash.
* Fixed a small bug: scripts were supposing perl was in
  /usr/bin.
* Fixed a bug which caused the pid of a child process to be
  incorrectly read
* fixed memory leak: some strings returned by log.c:make\_msg()
  weren't always free()d.
* bug fix: fcrondyn commands renice and kill used not to handle
  correctly the case where a job has several entries in exeq
  (exesev jobs).

**From version 2.9.3 to 2.9.4**

* Merged support for SE Linux (patch from Russell Coker: thanks!)
* Work on the documentation (fixed spelling mistakes, tried to
  make things clearer in fcrontab.5) (thanks Bill Wohler for your
  help!)
* Changed the subject line of mail reports: it now contains the
  subject line, and is very similar to vixie cron's one.
* Added a sum-up at the end of ./configure.
* bug fix: "makewhatis" bug is fixed -- at last!

  In fact, the problems encountered were due to an abusively
  ignored signal SIGPIPE.
* bug fix: possible crash of fcron when trying to save a file
  if there was no space left on device.
* bug fix: we don't consider '-' and '\_' as word delimiters for
  a username before the command anymore, since many programs have
  one of these characters in their name.
* bug fix: option first was broken in fcron 2.9.3.
* fixed a little typo in an error message
  (could->couldn't)
* bug fix: do not ignore the last line of a fcrontab if there
  is no \n before the end of file.
* fixed compile on SunOS 5.9 .
* Fcron now compiles on MacOS X.
* added some $srcdir to be able (again ;) ) to run configure
  from another directory.
* Perf improvement: use buffer for i/o in run\_job().

**From version 2.9.2 to 2.9.3**

* security issue: fcron used not to check the fcrontabs
  installed by root for a standard user. This could make an
  inattentive superuser install a user job runas(root)
  involontary.
* Perf improvement: we now use buffers to write something to
  disk (became necessary due to the use of O\_SYNC).
* To avoid loss of data in case of an hardware failure or a
  system crash, fcron now saves files to a temporary name, and then
  renames them to their definitive filename if everything's
  ok.
* The PID indicated by fcrondyn is now the pid of the job itself
  (up to now, it was the one of the fcron process controlling the
  job).
* Implemented functions kill (send a signal to a running job)
  and renice (change the priority of a running job) in
  fcrondyn.
* Added fcron's option -q to control the lavg and serial queue
  sizes.
* Added some timeouts in fcron for fcrondyn clients.
* Fcron is less restrictive concerning mailto addresses. In
  particular, you can now use address like user@host.
* bug fix: in 2.9.2, fcrontab and fcron did not set correctly
  some file modes.
* bug (introduced in 2.9.1): when a job stops with an non-zero
  exit status or because it has been signaled, send a mail to its
  owner to inform him (in 2.9.1 and 2.9.2, the mail was sent, but
  contained nothing).
* code clean: use the same scheme for all struct types, removed
  some code redundancy (save to disk management).

**From version 2.9.1 to 2.9.2**

* Added a system fcrontab. Root can access it with fcrontab by
  using "-u systab".
* fcrondyn's ls\_lavgq, ls\_serialq and ls\_exeq are now
  functional.
* mailto can now be set to a non-real user (for ex., an
  alias).
* fcron now calls shutdown() when a connection from fcrondyn is
  closed. Another change in the code should prevent fcrondyn from
  not returning to the prompt after a command has been run.
* use open() instead of fopen() to write files, for more
  security.
* fcrontab sets euid=uid before running the editor. This is
  required by some programs (for instance, perl).
* bug fix: using DESTDIR with make did not work with the
  doc.
* Code clean: changed macros to make parameters clearly
  different from vars.

**From version 2.9.0 to 2.9.1**

* fcron can now be run without root's privileges ([see FAQ](faq.html))
* added configure's option --with-boot-install .
* Minor change in the PAM code of fcron: may work better on
  some systems.
* configure script now uses getpwnam() and getgrnam() instead of
  reading directly /etc/passwd and /etc/group: this makes easier
  the use of NIS, LDAP, etc.
* Bug fix: using some "cmd > /dev/stderr" (or stdout) in a
  script used to make fcron send a bogus output mail. (rewrite of
  the code managing the output of jobs)
* Bug fix: typo error prevented fcrontab to be compiled on some
  systems.
* Minor bug fix about stdout option.
* Minor bug fix: giving fcrontab's option -c a relative path
  now works correctly.

**From version 2.1.0 to 2.9.0**

* Added some new options to fcron: -y, -o, -l; and some
  fcrontab options: stdout and volatile. All these permit to make
  fcron run in foreground, execute all the pending jobs (mainly
  %-jobs), and return. May be used, for instance, in a ppp-up
  script with a dialup connection to update a software
  regularly.
* Added fcrondyn: this software allows users to dialog
  dyn-amically with a running fcron daemon. Currently, it can list
  jobs of the user running it (or all jobs for root). In the near
  future, it should be able to run a job, change its next time and
  date of execution, renice a running job, send a signal to a
  running job, etc.
* All the documentation has been ported to SGML DocBook.

  It results on a much better HTML version, which I recommand
  you use. It is installed by default in fcron documentation
  directory (for instance, on my system:
  /usr/share/doc/fcron-X.X.X/).
* Fcrontab.5 has been updated and improved. Some examples have
  been added and some possible use of the different lines and
  options are mentioned.
* Added option random, which allows an entry run periodically to
  be run at a random time in its intervals of execution, instead of
  being run as soon as possible.
* added some more checks in fileconf.c: allow user to use
  hours, days, hourly, daily, etc options only with %-lines: it is
  ignored if set for a &-line, which is quite confusing for users
  who may type, for instance "&hourly" instead of
  "%hourly".
* bug fixed: you can now use arguments in the var EDITOR and
  VISUAL.
* bug fixed: fcron used to call sometimes a sleep(-1), which
  causes a freeze (no crash, but a very very long sleep :) ) under
  system using LIBC5, and maybe on some non-linux systems. It was
  not causing any problem under GLIBC2. Thanks go to Nick
  Pasich.

**From version 2.0.0 to 2.1.0**

* PAM support for fcron and fcrontab (need testing! - help
  would be appreciated).
* Fcron now send a mail if a job has noticenotrun set and could
  not be run because of a queue full.
* Fcron now compiles on AIX (thank you, John A. Parker!), and a
  few AIX-only bugs have been fixed, but it may remain some
  problems to correct. Please try, and tell me!
* We now use constants ROOTUID and ROOTGID instead of some
  hard-coded "0", and those constants are defined by the configure
  script (we use the uid/gid of the name given with the option
  "--with-root{name|group}"). It allows fcron to be run on system
  on which root is not uid/gid 0/0.
* code cleaning.
* bug fixed: setting lavg to (0,0,0) used to make the line be
  added in the lavg queue instead of the serial queue (but the
  lavgs were ignored anyway).
* bug fixed: fcrontab's "-z" option was not ignoring previous
  user's fcrontab version.
* bug fixed: on systems using putenv(), the var HOME, USER and
  SHELL wasn't correctly assigned. On system supporting setenv()
  (which is the default), the problem did not occur. (thanks go to
  Evan A. Zacks).

**From version 1.1.1 to 2.0.0**

* using SIGUSR2 on fcron makes it print its current schedule on
  syslog and toggles on/off the printing of debug info on
  syslog.
* fcron behavior on serial and lavg queues overflow has changed:
  in previous versions, it used to run a job to make room to put
  a new one. As it may conduct to a overwhelming of system
  resources, the new job is now refused (and not run). An error
  message is also logged through syslog.
* a mail is now sent if the job exited due to a signal, or if
  exit status is non-zero. Read FAQ if you experience problems
  about that.
* added a FAQ.
* bug fixed: a midmonthly job executed after the 15th of the
  month used to cause an endless loop. Thanks go to Guy Geens
  (thanks a lot!).
* bug fixed: inserting a job in serial queue or running a job
  not finished at startup was broken, unless the job was
  strict(no).
* bug fixed: some 1.1.1 changes used to make fcron impossible
  to compile without sendmail (./configure's option
  "--with-sendmail=no").
* bug fixed in sysV boot script: we know specify explicitly the
  path to fcron.
* bug fixed: unresolved error used to occur on some system not
  defining getopt\_long().

**From version 1.1.0 to 1.1.1**

* security fix: sym link attack against fcrontab. Any user
  allowed to use fcrontab used to be able to remove any fcrontab,
  and potentially to truncate any file to zero-length (under
  certain conditions, anyway).
* fcron and fcrontab now have a configuration file: fcron.conf.
  It contains the default paths (spool dir, etc) and programs to
  use (editor, shell, etc). Thanks to that file, several fcron
  processes can run simultaneously if they have a different config
  (different spool dir and pid file).
* added fcron's option "-m" to control the number of serial jobs
  which can be executed simultaneously.
* added fcron's option "-n" to create a new spool dir.
* command line syntax of fcrontab has changed: you can know use
  "user" (after the file name if any) instead of "-u user". It
  should make fcrontab a little more intuitive.
* It is now possible to put a user name between the time/date
  fields and the shell command of a fcrontab line (for Vixie cron
  format compatibility): it is equivalent to runas(user).
* support of Solaris (and SysV).
* early support of OpenBSD.
* the installation scripts now use nsswitch.conf to detect if a
  user or a group exists on the system. That way, naming services
  (NYS, ldap, etc) are supported.
* the man page and doc is now installed by default in
  $prefix/share/{man|doc} (instead of the previous
  $prefix/{man|doc}) ($prefix is generally "/usr").
* bug corrected: fcron used not to add a serial\_sev line to
  serial/lavg queue if this line was running, saying "already in
  serial queue".
* bug corrected: a "all" in fcron.allow with no fcron.deny file
  was not considered as an allow rule.

**From version 1.0.3 to 1.1.0**

* The binary format of the binary fcrontabs has changed: there
  is now no more need to reinstall the fcrontabs when upgrading
  fcron (but you need to convert your fcrontabs to the new format
  once), and this format should allow extensions without losing any
  information.
* better management of the errors in load/save fcrontabs
  functions.
* the doc is a clearer about @-lines.
* more security tests by fcrontab in the case it is suid root
  (but, if possible, it should be suid fcron as it is far more
  secure).
* we now remove unwanted fcrontabs before loading them in memory:
  well, it seems to be more logical like that :)) .
* bug fix: using options first with a &-line may have led to
  some problems during the first read by fcron (mail send
  erroneously if noticenotrun was used, bad set of the first
  execution's time and date or immediate execution if bootrun was
  set: in fact, the line was not recognized as a new line).
* bug fix: fcron used not to be able to be compiled from any
  directory because of an absent -I. line option for the compiler
  (the config.h file was not found).

**From version 1.0.2 to 1.0.3**

* fcron can now be configured and compiled from any directory
  (not only from the source dir).
* bug fix: fcron now sets umask to the value it got at start
  before running a job.
* bug corrected: a bug used to make the "truncated" system not
  to work correctly, so a too long log message used to make fcron
  crash.

**From version 1.0.1 to 1.0.2**

* the user for whom a job is run is now logged.
* installation script is now more explicit about what it is
  going to do.
* a boolean value can now also be set by "yes" and "no".
* bug corrected: bootrun option works again.
* bug corrected: shell variable containing underscore (\_) used
  to be rejected.
* bug corrected: installation script used not to check if user
  fcron was in group fcron, in which case fcrontab doesn't work
  correctly (it cannot, in that case, read the fcrontabs for
  non-privileged users).

**From version 1.0.0 to 1.0.1**

* security fix: a user used to be able to read a file owned by
  root if root runs a "fcrontab -u user -e".

**From version 0.9.5 to 1.0.0**

* added fcron's option "-s" to control the time between two
  saves of the fcrontabs on disk.
* installation scripts now support better FreeBSD and sh.
* bug corrected: configure's options prefix and
  without-sendmail used not to work.
* bug corrected: installing an fcrontab by "fcrontab file"
  wasn't working correctly with a relative path (a path not
  beginning by a "/").

**From version 0.9.4 to 0.9.5**

* security fix: the jobs of a fcrontab reinstalled by root used
  to be run as root (until the next action of the owner on the
  fcrontab).
* added options strict and noticenotrun to tell fcron
  respectively if a job should be removed from lavg queue if its
  execution interval is exceeded, and if fcron should mail user to
  report the non-execution of a job.
* added option nolog in order to log only errors (i.e. no
  message like "job x started"). This can help to reduce the disk
  access and save energy on a laptop, and make the log more
  readable if some jobs are run very often.
* better handle of changes of the uids of users in /etc/passwd
  (no more need to reinstall the fcrontabs).
* fcron.deny and fcron.allow files are now owned by root (they
  used to be owned by user fcron).
* added ./configure's option --with-answer-all to be able to use
  "make install" in a non-interactive way (can be useful for
  automatic installers).
* added option --with-rootname and --with-rootgroup to
  ./configure script for a better support of exotic systems.
* bug corrected in make install (script user-group): the script
  used not to handle correctly the absence of both useradd and
  adduser commands. This script now checks and tries to add a
  group fcron if necessary.

**From version 0.9.3 to 0.9.4**

* security improvement: after the (horrible) root exploit found
  in version 0.9.3, I decided to improve fcron/fcrontab's security.
  I've included some strong (I hope :)) ) tests in fcron to ensure
  that only root can run commands as superuser and use option
  runas. Even an corrupted fcrontab should not be able to get
  root's privileges. Pretty reassuring, isn't it?
* runfreq(1) lines have been replaced and extended by a new kind
  of line: the lines beginning by a "%". It's now possible to tell
  fcron to run a command once an hour, a week, etc, but only at
  some specified moments. For instance: '%weekly \* 4-7 echo "foo"'
  will run the command 'echo "foo"' once a week between 4 and 7 in
  the morning. (see "man 5 fcrontab" for more details).
* installation process improved: user is now consulted before
  anything is done about installation in boot scripts, etc. The
  default username of fcron is now ... fcron! (this is more secure
  than daemon, which can be used by other programs).
* fcron now adds the host name to the addresses of the mails it
  sends.
* fcrontab determines the identity of the running user by his
  uid (it used to use the var USER). That way, fcrontab should act
  as crontab under a "su".
* bug fixed: a tmp file was not removed after a "fcron
  -z"
* bug fixed in fcrontab: an expression of the form "start-stop"
  with start > stop used to be incorrectly managed by fcron.
* bug fixed: when fcron and fcrontab were installed under a
  non-privileged user rights, a normal user used to be not able to
  use fcrontab.
* bug fixed: while fcrontab was asking user if he would like to
  correct an erroneous line, the answer was not correctly
  handled.

**From version 0.9.2.1 to 0.9.3**

* installation scripts improved.
* added code to avoid infinite loops.
* bugs corrected in the functions to set the time and date of
  next execution.
* bug corrected in the check for invalid lines.

**From version 0.9.2 to 0.9.2.1**

* minor bug corrected in Makefile

**From version 0.9.1 to 0.9.2**

* fcron now uses autoconf (the configure script), so it should
  be easier to compile and install it and various systems.
* support of lavg options for all systems where getloadavg() is
  defined (BSD unix, etc) and on Linux systems with a proc
  filesystem (fcron can use /proc/loadavg).
* a job can now be executed several times simultaneously if
  option exesev is set to 1.
* user can determine if a job can be put several times in the
  serial queue simultaneously thanks to option serialonce.
* fcron does not wait anymore for the completion of all jobs of
  a file before deleting it from memory.
* fcron handles correctly the jobs which are both serial and
  lavg.
* fcron now runs under a specific user and group (other than
  root) for basic security reasons.
* bug corrected: fcron used to crash after a file was deleted
  from memory in some conditions.
* corrected the bug which used to appear when a line was put
  several times in the serial queue: in this case, fcron used not
  to count correctly the number of running serial jobs.
* bug corrected: fcrontab used not to remove the temporary file
  it creates if no modification where done to a file after an
  edition using the -e option and on errors.
* bug corrected: fcrontab now defines correctly the remain
  value of a line based on time and date beginning with a "&" but
  without runfreq definition.
* bug corrected: fcron used to not install correctly a file
  edited if a correction was made.
* bug corrected: reset option was not working correctly when
  set to a single line.

**From version 0.9.0 to 0.9.1**

* support of the option mailto for each line (it used to be set
  for the whole file).
* the value of the runas and mailto options are now stored
  internally as a uid number: you must reinstall all the system's
  fcrontabs if you change the uid of a user.
* Support of options "lavg\*", in order to run a job under a
  specific 1, 5 and/or 15 minutes system load average value(s).
  When the job should be run, it is placed in a specific queue and
  the load average is checked regularly until the right value(s)
  is/are got. The options "lavgor" and "lavgand" permits users to
  tell fcron if they prefer to perform a logic OR or AND between
  the 1, 5 and 15 load average values. The option "until" can be
  use to force the execution of a job after a determined timeout if
  the right conditions to run the job are not filled.
* fcron now uses putenv() in place of setenv() (setenv() is not
  POSIX compliant).
* a mailto option set to "" is now equivalent to
  "mail(false)".
* corrected the bug which used to make a bootrun and runfreq(1)
  job executed twice when fcron's start occurs in an interval of
  execution of the job.
* corrected the bug which used to make fcron crash after
  serial\_array is resized.

**From version 0.8.3 to 0.9.0**

* support of options in fcrontabs. Options can be specific to a
  line or defined once for every line located after their
  definition (a special option "reset" set all options to their
  default). Some options also have too names: a long name and an
  abbreviation.
* jobs can now be run be run one after the other (option
  "serial"): when the job should normally be run, it is added to a
  queue, which entries are executed one by one. It permits to avoid
  the use of a lot of system resources for a brief moment by the
  simultaneous execution of several tasks.
* jobs can be run at system start up if they should have been
  run during system down time (option "bootrun").
* root can run jobs as an another user (option "runas")
* user can set a nice value to a job, but only root can use a
  negative value (a negative value will increase priority)
* user can choose to perform a logic AND or a logic OR between
  day of month and day of week (option "dayor" and "dayand")
* user can choose to mail the output of jobs (option "mail") if
  any, and can force fcron to send a mail even if output is
  zero-length (option "forcemail").
* fixed the bug which used to make fcron run a job with a
  runfreq set to 1 at a wrong time.
* fixed a bug which used to make fcrontab crash after several
  corrections in edit mode.

**From version 0.8.2 to 0.8.3**

* (all this bugs appeared in version 0.8.2 :)
* fixed the bug which used to make fcron crash after a
  SIGHUP
* fixed the bug which used to prevent fcron from running some
  job based on time and date
* fixed the bug which used to makes fcron run the jobs one
  second too late

**From version 0.8.1 to 0.8.2**

* code has been optimized: The jobs are now queued in order of
  execution. It permits avoid useless tests of all jobs every time
  fcron wakes up, speeds up the determination of the time fcron
  should sleep, speeds up the processing after the end of a job,
  etc. I don't know why I haven't made it before :-) ...
* fcrontab has been improved: it is now more stable (many bugs
  which used to make fcrontab crash in case of errors in the
  fcrontab has been fixed). Plus, it now asks if you want to make
  corrections if needed when editing.

**From version 0.8.0 to 0.8.1**

* ported to FreeBSD 4.0

**From version 0.7.0 to 0.8.0**

* corrected the bug which keep normal users from listing and
  editing their current configuration file with fcrontab -l or
  -e.
* corrected the bugs which used to block fcron when a task was
  marked for execution but fcron stopped before it has been
  launched, and when fcron stopped after the end of a job but
  before the output has been mailed.
* day of week 0 and 7 now both mean Sunday.
* the abbreviations of months and day of week are not any more
  case dependent.
* months are now defined from 1 to 12 (and not from 0 to 11) (it
  was a little bit illogical :-).
* you can now force spaces in strings if you place them in
  quotes.
* I discovered ispell :-) ...
* I've added a kind of signature in the formated configuration
  files in order to keep the daemon from attempting to read an old
  configuration file which doesn't use the same syntax.
* You can now install a file with fcrontab from standard
  input.
* others minor adds and bug corrections.

| 12/26/2024 | **fcron 3.3.2 (dev) released** The email displayname used by fcron can now be configured (and be made RFC5322-compliant), and the delay before fcron reloads fcrontab changes can now be configured at compile time. Also, a display bug in fcrondyn was fixed, and the documentation wording was improved. |
| --- | --- |
| 12/05/2021 | **fcron 3.3.1 (dev) released** Fixed the compilation with SELinux support on newer systems, and various improvements to install/boot scripts (in particular on systemd) |
| 07/31/2019 | **Git repo moved to Github** The official repository of fcron was moved from TuxFamily to https://github.com/yo8192/fcron. This will give a more advanced and familiar interface and workflows, and make it easier to find. |
| 08/14/2016 | **fcron 3.3.0 (dev) released** fcron now handles computer suspend/resume. Added a 'runatresume' option, as well as a Vixie-cron-style '@resume' shortcut. |
| 06/26/2016 | **fcron 3.2.1 released** The main change in this release is that @-lines can now be run up to every second (previously every 10s at most). Also the install script now fully supports systemd. |
| 07/06/2014 | **Stable release fcron 3.2.0** The 3.1.X branch is now considered stable and thus graduated to a new stable 3.2.X branch. fcron 3.2.0 has many improvement over 3.0.6: (hopefully) full Vixie cron compatibility (@reboot etc shortcuts, auditing, job environment, email headers, ...), readline support for fcrondyn, improved Solaris 10 and SE Linux support. Quite a few changes were also done in the background to make the code easier to maintain and more robust. A couple of bugs and a couple of cosmetic improvements were made between 3.1.3 and 3.2.0. |
| 05/11/2014 | **fcron 3.1.3 released** A focus on bug fixes and stability. Also improved Solaris 10 and SE Linux support. The 3.1.X dev branch is now close (in terms of features and stability) to be made production. |
| 03/03/2013 | **fcron 3.1.2 released** No real new feature, but multiple bug were fixed in this release, plus some changes to make the code more robust. |
| 01/01/2013 | **fcron 3.1.1 released** Added readline support for fcrondyn, logging to a file without syslog, and some bug fixes. See [changes](http://fcron.free.fr/doc/en/changes.html) for a detailed list of changes. |
| 12/19/2012 | **fcron 3.1.0 released** I finally found the time to make a new dev release, which includes quite a few changes coded over the last couple of years. This release focuses on Vixie cron compatibility (@reboot etc shortcuts, auditing, job environment, email headers, ...) and refactoring to make the code easier to maintain. fcrondyn also doesn't require a password anymore (only really tested on Linux, feedback and help welcome on other platforms). You will find a few bug fixes too. As usual, please refer to the [changes](doc/en/changes.html) file for more details. |
| 12/05/2012 | **fcron git repository** For the more adventurous, or if you would like to contribute to the development of fcron, you can also access the version in development on fcron's git repository: `git clone git://git.tuxfamily.org/gitroot/fcron/fcron.git` |
| 04/05/2010 | **fcron 3.0.6 released** This new release fixes an issue preventing user from using fcrontab correctly on some systems: they would get an operation not permitted error message. A few other minor bug fixes are included as well. |
| 03/04/2010 | **fcron 3.0.5 released** The prior focus of this release is to fix a security issue that was found and would allow a malicious user to read fcron configuration files and the fcrontabs of non-root users. It also brings various minor improvements and bug fixes: please check the changes file for more details. |
| 11/08/2007 | **fcron 3.0.4 released** In this release the option random has been improved, a new option erroronlymail has been added so as an email is sent only when the job exited with a non-zero status. Some cleanup on the file closures have been done, which should remove the problems some users would see when job were executed (could not read/write pid, etc). |
| 06/05/2007 | **fcron 3.0.3 released** This stable release is almost identical to development version 3.0.3-rc1, apart from minor changes for non-Linux platforms. Since 3.0.2, the build and install processes have changed significantly and AIX and Solaris platforms are supported better. **Please bear in mind that the default install paths have changed since 3.0.3-rc1 to make them more standard.** |
| 04/15/2007 | **fcron 3.0.3-rc1 is out** This development version contains major changes in the build and install processec: the underlying idea is to make them more standard and to make fcron easier to package. This in particular means that the default install paths have changed. Some portability work has also been done for the AIX and Solaris platforms, and two new environment variables -- LOGNAME and TZ -- are now defined when a job is run. |
| 01/15/2007 | **fcron 3.0.2** This version features (among other things) some bug fixes for BSD system, and an improved compatibility with Vixie Cron. There are also some changes about the order of priority to determine which shell will be used by fcron to run a job: please check the changes for more details. A development version should be released soon: it will in particular include some significant changes in the configure script and the Makefile to ease up the work of the packagers and be more standard with the behavior of other packages. |
| 02/06/2006 | **fcron 3.0.1 is out !** A new version with several bug fixes, especially for BSD systems. The man pages have also been translated to French. **Please note that a buffer overflow has been found in the program convert-fcrontab which is part of fcron 3.0.0: it seems that this bug is not exploitable, but it is safer to upgrade to fcron 3.0.1 which includes a fix for this bug as soon as possible.** |
| 09/09/2005 | **Stable fcron 3.0.0 is out !** Quite a lot has changed since the 2.0.x branch:  * Added the program fcrondyn to interact with a running fcron process * PAM support * SE Linux support * Options and command line parameters to execute fcron in a script * Ability to run fcron without root priveleges * Ported to AIX, HP-UX * Better time zone support * fcron is more secure and robust.  I strongly recommend that people who would still use fcron branch 2.0.x upgrade to fcron 3.0.0. |
| 07/28/2005 | **Fcron 2.9.7 released** Option timezone has been added to replace option tzdiff : with timezone, you can run a job in a different timezone than the system one. Plus, it handles correctly the DST changes. The bug which made fcron send empty mails on very up-to-date systems has also been fixed. This version will be marked as stable 3.0.0 if no major problem are reported. |
| 03/12/2005 | **Version 2.9.6 released** This release fixes the latest daylight save time change bug : several checks have also been added to avoid such bugs. Fcrontab behaves better when there is no space left on the partition. Moreover, a script (not enabled by default) has been added to "emulate" Vixie cron behavior about /etc/crontab and /etc/cron.d (ie. when there is a change, automatically take it into account, without the need of running fcrontab by hand). See the beginning of script/check\_system\_crontabs for more information. |
| 11/15/2004 | **Security vulnerabilities found in fcronsighup :fcron 2.0.2 and 2.9.5.1 released** Security vulnerabilites have been found in fcronsighup, the program used by fcrontab to tell fcron it should reload its configuration. Version 2.0.1 and 2.9.5 are affected, and some previous versions too. **You are highly encouraged to upgrade** to fcron 2.0.2 (stable branch) or fcron 2.9.5.1, which fix the issue and improve fcronsighup's overall security. |
| 09/03/2004 | **Fcron 2.9.5 is out** A release with 2 major bug fixes, some new commands for fcrondyn, and several minor changes and bug fixes. |
| 04/25/2004 | **fcron 2.0.1 released** This new version of the stable branch fixes a nasty bug which occured on daylight saving time change on some systems. You are **highly** encouraged to upgrade to this version if you are currently using fcron 2.0.0. |
| 04/15/2004 | **New : Development Mailing List** I've created a mailing list for fcron development. See the contact page [for subscription instructions](contact.php#dev). |
| 04/15/2004 | **New version of fcron's web site** It should be clearer and nicer than the previous one. If you find a bug (hopefully you won't ;) ), please tell me at  . |
| 12/29/2003 | **New : user support mailing list** I've created a mailing list for user support. See the contact page [for subscription instructions](contact.php#help). |
| 12/29/2003 | **I'm back ! -- fcron 2.9.4 released** After a year without much work on fcron because of my studies, I have more time now, and I'm back on it. Here is [fcron 2.9.4](download.php) : makewhatis bug is fixed at last (it was an abusively ignored signal SIGPIPE : stupid ... but hard to find !), there are also several other bug fixes an minor improvements. Apart from SE Linux support, there is no new functionnality in this version. |
| 04/26/2003 | **Update on the "makewhatis" bug** I cannot work on it for now (see below), but I'd like to collect some info about this bug ...  In fact, I would like to know which systems/configs are hit by the bug (as far as I know, only Redhat based linux systems, such as Mandrake - some other systems, such as Debian, have no makewhatis command), and if the bug is only about some error messages, or if the job is not done correctly (currently, I don't know how to check that : any idea ?). It would be great if some people could send me a mail to tell me if they experience the bug or not, what system they run, etc. Thanks. Last, but not least, you are hit by this bug if you get a lot of messages like that in makewhatis's mailed job report :  "bzcat: I/O or other error, bailing out. Possible reason follows. bzcat: Broken pipe Input file = ./man.1.bz2, output file = (stdout)" |
| 03/02/2003 | **Too much work ... :(** Since I have competitive exams in a few months, I have very little time to work on fcron these days ...  Fcron 2.9.3 seems quite stable and bug free, but one remains : the "makewhatis" bug. I still don't know if it's a bug of awk (which is used by makewhatis) or fcron (probably the latter :) - but fcron might make awk run into a bug), nor if the script works correctly (does awk try again after an error and succeed ?) or not. I'd appreciate (and users facing this bug too ! ;) ) if someone could investigate and try to fix the bug : feel free to contact me if you need more details on the bug or on fcron itself. Otherwise, I'll fix it after my exams. |
| 11/02/2002 | **Dev release 2.9.3 is out of the press !** The save-to-disk code has been rewritten in part : it is much faster than in 2.9.2, and more robust : it should avoid any loss of data in case of an hardware failure, system crash, etc. Fcrondyn has 2 new commands : renice and kill. Some code clean, bug fixes, and minor security bug fixes and improvements. |
| 10/05/2002 | **Dev release 2.9.2 is out of the press !** Some more commands for fcrondyn have been implemented. A special user "systab" has been added to store the system fcrontab. Some code clean and bug fixes. |
| 08/11/2002 | **Dev release 2.9.1 is out of the press !** Some bug fixes, the rewrite of the code managing jobs' output, and the ability to run fcron without root's privileges are the main changes since 2.9.0. |
| 03/31/2002 | **Dev release 2.9.0 is out !** Several new features, including a new program, fcrondyn, to communicate dynamically with fcron. Fcron's documentation has been ported to Docbook, which results in a very nice html version. |
| 03/09/2002 | **Fcron announce only mailing list created** You can subscribe using the link above. |
| 12/25/2001 | **Dev release 2.1.0 is out ... merry Christmas !** The major improvement in this release is the first support of PAM. However, there are also some bug fixes and minor changes. Take a look at the complete list of [changes](doc/en/changes.html). |
| 09/02/2001 | **Looking for a co-maintainer** I probably won't have much time this year to work on fcron because of my studies :(( ... So some help from a co-maintainer would be very appreciated ! Please contact me at  if you can help me (or if you want to get more details). |
| 08/23/2001 | **Release 2.0.0 is out of the press !** This is the stable release from the development series 1.1.x. You are strongly advised to upgrade from 1.0.x series, as a major security bug has been fixed. Moreover, 2.0.x brings (among other things) a new save system (a lot more extendable), a new file conf (/etc/fcron.conf) where you can set path and default values of fcron (it allows to run several fcron simultaneously on the same system) and ... a FAQ ! :)). Some other changes in fcron's background layout permitted to port fcron to Solaris and OpenBSD. Read the [changes file](doc/en/changes.html) to get a complete list of changes (including bug fixes). |
| 07/10/2001 | **Dev release 1.1.1 out of the press !** A security bug fixed (see news below), and some other minor bugs corrected. Several new things in that release : particularly a fcron.conf file, new fcron's options -m (max number of serial job running simultaneously), -n (to create a spool dir), or the support of Vixie crontab format (i.e. \* \* \* \* \* user cmd). Fcron has also been ported to Solaris and OpenBSD. |
| 07/05/2001 | **Security issue in versions earlier than 1.1.1** Those versions contain a bug which can be exploited to truncate some files to zero-length. To avoid that, you should not run "fcrontab -" (i.e. not installing a fcrontab from stdin), especially as root. Version 1.1.1 (which is about to be released) and later include a fix, so you can run "fcrontab -" safely with them. |
| 05/07/2001 | **Development version 1.1.0 released !** This release includes the new binary fcrontab save format, which corrects some bugs found in the old one, and is much more extendable. For instance, there is no more need to reinstall the fcrontabs at each fcron's upgrade, which may have lead to informations loss. |
| 05/06/2001 | **A new ftp server for fcron !** Thanks to seul.org, fcron now haves a ftp server in the USA, so you can download the source archives, rpms and sign files from there. |
| 04/29/2001 | **The source packages are now signed using gpg.** You can get both my public key and the sign files on the download page. I'll put my public key on some key servers as soon as possible. |
| 04/15/2001 | **Release 1.0.3 is out of the press !** Some minor improvements and a crasher bug fix : a bug in the log part used to make fcron crash with too long messages (some log messages include the shell command, so a too long one in a fcrontab led to a crash). |
| 03/10/2001 | **Release 1.0.2 is out of the press !** Some minor improvements (such as the fact that the user for whom a job is run is logged) and bug fixes, particularly the install script's one which used not to put user fcron in group fcron : this has caused some permission errors with fcrontab on some systems. Option bootrun has also been fixed. |
| 03/05/2001 | **Fcron (not yet) supported by OpenBSD ...** I'm looking for some people to port fcron to OpenBSD : as I don't know this system, I can't do it alone ... If someone could at least help me to do it, it would be great ! Please contact me at  if you are ready to do it. |
| 02/26/2001 | **Release 1.0.1 is out of the press !** A security hole has been fixed : a normal user used to be able to read root files if root runs a "fcrontab -e -u user". |
| 02/26/2001 | **Release 1.0.0 is out of the press !** It finally happened ! I've been announcing it for quite a while, but "it comes when it's ready" :)) . Not a lot of new things since 0.9.5 : some minor bug fixes and improvements. Anyway, FreeBSD systems are supported better. |
| 02/02/2001 | **Release 0.9.5 is out of the press !** This release fixes a security bug found in release 0.9.4 (which is, hopefully, not as bad as 0.9.3's one). Moreover, it adds some options ("strict" and "noticenotrun") to get a better control over %-lines. The installation process has also been improved (again :)) ), and an option called "nolog" can help to reduce disk access for laptops. There is also no more need to reinstall the fcrontabs after having changed the uids in /etc/passwd. Note that the first stable version 1.0.0 will be released in a few weeks if no major bug are found in this release : if you find one (a big one, or even a spelling mistake :)) ) please contact me as soon as possible at  . |
| 01/01/2001 | **Release 0.9.4 is out of the press !** This release fixes the security problem of release 0.9.3 plus various bugs, and add a new kind of line : the "%"-line. The "%"-line replaces the "&runfreq(1)" lines while making it easier and more convenient to use. Take a look at the [doc](doc/en/fcrontab.5.html) for more details (section : Entries run periodically). (For more details about what have changed, take a look at the [CHANGES](doc/en/changes.html)) We are really close to version 1.0.0 ! And happy new millennium ! |
| 12/11/2000 | **Security issue** **fcron version 0.9.3 contains a bug which allow any user to run tasks as root. To avoid it, you should remove the suid bit from fcrontab and run AS ROOT "fcrontab -z -u user" for all users who have a fcrontab.**  Please wait for the release 0.9.4 which should arrive soon (a week or 2) to really correct this problem. |
| 11/03/2000 | **Release 0.9.3 is out of the press !** This version should be considered as a beta 1.0.0 : some bugs have been fixed from version 0.9.2.1, some checks have been added to avoid infinite loops. Plus, the installation scripts have been improved. The final version 1.0.0 should be the same as 0.9.3, but ... without bugs :)) (if any !). If some people can help me to test fcron thoroughly in order to get a free-from-bug final version quickly, please contact me at  . |
| 10/10/2000 | **Release 0.9.2.1 is out of the press !** Fcron now uses autoconf (the configure script) to run better on more systems. Plus, the lavg\* options can also be used on every systems which defines a getloadavg() function (BSD Unix, etc) (fcron sure still supports the /proc/loadavg file for Linux systems). Moreover, multiple minor modifications have been made and several bugs have been fixed. Read the [CHANGES](doc/en/changes.html) for more details. |
| 09/04/2000 | **Release 0.9.1 is out of the press !** Thanks to the new options lavg\*, you can now control the execution of a job depending on the 1, 5 and/or 15 minutes system load average. Plus, the mailto option can now be different for each line of a file For more details about what have changed, take a look at the [CHANGES](doc/en/changes.html). |
| 06/30/2000 | **Release 0.9.0 is out of the press !** This version implements a new system of options, which can apply to an individual line or a bloc of lines in a fcrontab file. Those options permit to get a better control over what fcron does while they allow users to make fcron have a specific comportment for some lines. For more details about what is permitted with those options, take a look at [fcrontab(5)](doc/en/fcrontab.5.html) |
| 06/16/2000 | **Release 0.8.2 is out of the press !** Some optimizations and improvements (stability, interactivity). |
| 05/31/2000 | **Release 0.8.1 is out of the press !** Fcron now runs on FreeBSD. |
| 05/29/2000 | **Site has moved to http://fcron.free.fr** |
