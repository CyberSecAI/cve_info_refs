      {
        "source": "securityreason.com_46edf77e_20250126_001648.html",
        "vulnerability": {
          "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the way SPIP handles SQL queries in forum functionalities.",
          "weaknesses": [
            "Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities",
            "Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability",
            "Full path disclosure"
           ],
          "impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access to the database, allowing attackers to read sensitive information, modify data, or potentially inject malicious code. XSS can allow attackers to inject client side scripts in pages viewed by other users. Full path disclosure helps attackers exploit other vulnerabilities.",
          "attack_vectors": [
            "SQL injection via forum.php3 using specially crafted URL parameters (id_article, id_breve, etc.)",
             "XSS via index.php3 using the 'lang' parameter",
              "Full Path disclosure by accessing inc-messforum.php3 directly"
           ],
          "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker can perform these attacks remotely, without any authentication. Full path disclosure needs access to the vulnerable inc-messforum.php3 file."
        },
         "additional_details": "The SQL injections are exploitable both with and without magic_quotes_gpc enabled. If magic_quotes_gpc is off, display_errors is on and SPIP is prior to version 1.8.2, the combination of SQL injection and the full path disclosure can lead to remote code execution by injecting PHP code into writable directories like 'IMG'.",
