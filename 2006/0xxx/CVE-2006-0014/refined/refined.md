  "CVE-2006-0014": {
    "description": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Outlook Express when using a Windows Address Book (.wab) file that could allow an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability to take complete control of the affected system. An unchecked buffer in the Windows Address Book (WAB) functions within Outlook Express.",
    "affected_products": [
      "Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 4",
      "Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 1 and Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 2",
       "Microsoft Windows XP Professional x64 Edition",
      "Microsoft Windows Server 2003 and Microsoft Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1",
      "Microsoft Windows Server 2003 for Itanium-based Systems and Microsoft Windows Server 2003 with SP1 for Itanium-based Systems",
      "Microsoft Windows Server 2003 x64 Edition",
      "Microsoft Windows 98, Microsoft Windows 98 Second Edition (SE), and Microsoft Windows Millennium Edition (Windows Me)"
    ],
    "root_cause": "An unchecked buffer in the Windows Address Book (WAB) functions within Outlook Express. Specifically, modification of the length value of certain Unicode strings within the .WAB file format results in an exploitable heap corruption.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap corruption due to improper handling of string length in Windows Address Book (.WAB) files",
    "Unchecked buffer in the Windows Address Book (WAB) functions"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.",
    "attack_vectors": [
        "Email: Sending a specially crafted .wab file to the user and persuading them to open it.",
        "Web-based attack: Hosting a website with a malicious .wab file that the user must save and open."
     ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to create a specially crafted .wab file. They also need to persuade the user to open the file in Outlook Express (either by email or on a website).",
   "additional_notes": "The vulnerability requires user interaction to be exploited. Users with fewer user rights are less impacted than users with administrative rights. Microsoft has released a patch for this vulnerability, and recommends to apply the update at the earliest opportunity. The vulnerability was reported through responsible disclosure by Stuart Pearson."
