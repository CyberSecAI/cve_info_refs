Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:**

*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2006-0083
*   **Description:** A format string vulnerability exists in the logging code of smstools.
*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from how smstools handles logging, allowing an attacker to insert format specifiers into the log string. This can lead to unexpected behavior, including code execution.
*  **Weakness/Vulnerability:** Format String Bug

**Impact:**

*   **Exploitation:** An attacker can exploit the format string vulnerability to execute arbitrary code.
*   **Privileges:** This code execution occurs with root privileges, meaning the attacker can gain complete control over the system.
*   **Severity:** The vulnerability is considered critical due to the potential for full system compromise.

**Attack Vector:**

*   **Local Attack:** The advisory specifies a "local" problem type. This means that the attacker must have some form of access to the system to exploit the vulnerability. The exact method of triggering the vulnerable logging code is not explicitly detailed here.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have the ability to influence the input that is passed to the logging function in `smstools`. This can be through manipulating input parameters or configuration files, which are then passed to the vulnerable logging mechanism.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Software:** The vulnerability affects the smstools package.
*   **Affected Versions:**  The stable version `1.14.8-1sarge0` and the unstable distribution version are affected.
*   **Fix:** The vulnerability is fixed in `smstools` version `1.14.8-1sarge0` for the stable (sarge) distribution.

The advisory indicates that the vulnerability was discovered by Ulf Harnhammar from the Debian Security Audit project.
