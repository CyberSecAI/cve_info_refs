Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of the `$monthy` parameter in the `index.php` script and the `$login` parameter in the `admin/index.php` script before using them in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. Because the application doesn't sanitize user-supplied input, an attacker can inject malicious SQL code via the `monthy` and `login` parameters.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The code fails to validate or sanitize the input, making it vulnerable to injection attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary SQL Queries:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database. This means they can potentially:
    *   Extract sensitive data.
    *   Modify or delete data.
    *   Potentially gain complete control over the application and its database, depending on the database user's privileges.
*   **Compromise of the application:** The application and the database could be compromised, potentially leading to a complete system takeover.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Parameters:** The `monthy` parameter in `index.php` is vulnerable through HTTP GET requests.
*   **HTTP POST parameters:** The `login` parameter in `admin/index.php` is vulnerable through HTTP POST requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely without any special access.
*   **Basic HTTP Request Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to craft HTTP requests with malicious SQL injection payloads in the specified parameters.
*  **`magic_quotes_gpc` off:** The vulnerability is exploitable when `magic_quotes_gpc` is off.

**Additional Details:**

*   The `monthy` parameter is used to filter blog posts by month and year.
*   The vulnerable code extracts the `monthy` parameter from the GET request and directly inserts it into an SQL query without any sanitization or escaping.
*   The vulnerable query is: `SELECT * FROM blogposts WHERE monthy = '$monthy' ORDER BY date DESC $blog_limit`
*  The `login` parameter is used in `admin/index.php` in a similar way to authenticate, leading to SQL injection when not sanitized.
*  The parameter is misread by various vulnerability databases as "monthly" but it is actually "monthy"
