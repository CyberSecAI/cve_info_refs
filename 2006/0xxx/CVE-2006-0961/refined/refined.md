Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2006-0961

**Vulnerable Software:** CilemNews System versions 1.1 and prior

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability lies in the `yazdir.asp` script, specifically in how it handles the `haber_id` parameter. This parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing for SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw. User-supplied input (`haber_id`) is directly incorporated into a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database. The provided exploit targets the `ayarlar` table to retrieve administrator username and password.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** Successful SQL injection can potentially be leveraged to perform more damaging actions like data manipulation or complete database compromise.
*   **Remote compromise:** A remote attacker can use the SQL injection vulnerability to extract user data.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `yazdir.asp` script, including the malicious SQL injection payload within the `haber_id` parameter in the URL.
*   **Network:** The attack can be carried out over the network by sending HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable CilemNews System.
*   **Basic SQL Knowledge:** Understanding how SQL injection works is necessary to craft the malicious payload.
*   **No Authentication Required:** No prior authentication is needed to exploit the vulnerability in `yazdir.asp` script.
