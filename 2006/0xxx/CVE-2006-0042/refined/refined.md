{
  "CVE-2006-0042": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "A vulnerability in the `apreq_parse_headers()` and `apreq_parse_urlencoded()` functions within libapreq2.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability lies in the way these functions parse HTTP headers and URL-encoded data, leading to potential quadratic behavior.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) by consuming excessive CPU resources.",
       "Attack vectors": "Remote exploitation via crafted HTTP requests containing specially crafted headers or URL-encoded data.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to a server using a vulnerable version of libapreq2."
    },
        {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "Potential quadratic behavior in the `apreq_parse_headers()` and `apreq_parse_urlencoded()` functions.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Inefficient parsing algorithm leading to quadratic time complexity.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service (DoS) due to high CPU consumption.",
      "Attack vectors": "Remote attacker sending specially crafted HTTP headers or URL-encoded data.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Ability to send HTTP requests to a server running a vulnerable version of libapreq2."
