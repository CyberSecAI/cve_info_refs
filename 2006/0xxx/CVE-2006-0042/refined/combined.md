| [27](#l27) | - C API [joes] |
| [28](#l28) | Clean up end-of-file parsing for apreq\_parse\_multipart(), |
| [29](#l29) | conforming to rfc-2046 § 5.1.1. |
| [30](#l30) |  |
| [31](#l31) | - Perl API [joes] |
| [32](#l32) | Move APR::Request::Param::Table and APR::Request::Cookie::Table |

| [55](#l55) |  |
| [56](#l56) | - C API [joes] |

| [70](#l70) | - C API [Marc Gràcia, joes] |
| [71](#l71) | Fix apreq\_decode(v) when iso-latin-1 chars appear |

| [82](#l82) |  |
| [83](#l83) | - Perl API [joes] |
| [84](#l84) | Support for table set/add/delete methods is formally withdrawn. |
| [85](#l85) | Technically this feature died with the module API refactoring in |
| [86](#l86) | 2.05-dev. |
| [87](#l87) |  |
| [88](#l88) | - C API [max] |
| [89](#l89) | Right-hand limit of apreq\_brigade\_move() is declared as "excluding", |
| [90](#l90) | but APR\_RING\_UNSPLICE() wants an "including" right-hand limit. Fixed |
| [91](#l91) | this by passing the previous bucket. |
| [92](#l92) |  |
| [93](#l93) | - Perl API [joes] |
| [94](#l94) | Drop support for Apache2::Request::new's HOOK\_DATA. |
| [95](#l95) | UPLOAD\_HOOK now takes only two arguments: ($upload, $data). |
| [96](#l96) |  |
| [97](#l97) | - Perl API [joes] |
| [98](#l98) | Drop support for Apache2::Cookie::Jar::new's VALUE\_CLASS. |
| [99](#l99) | 2.05-dev broke that API, and it's not worth trying to fix. |
| [100](#l100) | People who need that should use APR::Request::Cookie::Table's |
| [101](#l101) | cookie\_class() API instead. |
| [102](#l102) |  |
| [103](#l103) | - Perl API [joes] |
| [104](#l104) | Fix cookie domain/path munging in Apache2::Cookie::new(). |
| [105](#l105) |  |
| [106](#l106) |  |
| [107](#l107) | @section v2\_05\_dev Changes with libapreq2-2.05-dev (released May 5, 2005) |
| [108](#l108) |  |
| [109](#l109) |  |
| [110](#l110) | - Win32 build [Randy Kobes] |
| [111](#l111) | Have top-level 'nmake', 'nmake test', and 'nmake install' |
| [112](#l112) | targets, respectively, also include building, testing, and |
| [113](#l113) | installing the corresponding perl glue targets. |
| [114](#l114) |  |
| [115](#l115) | - C API [geoff] |

| [121](#l121) |  |
| [122](#l122) | - Perl API [joes] |
| [123](#l123) | Remove Apache2::Request::args. WARNING: through inheritance, |
| [124](#l124) | args() now maps to Apache2::RequestRec::args. Folks that want |
| [125](#l125) | the pre-2.05-dev behavior need to invoke APR::Request::args by name. |
| [126](#l126) |  |
| [127](#l127) | - C API [joes, Max Kellermann] |
| [128](#l128) | Add apreq\_initialize, apreq\_pre\_initialize and apreq\_post\_initialize. |
| [129](#l129) | These are not thread-safe operations, so applications need to ensure |
| [130](#l130) | they are invoked (in the correct sequence) prior to using any apreq2 |
| [131](#l131) | modules. |
| [132](#l132) |  |
| [133](#l133) | - C, Perl API [joes] |
| [134](#l134) | Add pool, bucket\_alloc to apreq\_handle\_t. |
| [135](#l135) |  |
| [136](#l136) | - Perl API [joes] |
| [137](#l137) | Drop $data argument from UPLOAD\_HOOK, and also drop HOOK\_DATA option. |
| [138](#l138) | Perl folks should use a closure instead of passing in context data. |
| [139](#l139) |  |
| [140](#l140) | - Perl API [joes] |
| [141](#l141) | Move bake, bake2 to Apache2::Cookie, now requiring |
| [142](#l142) | an extra $r argument. Also ""-operator is mapped |
| [143](#l143) | to as\_string() for Apache2::Cookie; but APR::Request::Cookie |
| [144](#l144) | maps it to value(). |
| [145](#l145) |  |
| [146](#l146) | - C API [joes] |
| [147](#l147) | Remove header\_in & header\_out from apreq\_module\_t. |
| [148](#l148) | Remove apreq\_ua\_cookie\_version() and apreq\_cookie\_bake\*(). |
| [149](#l149) | Remove cookie2 argument to apreq\_handle\_custom(). |
| [150](#l150) |  |
| [151](#l151) | - C API [joes] |
| [152](#l152) | s/APREQ/APREQ2/g in webserver configuration directives. |
| [153](#l153) |  |
| [154](#l154) | - C API [Igor Shevchenko, Philip Gollucci] |
| [155](#l155) | Fix segfault in mfd parser caused by parts w/ empty param names. |
| [156](#l156) |  |
| [157](#l157) | - C API [joes] |
| [158](#l158) | Add apreq\_cp1252\_to\_utf8(). |
| [159](#l159) |  |
| [160](#l160) | - C, Perl API [joes] |
| [161](#l161) | Add charset support for params and couple the SvUTF8 flag |
| [162](#l162) | to the param's taint flag. |
| [163](#l163) |  |
| [164](#l164) | - C API [joes] |
| [165](#l165) | Replace v->size with v->nlen + v->dlen. |
| [166](#l166) | Added supporting apreq\_value\_table\_add(). |
| [167](#l167) |  |
| [168](#l168) | - C API [joes] |
| [169](#l169) | Remove apreq\_cookie\_attr(). |
| [170](#l170) |  |
| [171](#l171) | - C API [joes] |
| [172](#l172) | - Add apreq\_error.h, apreq\_module.h. |
| [173](#l173) | - Rename apreq\_run\* and apreq\_make\* funcs to conform with |
| [174](#l174) | apreq\_$obj\_$meth scheme. |
| [175](#l175) | - Replace c->version & c->secure with flags. |
| [176](#l176) | - Parsers are assumed to be working with external data, so the |
| [177](#l177) | cookies & params they produce are marked tainted. |
| [178](#l178) |  |
| [179](#l179) | - C API [joes] |
| [180](#l180) | apreq\_parse\_cookie\_header() failed to parse RFC Cookie headers which |
| [181](#l181) | contained no space chars after the '$Version=1' preamble. |
| [182](#l182) |  |
| [183](#l183) | - C API [joes] |
| [184](#l184) | Reorganize around include/, library/, and module/ dirs. |
| [185](#l185) |  |
| [186](#l186) | - C Tests [joes] |
| [187](#l187) | Replace CuTest-based tests with custom TAP-compliant framework. |
| [188](#l188) |  |
| [189](#l189) | - C API [Max Kellermann] |
| [190](#l190) | Continue the API improvements: |
| [191](#l191) |  |
| [192](#l192) | - Convert APREQ\_RUN\_PARSER and APREQ\_RUN\_HOOK to inline, and downcase them. |

| [199](#l199) | - Convert apreq\_cookie\_name and apreq\_cookie\_value macros to inline. |
| [200](#l200) | - Convert apreq\_param\_name, apreq\_param\_value, apreq\_param\_info, and |
| [201](#l201) | apreq\_param\_brigade to inline. |
| [202](#l202) |  |
| [203](#l203) | - C API [joes] |
| [204](#l204) | Widespread API refactorization to remove apreq\_jar\_t and apreq\_request\_t: |
| [205](#l205) |  |
| [206](#l206) | - Header includes reorganized; apreq\_parsers.h added (back again). |
| [207](#l207) | - Replaced apreq\_jar\_t and apreq\_request\_t with single apreq\_env\_handle\_t. |
| [208](#l208) | - Added const qualifier to "v" attribute of apreq\_cookie\_t and apreq\_param\_t. |
| [209](#l209) | - Use union type-puns to drop const qualifiers inside the new |
| [210](#l210) | apreq\_value\_to\_cookie and apreq\_value\_to\_param implementations |
| [211](#l211) | (gcc generates same object code as the macro versions did). |

| [259](#l259) | - Remove env argument from APREQ\_PARSER\_ARGS and APREQ\_HOOK\_ARGS |
| [260](#l260) | - Augment apreq\_hook\_t and apreq\_parser\_t to replace missing env features. |
| [261](#l261) | - Change apreq\_make\_parser and apreq\_make\_hook signatures. |
| [262](#l262) | - Rename apreq\_add\_hook to apreq\_parser\_add\_hook, returning apr\_status\_t. |
| [263](#l263) | - Change apreq\_parser signature. |
| [264](#l264) |  |
| [265](#l265) | [apreq\_env.h] |
| [266](#l266) | - Remove read, log, pool, bucket\_alloc, request, jar, and query\_string methods. |
| [267](#l267) | - Include apreq\_parsers.h. |
| [268](#l268) | - Reorganize apreq\_env\_module\_t to provide hook, parser, jar, args, |
| [269](#l269) | & body table ops. |
| [270](#l270) | - Rename max\_brigade to "brigade\_limit", max\_body to "read\_limit". |
| [271](#l271) | - Change related module sigs, including temp\_dir, to get/set methods. |
| [272](#l272) | - Add parser and read\_limit args to apreq\_env\_make\_custom\_handle. |
| [273](#l273) | - Drop "name" arg and APREQ\_ENV\_MODULE =~ s/\_ENV//. |
| [274](#l274) | - s/apreq\_env\_make/apreq\_handle/ in the handle constructor names. |
| [275](#l275) |  |
| [276](#l276) | [mod\_apreq.c, apreq\_env\_apache2.h] |
| [277](#l277) | - Changed APREQ\_Max\* configs to APREQ\_BrigadeLimit and APREQ\_ReadLimit. |
| [278](#l278) | - Handle constructor renamed apreq\_handle\_apache2. |
| [279](#l279) |  |
| [280](#l280) | - C API [joes] |
| [281](#l281) | Make our "libtool current interface" number depend on apr's |
| [282](#l282) | major number. This allows libapreq2 to be installed into a |
| [283](#l283) | system-wide location while avoiding ABI conflicts arising from |
| [284](#l284) | our apr-based interfaces. |
| [285](#l285) |  |
| [286](#l286) | - C API [Max Kellermann] |
| [287](#l287) | Introduce apreq\_env\_handle\_t to replace the void \*env usage. |
| [288](#l288) | Also added apreq\_env\_custom for making private handles, and new |
| [289](#l289) | apreq\_env\_apache2.h to let mod\_apreq export apreq\_env\_make\_apache2. |
| [290](#l290) |  |
| [291](#l291) | - C API [Max Kellermann] |
| [292](#l292) | Rename apreq\_env\_t to apreq\_env\_module\_t, to prepare for |
| [293](#l293) | a new thread-safe apreq\_env API. |
| [294](#l294) |  |
| [295](#l295) | - C API [Max Kellermann] |
| [296](#l296) | mod\_apreq must check the return value of apreq\_brigade\_concat |
| [297](#l297) | to avoid a RAM-consuming infinite loop. A bad APREQ\_TempDir |
| [298](#l298) | setting can cause this situation. |
| [299](#l299) |  |
| [300](#l300) | - C API [joes] |
| [301](#l301) | Provide workaround for chunked trailers bug in ap\_http\_filter. |
| [302](#l302) |  |
| [303](#l303) | - C, Perl API [joes] |
| [304](#l304) | Several upload-related bugfixes: |
| [305](#l305) | 1) apreq\_upload and apreq\_uploads did not search the full body table, |
| [306](#l306) | 2) $upload->slurp and $io->read did not autovivify the resultant string. |
| [307](#l307) |  |
| [308](#l308) | - C API [joes] |
| [309](#l309) | Add "flags" attribute to apreq\_value\_t, planning for charset support. |
| [310](#l310) | This is an ABI change, starting with libapreq2.so.2.0.24. |
| [311](#l311) |  |
| [312](#l312) | - C API [joes] |
| [313](#l313) | Add apreq\_env\_bucket\_alloc() to get an allocator directly from the |
| [314](#l314) | environment instead of creating them from a pool. This is an |
| [315](#l315) | ABI change, starting with libapreq2.so.2.0.23. |
| [316](#l316) |  |
| [317](#l317) | - Build system [joes] |
| [318](#l318) | Add --with-apache2-httpd option so users can override apxs's |
| [319](#l319) | notion of where the httpd executable is. XSBuilder's header |
| [320](#l320) | parser runs from buildconf now instead of configure, so we |
| [321](#l321) | will include those tables in the release tarball. buildconf |
| [322](#l322) | gets an additional --with-perl option for running the xsbuilder.pl |
| [323](#l323) | parsing script. The XS generation code in xsbuilder.pl has moved |
| [324](#l324) | to glue/perl/Makefile.PL. |
| [325](#l325) |  |
| [326](#l326) | - Perl API [joes] |
| [327](#l327) | Allow ctors for Apache::Cookie, Apache::Cookie::Jar |
| [328](#l328) | and Apache:::Request to accept Apache::Request objects |
| [329](#l329) | (instead of requiring an Apache::RequestRec object). |
| [330](#l330) | This thread details the bug |
| [331](#l331) | <http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.apache.mod-perl/15727> |
| [332](#l332) |  |
| [333](#l333) | - C API [Bojan Smojver] |
| [334](#l334) | Bake cookies with err\_headers\_out so they are |
| [335](#l335) | sent on non-2xx server responses (ie. a 304 redirect). |
| [336](#l336) | Also ensure that headers are copied with apr\_table\_add |
| [337](#l337) | instead of apr\_table\_addn. Since apreq\_cookie\_bake() |
| [338](#l338) | allocates from the stack, the Set-Cookie headers would |
| [339](#l339) | occasionally get mangled without this patch. |
| [340](#l340) |  |
| [341](#l341) | - C API [joes] |
| [342](#l342) | Add apreq\_register\_parser(), which allows users to add |
| [343](#l343) | their own parsers to apreq\_parser()'s recognized MIME types. |
| [344](#l344) |  |
| [345](#l345) | - C API [joes] |
| [346](#l346) | Support "multipart/mixed" file uploads. |
| [347](#l347) | Support XForms' "multipart/related" enctype. |
| [348](#l348) |  |
| [349](#l349) | - C API [joes] |
| [350](#l350) | Add apreq\_hook\_apr\_xml\_parser(), which is a simple wrapper |
| [351](#l351) | hook around APR's expat-based apr\_xml\_parser. Add a generic |
| [352](#l352) | parser apreq\_parse\_generic() to parse arbitrary enctypes using |
| [353](#l353) | the hook API. |
| [354](#l354) |  |

| [356](#l356) | @section v2\_04\_dev Changes with libapreq2-2.04-dev (released August 30, 2004) |
| [357](#l357) |  |
| [358](#l358) |  |
| [359](#l359) | - Perl API [joes] |
| [360](#l360) | Add TAINT checks, marking all parsed data as tainted. |
| [361](#l361) |  |
| [362](#l362) | - C API [joes] |
| [363](#l363) | Add body\_status attribute to apreq\_request\_t, to allow the both |
| [364](#l364) | environment and the parser to report any errors encountered. |
| [365](#l365) |  |
| [366](#l366) | - C API [randyk, joes] |
| [367](#l367) | Cookie parser was locking up on non-alphanumeric chars in cookie names. |
| [368](#l368) | Also RFC Cookie attributes are always checked for quotes during bake(2), |
| [369](#l369) | and the quotes are now stripped from incoming RFC cookies during parsing |
| [370](#l370) | (but they are never stripped from the actual cookie value). |
| [371](#l371) |  |
| [372](#l372) | - Perl API [joes] |
| [373](#l373) | Apache::Cookie::Jar->new accepts a VALUE\_CLASS argument, which effectively |
| [374](#l374) | blesses all the jar's cookies into that class, which simplifies subclassing |
| [375](#l375) | Apache::Cookie. Accordingly Apache::Cookie->freeze($value) no longer accepts |
| [376](#l376) | a freeze()-able object in $value. |
| [377](#l377) |  |
| [378](#l378) | - C API [Markus Wichitill, randyk, joes] |
| [379](#l379) | Drop APR\_DELONCLOSE from apreq\_file\_mktemp implementation and install |
| [380](#l380) | apreq\_file\_cleanup. When passed to apr\_file\_open on Win32, APR\_DELONCLOSE |
| [381](#l381) | sets the FILE\_SHARED\_DELETE flag, which is, unfortunately, a property that |
| [382](#l382) | is preserved across NTFS "hard" links. This breaks apps that link() |
| [383](#l383) | the temp file to a permanent location, and subsequently expect to open it |
| [384](#l384) | without FILE\_SHARED\_DELETE before the original tempfile is closed+deleted. |
| [385](#l385) | In fact, even Apache::Upload does this, so it is a common enough event that |
| [386](#l386) | the apreq\_file\_cleanup workaround is necessary. |
| [387](#l387) |  |
| [388](#l388) | - C API [Ken Burcham, joes] |
| [389](#l389) | Fix bug in url parser that occurs when a %XX-encoded sequence |
| [390](#l390) | is split across multiple buckets. Added apreq\_decode\_decodev |
| [391](#l391) | to make this problem less inconvenient. |
| [392](#l392) |  |
| [393](#l393) | - Perl API [joes] |
| [394](#l394) | Exception objects inherit from the object which raised it, |
| [395](#l395) | which allows $@ to invoke its methods with impunity (exceptions |
| [396](#l396) | are disabled for objects which derive from an exception class). |
| [397](#l397) |  |
| [398](#l398) | - Perl API [joes] |
| [399](#l399) | Implement HOOK\_DATA and UPLOAD\_HOOK. |
| [400](#l400) |  |
| [401](#l401) | - Perl API [joes] |
| [402](#l402) | Add safe XS wrappers for $table->add, $table->set, $table->STORE, |
| [403](#l403) | and $table\_class->new. |
| [404](#l404) |  |
| [405](#l405) | - Perl API [joes] |
| [406](#l406) | Add exceptions to $upload->link, $upload->tempname, $upload->slurp, |
| [407](#l407) | and $cookie->set\_attr. Return value of $upload->slurp is now the |
| [408](#l408) | upload length. Also document new $upload->io. |
| [409](#l409) |  |
| [410](#l410) | - C API [joes] |
| [411](#l411) | Restrict all apr\_status\_t codes to APR\_SUCCESS, APR\_INCOMPLETE, |
| [412](#l412) | APR\_EGENERAL, APR\_EINIT, APR\_ENOTIMPL, since any others will |
| [413](#l413) | generate confusing error messages from apr\_strerror. |
| [414](#l414) |  |
| [415](#l415) | - Perl API [joes] |
| [416](#l416) | Added $upload->io with a TIEHANDLE API layered over APR::Brigade. $upload->fh |
| [417](#l417) | remains implemented as an APR::PerlIO object, which is seekable but less efficient |
| [418](#l418) | and currently suffers some portability issues associated with largefile support |
| [419](#l419) | in perl and apr. |
| [420](#l420) |  |
| [421](#l421) | - Perl API [joes] |
| [422](#l422) | Added apreq\_xs\_croak for throwing APR::Error exceptions and included |
| [423](#l423) | error-checking on $req->param, $req->args, $req->body, $req->upload, |
| [424](#l424) | and $jar->get. |
| [425](#l425) |  |
| [426](#l426) | - Perl API [joes] |
| [427](#l427) | Added $jar->status, $req->args\_status and $req->body\_status to report |
| [428](#l428) | parsing errors. Also add $upload->tempname per user request. |
| [429](#l429) |  |
| [430](#l430) | - C API [joes] |
| [431](#l431) | Dropped status attribute of apreq\_value\_t. Added status field to |
| [432](#l432) | apreq\_jar\_t and added args\_status field to apreq\_request\_t. Parsers |
| [433](#l433) | also must return their public status code when a NULL brigade is passed. |
| [434](#l434) | apreq\_hook\_disable\_uploads() is also added. |
| [435](#l435) |  |
| [436](#l436) | This is an ABI change affecting all versions of libapreq2 prior to 2.0.12. |
| [437](#l437) |  |
| [438](#l438) | - Perl API [joes] |
| [439](#l439) | $upload->info returns a proper APR::Table object now. Also implemented |
| [440](#l440) | $upload->size, $upload->fh, and $upload->type. |
| [441](#l441) |  |
| [442](#l442) | - C API [Jean-François Meesse] |
| [443](#l443) | mfd parser fails to parse CRLF-terminated files when the terminating |
| [444](#l444) | boundary string is at the start of a new bucket. This is reportedly |
| [445](#l445) | a common event for PDF files uploaded with Netscape 7. |
| [446](#l446) |  |
| [447](#l447) | - Perl API [joes] |
| [448](#l448) | Add back-compat support for Apache::Cookie->fetch() via |
| [449](#l449) | Apache->request. |
| [450](#l450) |  |
| [451](#l451) | - C API [joes] |
| [452](#l452) | Add MaxBody, MaxBrigade, and TempDir per-dir directives to mod\_apreq |
| [453](#l453) | filter. |
| [454](#l454) |  |
| [455](#l455) | - C API [joes] |
| [456](#l456) | Replace free/tempnam dependency in apreq\_file\_mktemp() with |
| [457](#l457) | apr\_temp\_dir\_get(). Add additional gcc warning flags when |
| [458](#l458) | --enable-maintainer-mode is set. |
| [459](#l459) |  |
| [460](#l460) | - C API [joes, Scott Hutton] |
| [461](#l461) | Replace apreq\_brigade\_copy with more effective APREQ\_BRIGADE\_COPY |
| [462](#l462) | macro. Also introduce APREQ\_BRIGADE\_SETASIDE to deal with buckets |
| [463](#l463) | that need to be set aside for use in future function calls. mod\_ssl |
| [464](#l464) | generates transient buckets which tickled this bug. |
| [465](#l465) |  |
| [466](#l466) | - Perl API [joes] |
| [467](#l467) | Separate Apache::Upload module from Apache::Request for |
| [468](#l468) | better organization. |
| [469](#l469) |  |
| [470](#l470) |  |
| [471](#l471) | @section v2\_03\_dev Changes with libapreq2-2.03-dev (released June 12, 2004) |
| [472](#l472) |  |
| [473](#l473) |  |
| [474](#l474) | - C API [joes] |
| [475](#l475) | "Objectify" cookie/jar API: s/apreq\_(make|serialize)\_cookie/apreq\_cookie\_$1/ |
| [476](#l476) | and reordering args so the cookie/jar object is always the first argument. |
| [477](#l477) | Macros added to provide source-compatibility with the old names. |
| [478](#l478) |  |
| [479](#l479) | - Perl API [joes] |
| [480](#l480) | Added $upload->slurp($data), which reads the contents of the file |
| [481](#l481) | upload "$upload" into the scalar "$data". |
| [482](#l482) |  |
| [483](#l483) | - C API [joes, randyk] |
| [484](#l484) | apreq\_run\_(hook|parser) are macros, so they are capitalized now. |
| [485](#l485) | Fixed apreq\_params\_as\_string() and added apreq\_params\_as\_array(). |
| [486](#l486) | Reworked definitions of APREQ\_DECLARE\_HOOK, APREQ\_DECLARE\_PARSER |
| [487](#l487) | and apreq\_(parser|hook)\_t, hopefully to be more Win32 friendly. |
| [488](#l488) | Also updated the documentation. |
| [489](#l489) |  |
| [490](#l490) | - C API [joes] |
| [491](#l491) | Compensate for a missing CRLF in empty file upload block, which |
| [492](#l492) | actually complies with RFC 2046 Section 5.1.1. Konqueror (version unknown) |
| [493](#l493) | and Mozilla 0.9.7 are known to emit such blocks. |
| [494](#l494) |  |
| [495](#l495) | - Perl API [joes] |
| [496](#l496) | $req->upload() in list context failed to filter out non-uploads. |
| [497](#l497) | Also $req->upload("nonexistent-key-name") segfaults. |
| [498](#l498) |  |
| [499](#l499) | - Perl test suite |
| [500](#l500) | t/TEST.PL must run parent class' pre\_configure to get the |
| [501](#l501) | configuration right |
| [502](#l502) |  |
| [503](#l503) | - C API [joes] |
| [504](#l504) | apreq\_brigade\_concat() wasn't supplying the final EOS bucket |
| [505](#l505) | to large brigades (>256K), which somtimes caused the prefetch |
| [506](#l506) | loop in mod\_apreq.c's apreq\_filter() to hang. |
| [507](#l507) |  |
| [508](#l508) | - Documentation [joes] |
| [509](#l509) | CHANGES file reformatted, removing dates & other clutter |
| [510](#l510) | as Stas suggests. |
| [511](#l511) |  |
| [512](#l512) | - C API [joes] |
| [513](#l513) | Rewrote cgi\_read() in apreq\_env.c and reworked mod\_apreq.c |
| [514](#l514) | to enforce apreq\_env\_max\_body() settings. |
| [515](#l515) |  |
| [516](#l516) | - C API [joes] |
| [517](#l517) | Fixed bug in url\_parser code- missing context brigade was |
| [518](#l518) | needed to track key-value pairs which span multiple buckets. |
| [519](#l519) |  |
| [520](#l520) | - C API [joes] |
| [521](#l521) | API modifications: removed struct apreq\_cfg\_t, adding |
| [522](#l522) | new apreq\_env hooks max\_body, max\_brigade\_len, and temp\_dir. |
| [523](#l523) | Folded apreq\_parsers.h into apreq\_params.h and modified the arguments |
| [524](#l524) | to apreq\_run\_parser() and apreq\_run\_hook(). Renamed |
| [525](#l525) | apreq\_parser\_t's content\_type as enctype and apreq\_copy\_brigade() |
| [526](#l526) | as apreq\_brigade\_copy(). |
| [527](#l527) | These changes make libapreq2.so.2.0.5 incompatible with earlier |
| [528](#l528) | versions. |
| [529](#l529) |  |
| [530](#l530) | - Perl API [stas] |
| [531](#l531) | Include ppport.h from blead-perl to support older perls. |
| [532](#l532) | Add a proper support for ithreads. |
| [533](#l533) |  |
| [534](#l534) | - C API [Swen Schillig, joes] |
| [535](#l535) | Fixed bug in calculation of Netscape cookie expiration dates. |
| [536](#l536) | apr\_time\_t is measured in microseconds, not seconds, which |
| [537](#l537) | threw off the arithmetic; apr\_time\_from\_sec was needed for |
| [538](#l538) | the conversion. |
| [539](#l539) |  |
| [540](#l540) | - C API [Max Kellermann] |
| [541](#l541) | Fix segfault caused by invalid %-escape sequence in query string. |
| [542](#l542) |  |
| [543](#l543) |  |
| [544](#l544) | @section v2\_02\_dev Changes with libapreq2-2.02-dev (released Nov 15, 2003) |
| [545](#l545) |  |
| [546](#l546) |  |
| [547](#l547) | - Perl API [joes] |
| [548](#l548) | Fix bogus pool/cookie initializers in Apache::Cookie::set\_attr(), |
| [549](#l549) | which caused Apache::Cookie::new to segfault. Bug |
| [550](#l550) | first reported to modperl list by Wolfgang Kubens. |
| [551](#l551) |  |
| [552](#l552) |  |
| [553](#l553) | @section v2\_01\_dev Changes with libapreq2-2.01-dev (released Nov 10, 2003) |
| [554](#l554) |  |
| [555](#l555) |  |
| [556](#l556) | - build system [joes] |
| [557](#l557) | Skip Apache::Test tests in env/ when Apache::Test is unavailable. |
| [558](#l558) | This allows the C API to be build and installed without requiring |
| [559](#l559) | Apache::Test (it is still a requirement for compiling the perl glue). |
| [560](#l560) |  |
| [561](#l561) | - C API mod\_apreq.c [joes] |
| [562](#l562) | Parser errors were creeping into the return value of apreq\_filter, |
| [563](#l563) | which breaks the "transparent tee" paradigm. This caused bogus |
| [564](#l564) | "400 Bad Request" responses (first reported by Vladimir Dudo) |
| [565](#l565) | to occur when libapreq2 was used by an output filter during a GET |
| [566](#l566) | request (handled by apache2's default handler). The test suite |
| [567](#l567) | has been updated accordingly. |
| [568](#l568) |  |
| [569](#l569) | - C API [joes] |
| [570](#l570) | Incorporate libapreq\_cgi into libapreq2 as the default environment, |
| [571](#l571) | and add apreq\_env\_t and initializer apreq\_env\_module() to manage the |
| [572](#l572) | environment at runtime (determining the environment at load-time |
| [573](#l573) | was problematic on non-ELF systems). |

| [576](#l576) | @section v2\_0\_0 Changes with libapreq2-2.00-dev (Oct 25, 2003) |
| [577](#l577) |  |
| [578](#l578) |  |
| [579](#l579) | - C API: libapreq\_cgi.c [randyk, joes] |
| [580](#l580) | CGI environment defined by env/libapreq\_cgi.c is functional |
| [581](#l581) | (with tests added to env/t). This library may soon be incorporated |
| [582](#l582) | directly into libapreq2 as a default enviroment. |
| [583](#l583) |  |
| [584](#l584) | - C API: mod\_apreq.c [joes] |
| [585](#l585) | Added ctx->saw\_eos to ensure we don't read from upstream filters |
| [586](#l586) | after receiving an eos bucket. Otherwise it was possible for |
| [587](#l587) | two eos buckets to appear when a prefetch read is involved, which |
| [588](#l588) | breaks other modules like mod\_proxy. This bug was uncovered by |
| [589](#l589) | Philippe Chiasson. mod\_apreq's apreq\_env\_majic\_number bumped to |
| [590](#l590) | reflect the added fixes. |
| [591](#l591) |  |
| [592](#l592) | - configure: --enable-perl-glue [joes] |
| [593](#l593) | The --enable-perl-glue option integrates the perl glue into the |
| [594](#l594) | normal Unix build cycle. It is disabled by default, but is silently |
| [595](#l595) | reenabled if the user configures the source tree via Makefile.PL. |
| [596](#l596) |  |
| [597](#l597) | - C API [joes] |
| [598](#l598) | Added apreq\_header\_attribute() and fixed mfd parser to allow |
| [599](#l599) | "charset" attribute to appear in the Content-Type header. Sven |
| [600](#l600) | Geisler points out that Opera 7.20 does generate such headers. |
| [601](#l601) |  |
| [602](#l602) | - C API [joes] |
| [603](#l603) | Added versioning API following <http://apr.apache.org/versioning.html> |
| [604](#l604) | apreq\_env renamed apreq\_env\_name, and apreq\_env\_magic\_number added |
| [605](#l605) | to provide versioning for environments (modules). The header files |
| [606](#l606) | are now installed to "include/apreq2", and the library is renamed |
| [607](#l607) | "libapreq2". Also added an apreq2-config script based on apu-config. |
| [608](#l608) |  |
| [609](#l609) | - configure: static mod\_apreq.c [Bojan Smojver, joes] |
| [610](#l610) | Add --with-apache2-src configure option, along with --with-apr-config |
| [611](#l611) | and --with-apu-config, and provide support for compiling mod\_apreq |
| [612](#l612) | into httpd as a static apache module. |
| [613](#l613) |  |
| [614](#l614) | - C API: mod\_apreq.c [joes] |
| [615](#l615) | Support for internal redirects added to the mod\_apreq filter. |
| [616](#l616) | This ensures any POST data prefetched in the main request |
| [617](#l617) | gets passed along to the subrequest handler(s). |
| [618](#l618) |  |
| [619](#l619) | - C bugfix: apreq\_decode [Graham Clark] |
| [620](#l620) | If the source and destination strings are represented by the same |
| [621](#l621) | pointer - e.g. if called as apreq\_unescape(s) - string s is modified |
| [622](#l622) | incorrectly in general. Patch includes new unit test. |
| [623](#l623) |  |
| [624](#l624) | - Perl API [joes] |
| [625](#l625) | Added $req->parse, $req->status, & "preparse" logic |
| [626](#l626) | to $req->param & $req->upload. |
| [627](#l627) |  |
| [628](#l628) | - C API [joes] |
| [629](#l629) | Added "preparse" logic to apreq\_params & apreq\_uploads |
| [630](#l630) | to bring behavior in line with libapreq-1.x. |
| [631](#l631) |  |
| [632](#l632) | - C API [joes] |
| [633](#l633) | Dropped param->charset. |
| [634](#l634) | Make apreq\_brigade\_concat public, so mod\_apreq can use it |
| [635](#l635) | for its ctx->spool brigade. |
| [636](#l636) |  |
| [637](#l637) | - Documentation [joes] |
| [638](#l638) | Updated Cookie\_pod to reflect API changes over v1.X. |
| [639](#l639) |  |
| [640](#l640) | - Documentation [joes] |
| [641](#l641) | Added doxygen links to Apache::Request and Apache::Cookie |
| [642](#l642) | perl docs. |
| [643](#l643) |  |
| [644](#l644) | - C API [joes] |
| [645](#l645) | Added apreq\_copy\_brigade(bb) to apreq.h. |
| [646](#l646) |  |
| [647](#l647) | - C API [joes] |
| [648](#l648) | The new filter-based design required a complete |
| [649](#l649) | departure from libapreq-1.X codebase. libapreq-2 |
| [650](#l650) | is based solely on APR, and to be fully functional, |
| [651](#l651) | requires a supporting environment similar to Apache-2. |
| [652](#l652) | A person wishing to port libapreq-2 to a new environment |
| [653](#l653) | needs to provide definitions for the declarations in apreq\_env.h. |
| [654](#l654) |  |
| [655](#l655) | - Perl API [joes] |
| [656](#l656) | Aggregates are always collected into an APR::Table-based package. |
| [657](#l657) | New table packages: Apache::Cookie::Table, Apache::Request::Table, |
| [658](#l658) | and Apache::Upload::Table. |
| [659](#l659) |  |
| [660](#l660) | - Perl API [joes] |
| [661](#l661) | Apache::Cookie->fetch now requires an "environment" argument ($r). |
| [662](#l662) | Its return value is blessed into the Apache::Cookie::Jar class. |
| [663](#l663) |  |
| [664](#l664) | - Perl API [joes] |
| [665](#l665) | Two new request lookup functions: |
| [666](#l666) | -# $req->args - param lookup using only the query string |
| [667](#l667) | -# $req->body - param lookup using only the POST data |
| [668](#l668) |  |
| [669](#l669) |  |
| [670](#l670) | \*\*/ |

| [23](#l23) | - C API [joes] |
| [24](#l24) | Protect against arbitrary recursion depth in apreq\_parse\_multipart() |
| [25](#l25) | by adding a reasonable compile-time MAX\_LEVEL limit. |
| [26](#l26) |  |
| [27](#l27) | - C API [joes] |
| [28](#l28) | Clean up end-of-file parsing for apreq\_parse\_multipart(), |
| [29](#l29) | conforming to rfc-2046 § 5.1.1. |
| [30](#l30) |  |
| [31](#l31) | - Perl API [joes] |
| [32](#l32) | Move APR::Request::Param::Table and APR::Request::Cookie::Table |
| [33](#l33) | packages to APR::Request module. |
| [34](#l34) |  |
| [35](#l35) | - Perl XS [Steve Hay] |

| [55](#l55) |  |
| [56](#l56) | - C API [joes] |

| [68](#l68) |  |
| [69](#l69) |  |
| [70](#l70) | - C API [Marc Gràcia, joes] |
| [71](#l71) | Fix apreq\_decode(v) when iso-latin-1 chars appear |
| [72](#l72) | at the end of an encoded string. |
| [73](#l73) |  |
| [74](#l74) | - Perl API [Philip M. Gollucci] |

| [76](#l76) |  |
| [77](#l77) | - C API [Philip M. Gollucci] |
| [78](#l78) | Add mod\_apreq2 to httpd's server tokens. |
| [79](#l79) |  |
| [80](#l80) | - Perl API [joes] |
| [81](#l81) | Drop support for $req->env(), which also died with 2.05-dev. |
| [82](#l82) |  |
| [83](#l83) | - Perl API [joes] |
| [84](#l84) | Support for table set/add/delete methods is formally withdrawn. |
| [85](#l85) | Technically this feature died with the module API refactoring in |
| [86](#l86) | 2.05-dev. |
| [87](#l87) |  |
| [88](#l88) | - C API [max] |
| [89](#l89) | Right-hand limit of apreq\_brigade\_move() is declared as "excluding", |
| [90](#l90) | but APR\_RING\_UNSPLICE() wants an "including" right-hand limit. Fixed |
| [91](#l91) | this by passing the previous bucket. |
| [92](#l92) |  |
| [93](#l93) | - Perl API [joes] |
| [94](#l94) | Drop support for Apache2::Request::new's HOOK\_DATA. |
| [95](#l95) | UPLOAD\_HOOK now takes only two arguments: ($upload, $data). |
| [96](#l96) |  |
| [97](#l97) | - Perl API [joes] |
| [98](#l98) | Drop support for Apache2::Cookie::Jar::new's VALUE\_CLASS. |
| [99](#l99) | 2.05-dev broke that API, and it's not worth trying to fix. |
| [100](#l100) | People who need that should use APR::Request::Cookie::Table's |
| [101](#l101) | cookie\_class() API instead. |
| [102](#l102) |  |
| [103](#l103) | - Perl API [joes] |
| [104](#l104) | Fix cookie domain/path munging in Apache2::Cookie::new(). |
| [105](#l105) |  |
| [106](#l106) |  |
| [107](#l107) | @section v2\_05\_dev Changes with libapreq2-2.05-dev (released May 5, 2005) |
| [108](#l108) |  |
| [109](#l109) |  |
| [110](#l110) | - Win32 build [Randy Kobes] |
| [111](#l111) | Have top-level 'nmake', 'nmake test', and 'nmake install' |
| [112](#l112) | targets, respectively, also include building, testing, and |
| [113](#l113) | installing the corresponding perl glue targets. |
| [114](#l114) |  |
| [115](#l115) | - C API [geoff] |
| [116](#l116) | Minimum httpd version is now 2.0.48, which includes the official |
| [117](#l117) | apr 0.9.4 release. |
| [118](#l118) |  |
| [119](#l119) | - C API [Max Kellermann] |
| [120](#l120) | Fix apreq\_quote. |
| [121](#l121) |  |
| [122](#l122) | - Perl API [joes] |
| [123](#l123) | Remove Apache2::Request::args. WARNING: through inheritance, |
| [124](#l124) | args() now maps to Apache2::RequestRec::args. Folks that want |
| [125](#l125) | the pre-2.05-dev behavior need to invoke APR::Request::args by name. |
| [126](#l126) |  |
| [127](#l127) | - C API [joes, Max Kellermann] |
| [128](#l128) | Add apreq\_initialize, apreq\_pre\_initialize and apreq\_post\_initialize. |
| [129](#l129) | These are not thread-safe operations, so applications need to ensure |
| [130](#l130) | they are invoked (in the correct sequence) prior to using any apreq2 |
| [131](#l131) | modules. |
| [132](#l132) |  |
| [133](#l133) | - C, Perl API [joes] |
| [134](#l134) | Add pool, bucket\_alloc to apreq\_handle\_t. |
| [135](#l135) |  |
| [136](#l136) | - Perl API [joes] |
| [137](#l137) | Drop $data argument from UPLOAD\_HOOK, and also drop HOOK\_DATA option. |
| [138](#l138) | Perl folks should use a closure instead of passing in context data. |
| [139](#l139) |  |
| [140](#l140) | - Perl API [joes] |
| [141](#l141) | Move bake, bake2 to Apache2::Cookie, now requiring |
| [142](#l142) | an extra $r argument. Also ""-operator is mapped |
| [143](#l143) | to as\_string() for Apache2::Cookie; but APR::Request::Cookie |
| [144](#l144) | maps it to value(). |
| [145](#l145) |  |
| [146](#l146) | - C API [joes] |
| [147](#l147) | Remove header\_in & header\_out from apreq\_module\_t. |
| [148](#l148) | Remove apreq\_ua\_cookie\_version() and apreq\_cookie\_bake\*(). |
| [149](#l149) | Remove cookie2 argument to apreq\_handle\_custom(). |
| [150](#l150) |  |
| [151](#l151) | - C API [joes] |
| [152](#l152) | s/APREQ/APREQ2/g in webserver configuration directives. |
| [153](#l153) |  |
| [154](#l154) | - C API [Igor Shevchenko, Philip Gollucci] |
| [155](#l155) | Fix segfault in mfd parser caused by parts w/ empty param names. |
| [156](#l156) |  |
| [157](#l157) | - C API [joes] |
| [158](#l158) | Add apreq\_cp1252\_to\_utf8(). |
| [159](#l159) |  |
| [160](#l160) | - C, Perl API [joes] |
| [161](#l161) | Add charset support for params and couple the SvUTF8 flag |
| [162](#l162) | to the param's taint flag. |
| [163](#l163) |  |
| [164](#l164) | - C API [joes] |
| [165](#l165) | Replace v->size with v->nlen + v->dlen. |
| [166](#l166) | Added supporting apreq\_value\_table\_add(). |
| [167](#l167) |  |
| [168](#l168) | - C API [joes] |
| [169](#l169) | Remove apreq\_cookie\_attr(). |
| [170](#l170) |  |
| [171](#l171) | - C API [joes] |
| [172](#l172) | - Add apreq\_error.h, apreq\_module.h. |
| [173](#l173) | - Rename apreq\_run\* and apreq\_make\* funcs to conform with |
| [174](#l174) | apreq\_$obj\_$meth scheme. |
| [175](#l175) | - Replace c->version & c->secure with flags. |
| [176](#l176) | - Parsers are assumed to be working with external data, so the |
| [177](#l177) | cookies & params they produce are marked tainted. |
| [178](#l178) |  |
| [179](#l179) | - C API [joes] |
| [180](#l180) | apreq\_parse\_cookie\_header() failed to parse RFC Cookie headers which |
| [181](#l181) | contained no space chars after the '$Version=1' preamble. |
| [182](#l182) |  |
| [183](#l183) | - C API [joes] |
| [184](#l184) | Reorganize around include/, library/, and module/ dirs. |
| [185](#l185) |  |
| [186](#l186) | - C Tests [joes] |
| [187](#l187) | Replace CuTest-based tests with custom TAP-compliant framework. |
| [188](#l188) |  |
| [189](#l189) | - C API [Max Kellermann] |
| [190](#l190) | Continue the API improvements: |
| [191](#l191) |  |
| [192](#l192) | - Convert APREQ\_RUN\_PARSER and APREQ\_RUN\_HOOK to inline, and downcase them. |
| [193](#l193) | - Remove apreq\_memmem. |
| [194](#l194) | - Convert apreq\_(un)escape to inline. |
| [195](#l195) | - apreq\_escape does not create an apreq\_value\_t\*. |
| [196](#l196) | - Initialize default\_parsers explicitly to NULL. |
| [197](#l197) | - Convert APREQ\_BRIGADE\_COPY to inline, and downcase it. |
| [198](#l198) | - Lowercase APREQ\_BRIGADE\_SETASIDE, APREQ\_BRIGADE\_COPY. |
| [199](#l199) | - Convert apreq\_cookie\_name and apreq\_cookie\_value macros to inline. |
| [200](#l200) | - Convert apreq\_param\_name, apreq\_param\_value, apreq\_param\_info, and |
| [201](#l201) | apreq\_param\_brigade to inline. |
| [202](#l202) |  |
| [203](#l203) | - C API [joes] |
| [204](#l204) | Widespread API refactorization to remove apreq\_jar\_t and apreq\_request\_t: |
| [205](#l205) |  |
| [206](#l206) | - Header includes reorganized; apreq\_parsers.h added (back again). |
| [207](#l207) | - Replaced apreq\_jar\_t and apreq\_request\_t with single apreq\_env\_handle\_t. |
| [208](#l208) | - Added const qualifier to "v" attribute of apreq\_cookie\_t and apreq\_param\_t. |
| [209](#l209) | - Use union type-puns to drop const qualifiers inside the new |
| [210](#l210) | apreq\_value\_to\_cookie and apreq\_value\_to\_param implementations |
| [211](#l211) | (gcc generates same object code as the macro versions did). |
| [212](#l212) | - Moved "flags" attribute from apreq\_value\_t to apreq\_cookie\_t and apreq\_param\_t. |
| [213](#l213) | - Remove env argument from hooks and parsers. |

| [256](#l256) |  |
| [257](#l257) | [apreq\_parsers.h] |
| [258](#l258) | - Acquire the hook and parser sections of original apreq\_params.h. |
| [259](#l259) | - Remove env argument from APREQ\_PARSER\_ARGS and APREQ\_HOOK\_ARGS |
| [260](#l260) | - Augment apreq\_hook\_t and apreq\_parser\_t to replace missing env features. |
| [261](#l261) | - Change apreq\_make\_parser and apreq\_make\_hook signatures. |
| [262](#l262) | - Rename apreq\_add\_hook to apreq\_parser\_add\_hook, returning apr\_status\_t. |
| [263](#l263) | - Change apreq\_parser signature. |

| [265](#l265) | [apreq\_env.h] |
| [266](#l266) | - Remove read, log, pool, bucket\_alloc, request, jar, and query\_string methods. |
| [267](#l267) | - Include apreq\_parsers.h. |
| [268](#l268) | - Reorganize apreq\_env\_module\_t to provide hook, parser, jar, args, |
| [269](#l269) | & body table ops. |

| [275](#l275) |  |
| [276](#l276) | [mod\_apreq.c, apreq\_env\_apache2.h] |
| [277](#l277) | - Changed APREQ\_Max\* configs to APREQ\_BrigadeLimit and APREQ\_ReadLimit. |
| [278](#l278) | - Handle constructor renamed apreq\_handle\_apache2. |
| [279](#l279) |  |
| [280](#l280) | - C API [joes] |
| [281](#l281) | Make our "libtool current interface" number depend on apr's |
| [282](#l282) | major number. This allows libapreq2 to be installed into a |
| [283](#l283) | system-wide location while avoiding ABI conflicts arising from |
| [284](#l284) | our apr-based interfaces. |
| [285](#l285) |  |
| [286](#l286) | - C API [Max Kellermann] |
| [287](#l287) | Introduce apreq\_env\_handle\_t to replace the void \*env usage. |
| [288](#l288) | Also added apreq\_env\_custom for making private handles, and new |
| [289](#l289) | apreq\_env\_apache2.h to let mod\_apreq export apreq\_env\_make\_apache2. |
| [290](#l290) |  |
| [291](#l291) | - C API [Max Kellermann] |
| [292](#l292) | Rename apreq\_env\_t to apreq\_env\_module\_t, to prepare for |
| [293](#l293) | a new thread-safe apreq\_env API. |
| [294](#l294) |  |
| [295](#l295) | - C API [Max Kellermann] |
| [296](#l296) | mod\_apreq must check the return value of apreq\_brigade\_concat |
| [297](#l297) | to avoid a RAM-consuming infinite loop. A bad APREQ\_TempDir |
| [298](#l298) | setting can cause this situation. |
| [299](#l299) |  |
| [300](#l300) | - C API [joes] |
| [301](#l301) | Provide workaround for chunked trailers bug in ap\_http\_filter. |
| [302](#l302) |  |
| [303](#l303) | - C, Perl API [joes] |
| [304](#l304) | Several upload-related bugfixes: |
| [305](#l305) | 1) apreq\_upload and apreq\_uploads did not search the full body table, |
| [306](#l306) | 2) $upload->slurp and $io->read did not autovivify the resultant string. |
| [307](#l307) |  |
| [308](#l308) | - C API [joes] |
| [309](#l309) | Add "flags" attribute to apreq\_value\_t, planning for charset support. |
| [310](#l310) | This is an ABI change, starting with libapreq2.so.2.0.24. |
| [311](#l311) |  |
| [312](#l312) | - C API [joes] |
| [313](#l313) | Add apreq\_env\_bucket\_alloc() to get an allocator directly from the |
| [314](#l314) | environment instead of creating them from a pool. This is an |
| [315](#l315) | ABI change, starting with libapreq2.so.2.0.23. |
| [316](#l316) |  |
| [317](#l317) | - Build system [joes] |
| [318](#l318) | Add --with-apache2-httpd option so users can override apxs's |
| [319](#l319) | notion of where the httpd executable is. XSBuilder's header |
| [320](#l320) | parser runs from buildconf now instead of configure, so we |
| [321](#l321) | will include those tables in the release tarball. buildconf |
| [322](#l322) | gets an additional --with-perl option for running the xsbuilder.pl |
| [323](#l323) | parsing script. The XS generation code in xsbuilder.pl has moved |
| [324](#l324) | to glue/perl/Makefile.PL. |
| [325](#l325) |  |
| [326](#l326) | - Perl API [joes] |
| [327](#l327) | Allow ctors for Apache::Cookie, Apache::Cookie::Jar |
| [328](#l328) | and Apache:::Request to accept Apache::Request objects |
| [329](#l329) | (instead of requiring an Apache::RequestRec object). |
| [330](#l330) | This thread details the bug |
| [331](#l331) | <http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.apache.mod-perl/15727> |
| [332](#l332) |  |
| [333](#l333) | - C API [Bojan Smojver] |
| [334](#l334) | Bake cookies with err\_headers\_out so they are |
| [335](#l335) | sent on non-2xx server responses (ie. a 304 redirect). |
| [336](#l336) | Also ensure that headers are copied with apr\_table\_add |
| [337](#l337) | instead of apr\_table\_addn. Since apreq\_cookie\_bake() |
| [338](#l338) | allocates from the stack, the Set-Cookie headers would |
| [339](#l339) | occasionally get mangled without this patch. |
| [340](#l340) |  |
| [341](#l341) | - C API [joes] |
| [342](#l342) | Add apreq\_register\_parser(), which allows users to add |
| [343](#l343) | their own parsers to apreq\_parser()'s recognized MIME types. |
| [344](#l344) |  |
| [345](#l345) | - C API [joes] |
| [346](#l346) | Support "multipart/mixed" file uploads. |
| [347](#l347) | Support XForms' "multipart/related" enctype. |
| [348](#l348) |  |
| [349](#l349) | - C API [joes] |
| [350](#l350) | Add apreq\_hook\_apr\_xml\_parser(), which is a simple wrapper |
| [351](#l351) | hook around APR's expat-based apr\_xml\_parser. Add a generic |
| [352](#l352) | parser apreq\_parse\_generic() to parse arbitrary enctypes using |
| [353](#l353) | the hook API. |
| [354](#l354) |  |
| [355](#l355) |  |
| [356](#l356) | @section v2\_04\_dev Changes with libapreq2-2.04-dev (released August 30, 2004) |
| [357](#l357) |  |
| [358](#l358) |  |
| [359](#l359) | - Perl API [joes] |
| [360](#l360) | Add TAINT checks, marking all parsed data as tainted. |
| [361](#l361) |  |
| [362](#l362) | - C API [joes] |
| [363](#l363) | Add body\_status attribute to apreq\_request\_t, to allow the both |
| [364](#l364) | environment and the parser to report any errors encountered. |
| [365](#l365) |  |
| [366](#l366) | - C API [randyk, joes] |
| [367](#l367) | Cookie parser was locking up on non-alphanumeric chars in cookie names. |
| [368](#l368) | Also RFC Cookie attributes are always checked for quotes during bake(2), |
| [369](#l369) | and the quotes are now stripped from incoming RFC cookies during parsing |
| [370](#l370) | (but they are never stripped from the actual cookie value). |
| [371](#l371) |  |
| [372](#l372) | - Perl API [joes] |
| [373](#l373) | Apache::Cookie::Jar->new accepts a VALUE\_CLASS argument, which effectively |
| [374](#l374) | blesses all the jar's cookies into that class, which simplifies subclassing |
| [375](#l375) | Apache::Cookie. Accordingly Apache::Cookie->freeze($value) no longer accepts |
| [376](#l376) | a freeze()-able object in $value. |
| [377](#l377) |  |
| [378](#l378) | - C API [Markus Wichitill, randyk, joes] |
| [379](#l379) | Drop APR\_DELONCLOSE from apreq\_file\_mktemp implementation and install |
| [380](#l380) | apreq\_file\_cleanup. When passed to apr\_file\_open on Win32, APR\_DELONCLOSE |
| [381](#l381) | sets the FILE\_SHARED\_DELETE flag, which is, unfortunately, a property that |
| [382](#l382) | is preserved across NTFS "hard" links. This breaks apps that link() |
| [383](#l383) | the temp file to a permanent location, and subsequently expect to open it |
| [384](#l384) | without FILE\_SHARED\_DELETE before the original tempfile is closed+deleted. |
| [385](#l385) | In fact, even Apache::Upload does this, so it is a common enough event that |
| [386](#l386) | the apreq\_file\_cleanup workaround is necessary. |
| [387](#l387) |  |
| [388](#l388) | - C API [Ken Burcham, joes] |
| [389](#l389) | Fix bug in url parser that occurs when a %XX-encoded sequence |
| [390](#l390) | is split across multiple buckets. Added apreq\_decode\_decodev |
| [391](#l391) | to make this problem less inconvenient. |
| [392](#l392) |  |
| [393](#l393) | - Perl API [joes] |
| [394](#l394) | Exception objects inherit from the object which raised it, |
| [395](#l395) | which allows $@ to invoke its methods with impunity (exceptions |
| [396](#l396) | are disabled for objects which derive from an exception class). |
| [397](#l397) |  |
| [398](#l398) | - Perl API [joes] |
| [399](#l399) | Implement HOOK\_DATA and UPLOAD\_HOOK. |
| [400](#l400) |  |
| [401](#l401) | - Perl API [joes] |
| [402](#l402) | Add safe XS wrappers for $table->add, $table->set, $table->STORE, |
| [403](#l403) | and $table\_class->new. |
| [404](#l404) |  |
| [405](#l405) | - Perl API [joes] |
| [406](#l406) | Add exceptions to $upload->link, $upload->tempname, $upload->slurp, |
| [407](#l407) | and $cookie->set\_attr. Return value of $upload->slurp is now the |
| [408](#l408) | upload length. Also document new $upload->io. |
| [409](#l409) |  |
| [410](#l410) | - C API [joes] |
| [411](#l411) | Restrict all apr\_status\_t codes to APR\_SUCCESS, APR\_INCOMPLETE, |
| [412](#l412) | APR\_EGENERAL, APR\_EINIT, APR\_ENOTIMPL, since any others will |
| [413](#l413) | generate confusing error messages from apr\_strerror. |
| [414](#l414) |  |
| [415](#l415) | - Perl API [joes] |
| [416](#l416) | Added $upload->io with a TIEHANDLE API layered over APR::Brigade. $upload->fh |
| [417](#l417) | remains implemented as an APR::PerlIO object, which is seekable but less efficient |
| [418](#l418) | and currently suffers some portability issues associated with largefile support |
| [419](#l419) | in perl and apr. |
| [420](#l420) |  |
| [421](#l421) | - Perl API [joes] |
| [422](#l422) | Added apreq\_xs\_croak for throwing APR::Error exceptions and included |
| [423](#l423) | error-checking on $req->param, $req->args, $req->body, $req->upload, |
| [424](#l424) | and $jar->get. |
| [425](#l425) |  |
| [426](#l426) | - Perl API [joes] |
| [427](#l427) | Added $jar->status, $req->args\_status and $req->body\_status to report |
| [428](#l428) | parsing errors. Also add $upload->tempname per user request. |
| [429](#l429) |  |
| [430](#l430) | - C API [joes] |
| [431](#l431) | Dropped status attribute of apreq\_value\_t. Added status field to |
| [432](#l432) | apreq\_jar\_t and added args\_status field to apreq\_request\_t. Parsers |
| [433](#l433) | also must return their public status code when a NULL brigade is passed. |
| [434](#l434) | apreq\_hook\_disable\_uploads() is also added. |
| [435](#l435) |  |
| [436](#l436) | This is an ABI change affecting all versions of libapreq2 prior to 2.0.12. |
| [437](#l437) |  |
| [438](#l438) | - Perl API [joes] |
| [439](#l439) | $upload->info returns a proper APR::Table object now. Also implemented |
| [440](#l440) | $upload->size, $upload->fh, and $upload->type. |
| [441](#l441) |  |
| [442](#l442) | - C API [Jean-François Meesse] |
| [443](#l443) | mfd parser fails to parse CRLF-terminated files when the terminating |
| [444](#l444) | boundary string is at the start of a new bucket. This is reportedly |
| [445](#l445) | a common event for PDF files uploaded with Netscape 7. |
| [446](#l446) |  |
| [447](#l447) | - Perl API [joes] |
| [448](#l448) | Add back-compat support for Apache::Cookie->fetch() via |
| [449](#l449) | Apache->request. |
| [450](#l450) |  |
| [451](#l451) | - C API [joes] |
| [452](#l452) | Add MaxBody, MaxBrigade, and TempDir per-dir directives to mod\_apreq |
| [453](#l453) | filter. |
| [454](#l454) |  |
| [455](#l455) | - C API [joes] |
| [456](#l456) | Replace free/tempnam dependency in apreq\_file\_mktemp() with |
| [457](#l457) | apr\_temp\_dir\_get(). Add additional gcc warning flags when |
| [458](#l458) | --enable-maintainer-mode is set. |
| [459](#l459) |  |
| [460](#l460) | - C API [joes, Scott Hutton] |
| [461](#l461) | Replace apreq\_brigade\_copy with more effective APREQ\_BRIGADE\_COPY |
| [462](#l462) | macro. Also introduce APREQ\_BRIGADE\_SETASIDE to deal with buckets |
| [463](#l463) | that need to be set aside for use in future function calls. mod\_ssl |
| [464](#l464) | generates transient buckets which tickled this bug. |
| [465](#l465) |  |
| [466](#l466) | - Perl API [joes] |
| [467](#l467) | Separate Apache::Upload module from Apache::Request for |
| [468](#l468) | better organization. |
| [469](#l469) |  |
| [470](#l470) |  |
| [471](#l471) | @section v2\_03\_dev Changes with libapreq2-2.03-dev (released June 12, 2004) |
| [472](#l472) |  |
| [473](#l473) |  |
| [474](#l474) | - C API [joes] |
| [475](#l475) | "Objectify" cookie/jar API: s/apreq\_(make|serialize)\_cookie/apreq\_cookie\_$1/ |
| [476](#l476) | and reordering args so the cookie/jar object is always the first argument. |
| [477](#l477) | Macros added to provide source-compatibility with the old names. |
| [478](#l478) |  |
| [479](#l479) | - Perl API [joes] |
| [480](#l480) | Added $upload->slurp($data), which reads the contents of the file |
| [481](#l481) | upload "$upload" into the scalar "$data". |
| [482](#l482) |  |
| [483](#l483) | - C API [joes, randyk] |
| [484](#l484) | apreq\_run\_(hook|parser) are macros, so they are capitalized now. |
| [485](#l485) | Fixed apreq\_params\_as\_string() and added apreq\_params\_as\_array(). |
| [486](#l486) | Reworked definitions of APREQ\_DECLARE\_HOOK, APREQ\_DECLARE\_PARSER |
| [487](#l487) | and apreq\_(parser|hook)\_t, hopefully to be more Win32 friendly. |
| [488](#l488) | Also updated the documentation. |
| [489](#l489) |  |
| [490](#l490) | - C API [joes] |
| [491](#l491) | Compensate for a missing CRLF in empty file upload block, which |
| [492](#l492) | actually complies with RFC 2046 Section 5.1.1. Konqueror (version unknown) |
| [493](#l493) | and Mozilla 0.9.7 are known to emit such blocks. |
| [494](#l494) |  |
| [495](#l495) | - Perl API [joes] |
| [496](#l496) | $req->upload() in list context failed to filter out non-uploads. |
| [497](#l497) | Also $req->upload("nonexistent-key-name") segfaults. |
| [498](#l498) |  |
| [499](#l499) | - Perl test suite |
| [500](#l500) | t/TEST.PL must run parent class' pre\_configure to get the |
| [501](#l501) | configuration right |
| [502](#l502) |  |
| [503](#l503) | - C API [joes] |
| [504](#l504) | apreq\_brigade\_concat() wasn't supplying the final EOS bucket |
| [505](#l505) | to large brigades (>256K), which somtimes caused the prefetch |
| [506](#l506) | loop in mod\_apreq.c's apreq\_filter() to hang. |
| [507](#l507) |  |
| [508](#l508) | - Documentation [joes] |
| [509](#l509) | CHANGES file reformatted, removing dates & other clutter |
| [510](#l510) | as Stas suggests. |
| [511](#l511) |  |
| [512](#l512) | - C API [joes] |
| [513](#l513) | Rewrote cgi\_read() in apreq\_env.c and reworked mod\_apreq.c |
| [514](#l514) | to enforce apreq\_env\_max\_body() settings. |
| [515](#l515) |  |
| [516](#l516) | - C API [joes] |
| [517](#l517) | Fixed bug in url\_parser code- missing context brigade was |
| [518](#l518) | needed to track key-value pairs which span multiple buckets. |
| [519](#l519) |  |
| [520](#l520) | - C API [joes] |
| [521](#l521) | API modifications: removed struct apreq\_cfg\_t, adding |
| [522](#l522) | new apreq\_env hooks max\_body, max\_brigade\_len, and temp\_dir. |
| [523](#l523) | Folded apreq\_parsers.h into apreq\_params.h and modified the arguments |
| [524](#l524) | to apreq\_run\_parser() and apreq\_run\_hook(). Renamed |
| [525](#l525) | apreq\_parser\_t's content\_type as enctype and apreq\_copy\_brigade() |
| [526](#l526) | as apreq\_brigade\_copy(). |
| [527](#l527) | These changes make libapreq2.so.2.0.5 incompatible with earlier |
| [528](#l528) | versions. |
| [529](#l529) |  |
| [530](#l530) | - Perl API [stas] |
| [531](#l531) | Include ppport.h from blead-perl to support older perls. |
| [532](#l532) | Add a proper support for ithreads. |
| [533](#l533) |  |
| [534](#l534) | - C API [Swen Schillig, joes] |
| [535](#l535) | Fixed bug in calculation of Netscape cookie expiration dates. |
| [536](#l536) | apr\_time\_t is measured in microseconds, not seconds, which |
| [537](#l537) | threw off the arithmetic; apr\_time\_from\_sec was needed for |
| [538](#l538) | the conversion. |
| [539](#l539) |  |
| [540](#l540) | - C API [Max Kellermann] |
| [541](#l541) | Fix segfault caused by invalid %-escape sequence in query string. |
| [542](#l542) |  |
| [543](#l543) |  |
| [544](#l544) | @section v2\_02\_dev Changes with libapreq2-2.02-dev (released Nov 15, 2003) |
| [545](#l545) |  |
| [546](#l546) |  |
| [547](#l547) | - Perl API [joes] |
| [548](#l548) | Fix bogus pool/cookie initializers in Apache::Cookie::set\_attr(), |
| [549](#l549) | which caused Apache::Cookie::new to segfault. Bug |
| [550](#l550) | first reported to modperl list by Wolfgang Kubens. |
| [551](#l551) |  |
| [552](#l552) |  |
| [553](#l553) | @section v2\_01\_dev Changes with libapreq2-2.01-dev (released Nov 10, 2003) |
| [554](#l554) |  |
| [555](#l555) |  |
| [556](#l556) | - build system [joes] |
| [557](#l557) | Skip Apache::Test tests in env/ when Apache::Test is unavailable. |
| [558](#l558) | This allows the C API to be build and installed without requiring |
| [559](#l559) | Apache::Test (it is still a requirement for compiling the perl glue). |
| [560](#l560) |  |
| [561](#l561) | - C API mod\_apreq.c [joes] |
| [562](#l562) | Parser errors were creeping into the return value of apreq\_filter, |
| [563](#l563) | which breaks the "transparent tee" paradigm. This caused bogus |
| [564](#l564) | "400 Bad Request" responses (first reported by Vladimir Dudo) |
| [565](#l565) | to occur when libapreq2 was used by an output filter during a GET |
| [566](#l566) | request (handled by apache2's default handler). The test suite |
| [567](#l567) | has been updated accordingly. |
| [568](#l568) |  |
| [569](#l569) | - C API [joes] |
| [570](#l570) | Incorporate libapreq\_cgi into libapreq2 as the default environment, |
| [571](#l571) | and add apreq\_env\_t and initializer apreq\_env\_module() to manage the |
| [572](#l572) | environment at runtime (determining the environment at load-time |
| [573](#l573) | was problematic on non-ELF systems). |
| [574](#l574) |  |
| [575](#l575) |  |
| [576](#l576) | @section v2\_0\_0 Changes with libapreq2-2.00-dev (Oct 25, 2003) |
| [577](#l577) |  |
| [578](#l578) |  |
| [579](#l579) | - C API: libapreq\_cgi.c [randyk, joes] |
| [580](#l580) | CGI environment defined by env/libapreq\_cgi.c is functional |
| [581](#l581) | (with tests added to env/t). This library may soon be incorporated |
| [582](#l582) | directly into libapreq2 as a default enviroment. |
| [583](#l583) |  |
| [584](#l584) | - C API: mod\_apreq.c [joes] |
| [585](#l585) | Added ctx->saw\_eos to ensure we don't read from upstream filters |
| [586](#l586) | after receiving an eos bucket. Otherwise it was possible for |
| [587](#l587) | two eos buckets to appear when a prefetch read is involved, which |
| [588](#l588) | breaks other modules like mod\_proxy. This bug was uncovered by |
| [589](#l589) | Philippe Chiasson. mod\_apreq's apreq\_env\_majic\_number bumped to |
| [590](#l590) | reflect the added fixes. |
| [591](#l591) |  |
| [592](#l592) | - configure: --enable-perl-glue [joes] |
| [593](#l593) | The --enable-perl-glue option integrates the perl glue into the |
| [594](#l594) | normal Unix build cycle. It is disabled by default, but is silently |
| [595](#l595) | reenabled if the user configures the source tree via Makefile.PL. |
| [596](#l596) |  |
| [597](#l597) | - C API [joes] |
| [598](#l598) | Added apreq\_header\_attribute() and fixed mfd parser to allow |
| [599](#l599) | "charset" attribute to appear in the Content-Type header. Sven |
| [600](#l600) | Geisler points out that Opera 7.20 does generate such headers. |
| [601](#l601) |  |
| [602](#l602) | - C API [joes] |
| [603](#l603) | Added versioning API following <http://apr.apache.org/versioning.html> |
| [604](#l604) | apreq\_env renamed apreq\_env\_name, and apreq\_env\_magic\_number added |
| [605](#l605) | to provide versioning for environments (modules). The header files |
| [606](#l606) | are now installed to "include/apreq2", and the library is renamed |
| [607](#l607) | "libapreq2". Also added an apreq2-config script based on apu-config. |
| [608](#l608) |  |
| [609](#l609) | - configure: static mod\_apreq.c [Bojan Smojver, joes] |
| [610](#l610) | Add --with-apache2-src configure option, along with --with-apr-config |
| [611](#l611) | and --with-apu-config, and provide support for compiling mod\_apreq |
| [612](#l612) | into httpd as a static apache module. |
| [613](#l613) |  |
| [614](#l614) | - C API: mod\_apreq.c [joes] |
| [615](#l615) | Support for internal redirects added to the mod\_apreq filter. |
| [616](#l616) | This ensures any POST data prefetched in the main request |
| [617](#l617) | gets passed along to the subrequest handler(s). |
| [618](#l618) |  |
| [619](#l619) | - C bugfix: apreq\_decode [Graham Clark] |
| [620](#l620) | If the source and destination strings are represented by the same |
| [621](#l621) | pointer - e.g. if called as apreq\_unescape(s) - string s is modified |
| [622](#l622) | incorrectly in general. Patch includes new unit test. |
| [623](#l623) |  |
| [624](#l624) | - Perl API [joes] |
| [625](#l625) | Added $req->parse, $req->status, & "preparse" logic |
| [626](#l626) | to $req->param & $req->upload. |
| [627](#l627) |  |
| [628](#l628) | - C API [joes] |
| [629](#l629) | Added "preparse" logic to apreq\_params & apreq\_uploads |
| [630](#l630) | to bring behavior in line with libapreq-1.x. |
| [631](#l631) |  |
| [632](#l632) | - C API [joes] |
| [633](#l633) | Dropped param->charset. |
| [634](#l634) | Make apreq\_brigade\_concat public, so mod\_apreq can use it |
| [635](#l635) | for its ctx->spool brigade. |
| [636](#l636) |  |
| [637](#l637) | - Documentation [joes] |
| [638](#l638) | Updated Cookie\_pod to reflect API changes over v1.X. |
| [639](#l639) |  |
| [640](#l640) | - Documentation [joes] |
| [641](#l641) | Added doxygen links to Apache::Request and Apache::Cookie |
| [642](#l642) | perl docs. |
| [643](#l643) |  |
| [644](#l644) | - C API [joes] |
| [645](#l645) | Added apreq\_copy\_brigade(bb) to apreq.h. |
| [646](#l646) |  |
| [647](#l647) | - C API [joes] |
| [648](#l648) | The new filter-based design required a complete |
| [649](#l649) | departure from libapreq-1.X codebase. libapreq-2 |
| [650](#l650) | is based solely on APR, and to be fully functional, |
| [651](#l651) | requires a supporting environment similar to Apache-2. |
| [652](#l652) | A person wishing to port libapreq-2 to a new environment |
| [653](#l653) | needs to provide definitions for the declarations in apreq\_env.h. |
| [654](#l654) |  |
| [655](#l655) | - Perl API [joes] |
| [656](#l656) | Aggregates are always collected into an APR::Table-based package. |
| [657](#l657) | New table packages: Apache::Cookie::Table, Apache::Request::Table, |
| [658](#l658) | and Apache::Upload::Table. |
| [659](#l659) |  |
| [660](#l660) | - Perl API [joes] |
| [661](#l661) | Apache::Cookie->fetch now requires an "environment" argument ($r). |
| [662](#l662) | Its return value is blessed into the Apache::Cookie::Jar class. |
| [663](#l663) |  |
| [664](#l664) | - Perl API [joes] |
| [665](#l665) | Two new request lookup functions: |
| [666](#l666) | -# $req->args - param lookup using only the query string |
| [667](#l667) | -# $req->body - param lookup using only the POST data |
| [668](#l668) |  |
| [669](#l669) |  |
| [670](#l670) | \*\*/ |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
