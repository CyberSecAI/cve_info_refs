Response:

```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability is caused by the way Microsoft Office applications parse GIF images. Specifically, when a malformed GIF image is opened, it can corrupt system memory.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of malformed GIF images within Microsoft Office applications, leading to memory corruption.

Impact of exploitation:
A remote, unauthenticated attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system by exploiting the memory corruption. If the user is logged in with administrative rights, the attacker could gain complete control of the system, allowing them to install programs, view, change or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.

Attack vectors:
The primary attack vector involves tricking a user into opening a specially crafted Office document containing a malformed GIF image. This can be done through:
    - E-mail attachments
    - Malicious websites hosting the malformed GIF image within an Office document

Required attacker capabilities/position:
The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious Office document containing a malformed GIF image to the victim. The attacker does not need to be authenticated or have any prior access to the system. The user needs to open the document for the exploit to occur.
