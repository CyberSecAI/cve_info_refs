Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2006-0084:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of the `$_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT']` variable in the raSMP application. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code into the User-Agent field of an HTTP request.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS, as the injected malicious code can be executed within the context of the victim's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Administrator Account Compromise:** If the vulnerable application's administrator views the site statistics, the injected XSS code will be executed in their browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, stealing admin credentials, or other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP User-Agent Header Manipulation:** Attackers inject malicious scripts by manipulating the User-Agent header in an HTTP request. The application does not sanitize or encode the user-agent string.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Send HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server, with a crafted User-Agent header.
*   No special access is needed to inject the malicious user agent string. An attacker can make a request to the vulnerable page with this vulnerability.
*   The attacker must rely on an administrator viewing the vulnerable page to trigger the malicious code in their browser.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Vulnerable Software:** raSMP version 2.0.0 is specifically mentioned as vulnerable.
*   **Affected Files:** `common.php`, `common/functions.php`, and `admin/stats.php` are mentioned as files where the vulnerability is present.
*   **Fix:** The vulnerability was reportedly fixed in version 2.0.1 of raSMP.
*  **Discovery:** The vulnerability was discovered by Aliaksandr Hartsuyeu of eVuln.com.
