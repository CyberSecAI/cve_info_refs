Package        : mailman
Vulnerability  : programming error
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2006-0052
Debian Bug     : 358892

A potential denial of service problem has been discovered in mailman,
the web-based GNU mailing list manager.  The (failing) parsing of
messages with malformed mime multiparts sometimes caused the whole
mailing list to become inoperative.

The old stable distribution (woody) is not vulnerable to this issue.

For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.1.5-8sarge2.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your mailman package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

# CVE-2006-0052

| **Name** | CVE-2006-0052 |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | The attachment scrubber (Scrubber.py) in Mailman 2.1.5 and earlier, when using Python's library email module 2.5, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (mailing list delivery failure) via a multipart MIME message with a single part that has two blank lines between the first boundary and the end boundary. |

Hello.

Mailman 2.1.5 contains a subtle bug inside its Scrubber.py, which can
cause some messages with badly formed mime multiparts and sometimes all
messaged received after the defective one to be shunted, thus rendering
the specific list to be unusable. (Thus the slightly increased
severity.)

See also <http://mail.python.org/pipermail/mailman-users/2005-June/045107.html>

Example for one traceback:

(The date is so old, because I since fixed this problem locally but never
got around to submitting this bug to the BTS.)

This thus leads to a DoS attack vector, and makes it a security
vulnerability.

I wasn't able to find a CVE number for this; none of
<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=mailman> looks
relevant. Should we get one? If yes, will the security team take care
of this?

Sid and etch are not vulnerable; problem was fixed in upstream 2.1.6;
etch contains 2.1.7-1; it was fixed in sid (without even realising it)
with the upload of 2.1.6-1 on Sun, 25 Dec 2005.

Please take this opportunity to retroactively add to the changelog of
2.1.5-8sarge1 that the

We should give more details, because there have been two other DoS
vulnerabilities recently, so we don't want people to get confused. I
propose something along the lines of:

 A potential denial of service problem has been discovered in mailman,
 the web-based GNU mailing list manager. The (failing) parsing of
 messages with malformed mime multiparts sometimes caused the whole
 mailing list to become inoperative.

Hi,

this issue has been assigned [CVE-2006-0052](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-0052). In Ubuntu, we used this
patch:

  <http://patches.ubuntu.com/patches/mailman.CVE-2006-0052.diff>

It's a bit longer, since I started with fixing with upstream bug
1430236. Now it's a bit redundant, but better safe than sorry. :)

Thanks,

Martin

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
