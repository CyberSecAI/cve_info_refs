How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote

CVE IDs        : CVE-2006-0146 CVE-2006-0147 CVE-2006-0410 CVE-2006-0806

Debian Bugs    : 349985 358872

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in libphp-adodb, the
'adodb' database abstraction layer for PHP, which is embedded in
cacti, a frontend to rrdtool for monitoring systems and services.  The
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:

CVE-2006-0146

    Andreas Sandblad discovered that improper user input sanitisation
    results in a potential remote SQL injection vulnerability enabling
    an attacker to compromise applications, access or modify data, or
    exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation.
    This requires the MySQL root password to be empty.  It is fixed by
    limiting access to the script in question.

CVE-2006-0147

    A dynamic code evaluation vulnerability allows remote attackers to
    execute arbitrary PHP functions via the 'do' parameter.

CVE-2006-0410

    Andy Staudacher discovered an SQL injection vulnerability due to
    insufficient input sanitising that allows remote attackers to
    execute arbitrary SQL commands.

CVE-2006-0806

    GulfTech Security Research discovered multiple cross-site
    scripting vulnerabilities due to improper user-supplied input
    sanitisation.  Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to
    cause arbitrary scripts to be executed in the browser of an
    unsuspecting user's machine, or result in the theft of
    cookie-based authentication credentials.

The old stable distribution (woody) is not affected by these problems.

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.8.6c-7sarge3.

For the unstable distribution these problems will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your cacti package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Package        : moodle
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE IDs        : CVE-2006-0146 CVE-2006-0147 CVE-2006-0410 CVE-2006-0806

Debian Bugs    : 349985 358872

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in libphp-adodb, the
'adodb' database abstraction layer for PHP, which is embedded in
moodle, a course management system for online learning.  The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:

CVE-2006-0146

    Andreas Sandblad discovered that improper user input sanitisation
    results in a potential remote SQL injection vulnerability enabling
    an attacker to compromise applications, access or modify data, or
    exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation.
    This requires the MySQL root password to be empty.  It is fixed by
    limiting access to the script in question.

CVE-2006-0147

    A dynamic code evaluation vulnerability allows remote attackers to
    execute arbitrary PHP functions via the 'do' parameter.

CVE-2006-0410

    Andy Staudacher discovered an SQL injection vulnerability due to
    insufficient input sanitising that allows remote attackers to
    execute arbitrary SQL commands.

CVE-2006-0806

    GulfTech Security Research discovered multiple cross-site
    scripting vulnerabilities due to improper user-supplied input
    sanitisation.  Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to
    cause arbitrary scripts to be executed in the browser of an
    unsuspecting user's machine, or result in the theft of
    cookie-based authentication credentials.

The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain moodle packages.

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.4.dfsg.1-3sarge1.

For the unstable distribution these problems will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your moodle package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

# Cacti: Multiple vulnerabilities in included ADOdb — GLSA **200604-07**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in the ADOdb layer included
in Cacti, potentially resulting in the execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-analyzer/cacti** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.8.6h\_p20060108-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.8.6h\_p20060108-r2** |

### Background

Cacti is a complete web-based frontend to rrdtool. ADOdb is a
PHP-based database abstraction layer which is included in Cacti.

### Description

Several vulnerabilities have been identified in the copy of ADOdb
included in Cacti. Andreas Sandblad discovered a dynamic code
evaluation vulnerability (CVE-2006-0147) and a potential SQL injection
vulnerability (CVE-2006-0146). Andy Staudacher reported another SQL
injection vulnerability (CVE-2006-0410), and Gulftech Security
discovered multiple cross-site-scripting issues (CVE-2006-0806).

### Impact

Remote attackers could trigger these vulnerabilities by sending
malicious queries to the Cacti web application, resulting in arbitrary
code execution, database compromise through arbitrary SQL execution,
and malicious HTML or JavaScript code injection.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Cacti users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-analyzer/cacti-0.8.6h_p20060108-r2"
```

# ADOdb: PostgresSQL command injection — GLSA **200602-02**

ADOdb is vulnerable to SQL injections if used in conjunction with a
PostgreSQL database.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-php/adodb** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.71** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.71** |

### Background

ADOdb is an abstraction library for PHP creating a common API for
a wide range of database backends.

### Description

Andy Staudacher discovered that ADOdb does not properly sanitize
all parameters.

### Impact

By sending specifically crafted requests to an application that
uses ADOdb and a PostgreSQL backend, an attacker might exploit the flaw
to execute arbitrary SQL queries on the host.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All ADOdb users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-php/adodb-4.71"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
