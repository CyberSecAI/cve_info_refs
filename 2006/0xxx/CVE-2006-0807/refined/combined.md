## Why NJStar Japanese WP ?

Learning another language is a wonderful opportunity to broaden one’s view and expose to another country’s community, literature and culture. It is a magnificent adventure which will be proven to be beneficial of a life time, including your career and self-cultivation. However, completing such quest is not a matter of days. It normally takes years to master another language. That is why you need a long term companion to travel along with you. NJStar provides a powerful software which offers much handy functionality to enhance your Japanese learning experience. It provides assistance as you achieving your goal.

**Main Features of NJStar Japanese WP**
## Your Perfect Learning Guide: Bilingual Monash Dictionary

The JMdict (Japanese-Multilingual Dictionary) project being conducted by Monash University has at its aim the compilation of a multilingual lexical database with Japanese as the pivot language. It translates English, German, Dutch, France and Russian into Japanese.

NJStar Japanese WP has embedded this powerful dictionary into the software, so people with broaden culture background would be able to learn to the language with ease. JMdict is updated on daily basis and NJStar always gives you access to their latest version.

![](/gif/njjwp6/jpnwp3.png)

## Word Annotation and Dictionaries

With a sizable vocabulary, being able to comprehend the meaning of any form of literature smoothly would be much desirable. NJStar WP provides multiple ways to assist you when it comes to comprehend the Japanese language by removing the obstacles on your way.

That is why we offer the essentials: Bilingual Dictionary, which translate multi-language to Chinese and vice versa; Popup Dictionary, which shows the meaning of the highlighted words; and Input bar Dictionary, which guarantee your input gives the correct meaning. Word annotation extracts all the key words of the whole paragraph and has their meaning display in a separate file along with the original document, saving you the time to record them manually.

![](/gif/njjwp6/jpnwp2.png)

## Verb forms

Japanese has a relatively complex verb conjugation system. There are more than a few tense and it is challenging for the learner to master in the beginning. For example, on top of present, past and future tense, it has presumptive, imperative, progressive etc. How could I get it right?

NJStar WP addresses this issue by showing every possible form of the verb at user’s demand. This largely simplify the process of checking against the grammar book to just a simple click.

![](/gif/njjwp6/jpnwp4.png)

## Kanji and Radical look up

Kanji are the adopted logographic Chinese characters used in the modern Japanese writing system. With the knowledge of neither pronunciation nor the meaning, Japanese character may seem impossible to learn, not even with proper translation software. What is the right way to start?

Unlike Hiragana or Katakana, Chinese character consists of side components. Hence, we incorporate radical look up to facilitate the demand of our user. Radical Look up allows you to look up the meaning base on the component of each character. You may explore the meaning of the word as easy as several clicks and precede your learning in advanced stage.

![](/gif/njjwp6/jpnwp1.png)

## Good for input: Kanji input using Romaji Method

Being able to understand is nice, being able to deliver is better. The art of language will be far less appealing without being able to interact with others. Are you ready to write your first Japanese article?

Our package has multiple build-in input pinyin method such as Romaji, Kanakanji etc. It is the perfect solution when it comes to Japanese document processing.

![](/gif/njjwp6/jpnwp5.png)

## Calligraphy Stroking

In addition, our WP also contains printable strokes by stroke calligraphy which allows you to go beyond the learning experience on computer. Therefore, NJStar is the one stop solution to all your Japanese input demands.

## Some degree of similarity with MS office interface

We are at our best performance with the environment which we are most familiar with. Instead of throwing you into the pool to make you learn a completely different software, why not adapt to the most accepted word processing standard in the world?

You may feel very welcomed the first sight you glance on the NJStar WP as it launches. We had all the functionality described above integrated with subversion of Microsoft word processer. It ensures the user would be comfortable with the interface and focus on the language learning experience. A package of language learning software along with a powerful document processing software. This is an offer you could not miss.

By ignoring NJStar WP's formatting commands, you can also use NJStar as a [Japanese Text Editor.](njstar-japanese-text-editor)

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Why NJStar Chinese WP ?

Learning another language is a wonderful opportunity to broaden one’s view and exposure to another country’s community, literature and culture. It is a magnificent adventure which will be proven to be beneficial for a life time, including your career and self-cultivation. However, completing such a quest is not an achievement that can be accomplished in a matter of days. It normally takes years to master another language. That is why you need a long term companion to travel along with you. NJStar provides a powerful software which offers many handy tools to enhance your Chinese learning experience. It provides assistance and guidance as you are achieving your goals.

**Main Features of NJStar Chinese WP**
## Your Perfect Learning Guide: Radical Lookup

We know English but want to learn Chinese, but the two belong to different language families. The most distinctive difference is character structure. With the knowledge of neither pronunciation nor the meaning, Chinese characters may seem impossible to learn, even with a translation software. What is the right way to start?

We address this issue accordingly to our user’s demands. Unlike English, which consists of 26 alphabetical characters, Chinese characters consists of side components. Radical Look up allows you to look up a character based on the components of the specific character you're searching for. This means that as long as you know what the character looks like you will be able to search for it in our dictionary. You will be able to explore the meaning of different characters in as easy as several clicks and learn the language with a unique perspective.

## Word Annotation and Dictionaries

With a sizable vocabulary, being able to comprehend the meaning of any form of literature smoothly would be much desirable. NJStar WP provides multiple ways to assist you when it comes to learning the Chinese language by removing the obstacles on your way.

That is why we offer the essentials: Bilingual Dictionary, which translate English to Chinese and vice versa; Popup Dictionary, which shows the meaning of the highlighted words; and Input bar Dictionary, which guarantee your input gives the correct meaning. Word annotation extracts all the key words of the whole paragraph and has their meaning and Pinyin displayed in a separate file along with the original document, saving you the time to record them manually.
