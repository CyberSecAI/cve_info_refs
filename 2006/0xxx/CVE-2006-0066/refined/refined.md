Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2006-0066:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper sanitization of the `$readold` variable before it's used in an SQL query within the `index.php` script of PHPjournaler.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, which allows attackers to manipulate SQL queries by injecting arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can potentially extract sensitive data from the database, including administrator passwords.
- **Arbitrary Query Execution:** The ability to inject arbitrary SQL code allows attackers to perform other database operations, potentially leading to data modification or deletion.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited through a crafted HTTP GET request to `index.php`, specifically manipulating the `readold` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- **Understanding of SQL:** A basic understanding of SQL is required to craft malicious SQL injections.

**Additional details:**
- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates how to extract the administrator's password using a `UNION SELECT` statement.
- The vulnerability is marked as unpatched, indicating that a fix is not readily available.
