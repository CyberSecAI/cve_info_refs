{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from the way CubeCart 3.0.6 handles the `glob` and `cart_order_id` variables within `includes/orderSuccess.inc.php`. Specifically, the script doesn't properly validate the input passed to the `glob[rootDir]` variable, which allows an attacker to inject a remote file inclusion (RFI) vulnerability.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Remote Command Execution",
    "Improper input validation",
    "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the target server. This can lead to complete compromise of the server, data theft, and other malicious activities.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `includes/orderSuccess.inc.php` script. The malicious request includes crafted values for `glob[rootDir]`, `cart_order_id` and the `cmd` parameter, effectively forcing the script to include a remote PHP shell.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target server. The server needs to have `register_globals` enabled for this specific exploit to be successful. Additionally the attacker requires access to a web server to host their malicious PHP shell script."
