We urge all uses to update their boards as soon as possible.  Affected files:  * admin/moderate.php * admin/themes.php * inc/functions.php * inc/functions\_upload.php * printthread.php * usercp.php  Updating Your Board Please use your Admin CP to determine which MyBB version you are currently using.  If you are running MyBB 1.01  * Download the files in the attachment below and upload them to your forum.  You do NOT need to run the upgrade scripts.
