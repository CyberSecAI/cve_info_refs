| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=839#c0)  William M. Grim    2004-04-09 15:18:42 AEST  ``` I was having a problem all weekend where UsePrivilegeSeparation was on, and users were being authenticated through PAM modules.  I would continuously get ssh_exchange_identification errors.  Generally this is a hosts.allow/.deny problem.  However, after running into this problem 3 times, I determined this was not the problem.  The problem has to do with something between sshd and PAM during privilege separation.  I was randomly getting several "sshd: <user> [pam]" processes in my "ps ax" list.  When the maximum unauthenticated connetion limit was reached, no one could login.  Turning privilege separation off seems to remove the problem.  It is also important to make sure ssh* binaries are not setuid root in this case.  Use SELinux or similar if you feel you need more security.  However, I would like privilege separation fixed. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=839#c1)  Darren Tucker    2004-04-09 15:27:19 AEST  ``` Created [attachment 600](attachment.cgi?id=600&action=diff "Reset thread status") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=600&action=edit "Reset thread status") Reset thread status  Please try this patch (which has already been committed to -current, auth-pam.c rev 1.97) or try a snapshot. ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=839#c2)  Darren Tucker    2004-04-09 15:31:48 AEST  ``` BTW the only binary that should be setuid is ssh-keysign (and possibly ssh, but only if you use a server that requires connections from low-numbered ports, eg for RSARhosts authentication). ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=839#c3)  Darren Tucker    2004-05-03 11:05:25 AEST  ``` The patch on this bug is in 3.8.1p1, so I think this is fixed.  Does the problem still occur with that version? ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=839#c4)  Darren Tucker    2004-05-21 13:08:39 AEST  ``` Created [attachment 639](attachment.cgi?id=639&action=diff "Signal PAM \"thread\" if SIGCHLD is caused by the privsep slave exitting") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=639&action=edit "Signal PAM \"thread\" if SIGCHLD is caused by the privsep slave exitting") Signal PAM "thread" if SIGCHLD is caused by the privsep slave exitting  Colin Watson pointed out that this may correspond to a Debian bug: <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=248125>  It appears that what is happening is that the client exits, breaking the TCP connection.  When that happens, the privsep slave exits too, which causes a SIGCHLD to be delivered to the monitor.  The monitor then attempts to waitpid() on the PAM "thread" which is still alive and blissfully unaware of a problem (because nobody told it to die).  That waitpid hangs the monitor's cleanup.  The attached patch tests adds a test for this case to the signal handler to shoot the PAM  thread itself if it has to.  It the same as the one I sent to the Debian bug except it resets SIGCHLD to prevent reentering the signal handler when the second process exits. ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=839#c5)  Damien Miller    2004-05-21 13:26:15 AEST  ``` Comment on [attachment 639](attachment.cgi?id=639&action=diff "Signal PAM \"thread\" if SIGCHLD is caused by the privsep slave exitting") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=639&action=edit "Signal PAM \"thread\" if SIGCHLD is caused by the privsep slave exitting") Signal PAM "thread" if SIGCHLD is caused by the privsep slave exitting  Looks sane to me. ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=839#c6)  Darren Tucker    2004-05-24 12:00:13 AEST  ``` Thanks, patch id #639 has just been committed (to both HEAD and 3.8.1 branch).  William, could you please try either the patch or a snapshot[1] and confirm whether or not the problem is fixed for you?  [1] ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/OpenSSH/portable/snapshot/ or one of its mirrors. ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=839#c7)  Darren Tucker    2004-05-30 21:06:18 AEST  ``` Mario Holbe reports that the patch has been applied to Debian (unstable) and fixes the problem for him.  I think this is now fixed, so I'm resolving this bug.  If you can reproduce your problem with either a current snapshot or 3.8.1p1 with patch id #639 then please reopen this bug. ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=839#c8)  Pavel Kankovsky    2004-07-21 09:20:56 AEST  ``` There is a bug in the patch: waitpid() with ENOHANG can return 0 if the child is still alive. The corresponding piece of code in sshpam_sigchld_handler() should look like this one:  +       int res; ... +       res = waitpid(cleanup_ctxt->pam_thread, &sshpam_thread_status, WNOHANG); +       if (res == 0 || res == -1) { +               /* PAM thread has not exitted, privsep slave must have */ +               kill(cleanup_ctxt->pam_thread, SIGTERM); +               res = waitpid(cleanup_ctxt->pam_thread, &sshpam_thread_status, 0); +               if (res == -1) +                       return; /* could not wait */ +       }  ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=839#c9)  Darren Tucker    2004-07-21 16:49:15 AEST  ``` This has already been fixed in -current:  20040711  - (dtucker) [auth-pam.c] Check for zero from waitpid() too, which allows    the monitor to properly clean up the PAM thread (Debian bug #252676).  ``` |  |

FreeBSD-SA-06:09.openssh Security Advisory
The FreeBSD Project
Topic: Remote denial of service in OpenSSH
Category: contrib
Module: OpenSSH
Announced: 2006-03-01
Affects: FreeBSD 5.3 and 5.4
Corrected: 2006-03-01 14:19:48 UTC (RELENG\_5, 5.5-PRERELEASE)
2006-03-01 14:21:01 UTC (RELENG\_5\_4, 5.4-RELEASE-p12)
2006-03-01 14:24:52 UTC (RELENG\_5\_3, 5.3-RELEASE-p27)
CVE Name: CVE-2006-0883
For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit
<URL:http://www.freebsd.org/security/>.
I. Background
OpenSSH is an implementation of the SSH protocol suite, providing an
encrypted, authenticated transport for a variety of services,
including remote shell access.
Privilege separation is a mechanism used by OpenSSH to protect itself
against possible future vulnerabilities. It works by splitting the
server process in two: the child process drops its privileges and
carries on the conversation with the client, while the parent retains
its privileges, monitors the child, and performs privileged operations
on behalf of the child when it is satisified that everything is in
order. Privilege separation is enabled by default in FreeBSD.
OpenPAM is an implementation of the PAM framework, which allows the
use of loadable modules to implement user authentication and session
management in a manner defined by the administrator. It is used by
OpenSSH and numerous other applications in FreeBSD to provide a
consistent and configurable authentication system.
II. Problem Description
Because OpenSSH and OpenPAM have conflicting designs (one is event-
driven while the other is callback-driven), it is necessary for
OpenSSH to fork a child process to handle calls to the PAM framework.
However, if the unprivileged child terminates while PAM authentication
is under way, the parent process incorrectly believes that the PAM
child also terminated. The parent process then terminates, and the
PAM child is left behind.
Due to the way OpenSSH performs internal accounting, these orphaned
PAM children are counted as pending connections by the master OpenSSH
server process. Once a certain number of orphans has accumulated, the
master decides that it is overloaded and stops accepting client
connections.
III. Impact
By repeatedly connecting to a vulnerable server, waiting for a
password prompt, and closing the connection, an attacker can cause
OpenSSH to stop accepting client connections until the system restarts
or an administrator manually kills the orphaned PAM processes.
IV. Workaround
The following command will show a list of orphaned PAM processes:
# pgrep -lf '[pam]'
The following command will kill orphaned PAM processes:
# pkill -f '[pam]'
To prevent OpenSSH from leaving orphaned PAM processes behind, perform
one of the following:
1) Disable PAM authentication in OpenSSH. Users will still be able to
log in using their Unix password, OPIE or SSH keys.
To do this, execute the following commands as root:
# echo 'UsePAM no' >>/etc/ssh/sshd\_config
# /etc/rc.d/sshd restart
2) If disabling PAM is not an option - if, for instance, you use
RADIUS authentication, or store user passwords in an SQL database -
you may instead disable privilege separation. However, this may
leave OpenSSH vulnerable to hitherto unknown bugs, and should be
considered a last resort.
To do this, execute the following commands as root:
# echo 'UsePrivilegeSeparation no' >>/etc/ssh/sshd\_config
# /etc/rc.d/sshd restart
V. Solution
Perform one of the following:
1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to 5-STABLE or to the RELENG\_5\_4 or
RELENG\_5\_3 security branch dated after the correction date.
2) To patch your present system:
The following patches have been verified to apply to FreeBSD 5.3 and
5.4 systems.
a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.
# fetch ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/patches/SA-06:09/openssh.patch
# fetch ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/patches/SA-06:09/openssh.patch.as
c
b) Execute the following commands as root:
# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch
# cd /usr/src/secure/lib/libssh
# make obj && make depend && make && make install
# cd /usr/src/secure/usr.sbin/sshd
# make obj && make depend && make && make install
# /etc/rc.d/sshd restart
