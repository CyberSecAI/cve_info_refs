How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Summary
=======
Bugzilla is a Web-based bug-tracking system, used by a large number of
software projects.
This advisory covers three security bugs that have recently been
discovered and fixed in the Bugzilla code:
+ The 'whinedays' and 'mostfreqthreshold' parameters are not correctly
validated in editparams.cgi. The first one can lead to SQL injection.
+ Escaped HTML markup in titles of RSS feeds are incorrectly decoded by
some RSS readers and could potentially lead to XSS vulnerabilities.
+ The login form on the home page, in conjuction with very specific
configuation settings and a specially formed URL, may redirect you
outside the Bugzilla installation, allowing the login name and password
to be stolen.
All Bugzilla installations are advised to upgrade to the latest stable
version of Bugzilla, 2.20.1.
Development snapshots of 2.21 before 2.22rc1 are also vulnerable.
If you are using a development snapshot, you should upgrade to 2.22rc1,
use CVS to update, or apply the patches from the specific bugs listed below.
None of these vulnerabilities affect the old Bugzilla 2.16.x versions.
Vulnerability Details
=====================
Issue 1
-------
Class: SQL injection
Versions: 2.17.1 and above
Description: The 'whinedays' parameter, editable from editparams.cgi,
is not validated before being saved. This can lead to SQL
injection in the whineatnews.pl script. This injection
requires administrative privileges.
The validation for the 'mostfreqthreshold' parameter is also
missing, but this is not exploitable.
Reference: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=312498
Issue 2
-------
Class: Cross Site Scripting
Versions: 2.20rc1 - 2.20, 2.21.1
Description: Some RSS readers incorrectly decode escaped HTML markup in
feed titles and this could be used to inject some scripts.
Although this is not a Bugzilla bug, we prefer to shift to
Atom feeds, where the RFC is unambiguous about HTML markup
in feed titles.
Reference: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=313441
Issue 3
-------
Class: Sensitive Data Exposure
Versions: 2.19.3 and above
Description: When the Bugzilla login page is at a subdirectory of the web
server and the subdirectory name is a resolvable host on the
victim's local network, it is possible to craft a URL that,
when used to login to Bugzilla, would send the user's
credentials to this host.
These conditions make this flaw very difficult to exploit.
Reference: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=325079
Vulnerability Solutions
=======================
The fixes for all of the security bugs mentioned in this advisory
are included in the 2.18.5, 2.20.1, and 2.22rc1 releases. Upgrading
to these releases will protect installations from possible exploits
of these issues.
Full release downloads, patches to upgrade Bugzilla from previous
versions, and CVS upgrade instructions are available at:
http://www.bugzilla.org/download.html
Specific patches for each of the individual issues can be found on the
corresponding bug reports for each issue, at the URL given in the
reference for that issue in the list above.

| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=325079#c0)• 19 years ago |
|  | |

Most of the discussion is in [bug 325058](/show_bug.cgi?id=325058 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - http://landfill.bugzilla.org//paul/ login form redirects me to paul.fr") already, but here is a short summary:
[bug 325058 comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=325058#c0 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - http://landfill.bugzilla.org//paul/ login form redirects me to paul.fr") (LpSolit):
This URL ( <http://landfill.bugzilla.org//paul/> ) contains a double slash // and the login form on Bugzilla redirects me outside bugzilla.org, in my case paul.fr (but I suspect it depends on your locale, in my case: french).
Discussing with CTho on #developers, it looks like the login and password [may] have been sent to paul.fr instead of landfill.bugzilla.org, meaning that they have now my admin login and password for our QA installations.
[bug 325058 comment 6](/show_bug.cgi?id=325058#c6 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - http://landfill.bugzilla.org//paul/ login form redirects me to paul.fr") (dveditz):
Is this a landfill bug in the way it handles multiple installations? The form
action is derived from the URL. If you don't specify the double-slash and visit
the intended <http://landfill.bugzilla.org/paul/> then the form action is
"/paul/index.cgi" which logs into landfill. If you use the double-slash it's
copied into the form action making 'paul' a hostname. Landfill should do some
sanity-checking when generating the form action, or specify the complete url.
Why is this filed as a networking bug? It looks like Gecko is doing exactly
what the page is telling it to do (submit the form to "paul").
[bug 325058 comment 8](/show_bug.cgi?id=325058#c8 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - http://landfill.bugzilla.org//paul/ login form redirects me to paul.fr") (LpSolit):
The problem is not specific to landfill, it affects \*all\* Bugzilla
installations.
The problem is that template/en/default/account/auth/login-small.html.tmpl
uses:
<form name="login" action="[% cgi.script\_name FILTER html %]" method="POST">
so when you enter //foo, you get action="//foo/index.cgi" which redirects you
outside your Bugzilla installation with your login and password.
It could as well be a bug in CGI.pm itself. Anyway, Bugzilla should probably
use Param('urlbase').
-----
The template/en/default/account/auth/login-small.html.tmpl template was introduced in Bugzilla 2.20 in [bug 165075](/show_bug.cgi?id=165075 "RESOLVED FIXED - Include login prompt on main page"). This means that only the home page is affected due to the use of 'cgi.script\_name' which returns the full path, but you are not affected when you have to log in due to GoAheadAndLogIn=1 which is correctly handled by Auth::Login::WWW::CGI::login(). This routine indeed calls $cgi->url(-relative=>1) and so you cannot be redirected outside Param('urlbase') or Param('sslbase').
Probably the right fix is to do something similar for login-small.html.tmpl.

It should be noted that this is only an issue if the "foo" part of "//foo" is a valid URL - in the example given, no data is sent unless the address "paul" resolves to something. So the bugzilla install would have to be at an address like "www.domain.org/evil.com" for this to be exploitable, and it would be exploitable only by evil.com.

// is shorthand for a Windows network share, isn't it? So this would look for an smb:// host on your local network named "paul" instead of http: if it's interpreting it as a hostname.

I don't particularly see this as major. A user has to type a double slash, or be redirected to the site with a double slash. Now, granted, somebody could maliciously link to the site with a double slash, so that's exploitable. But for the most part, this would only be exploited by accident. After all, this bug has obviously been around for a long time, and we only just now discovered it.
I'm hesitant to block anything on it, but as it is a valid security bug, we should fix it before our \*next\* (not 2.20.1) release.Severity: major → normalFlags: blocking2.22?Flags: blocking2.22+Flags: blocking2.20.2?Flags: blocking2.20.2+Flags: blocking2.20.1?Flags: blocking2.20.1-

Oh, by the way, I think the obvious simple fix is to modify the URL filter so that it strips off any slashes near the beginning of a URL other than the first one. It means that we won't be able to insert SMB network paths there, but... um... oh well. :-) I don't think we had any plans on that.

No need to change the URL filter. The right fix is to replace cgi.script\_name by something like $cgi->url(-relative => 1), as done by Auth::Login::WWW::CGI::login().

"for a long time" isn't true. Only versions 2.19.3 and above are affected, with 2.20 being released on Sept 30, 2005; that's pretty recent. 2.19.2 and below are not affected as you couldn't log in from the home page.

cgi.script\_name will redirect you outside your installation if the URL contains //. So I now let the .cgi script pass this param.

better patch, v2
>+[% DEFAULT homepage = "index.cgi" %]
Nit: this should probably be set globally, and perhaps it should be an absolute URL via URLPATH.

Use an absolute path. Now, //paul and //paul/index.cgi both fall back to /paul/index.cgi.

I wouldn't think this particularly necessary unless cgi.url is empty, but I doubt it hurts anything, either. It does seem like this stuff should happen globally, so all templates can take advantage of it.

Well, I could still write <http://www.foo.com//paul/index.cgi>. My patch force it to fall back to <http://www.foo.com/paul/index.cgi> in this case too.
About making it global, we could set <base href=""> in global/header.html.tmpl, but I'm not sure <form> really cares about <base>. Does it?Blocks: [320312](/show_bug.cgi?id=320312 "RESOLVED FIXED - Security Advisory for 2.16.11, 2.18.5, 2.20.1, and 2.22rc1")Flags: approval?Flags: approval2.20?

Attached patch

[patch, v3.1](attachment.cgi?id=211115&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=211115&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=325079&attachment=211115)

Small improvement: do not hardcode 'index.cgi'. If we are accessing the homepage, the relative URL is empty, but as we are appending the full path to the installation (either urlbase or sslbase), we never end with an empty script\_name and so we never have action="".

Blocker regression caused by this bug at [bug 328108](/show_bug.cgi?id=328108 "VERIFIED FIXED - Unable to login on a fresh Bugzilla install using the login form on the home page") (maybe we should consider some of the previous versions, in order to avoid using urlbase in a pre-login stage)
