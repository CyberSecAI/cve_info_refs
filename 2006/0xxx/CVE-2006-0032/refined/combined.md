## Microsoft Indexing Services vulnerable to cross-site scripting

#### Vulnerability Note VU#108884

Original Release Date: 2006-09-12 | Last Revised: 2006-09-15

---

### Overview

Microsoft's Indexing Service does not properly validate queries. This vulnerability may allow an attacker to run client-side scripts on behalf of a user.

### Description

| Microsoft's [Indexing Service](http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/snap_idx_srv_mgmt.mspx?mfr=true) allows users to quickly search computers and networks. This service can be used in combination with [Internet Information Services (IIS)](http://www.microsoft.com/WindowsServer2003/iis/default.mspx) to enable IIS as a Web-based interface for the Indexing Service.  A cross-site scripting vulnerability on systems running the Indexing Service may allow an attacker to run a malicious script. This script could take any action on the user's computer that the vulnerable web site is legitimately authorized to take. For more information on cross-site scripting, see the CERT [Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerabilities](http://www.cert.org/archive/pdf/cross_site_scripting.pdf) document.Note that both IIS and the Indexing Service need to be installed and running for a system to be vulnerable. |
| --- |

### Impact

| If an attacker can trick or entice a user to follow a link, the attacker can execute script as the victim in the context of the zone in which the vulnerable server resides. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade**Microsoft has released an [update](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms06-053.mspx) to address this issue. |
| --- |

| **Disable or remove the Indexing Service**If the indexing service is not needed, disable or remove it. Microsoft has provided instructions on how to do this in [Security Bulletin MS06-053](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms06-053.mspx). |

# Security Update Severity Rating System

Attacks that impact customers' systems rarely result from attackers' exploitation of previously unknown vulnerabilities. Rather, they exploit vulnerabilities for which patches are available but not applied. For this reason, Microsoft recommends that customers make patching a priority. Currently available updates are listed in the [Security Update Guide](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/).

However, not all vulnerabilities are equally severe. To help customers understand the risk associated with each vulnerability we patch, we have published a severity rating system that rates each vulnerability according to the worst theoretical outcome were that vulnerability to be exploited.

| Rating | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Critical | A vulnerability whose exploitation could allow code execution ***without*** user interaction. These scenarios include self-propagating malware (e.g. network worms), or unavoidable common use scenarios where code execution occurs without warnings or prompts. This could mean browsing to a web page or opening email.  Microsoft recommends that customers apply Critical updates immediately. |
| Important | A vulnerability whose exploitation could result in compromise of the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of user data, or of the integrity or availability of processing resources. These scenarios include common use scenarios where client is compromised ***with***warnings or prompts regardless of the prompt's provenance, quality, or usability. Sequences of user actions that do not generate prompts or warnings are also covered.  Microsoft recommends that customers apply Important updates at the earliest opportunity. |
| Moderate | Impact of the vulnerability is mitigated to a significant degree by factors such as authentication requirements or applicability only to non-default configurations.  Microsoft recommends that customers consider applying the security update. |
| Low | Impact of the vulnerability is comprehensively mitigated by the characteristics of the affected component. Microsoft recommends that customers evaluate whether to apply the security update to the affected systems. |

The measure of a vulnerability’s severity is distinct from the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited. To assess that likelihood, the [Microsoft Exploitability Index](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/cc998259) provides additional information to help customers better prioritize the deployment of Microsoft security updates. This index provides customers with guidance on the likelihood of functioning exploit code being developed for vulnerabilities addressed by Microsoft security updates, within the first thirty days of that update's release.

While this severity rating system is intended to provide a broadly objective assessment of each issue, we strongly encourage customers to evaluate their own environments and make decisions about which updates are required to protect their systems.

## Vulnerability Details

#### Microsoft Indexing Service Vulnerability - CVE-2006-0032:

There is an information disclosure vulnerability in the Indexing Service because of the way that it handles query validation. The vulnerability could allow an attacker to run client-side script on behalf of a user. The script could spoof content, disclose information, or take any action that the user could take on the affected Web site.

#### Mitigating Factors for Microsoft Indexing Service Vulnerability - CVE-2006-0032:

* By default, Internet Information Services (IIS) is not installed on Windows XP or on Windows Server 2003.
* On Windows Server 2003, the Indexing Service is not enabled by default.
* On Windows Server 2003, even when the Indexing Service is installed, by default it is not accessible from IIS. Manual steps are required to enable IIS to become a Web-based interface for the Indexing Service. By default the Indexing Service is used only to perform local and remote file system queries.

#### Workarounds for Microsoft Indexing Service Vulnerability - CVE-2006-0032:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. Although these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

* **Do not browse the Internet from a system in a server role**

  Do not browse the Internet from a Web server or a system in any other server role.
* **Disable page encoding auto-detection in Internet Explorer**

  Disabling the page encoding auto-detection in Internet Explorer helps protect the affected system from attempts to exploit this vulnerability.

  To configure components and services:

  1. Launch Internet Explorer.
  2. Click on **View**, click **Encoding**, if **Auto-select** has a check mark next to it, and left click **Auto-select** to de-select this setting.

  **Impact of Workaround:** Internet Explorer may fail to properly detect the encoding used on web pages that do not specify a default character encoding, resulting in encoded characters being displayed incorrectly. The user can still manually select the proper encoding type to display the page properly.
* **Use URLScan on Windows 2000 running IIS 5.0**

  The installation of [URLScan](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/tools/urlscan.mspx) helps protect the affected system from attempts to exploit this vulnerability.

  1. Install URLScan, in its default configuration URLScan 2.5 will block requests for .IDA, .IDQ and .HTW files which are the affected Index Server extensions.
  2. Restart the IISAdmin and WWW Publishing services for the changes to take effect.

  **Impact of Workaround:** The default configuration of URLScan will block requests for Index Server file types (.IDA, .IDQ, .HTW) and as such will block any web based searches that make use of these file types.
* **Remove the Index Server ISAPI extension Script Mappings from Internet Information Service for Windows 2000 running IIS 5.0**

  The removal of the Index Server ISAPI extension Script Mappings from IIS helps protect the affected system from attempts to exploit this vulnerability.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Control Panel.** Alternatively, point to **Settings**, and then click **Control Panel**
  2. Double-click **Administrative Tools**.
  3. Double-click **Internet Information Services.**
  4. Right click WebServer, select **Properties**.
  5. . Select within **Master Properties**, select **WWW Service** and click **Edit**.
  6. On the **WWW ServiceMaster Properties**, select **Home Directory** and click **Configuration**.
  7. On the **Application Configuration**, highlight the .HTW, .IDA and .IDQ extensions and click **Remove**.

  **Impact of Workaround:** The default configuration of URLScan will block requests for Index Server file types (.IDA, .IDQ, .HTW) and as such will block any web based searches that make use of these file types.
* **Remove the Indexing Service**

  **If the Indexing Service is no longer needed, you could remove it by following this procedure.**

  To configure components and services:

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Control Panel.** Alternatively, point to **Settings**, and then click **Control Panel**.
  2. Double-click **Add or Remove Programs**.
  3. Click **Add/Remove Windows Components**.
  4. Click to clear the Indexing Service check box to remove the Indexing Service.
  5. Complete the Windows Components Wizard by following the instructions on the screen.

  **Impact of Workaround:** If this service is removed, all search functionality is provided by traversing the folder hierarchy and scanning each file for the requested string and search responses will be slower. If the MMC Indexing Service snap-in is used to create a new catalog, the catalog will remain offline until this service is started.
* **Disable the Indexing Service extensions from IIS on Windows 2003 running IIS 6.0**

  **If the Indexing Service extensions are no longer needed, you could disable it by following this procedure.**

  To configure components and services:

  1. Double-click **Administrative Tools**.
  2. Double-click **Internet Information Services.**
  3. Click **Web Service Extensions.**
  4. Click **Indexing Service**.
  5. Click **Prohibit**.

  **Impact of Workaround:** If this service extension is removed, all search functionality is provided by traversing the folder hierarchy and scanning each file for the requested string and search responses will be slower. If the MMC Indexing Service snap-in is used to create a new catalog, the catalog will remain offline until this service is started.

#### FAQ for Microsoft Indexing Service Vulnerability - CVE-2006-0032:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

There is an information disclosure vulnerability in Indexing Service because of the way that it handles query validation. The vulnerability could allow an attacker to run client-side script on behalf of a user. The script could spoof content, disclose information, or take any action that the user could take on the affected Web site.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The Indexing Service does not properly validate query parameters, creating the possibility of cross-site scripting.

**What is Indexing Service?**

The Indexing Service is a base service for the affected operating systems. Formerly known as Index Server, its original function was to index the content of Internet Information Services (IIS) Web servers. Indexing Service now creates indexed catalogs for the contents and properties of both file systems and virtual Web servers.The Indexing Service is available to applications and scripts for providing an efficient means of managing, querying, and indexing information in file systems or Web servers. Indexing Service also provides query mechanisms for efficiently accessing the information in the catalogs. The indexed information results from filtering the file systems and the Web servers using Microsoft-supplied filters and, optionally, custom-supplied filters.

**What is cross-site scripting?**

Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a security vulnerability that could enable an attacker to "inject" code into a user's session with a Web site. The attack involves Web servers that dynamically generate HTML pages. If these servers embed browser input in the dynamic pages that they send back to the browser, these servers can be manipulated to include content in the dynamic pages. This will allow malicious script to be executed. Web browsers may perpetuate this problem through their basic assumptions of "trusted" sites and their use of cookies to maintain persistent state with the Web sites that they frequent. This attack does not modify Web site content. Instead, it inserts new, malicious script that can execute at the browser in the security context associated with a trusted server.

**How does cross-site scripting work?**

Web pages contain text and HTML markup. Text and HTML markup are generated by the server and are interpreted by the client. Servers that generate static pages have full control over the way that the client interprets the pages that the server sends. However, servers that generate dynamic pages do not have control over the way that the client interprets the serversâ output. If untrusted content is introduced into a dynamic page, neither the server nor the client has sufficient information to recognize that this action has occurred and to take protective measures.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run a malicious script. If this malicious script is run, it would run in the security context of the user on the client. The script could take any action on the user's computer that the Web site is authorized to take. These actions could include monitoring the userâs Web session and forwarding information to a third party, running other code on the user's system, and reading or writing cookies.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or instant messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Systems that have the Indexing Service accessible through IIS are at risk from this vulnerability from Internet based attacks. If the Indexing Service is not enabled the system would not be vulnerable to this issue.

Client systems could allow an attacker to run client-side script on behalf of a user. The script could spoof content, disclose information, or take any action that the user could take on the affected Web site.

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that Indexing Service validates query parameters.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**Installation Information**

This security update supports the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/help** | Displays the command-line options. |
| Setup Modes |  |
| **/passive** | Unattended Setup mode. No user interaction is required, but installation status is displayed. If a restart is required at the end of setup, a dialog box will be presented to the user with a timer warning that the computer will restart in 30 seconds. |
| **/quiet** | Quiet mode. This is the same as unattended mode, but no status or error messages are displayed. |
| Restart Options |  |
| **/norestart** | Does not restart when installation has completed. |
| **/forcerestart** | Restarts the computer after installation and forces other applications to close at shutdown without saving open files first. |
| **/warnrestart[:x]** | Displays a dialog box with a timer warning the user that the computer will restart in *x* seconds. (The default setting is 30 seconds.) Intended for use with the **/quiet** switch or the **/passive** switch. |
| **/promptrestart** | Display a dialog box prompting the local user to allow a restart. |
| Special Options |  |
| **/overwriteoem** | Overwrites OEM files without prompting. |
| **/nobackup** | Does not back up files needed for uninstallation. |
| **/forceappsclose** | Forces other programs to close when the computer shuts down. |
| **/log:path** | Allows the redirection of installation log files. |
| **/integrate:path** | Integrates the update into the Windows source files. These files are located at the path that is specified in the switch. |
| **/extract[:path]** | Extracts files without starting the Setup program. |
| **/ER** | Enables extended error reporting. |
| **/verbose** | Enables verbose logging. During installation, creates %Windir%\CabBuild.log. This log details the files that are copied. Using this switch may cause the installation to proceed more slowly. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841). For more information about the Update.exe installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

**Deployment Information**

To install the security update without any user intervention, use the following command at a command prompt for Microsoft Windows XP:

**Windowsxp-kb920685-x86-enu /quiet**

**Note** Use of the **/quiet** switch will suppress all messages. This includes suppressing failure messages. Administrators should use one of the supported methods to verify the installation was successful when they use the **/quiet** switch. Administrators should also review the KB920685.log file for any failure messages when they use this switch.

To install the security update without forcing the system to restart, use the following command at a command prompt for Windows XP:

**Windowsxp-kb920685-x86-enu /norestart**

**Notes** When you install these security updates, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the Update.exe installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you can use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. MBSA allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).
* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry keys.

  For Windows XP Home Edition Service Pack 1, Windows XP Professional Service Pack 1, Windows XP Tablet PC Edition, Windows XP Media Center Edition, Windows XP Home Edition Service Pack 2, Windows XP Professional Service Pack 2, Windows XP Tablet PC Edition 2005, and Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005:

  HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows XP\SP3\KB920685\Filelist

  For Windows XP Professional x64 Edition:

  HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows XP Version 2003\SP2\KB920685\Filelist

  **Note** These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly if an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams the 920685 security update into the Windows installation source files.

  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry keys.

  Windows Server 2003, Web Edition; Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition; Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition; Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition; Windows Small Business Server 2003; Windows Server 2003, Web Edition with SP1; Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition with SP1; Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition with SP1; Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition with SP1; Windows Server 2003 R2, Web Edition; Windows Server 2003 R2, Standard Edition; Windows Server 2003 R2, Datacenter Edition; Windows Server 2003 R2, Enterprise Edition; Windows Small Business Server 2003 R2:

  HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows Server 2003\SP2\KB920685\Filelist

  **Note** This registry key may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, this registry key may not be created correctly if an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams the 920685 security update into the Windows installation source files.

**Software Update Services:**

By using Microsoft Software Update Services (SUS), administrators can quickly and reliably deploy the latest critical updates and security updates to Windows 2000 and Windows Server 2003-based servers, and to desktop systems that are running Windows 2000 Professional or Windows XP Professional.

For more information about how to deploy security updates by using Software Update Services, visit the [Software Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21133).

**Windows Server Update Services:**

By using Windows Server Update Services (WSUS), administrators can quickly and reliably deploy the latest critical updates and security updates for Windows 2000 operating systems and later, Office XP and later, Exchange Server 2003, and SQL Server 2000 onto Windows 2000 and later operating systems.

For more information about how to deploy security updates using Windows Server Update Services, visit the [Windows Server Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=50120).

**Systems Management Server:**

Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) delivers a highly configurable enterprise solution for managing updates. By using SMS, administrators can identify Windows-based systems that require security updates and can perform controlled deployment of these updates throughout the enterprise with minimal disruption to end users. For more information about how administrators can use SMS 2003 to deploy security updates, visit the [SMS 2003 Security Patch Management Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=22939). SMS 2.0 users can also use [Software Updates Service Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33340) to help deploy security updates. For information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

**Note** SMS uses the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer, the Microsoft Office Detection Tool, and the Enterprise Update Scan Tool to provide broad support for security bulletin update detection and deployment. Some software updates may not be detected by these tools. Administrators can use the inventory capabilities of the SMS in these cases to target updates to specific systems. For more information about this procedure, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33341). Some security updates require administrative rights following a restart of the system. Administrators can use the Elevated Rights Deployment Tool (available in the [SMS 2003 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33387) and in the [SMS 2.0 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21161)) to install these updates.
