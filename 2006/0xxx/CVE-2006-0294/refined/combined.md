How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2006-02

## Changing position:relative to static corrupts memory

Announced
February 1, 2006
Reporter
Martijn Wargers
Impact
Moderate
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox 1.5.0.1
* SeaMonkey 1
* Thunderbird 1.5.0.2

### Description

Dynamically changing the style of an element from position:relative
to position:static can cause Gecko to operate on freed memory.
It may be possible to exploit this in order to run arbitrary
code.

This flaw was introduced during Firefox 1.5 and SeaMonkey 1.0
development and does not affect Firefox 1.0 or the Mozilla Suite 1.7

Thunderbird 1.5 could be vulnerable if JavaScript is
enabled in mail. This is not the default setting and we strongly
discourage users from turning on JavaScript in mail. Thunderbird
is not vulnerable in its default configuration.

**Update (13 April 2006)**

This flaw has been fixed in Thunderbird 1.5.0.2

### Workaround

Upgrade to the fixed versions. Do not enable JavaScript in Thunderbird
or SeaMonkey mail.

Well, this seems to have regressed between 2005-06-20 and 2005-06-22:
<http://bonsai.mozilla.org/cvsquery.cgi?treeid=default&module=all&branch=HEAD&branchtype=match&dir=&file=&filetype=match&who=&whotype=match&sortby=Date&hours=2&date=explicit&mindate=2005-06-20+05%3A00%3A00&maxdate=2005-06-22+12%3A00%3A00&cvsroot=%2Fcvsroot>
I don't have really an idea which bug could have caused the regression.

I crashed with builds back to 2005-06-10 but then couldn't crash with any build. valgrind caught it trying to use already-freed memory.

I see this only when we process the restyle for the inner <q> first. Then when we're processing the restyle for the outer <q> we get to destroying the brand-new frame the inner restyle created for the positioned <span> and crash when trying to delete its view...

The inner frame shouldn't have a view anymore ... did we somehow fail to remove the view from its parent when we reframed the inner element?

This looks like a regression from [bug 292116](/show_bug.cgi?id=292116 "RESOLVED FIXED - [FIXr]:before ending up before explicit children in some cases") -- changing the parent means we get a mismatch between the frame and view trees....

This should fix it...
don't you need to initialize appendAfterFrame to nsnull to avoid a 'possible use of uninitialized' warning?

I didn't get those warnings when I compiled, so I assumed that gcc is finally sorta-smart enough...
I'll init them if warnings appear when I check in.

This should fix it...
This is a double-delete, hence potentially exploitable... I think we should take this on the 1.8 branch, after it bakes on the trunk a tad.

I can't speak to any \*potential\* regressions, but the crash itself is certainly fixed in trunk build 2005-11-29-09 of SeaMonkey trunk on Windows XP.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
