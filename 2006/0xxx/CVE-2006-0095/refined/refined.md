{
  "CVE-2006-0095": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "The dm-crypt driver in the Linux kernel does not clear an internal structure before freeing it, potentially disclosing sensitive information.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The dm-crypt driver fails to clear the `struct crypt_config` structure, including key material, before freeing it from memory.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Information Exposure",
        "Memory Leak"
      ],
      "impact": "Sensitive key information could be leaked, potentially compromising the security of encrypted data. This information could be exposed, for example, in a suspend-to-disk (swsusp) image, even after the encrypted device has been removed.",
        "attack_vectors": [
        "Local Access"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker with local access can potentially read the leaked key material, allowing them to decrypt data protected by the dm-crypt system."
    }
