How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

  [General News](index.php?site=news&show=General News) » Happy new year 2016
  07.01.2016 - 16:40, written by [**derchris**](index.php?site=profile&id=1107)
  To all webSPELL users, we wish you a happy new year 2016.

  It has been very quite from our side over the last few weeks.

  We are still looking at getting a new release out at some point, but due to human nature, we cannot set a time when this will be happening.

  There have been some engagement from users in testing the current development version, which is not as easy as one would think.

  Also bugs are being reported on our [GitHub Issue Tracker](https://github.com/webSPELL/webSPELL/issues)

  So I started to create some Contribution guidelines, and also an easy way to develop/test the current source we are working on:

  [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/webSPELL/webSPELL/blob/dev/CONTRIBUTE.md)

  This is just a starting point for anyone interested in the current status.

  If time allows we will also package the current source into a alpha/beta release for installation on websites.

  Also thanks to all the various translations made.

  We have now more completed translations than in any previous version.

  Looking forward to get all of them translated.

  All the best, and lets hope all goes to plan.

  [Webspell Release](index.php?site=news&show=Webspell Release) » Translations for upcoming release
  23.04.2015 - 20:15, written by [**derchris**](index.php?site=profile&id=1107)
  We are close to finish a new release

  Because of all the changes, there are several new and modified language files.

  So we need translators for our roughly 35 languages.

  As a result we created a project on Crowdin to keep better track of the work:

  <http://translate.webspell.org>

  You can register and take an active part in doing translations..

  On there you can see which languages are not yet 100% translated, and add translation suggestions online.

  Up to date status:

  [Webspell Release](index.php?site=news&show=Webspell Release) » webSPELL 4.2.4 Release (Hotfix)
  28.01.2015 - 19:05, written by [**derchris**](index.php?site=profile&id=1107)
  With this release it is possible again to create Awards, Calendar entries, Challenges, Clanwars and Demos for 2015 and beyond.

  [webSPELL-4.2.4](http://www.webspell.org/index.php?site=files&file=44)

  If you are not going to do a full-reinstall, you can just replace the modified files:

  awards.php

  calendar.php

  challenge.php

  clanwars.php

  demos.php

  Advanced users can have a look at the [changes](https://github.com/webSPELL/webSPELL/commit/68dced0dc64a968c1fa5bfaab330b13a3777da7c) here.

  Meanwhile we are still working on the next big release, which so far has 778 Commits and over 13.000 changed lines of code.

  **Translators needed**

  Because of the majority of code changes, we also need to change and add Translations. We are seeking help from people who can speak any other language beside German and English. Please report in the comments, PN any of the [Developers](http://www.webspell.org/index.php?site=squads&action=show&squadID=2) or direct in the [Github Issue](https://github.com/webSPELL/webSPELL/issues/186).

  **For those who already downloaded the 4.2.4 release, please re-download, as there was an issue with the provided archive.**
