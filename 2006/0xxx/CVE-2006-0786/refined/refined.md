Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2006-0786:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the `include.php` file of PHPKIT versions 1.6.1 Release 2 and earlier. It stems from an incomplete blacklist implementation when handling the `path` parameter used for file inclusion.  Specifically, the code attempts to prevent remote file inclusion by checking for "http://", "ftp://", and "https://" but fails to block other URI schemes like UNC paths and ftps URLs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incomplete Blacklist:** The primary weakness is the use of an insufficient blacklist to filter input.  It only checks for specific HTTP/FTP schemes, neglecting other ways to specify remote resources.
*   **Unsanitized Input:** The `path` variable is not properly sanitized before being used in an `include()` statement, making it susceptible to file inclusion attacks.
*   **Use of `filecheck()` function:** The `filecheck()` function only checks if the file exists and is readable, which does not prevent the inclusion of malicious remote files.
*   **Vulnerable Code:** The vulnerable code is present in `include.php` specifically around lines 558/579 and `inc/func/default.php` at line 355-362.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** Attackers can include arbitrary local or remote files, leading to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious PHP file, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers could potentially read sensitive files from the target server by exploiting the file inclusion.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted GET request with a malicious value for the `path` parameter.
*   **UNC Paths:**  Attackers can use UNC paths to include files from network shares (e.g., `\\192.168.1.2\share\malicious.php`).
*    **ftps URLs:**  Attackers can use the `ftps://` URI scheme to include files from remote FTP servers.
*    **Null Byte Injection:** Attackers can use null bytes (`%00`) to bypass the `.php` extension check.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
*   **`allow_url_fopen` Enabled:** For remote file inclusion via ftps URLs or SMB shares, the server must have the `allow_url_fopen` PHP setting enabled.
*   **Knowledge of Target System:** The attacker needs knowledge of paths to local files or addresses of accessible network shares or FTP servers containing malicious PHP files.

**Additional Technical Details**

* The exploit code provided demonstrates how to leverage the vulnerability to execute arbitrary commands on the target server by including a malicious PHP script that executes system commands via a `cmd` parameter in the GET request.
* The vulnerability is also exploitable if `magic_quotes_gpc` is off as a null byte (`%00`) can be used to bypass the extension check and include arbitrary files.
