      "source": "www.kb.cert.org_9ff92e45_20250124_213026.html",
      "root_cause": "Multiple vulnerabilities in the Sun Java Reflection API.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The Java Reflection API allows Java classes to determine information about other Java classes, such as public methods.",
        "Seven vulnerabilities in the Java Reflection API may allow a Java applet to bypass Java applet security restrictions."
      ],
      "impact": "An untrusted Java applet can bypass security restrictions and execute arbitrary code, potentially accessing and manipulating system resources.",
       "attack_vector": "By convincing a user to run a specially crafted Java applet, a remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the applet. Web browsers with Java support may run applets from untrusted web sites.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "Remote, unauthenticated attacker. Requires the ability to deliver a malicious Java applet."

      "cve_id": "CVE-2006-0617",
        "source": "www.gentoo.org_77ffd8b3_20250124_213024.html",
      "root_cause": "Inadequate constraints on applets from privilege escalation and arbitrary code execution in Sun's Java Development Kit (JDK) and Java Runtime Environment (JRE).",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Applets executed using JRE or JDK can use \"reflection\" APIs functions to elevate its privileges beyond the sandbox restrictions."
      ],
      "impact": "A malicious Java applet can bypass Java sandbox restrictions and hence access local files, connect to arbitrary network locations and execute arbitrary code on the user's machine. Java Web Start applications are affected likewise.",
        "attack_vector": "Remote execution of a malicious Java applet or Java Web Start application.",
        "attacker_capabilities": "Remote attacker capable of delivering a malicious Java applet or Java Web Start application."
