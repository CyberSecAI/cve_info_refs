  "CVE-2006-0160": {
    "Description": "The vulnerability is present in the add_post.php3 script of Venom Board version 1.22. The script does not properly sanitize the $parent, $root, and $topic_id variables before using them in a SQL query, which can be exploited by injecting arbitrary SQL code.",
    "Root cause": "Lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input before using it in a SQL query.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or deletion.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via HTTP requests to the vulnerable `post.php3` script.",
     "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to send a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable script with malicious SQL code injected in the topic_id parameter. No authentication is required."
