  "CVE-2006-0022": {
    "description": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Microsoft PowerPoint due to a failure to properly handle malformed records. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating a specially crafted PowerPoint file.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Improper handling of malformed records within a PowerPoint file.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Failure to validate record structure.",
        "Memory corruption leading to arbitrary code execution."
      ],
      "impact": "Remote code execution allowing an attacker to take complete control of a vulnerable system. This includes the ability to install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Email: By sending a specially crafted PowerPoint file to a user, and persuading the user to open the file.",
         "Web-based attack: By hosting a website containing a malicious PowerPoint file and persuading a user to visit the website and open the file."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to create a malformed PowerPoint file and convince a user to open it. If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker gains full control of the system."
    },
    "affected_products": [
      "Microsoft PowerPoint 2000",
      "Microsoft PowerPoint 2002",
       "Microsoft PowerPoint 2003",
      "Microsoft PowerPoint 2004 for Mac",
      "Microsoft PowerPoint v. X for Mac"
    ],
    "additional_notes": "The vulnerability could not be exploited automatically through email or on a website (except PowerPoint 2000, which doesn't prompt before opening). Users must open the malicious file for the attack to succeed. The vulnerability is resolved by modifying the way PowerPoint validates the length of a message before it is passed to the allocated buffer. This bulletin replaces MS06-010 for PowerPoint 2000."
