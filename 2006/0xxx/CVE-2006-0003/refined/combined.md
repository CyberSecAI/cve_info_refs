##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## RDS.Dataspace ActiveX control bypasses ActiveX security model

#### Vulnerability Note VU#234812

Original Release Date: 2006-04-11 | Last Revised: 2006-11-02

---

### Overview

The Microsoft RDS.Dataspace ActiveX control bypasses the ActiveX security model, which can allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.

### Description

| **ActiveX**  [ActiveX](http://www.microsoft.com/com/default.mspx) is a technology that allows programmers to create reusable software components that can be incorporated into applications to extend their functionality. Internet Explorer is a common Windows application that makes use of ActiveX controls.**ActiveX safety determination**Internet Explorer determines if an ActiveX control is safe by querying the [IObjectSafety interface](http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/components/com/reference/ifaces/iobjectsafety/iobjectsafety.asp) of the object and by querying the Implemented Categories registry key for the control, as specified by [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 216434](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/216434/) and the [MSDN ActiveX safety article](http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/components/activex/safety.asp). **ActiveX security options** Through either the IObjectSafety interface or the appropriate registry values, an ActiveX control can be marked as "safe for scripting" and/or "safe for initialization." According to the MSDN article [Signing and Marking ActiveX Controls](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnaxctrl/html/msdn_signmark.asp):  *If you mark your control as safe for initializing, you are asserting that no matter what values are used to initialize your control, it won't do anything that would damage a user's system or compromise the user's security.**If you mark your control as safe for scripting, you are asserting that your control won't do anything to damage a user's system or compromise the user's security, regardless of how your control's methods and properties are manipulated by the Web page's script. In other words, it has to accept any method calls (with any parameters) and/or property manipulations in any order without doing anything bad.***Microsoft Data Access Components and Remote Data Service (RDS)**MDAC is a collection of utilities and routines to process requests between databases and network applications. The RDS component provides an intermediary step for a client's request for service from a back-end database. The component enables the web site to apply business logic to the request.**The Problem**The RDS.Dataspace ActiveX control includes a method that can create an instance of an ActiveX control that exists on the system. The ActiveX objects created in this manner will bypass the ActiveX security model. In particular, the "safe for scripting" and killbit options are ignored. Note that in default configurations of Internet Explorer, the RDS.Dataspace ActiveX control cannot be loaded in the Internet Zone.Note that exploit code for this vulnerability is publicly available.More information is available in Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS06-014](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS06-014.mspx). |
| --- |

### Impact

| If a remote attacker can persuade a user to access a specially crafted web page, that attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the compromised user. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an Update**This issue is addressed in Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS06-014](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS06-014.mspx). |
| --- |

| **Disable the****RDS.Dataspace ActiveX control****in Internet Explorer**The RDS.Dataspace ActiveX control can be disabled in Internet Explorer by setting the kill bit for the following CLSID:{BD96C556-65A3-11D0-983A-00C04FC29E36} More information about how to set the kill bit is available in [Microsoft Support Document 240797](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797). **Disable ActiveX**Disabling ActiveX controls in the Internet Zone (or any zone used by an attacker) appears to prevent exploitation of this vulnerability. Instructions for disabling ActiveX in the Internet Zone can be found in the "[Securing Your Web Browser"](http://www.us-cert.gov/reading_room/securing_browser/#Internet_Explorer) document and the [Malicious Web Scripts FAQ](http://www.cert.org/tech_tips/malicious_code_FAQ.html#ie56). |

HS06-013;
Vulnerability in the MDAC Function Could Allow Remote Code Execution

Solution for DBPARTNER ODBC Driver, DABroker for
ODBC, DBPARTNER2, and HITSENSER5

A vulnerability that could allow an attacker to execute code remotely was
discovered in the Microsoft Data Access Components (MDAC) function included
in DBPARTNER ODBC Driver, DABroker for ODBC, DBPARTNER2, and
HITSENSER5.

[Affected MDAC version]
This vulnerability is in the MDAC 2.5 installation module. The MDAC 2.5
installation module is copied (i) if "MDAC 2.5" is selected in a custom
installation of DBPARTNER ODBC Driver/DBPARTNER ODBC 3.0 Driver, or
(ii) in a default installation of DABroker for ODBC, or (iii) in an upgrade
installation of MDAC 2.5 on a target machine.
This vulnerability is also in the DBPARTNER ODBC Driver included in the
following DBPARTNER2 and HITSENSER5 related products.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

**What is the Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration?**

Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured Internet Explorer settings that reduce the likelihood of a user or of an administrator downloading and running malicious Web content on a server. Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration reduces this risk by modifying many security-related settings. This includes the settings on the **Security** tab and the **Advanced** tab in the **Internet Options** dialog box. Some of the important modifications include the following:

* Security level for the Internet zone is set to **High**. This setting disables scripts, ActiveX controls, Microsoft Java Virtual Machine (MSJVM), and file downloads.
* Automatic detection of intranet sites is disabled. This setting assigns all intranet Web sites and all Universal Naming Convention (UNC) paths that are not explicitly listed in the Local intranet zone to the Internet zone.
* Install On Demand and non-Microsoft browser extensions are disabled. This setting prevents Web pages from automatically installing components and prevents non-Microsoft extensions from running.
* Multimedia content is disabled. This setting prevents music, animations, and video clips from running.

**Extended security update support for Microsoft Windows NT Workstation 4.0 Service Pack 6a and Windows 2000 Service Pack 2 ended on June 30, 2004. Extended security update support for Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0 Service Pack 6a ended on December 31, 2004. Extended security update support for Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 3 ended on June 30, 2005. I am still using one of these operating systems, what should I do?**

Windows NT Workstation 4.0 Service Pack 6a, Windows NT Server 4.0 Service Pack 6a, Windows 2000 Service Pack 2, and Windows 2000 Service Pack 3 have reached the end of their support life cycles.

For more information about MBSA, visit the [MBSA Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134). For more information about the programs that MBSA 1.2.1 currently does not detect, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 306460](https://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=306460). However, Microsoft has developed a version of the [Enterprise Scan Tool (EST](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/894193)) that will help customers determine whether the security updates provided in this security bulletin are required. For more information, see the "Can I use a version of the [Enterprise Scan Tool (EST)](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/894193) to determine whether this update is required?" question.

**Can I use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) 2.0 to determine whether this update is required?**

Yes. MBSA 2.0 will determine whether this update is required. MBSA 2.0 can detect security updates for products that Microsoft Update supports. For more information about MBSA, visit the [MBSA Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).

**What is the Enterprise Update Scanning Tool (EST)?**

As part of an ongoing commitment to provide detection tools for bulletin-class security updates, Microsoft delivers a stand-alone detection tool whenever the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) and the Office Detection Tool (ODT) cannot detect whether the update is required for an MSRC release cycle. This stand-alone tool is called the [Enterprise Scan Tool (EST)](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/894193) and is designed for enterprise administrators. When a version of the Enterprise Update Scanning Tool is created for a specific bulletin, customers can run the tool from a command line interface (CLI) and view the results of the XML output file. To help customers better utilize the tool, detailed documentation will be provided with the tool. There is also a version of the tool that offers an integrated experience for SMS administrators.

**Can I use a version of the Enterprise Update Scanning Tool (EST) to determine whether this update is required?**

Yes. Microsoft has created a version of the EST that will determine if you have to apply this update. For download links and more information about the version of the EST that is being released this month, see the following [Microsoft Web site](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/894193). SMS customers should review the "Can I use Systems Management Server (SMS) to determine whether this update is required?" FAQ for more information about SMS and EST.

**Can I use Systems Management Server (SMS) to determine whether this update is required?**

Yes. SMS can help detect and deploy this security update.

SMS can use the SMS Software Update Services (SUS) Feature Pack to detect security updates. The SMS SUS Feature Pack includes the Security Update Inventory Tool (SUIT). For more information about the Security Update Inventory Tool, visit the following [Microsoft Web site](https://www.microsoft.com/smserver/downloads/2003/featurepacks/suspack). For more information about the limitations of the Security Update Inventory Tool, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 306460](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/306460).

The SMS SUS Feature Pack also includes the Microsoft Office Inventory Tool to detect for required updates for Microsoft Office applications.

SMS can use the SMS 2003 Inventory Tool for Microsoft Updates to detect security updates that are offered by [Microsoft Update](https://update.microsoft.com/microsoftupdate) and that are supported by [Windows Server Update Services](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=50120). For more information about the SMS 2003 Inventory Tool for Microsoft Updates, visit the following [Microsoft Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=50757).

SMS 2.0 and SMS 2003 customers who do not use the SMS 2003 Inventory Tool for Microsoft Updates must download and deploy an updated version of the Extended Security Update Inventory Tool to receive full detection and deployment for this update.

For more information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

## Vulnerability Details

#### Microsoft Windows MDAC Vulnerability - CVE-2006-0003:

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the RDS.Dataspace ActiveX control that is provided as part of the ActiveX Data Objects (ADO) and that is distributed in MDAC. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system.

#### Mitigating Factors for Microsoft Windows MDAC Vulnerability - CVE-2006-0003:

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site. It could also be possible to display malicious Web content by using banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver Web content to affected systems.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/workshop/security/szone/overview/esc_changes.asp). This mode mitigates this vulnerability in the e-mail vector because reading e-mail messages in plain text is the default configuration for Outlook Express.

#### Workarounds for Microsoft Windows MDAC Vulnerability - CVE-2006-0003:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

* **Disable the RDS.Dataspace ActiveX control from running within Internet Explorer**
  Disable attempts to instantiate the RDS.Dataspace ActiveX control in Internet Explorer by setting the kill bit for the control.

**Warning** If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

For example, to set the kill bit for a CLSID for this object, paste the following text in a text editor such as Notepad. Then, save the file by using the .reg file name extension.

[HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility{BD96C556-65A3-11D0-983A-00C04FC29E36}]"Compatibility Flags"=dword: 00000400

**Note** For more information about how to prevent a control from running in Internet Explorer, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 240797](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797). Follow the procedure that this article provides to create a Compatibility Flags value in the registry. By doing this, you will prevent the RDS.Dataspace ActiveX control from being instantiated in Internet Explorer.

**Impact of Workaround:** Any Web-based application that requires the RDS control to be instantiated within Internet Explorer will no longer function correctly.

* **Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to âHighâ to prompt before running ActiveX controls in these zones**
  You can help protect against this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to prompt before running ActiveX controls. You can do this by setting your browser security to **High**.

To raise the browsing security level in Microsoft Internet Explorer, follow these steps:

* On the Internet Explorer **Tools** menu, click **Internet Options**.
* In the **Internet Options** dialog box, click the **Security** tab, and then click the **Internet** icon.
* Under **Security level for this zone**, move the slider to **High**. This sets the security level for all Web sites you visit to High.

**Note** If no slider is visible, click **Default Level**, and then move the slider to **High**.

Repeat steps 1 through 3 for the Local intranet security zone by clicking on the **Local intranet** icon.

**Note** Setting the level to **High** may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the security setting set to **High**.

**Impact of Workaround:** User will be prompted prior to running ActiveX controls unless the Web site is in the userâs list of trusted sites.

* **Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running ActiveX controls or disable ActiveX controls in the Internet and Local intranet security zone**
  You can help protect against this vulnerability by changing your settings to prompt before running ActiveX controls or disable ActiveX controls in the Internet and Local intranet security zone. To do this, follow these steps:
* On the Internet Explorer **Tools** menu, click **Internet Options**.
* In the **Internet Options** dialog box, click the **Security** tab, and then click the **Internet** icon.
* Click **Custom Level**.
* Under **Settings,** in the **ActiveX controls and plug-ins** section, under **Run ActiveX controls and plug-ins**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
* Click **Local intranet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
* Under **Settings,** in the **ActiveX controls and plug-ins** section, under **Run ActiveX controls and plug-ins**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK.**
* Click **OK** two times to return to Internet Explorer.

**Impact of Workaround:** There are side effects to prompting before running ActiveX controls. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running ActiveX controls is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click **Yes** to run ActiveX controls.

#### FAQ for Microsoft Windows MDAC Vulnerability - CVE-2006-0003:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could remotely take complete control of an affected system.

If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

Under certain conditions, the RDS.Dataspace ActiveX control fails to ensure that it interacts safely when it is hosted on a Web page\*\*.\*\*

**What is Remote Data Services (RDS)?**

Remote Data Service (RDS) is a feature of ADO. You can use RDS to move data from a server to a client application or to a Web page, to manipulate the data on the client, and to return updates to the server in a single round trip.

**Who could exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could create an e-mail message that is specially crafted to try to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending this specially crafted e-mail message to a user of a server that is running an affected software application. An attacker could then persuade the user to click a link in the e-mail message. In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site. It could also be possible to display malicious Web content by using banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver Web content to affected systems.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability requires that a user is logged on and reading e-mail messages or is visiting Web sites for any malicious action to occur. Therefore, any systems where e-mail messages are read or where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability.

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by applying additional restrictions to the behavior of the RDS.Dataspace ActiveX control when it is hosted on a Web page.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**Notes** When you install these security updates, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the Update.exe installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as hotfix, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you can use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. MBSA allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).

* **File Version Verification**

**Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

* Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
* In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
* In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
* In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

**Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.

* On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

**Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.

* **Registry Key Verification**

You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry keys.

For Windows XP Home Edition Service Pack 1, Windows XP Professional Service Pack 1, Windows XP Tablet PC Edition, Windows XP Media Center Edition:

HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows XP\SP3\KB911562\Filelist

Windows XP Home Edition Service Pack 2, Windows XP Professional Service Pack 2, Windows XP Tablet PC Edition 2005, and Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005:

HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows XP\SP3\KB911562\Filelist

For Windows XP Professional x64 Edition:

HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows XP Version 2003\SP2\ KB911562Filelist

**Note** These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly if an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams the 911562 security update into the Windows installation source files.

#### Microsoft Data Access Components When Installed on Windows 2000 (all versions)

**Prerequisites**

For Windows 2000, this security update requires Service Pack 4 (SP4). For Small Business Server 2000, this security update requires Small Business Server 2000 Service Pack 1a (SP1a) or Small Business Server 2000 running with Windows 2000 Server Service Pack 4 (SP4).

The software that is listed has been tested to determine whether the versions are affected. Other versions either no longer include security update support or may not be affected. To determine the support life cycle for your product and version, visit the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742).

**Inclusion in Future Service Packs:**

The update for this issue may be included in a future Update Rollup.

**Installation Information**

This security update supports the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/help** | Displays the command-line options |
| Setup Modes |  |
| **/passive** | Unattended Setup mode. No user interaction is required, but installation status is displayed. If a restart is required at the end of Setup, a dialog box will be presented to the user with a timer warning that the computer will restart in 30 seconds. |
| **/quiet** | Quiet mode. This is the same as unattended mode, but no status or error messages are displayed. |
| Restart Options |  |
| **/norestart** | Does not restart when installation has completed |
| **/forcerestart** | Restarts the computer after installation and force other applications to close at shutdown without saving open files first. |
| **/warnrestart[:x]** | Presents a dialog box with a timer warning the user that the computer will restart in *x* seconds. (The default setting is 30 seconds.) Intended for use with the **/quiet** switch or the **/passive** switch. |
| **/promptrestart** | Display a dialog box prompting the local user to allow a restart |
| Special Options |  |
| **/overwriteoem** | Overwrites OEM files without prompting |
| **/nobackup** | Does not back up files needed for uninstall |
| **/forceappsclose** | Forces other programs to close when the computer shuts down |
| **/log:path** | Allows the redirection of installation log files |
| **/integrate:path** | Integrates the update into the Windows source files. These files are located at the path that is specified in the switch. |
| **/extract[:path]** | Extracts files without starting the Setup program |
| **/ER** | Enables extended error reporting |
| **/verbose** | Enables verbose logging. During installation, creates %Windir%\CabBuild.log. This log details the files that are copied. Using this switch may cause the installation to proceed more slowly. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841). For more information about the Update.exe installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951). For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as hotfix, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

**Deployment Information**

**Note** If you are unsure of the version of MDAC you are running, install the [Component Checker](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=8f0a8df6-4a21-4b43-bf53-14332ef092c9).

To install the security update without any user intervention, use the following command at a command prompt for Windows 2000 Service Pack 4:

**MDAC253-KB911562-x86-enu /quiet**

**or**

**MDAC271-KB911562-x86-enu /quiet**

**or**

**MDAC28-KB911562-x86-enu /quiet**

**or**

**MDAC281-KB911562-x86-enu /quiet**

**Note** Use of the **/quiet** switch will suppress all messages. This includes suppressing failure messages. Administrators should use one of the supported methods to verify the installation was successful when they use the **/quiet** switch. Administrators should also review the MDAC253-KB911562-x86-XXX.log, MDAC271-KB911562-x86-XXX.log, MDAC28-KB911562-XXX.log or MDAC281-KB911562-XXX.log files for any failure messages when they use this switch.

To install the security update without forcing the system to restart, use the following command at a command prompt for Windows 2000 Service Pack 4:

**MDAC253-KB911562-x86-enu / norestart**

**or**

**MDAC271-KB911562-x86-enu / norestart**

**or**

**MDAC28-KB911562-x86-enu / norestart**

**Restart Requirement**

This update does not require a restart. The installer stops the required services, applies the update, and then restarts the services. However, if the required services cannot be stopped for any reason, or if required files are being used, this update will require a restart. If this behavior occurs, a message appears that advises you to restart.

**Removal Information**

To remove this security update, use the Add or Remove Programs tool in Control Panel.

System administrators can also use the Spuninst.exe utility to remove this security update. The Spuninst.exe utility is located in the following; %Windir%$SQLUninstallMDAC25SP3-KB911562-x86-XXX$\Spuninst, %Windir%$SQLUninstallMDAC27SP1-KB911562-x86-XXX$\Spuninst, %Windir%$SQLUninstallMDAC28-KB911562-x86-XXX$\Spuninst, or %Windir%$SQLUninstallMDAC28SP1-KB911562-x86-XXX$\Spuninst

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you can use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. MBSA allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).

* **File Version Verification**

**Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

* Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
* In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
* In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
* In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

**Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.

* On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

**Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.

* **Registry Key Verification**

You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry keys.

Microsoft Data Access Components 2.5 Service Pack 3:

HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\DataAccess\MDAC25\SP3\KB911562\Filelist

Microsoft Data Access Components 2.7 Service Pack 1:

HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\DataAccess\MDAC27\SP1\KB911562\Filelist

Microsoft Data Access Components 2.8:

HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\DataAccess\MDAC28\SP0\KB911562\Filelist

Microsoft Data Access Components 2.8 Service Pack 1:

HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\DataAccess\MDAC28\SP1\KB911562\Filelist

**Note** This registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, this registry key may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams the 911562 security update into the Windows installation source files.

**Software Update Services:**

By using Microsoft Software Update Services (SUS), administrators can quickly and reliably deploy the latest critical updates and security updates to Windows 2000 and Windows Server 2003-based servers, and to desktop systems that are running Windows 2000 Professional or Windows XP Professional.

For more information about how to deploy security updates by using Software Update Services, visit the [Software Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21133).

**Windows Server Update Services:**

By using Windows Server Update Services (WSUS), administrators can quickly and reliably deploy the latest critical updates and security updates for Windows 2000 operating systems and later, Office XP and later, Exchange Server 2003, and SQL Server 2000 onto Windows 2000 and later operating systems.

For more information about how to deploy security updates using Windows Server Update Services, visit the [Windows Server Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=50120).

**Systems Management Server:**

Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) delivers a highly-configurable enterprise solution for managing updates. By using SMS, administrators can identify Windows-based systems that require security updates and can perform controlled deployment of these updates throughout the enterprise with minimal disruption to end users. For more information about how administrators can use SMS 2003 to deploy security updates, visit the [SMS 2003 Security Patch Management Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=22939). SMS 2.0 users can also use [Software Updates Service Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33340) to help deploy security updates. For information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

**Note** SMS uses the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer, the Microsoft Office Detection Tool, and the Enterprise Update Scanning Tool to provide broad support for security bulletin update detection and deployment. Some software updates may not be detected by these tools. Administrators can use the inventory capabilities of the SMS in these cases to target updates to specific systems. For more information about this procedure, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33341). Some security updates require administrative rights following a restart of the system. Administrators can use the Elevated Rights Deployment Tool (available in the [SMS 2003 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33387) and in the [SMS 2.0 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21161)) to install these updates.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
