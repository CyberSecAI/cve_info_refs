Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability present in the `login.php` script of VEGO Links Builder. The `$username` variable is not properly sanitized before being used in an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw. This allows an attacker to manipulate the SQL query by injecting malicious SQL code through the unsanitized `$username` input.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize or validate user-supplied input before using it in a database query, creating a vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass the normal authentication process and gain unauthorized access to the administrative area of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP request to `login.php` with a malicious payload injected into the `username` field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a HTTP request.
*   **Magic Quotes Off:** The vulnerability is exploitable when the `magic_quotes_gpc` PHP setting is turned off on the server.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable script is `login.php`.
*   The `$username` variable is vulnerable.
*   A successful exploit involves setting the `username` parameter to `a' or 1/*` and the password can be any value
