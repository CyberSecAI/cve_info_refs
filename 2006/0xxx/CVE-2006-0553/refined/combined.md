How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

PostgreSQL minor version 8.1.3 has been released, containing a patch for a
serious security issue present in the 8.1 branch.  All users of 8.1 are
urged to upgrade at the earliest opportunity.

Minor versions 8.0.7, 7.4.12, and 7.3.14 are being released at the same
time.  These  contain only minor bug fixes to the 8.0, 7.4 and 7.3
versions and can be upgraded on a more planned schedule, unless of course
you are encountering one of the bugs described.

The security issue in 8.1.x allows an authenticated database user to
escalate his ROLE privileges by exploiting knowledge of the backend
protocol.  While there are no known exploits in the wild for this, users
are urged not to wait until they encounter one.

8.1.3 also contains a number of other bug fixes, most of them for very
specific (rare) database configurations and schema issues, but including a
number of crash fixes.   Notable also is a fix to the TSearch2 GiST index
generation code which will significantly speed up creation of TSearch2
indexes.   See the release notes for more detail:

<http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.1/static/release.html>

As usual, you may download the new releases from our FTP Mirrors or
BitTorrent:

The release notes contain the significant changes in each
PostgreSQL release, with major
features and migration issues listed at the top. The release
notes do not contain changes that affect only a few users or
changes that are internal and therefore not user-visible. For
example, the optimizer is improved in almost every release, but
the improvements are usually observed by users as simply faster
queries.

A complete list of changes for each release can be obtained by
viewing the [Git](sourcerepo.html#GIT) logs for each
release. The [pgsql-committers email list](http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-committers/) records all source code
changes as well. There is also a [web interface](http://git.postgresql.org/gitweb?p=postgresql.git;a=summary) that shows changes to specific
files.

The name appearing next to each item represents the major
developer for that item. Of course all changes involve community
discussion and patch review, so each item is truly a community
effort.

# E.1. Release 8.1.23

> **Release date:** 2010-12-16

This release contains a variety of fixes from 8.1.22. For
information about new features in the 8.1 major release, see
[Section E.24](release-8-1.html).

This is expected to be the last PostgreSQL release in the 8.1.X series.
Users are encouraged to update to a newer release branch
soon.

## E.1.1. Migration to Version 8.1.23

A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.1.X.
However, if you are upgrading from a version earlier than
8.1.18, see the release notes for 8.1.18.

## E.1.2. Changes

* Force the default [wal\_sync\_method](runtime-config-wal.html#GUC-WAL-SYNC-METHOD) to be fdatasync on Linux (Tom Lane, Marti
  Raudsepp)

  The default on Linux has actually been fdatasync for many years, but recent
  kernel changes caused PostgreSQL to choose open\_datasync instead. This choice did not
  result in any performance improvement, and caused
  outright failures on certain filesystems, notably
  ext4 with the data=journal mount option.
* Fix recovery from base backup when the starting
  checkpoint WAL record is not in the same WAL segment as
  its redo point (Jeff Davis)
* Add support for detecting register-stack overrun on
  IA64 (Tom Lane)

  The IA64 architecture has two
  hardware stacks. Full prevention of stack-overrun
  failures requires checking both.
* Add a check for stack overflow in `copyObject()` (Tom Lane)

  Certain code paths could crash due to stack overflow
  given a sufficiently complex query.
* Fix detection of page splits in temporary GiST indexes
  (Heikki Linnakangas)

  It is possible to have a "concurrent" page split in a temporary
  index, if for example there is an open cursor scanning
  the index when an insertion is done. GiST failed to
  detect this case and hence could deliver wrong results
  when execution of the cursor continued.
* Avoid memory leakage while ANALYZE'ing complex index expressions (Tom
  Lane)
* Ensure an index that uses a whole-row Var still
  depends on its table (Tom Lane)

  An index declared like create
  index i on t (foo(t.\*)) would not automatically get
  dropped when its table was dropped.
* Do not "inline" a SQL
  function with multiple OUT
  parameters (Tom Lane)

  This avoids a possible crash due to loss of
  information about the expected result rowtype.
* Fix constant-folding of COALESCE() expressions (Tom Lane)

  The planner would sometimes attempt to evaluate
  sub-expressions that in fact could never be reached,
  possibly leading to unexpected errors.
* Add print functionality for InhRelation nodes (Tom Lane)

  This avoids a failure when debug\_print\_parse is enabled and certain
  types of query are executed.
* Fix incorrect calculation of distance from a point to
  a horizontal line segment (Tom Lane)

  This bug affected several different geometric
  distance-measurement operators.
* Fix PL/pgSQL's
  handling of "simple"
  expressions to not fail in recursion or error-recovery
  cases (Tom Lane)
* Fix bug in contrib/cube's
  GiST picksplit algorithm (Alexander Korotkov)

  This could result in considerable inefficiency, though
  not actually incorrect answers, in a GiST index on a
  cube column. If you have such an
  index, consider REINDEXing it
  after installing this update.
* Don't emit "identifier will be
  truncated" notices in contrib/dblink except when creating new
  connections (Itagaki Takahiro)
* Fix potential coredump on missing public key in
  contrib/pgcrypto (Marti
  Raudsepp)
* Fix memory leak in contrib/xml2's XPath query functions (Tom
  Lane)
* Update time zone data files to tzdata release 2010o for DST law
  changes in Fiji and Samoa; also historical corrections
  for Hong Kong.

## PostgreSQL database privilege escalation vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#567452

Original Release Date: 2006-02-27 | Last Revised: 2006-05-17

---

### Overview

PostgreSQL fails to properly recover from errors. This may allow an authenticated attacker to gain elevated privileges on a PostgreSQL database.

### Description

| **PostgreSQL Database**  PostgreSQL is an open source database management system. **The Problem**There is a vulnerability in the way that PostgreSQL recovers from errors. According to the release notes for [PostgreSQL 8.1.3](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.1/static/release.html#RELEASE-8-1-3): *Due to inadequate validity checking, a user could exploit the special case that* *SET ROLE**normally uses to restore the previous role setting after an error. This allowed ordinary users to acquire superuser status, for example.***Considerations**This issue only exists in PostgreSQL versions 8.1.0 to 8.1.2. An attacker must have valid credentials to exploit this vulnerability. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An authenticated attacker may be able to gain elevated privileges on a PostgreSQL database. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade**  This issue has been corrected in PostgreSQL version [8.1.3](http://www.postgresql.org/ftp/source/v8.1.3/). |
