{
  "CVE-2006-0553": {
    "Description": "PostgreSQL fails to properly recover from errors. This may allow an authenticated attacker to gain elevated privileges on a PostgreSQL database.",
    "Root cause": "Inadequate validity checking in the way PostgreSQL recovers from errors during SET ROLE operations.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper error handling",
      "Insufficient privilege validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "An authenticated database user can escalate their privileges to superuser status.",
    "Attack vectors": "Exploiting the backend protocol by manipulating the SET ROLE command and how it restores previous role settings after an error.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs valid credentials for a database user account. The attacker must also have knowledge of the backend protocol and how it manages role settings."
  }
