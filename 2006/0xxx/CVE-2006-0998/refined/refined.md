  "CVE-2006-0998": {
    "Description": "The provided content relates to CVE-2006-0998, which is described as 'SSL Server Supports Weak Encryption Vulnerability port 443/tcp over SSL'.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from the SSL server allowing the use of weak encryption ciphers during SSL handshakes. These weak ciphers, such as RC2, RC4, DES or 3DES, could potentially allow for easier decryption of the client-server communication.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "The SSL server, specifically the NILE.NLM module, does not prioritize strong ciphers over weak ones during the SSL handshake by default, allowing the client to choose weak ciphers.",
       "The server is vulnerable to downgrade attacks if the client offers null ciphers, which effectively means no encryption."
    ],
    "Impact": "Exploitation could lead to exposure of sensitive data transmitted over the SSL connection due to the use of weak or null encryption. This could allow an attacker to eavesdrop on communications and potentially manipulate the data.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "An attacker can potentially force the SSL server to use weak ciphers by manipulating the list of ciphers proposed by the client during the SSL handshake.",
      "An attacker can force the server to use null ciphers, which results in no encryption"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": [
      "An attacker needs the ability to intercept or modify the SSL handshake between the client and the server.",
        "An attacker needs the ability to configure a client to propose null ciphers during the SSL handshake"
    ],
     "Additional Information": "The vulnerability was addressed by modifying the NILE.NLM module to prefer strong ciphers over weak ciphers by default. A configuration option was introduced to allow users to revert to using weak ciphers if required, via a setting in SYS:\\ETC\\NILE.CFG file with a WeakCrypto enabled parameter. The vulnerability was detected by SSL Digger by Foundstone."
