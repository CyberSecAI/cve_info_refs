KB 7004507

# SSL Allows the use of Weak Ciphers.

* **Document ID:***7004507*
* **Creation Date:**23-Sep-2009
* **Modified Date:**16-Jul-2019
* + **Micro Focus Products:**eDirectoryNetWareOpen Enterprise Server

## Environment

 Novell Open Enterprise Server (OES)
 Novell NetWare 6.5

## Situation

 SSL Allows the use of Weak Ciphers.
 SSL Server Allows Cleartext Communication Vulnerability port 443/tcp over SSL
 SSL Server Supports Weak Encryption Vulnerability port 443/tcp over SSL
 SSL Server May Be Forced to Use Weak Encryption Vulnerability port 443/tcp over SSL
 The Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol allows for secure communication between a client and a server.
The client-server communication is generally encrypted using a symmetric cipher such as RC2, RC4, DES or 3DES.

Some implementations of SSL allow for weak cipher communication.

Technically it is encryption but with a NULL key, so the various checks go through the exact same code path as the standard higher encryption ciphers.
When the SSL session starts, the client (in most cases, a browser) sends the list of ciphers and compression algorithms.
This list, by default, does not send any NULL encryption ciphers.
However some browsers will allow you to configure it to send NULL encryption ciphers by default.

NOTE:

Some ways to verify if a port is allowing weak ciphers.  This is useful if detection software shows a fault positive.

openssl s\_client -connect <ipaddress:port> -ssl2 -state
EX:  openssl s\_client -connect 192.168.1.100:443 -ssl2 -state

openssl s\_client -connect <ipaddress:port> -cipher LOW -state
EX: openssl s\_client -connect 192.168.1.100:443 -cipher LOW -state

## Resolution

 NILE.NLM has been modified so that strong ciphers are preferred over weak ciphers by default during SSL handshakes.

The updated version of NILE.NLM is available for download in NILE65SP5A.EXE.

## Additional Information

 Each of the vulnerabilities and their associated CVE numbers are listed below:

CVE- 2006- 0997 - SSL Server Allows Cleartext Communication Vulnerability port 443/tcp over SSL
CVE- 2006- 0998 - SSL Server Supports Weak Encryption Vulnerability port 443/tcp over SSL
CVE- 2006- 0999 - SSL Server May Be Forced to Use Weak Encryption Vulnerability port 443/tcp over SSL
 In order to revert back to allowing weak ciphers it is necessary to modify the SYS:\ETC\NILE.CFG and enter the following:
[WeakCrypto]
Enabled=Y|N

NOTE: After modifying the settings in the SYS:\ETC\NILE.CFG file it is necessary to restart the server to have the changes take effect.
 SSL Digger by Foundstone was used to test this vulnerability.

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2014

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2014

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

[Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible.** This Critical Patch Update contains 144 new security fixes across the product families listed below.

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available at: [http://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF).

Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](http://cve.mitre.org) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same **CVE#** in all risk matrices. *Italics* indicate vulnerabilities in code included from other product areas.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 2.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS 2.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected.The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and how to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update January 2014 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1594621.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_adf.ctrl-state=7zc236l82_4880&id=1594621.1).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_adf.ctrl-state=7zc236l82_4885&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](//www.oracle.com/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available to customers who have purchased Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download patches released through the Critical Patch Update program for products in the Extended Support Phase.

### Appendix - Oracle Java SE

#### Oracle Java SE Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 36 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE.
34 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication,
i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password.
The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpujan2014verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Partial" instead of "Complete", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 10.0 becomes 7.5.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 7 release.

[My Oracle Support Note 360870.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=82515731195137&id=360870.1) explains the impact of Java security vulnerabilities on Oracle products that include an Oracle Java SE JDK or JRE.
