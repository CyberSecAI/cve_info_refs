Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection in the `sme_admin/login.php` script of SmE GB Host.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
The script fails to properly sanitize the username value before using it in a SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code. The vulnerability is exploitable when `magic_quotes_gpc` is off.

Impact of exploitation:
An attacker can bypass authentication and potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries. This could lead to unauthorized access, data manipulation, or other malicious activities.

Attack vectors:
The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable `sme_admin/login.php` script.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server where the vulnerable script is hosted, and needs to know the path to the `sme_admin/login.php` script.
