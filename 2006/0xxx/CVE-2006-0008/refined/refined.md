      ],
      "impact": "An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "An attacker must have access to the system to perform an interactive logon, either locally or via a Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) session."
