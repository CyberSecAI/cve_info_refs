## Vulnerability Details

#### Korean IME Vulnerability - CVE-2006-0008:

A [privilege elevation](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21142) vulnerability exists in the Windows and Office Korean Input Method Editor (IME). This vulnerability could allow a malicious user to take complete control of an affected system. For an attack to be successful an attacker must be able to interactively logon to the affected system.

#### Mitigating Factors for Korean IME Vulnerability - CVE-2006-0008:

* To exploit this vulnerability an attacker must have access to the system to perform an interactive logon, either locally or via a Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) session.
* Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.
* By default, RDP is not enabled on any operating system version. On Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, Remote Assistance can enable RDP. On Windows XP Media Center Edition, RDP is enabled if a Media Center Extender has been installed. For information about Media Center Extenders, visit the following [Web site](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/aa302360).

  On Small Business Server 2000 and on Windows Small Business Server 2003, RDP in enabled by default. However, by default, on Windows Small Business Server 2003 and earlier versions, the RDP Protocol communication ports are blocked from the Internet. RDP is available only on the local network unless Terminal Services or the Remote Web Workplace features have been enabled by using the Configure E-mail and Internet Connection Wizard (CEICW).
* If Remote Desktop is manually enabled, the following Windows Firewall changes will occur, depending on the operating system version:

  + On Windows XP Service Pack 2 systems that have Windows Firewall enabled, enabling the Remote Desktop feature will automatically enable the Remote Desktop exception in the firewall, with the scope of **All computers (including those on the Internet)**. When you disable Remote Desktop, this firewall exception is automatically disabled.

    On Windows XP Service Pack 1, Windows Server 2003, and Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1, enabling the Remote Desktop Feature does not enable the Remote Desktop exception in the firewall. Enabling Remote Desktop causes a dialog box to appear that indicates that you must manually enable this exception. There is a Remote Desktop entry in the exception in the list of the firewall exceptions that a user would have to manually enable. Disabling Remote Desktop does not change the exception status in the firewall. However, although the system is no longer vulnerable to this issue through Remote Desktop, it could still be vulnerable through Remote Assistance and Terminal Services, where available.

#### Workarounds for Korean IME Vulnerability - CVE-2006-0008:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known remote attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

* **Disable Terminal Services, Remote Desktop, Remote Assistance, and Windows Small Business Server 2003 Remote Web Workplace if they are no longer required.**

  If you no longer need these services on your system, consider disabling them as a security best practice. Disabling unused and unneeded services helps reduce your exposure to security vulnerabilities.

  For information about how to disable Remote Desktop manually, visit the following [Web site](https://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/rdesktop_disable.mspx).

  For information about how to disable Remote Desktop by using Group Policy, see the following [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/306300).

  For information about Remote Assistance, including instructions on how to disable Remote Assistance manually and by using Group Policy, visit the following [Web site](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/winxppro/maintain/intmgmt/20_xprem.mspx).

  For information about how to disable the Windows Small Business Server 2003 Terminal Services and Remote Web Workplace features, visit the following [Web site](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/secnews/articles/sec_sbs2003_network.mspx).
* **Block TCP port 3389 at the enterprise perimeter firewall.**

  This port is used to initiate a connection with the affected component. Blocking it at the network perimeter firewall will help protect systems that are behind that firewall from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. This can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Blocking the affected ports at the enterprise perimeter is the best defense to help avoid Internet-based attacks. However, systems could still be vulnerable to attacks from within their enterprise perimeter. Additionally, on Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, Windows Firewall can help protect individual systems. By default, Windows Firewall does not allow connections to this port, except in Windows XP Service Pack 2 when the Remote Desktop feature is enabled. For information about how to disable the Windows Firewall exception for Remote Desktop on these platforms, visit the following [Web site](https://technet.microsoft.com/windowsserver/en/library/a08da8ea-a616-4422-bbd7-9cb8de066b29). If you cannot disable the Windows Firewall exception for Remote Desktop, you may be able to reduce the scope of this vulnerability by setting the default value of **All computers (Including those on the Internet)**, to the local network. Doing this helps reduce the likelihood of attacks from the Internet.

  **Note** Windows Small Business Server 2003 uses a feature named Remote Web Workplace. This feature uses TCP port 4125 for RDP connections, but only once a user has been successfully authenticated. If you are using this feature, you should validate that this port is also blocked from the Internet in addition to port 3389.

  **Note** It is possible to manually change the affected components to use other ports. If you have performed these actions, you should also block those additional ports.
* **Help secure Remote Desktop connections by using an IPsec policy.**

  Specific configurations would be dependent upon the individual environment. For information about Internet Protocol Security (IPsec), visit the following [Web site](https://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/technologies/networking/ipsec/default.mspx). Detailed information about IPsec and about how to apply filters is available in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 313190](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/313190) and [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 813878](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/813878).
* **Help secure Remote Desktop connections by using a virtual private network (VPN) connection.**

  Specific configurations depend on the individual environment. For information about Virtual Private Networks, visit the following [Web site](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windowsserver2003/library/serverhelp/a08da8ea-a616-4422-bbd7-9cb8de066b29.mspx).

#### FAQ for Korean IME Vulnerability - CVE-2006-0008:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a [privilege elevation](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21142) vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

Under certain conditions, the Input Method Editor (IME) for the Korean language inappropriately exposes functionality that runs in the LocalSystem context.

**What is the Korean IME?**

IMEs help solve a problem associated with entering information in certain languages via a keyboard.

For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).
* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update is installed on an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool, which allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).
* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.

#### Administrative Installation Information

If you installed your application from a server location, the server administrator must update the server location with the administrative update and deploy that update to your computer.

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. MBSA allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).
* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.

**Software Update Services:**

By using Microsoft Software Update Services (SUS), administrators can quickly and reliably deploy the latest critical updates and security updates to Windows 2000 based servers, to Windows Server 2003-based servers, and to desktop systems that are running Windows 2000 Professional or Windows XP Professional.

For more information about how to deploy security updates by using Software Update Services, visit the [Software Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21133).

**Windows Server Update Services:**

By using Windows Server Update Services (WSUS), administrators can quickly and reliably deploy the latest critical updates and security updates for Windows 2000 operating systems and later, Office XP and later, Exchange Server 2003, and SQL Server 2000 onto Windows 2000 and later operating systems.

For more information about how to deploy security updates using Windows Server Update Services, visit the [Windows Server Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=50120).

**Systems Management Server:**

Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) delivers a highly-configurable enterprise solution for managing updates. By using SMS, administrators can identify Windows-based systems that require security updates and can perform controlled deployment of these updates throughout the enterprise with minimal disruption to end users. For more information about how administrators can use SMS 2003 to deploy security updates, visit the [SMS 2003 Security Patch Management Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=22939). SMS 2.0 users can also use [Software Updates Service Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33340) to help deploy security updates. For information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

**Note** SMS uses the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer, the Office Detection Tool, and the Enterprise Update Scan Tool to provide broad support for security bulletin update detection and deployment. Some software updates may not be detected by these tools. Administrators can use the inventory capabilities of SMS in these cases to target updates to specific systems. For more information about this procedure, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33341). Some security updates require administrative rights following a restart of the system. Administrators can use the Elevated Rights Deployment Tool (available in the [SMS 2003 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33387) and in the [SMS 2.0 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21161)) to install these updates.
