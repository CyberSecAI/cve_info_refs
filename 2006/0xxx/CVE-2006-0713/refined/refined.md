{
  "CVE-2006-0713": {
    "related_content": true,
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The application includes arbitrary local files due to insufficient sanitization of the `lang` and `language` parameters in several PHP files.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Arbitrary Local File Inclusion"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can include arbitrary PHP files from local resources. If `magic_quotes_gpc` is disabled, it may allow including sensitive files such as `/etc/passwd` or potentially executing arbitrary code by including a file containing malicious PHP code.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "HTTP GET requests with manipulated `lang` parameter in `docs/index.php`.",
        "HTTP GET or POST requests with manipulated `language` parameter in `install/install.php`.",
        "HTTP GET requests with manipulated `language` parameter in `install/sec_stage_install.php` and `install/third_stage_install.php`.",
         "HTTP POST requests with manipulated `language` parameter in `install/forth_stage_install.php`."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "Attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application. No authentication is required for the file inclusion. For the arbitrary code execution through the log injection, the attacker must be able to interact with the login page to inject the malicious code into the log file, as well as access the vulnerable files for remote inclusion.",
      "additional_details": "The vulnerability exists in multiple files within the application, including `docs/index.php`, and multiple files in the `install/` directory (`install.php`, `sec_stage_install.php`, `third_stage_install.php`, and `forth_stage_install.php`). The vulnerability can be exploited even after the installation if the `install/` directory is not removed. Also, a remote user can inject arbitrary code into `sql/tmp/linpha.log` if \"user login events log\" is set to \"file\" and then include this log file."
