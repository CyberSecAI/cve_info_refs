{
  "CVE-2006-0225": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The scp command, when performing local-to-local copies, uses the `system()` function to execute a `cp` command. It improperly handles filenames containing special characters that may cause unintended command execution due to shell expansion.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper handling of special characters in filenames, leading to command injection through shell expansion.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary command execution with the privileges of the user running scp, potentially leading to privilege escalation or data compromise.",
      "Attack vectors": "Local exploitation by tricking a user into using scp with a malicious filename, or utilizing wildcards that include malicious filenames.",
       "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local user on the system with the ability to create files and trigger the use of scp."
    },
    {
     "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `scp` command uses `system()` to execute the `cp` command when copying files locally. This exposes the file name to the shell twice, potentially leading to command injection.",
     "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Double shell expansion due to the use of `system()`, allowing for the injection of arbitrary commands through specially crafted filenames.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "A local attacker can execute arbitrary code as the user running `scp`.",
     "Attack vectors": "Local exploitation via specially crafted filenames used in conjunction with the `scp` command.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "A local attacker with the ability to create files and run `scp`."
    },
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by scp using shell expansion twice on the filenames when doing local-to-local copies.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Double shell expansion via system() call in scp allows for command injection.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "A local attacker can execute arbitrary commands as the user running scp by crafting malicious filenames.",
      "Attack vectors": "A local user creating a file with malicious shell escape characters and then using scp to copy that file.",
       "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local user access."
    },
     {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The scp command uses a system call, which can lead to arbitrary command execution if the filename contains shell metacharacters. The local-to-local copy functionality was using a shell command which expanded the filename twice, making it easier to perform the command injection.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The use of system() function with unsanitized user-controlled input (filenames) leads to command injection vulnerabilities.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the user running the scp command.",
      "Attack vectors": "A local user crafting a filename containing shell metacharacters to execute code when another user copies the file using scp.",
       "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local user who can create files and cause another user to copy them using scp."
