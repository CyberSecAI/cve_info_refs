Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** Stack overflow vulnerability due to insufficient bounds checking when handling the "Name of site" field in NicoFTP.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Lack of input validation on the length of the FTP site name.
    *   Writing user-supplied data directly to a fixed-size buffer on the stack.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   The vulnerability can lead to a crash by overwriting the return address on the stack.
    *   Potential for arbitrary code execution if the attacker can control the overwritten return address and other registers (though this is stated to be difficult).
*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Create or modify an FTP account within NicoFTP.
    *   Fill the 'Name of site' field with a long string of 4101 characters and then another 4 characters to trigger the overflow.
    *   Alternatively, modify the 'Name' value within the `Sites.conf` file.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to interact with the NicoFTP application or have the ability to modify its configuration file. No authentication is required.

**Additional details from the content:**

*   The affected software is NicoFTP version 3.0.1.19 and earlier.
*   The vulnerability was discovered on 12/29/2005 and published on 01/01/2006.
*   The exploit is achieved by writing a long string in the "Name of site" field during account creation, causing a stack buffer overflow.
*   The provided analysis mentions that achieving reliable code execution was difficult due to overwritten registers, making a reliable exploit problematic.
