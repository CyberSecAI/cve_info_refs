How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Frequently asked questions (FAQ) related to this security update

**Why did Microsoft reissue this bulletin on June 13, 2006?**

Microsoft updated this bulletin and the associated security updates to include updated registry key values for the NetBT, RemoteAccess, and TCPIP services. These values have been modified to be the same as Windows XP Service Pack 2 on Windows XP Service Pack 1 systems. Customers running Windows XP Service Pack 1 are encouraged to apply this revised update for additional security from privilege elevation through the these services as described in the Vulnerability Details section of this security bulletin. Windows 2003 systems with no service pack applied are not affected by this reissue. For more information, and the updated registry key values, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 914798](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/914798).

**What changes does the revised security update include?**

The revised security update contains no changes to the binaries included in the initial security update. During installation, the revised security update will update the registry valudes for the NetBT, RemoteAccess, and TCPIP services as indicated in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 914798](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/914798).

**What are the known issues that customers may experience when they install this security update?**

[Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 914798](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/914798) documents the currently known issues that customers may experience when they install this security update. The article also documents recommended solutions for these issues. For more information, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 914798](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/914798).

**Why are no updated files applied to the system after installing this update?**

For Windows XP Service Pack 1 systems, this update sets the service discretionary access control list (DACL) to the same settings as Windows XP Service Pack 2. For Windows 2003 with no service pack installed, this update sets the selected service DACLs to Windows 2003 Service Pack 1 settings. These configuration changes are made by the installation program, and no system files are updated as a result of applying this security update.

**Will I be able to uninstall this update?**

Since no system files are modified as a result of applying this update, this update cannot be removed.  For Windows 2003 with no service pack installed and Windows XP SP1 systems, this update sets the selected service DACLs to Windows 2003 SP1 and Windows XP SP2 settings. These configuration changes are made by the installation program, and no system files are updated as a result of applying this security update. However the changes can be reverted using system utilities. To learn more about removing and restoring the DACL configuration changes made by this update please see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 914798](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/914798).

**Does this update contain any security-related changes to functionality?**

Yes. In addition to the services listed in the âVulnerability Detailsâ section of the bulletin, the update also modifies the DACLs for the service and service registry keys listed in the table below for additional defense-in-depth protection. These additional services and service registry keys set the DACLs for the services listed below to the same as Windows XP Service Pack 2 on Windows XP Service Pack 1 systems, and Windows 2003 Service Pack 1 on Windows 2003 systems with no service pack applied. For additional information on these and other service and registry key DACLs changes included with this update, see, [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 914798](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/914798).

## Vulnerability Details

#### Permissive Windows Services DACLs could allow elevation of privilege - CVE-2006-0023

A [privilege elevation](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21142) vulnerability exists on Windows XP Service Pack 1 on the identified Windows services where the permissions are set by default to a level that may allow a low-privileged user to change properties associated with the service. On Windows 2003 permissions on the identified services are set to a level that may allow a user that belongs to the network configuration operators group to change properties associated with the service. Only members of the Network Configuration Operators group on the targeted machine can remotely attack Windows Server 2003, and this group contains no users by default. The vulnerability could allow a user with valid logon credentials to take complete control of the system on Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 1.

#### Mitigating Factors for Permissive Windows Services DACLs could allow elevation of privilege - CVE-2006-0023

* An attacker must have valid logon credentials to be able to exploit this vulnerability. The vulnerability could not be exploited by anonymous users.
* Four of the six services identified (NetBT, SCardSvr, DHCP, DnsCache) require an attacker to already be running in a privileged security context. Additionally, the two services, SSDPSRV and UPNPHost, which allow an authenticated user to attack a vulnerable system are only vulnerable on Windows XP Service Pack 1.

#### Workarounds for Vulnerability in Windows Services DACLs could result in elevation of privilege - CVE-2006-0023:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. The identified workarounds change the default DACLs on Windows XP Service Pack 1 and on Windows Server to the enhanced security DACLs that are used on Windows XP Service Pack 2 and on Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1. Therefore, these workarounds are considered complete solutions to this issue. Because the recommended access controls have been shipping with the latest operating systems for some time, they are anticipated to constitute low risk. However, any DACL change carries some risk of application incompatibility.

* **Use the sc.exe command to set modified access controls for the identified services:**

  **Note** You must run the **sc.exe** command as a privileged user. You can run this command by using a computer startup script or by using an SMS script. By running this command, you increase the security of the DACLs so that they are at the same level as Windows XP Service Pack 2 and Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1. For more information about the **sc.exe** command and about how to set DACLs for Windows services, see the following [Microsoft Product Documentation](https://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/sc.mspx). This mitigation does not require that you restart the computer.

  **For Windows XP Service Pack 1, run each of the following commands. Each command changes the DACL on the associated affected service.**

  **sc** sdset ssdpsrv D:(A;;CCDCLCSWRPWPDTLOCRSDRCWDWO;;;SY)(A;;CCDCLCSWRPWPDTLOCRSDRCWDWO;;;BA)(A;;CCLCSWRPWPDTLOCRRC;;;PU)(A;;CCDCLCSWRPWPDTLOCRSDRCWDWO;;;SO)(A;;CCLCSWRPLORC;;;AU)(A;;RPWPDTRC;;;LS)

  **For Windows Server 2003 ,run each of the following commands. Each command changes the DACL on the associated affected service.**

  **sc** sdset netbt D:(A;;CCLCSWLOCRRC;;;AU)(A;;CCLCSWRPLOCRRC;;;PU)(A;;CCDCLCSWRPWPDTLOCRSDRCWDWO;;;BA)(A;;CCDCLCSWRPWPDTLOCRSDRCWDWO;;;SO)(A;;CCLCSWRPWPDTLOCRRC;;;SY)(A;;DT;;;LS)(A;;DT;;;NS)(A;;CCLCSWRPLOCRRC;;;NO)S:(AU;FA;CCDCLCSWRPWPDTLOCRSDRCWDWO;;;WD)

  **Note** For Windows Server 2003 ,NetBT, DnsCache, and DHCP are the only identified affected services. In the Windows Server 2003 scenario, an attack must be launched by a member of the Network Configuration Operators group. This group is empty by default.

  **Impact of Workaround:** None
* **Use Group Policy to deploy modified access controls for the identified services.**

  Domain administrators can use Group Policy and the security templates to deploy modified access controls to Windows XP Service Pack 1 systems. For more information about how to implement security templates by using Group Policy, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 816585](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/816585). You do not have to restart the computer to complete this mitigation.

  **For Windows XP Service Pack 1, use the following security template to modify the Upnphost, SCardSvr, SSDPSRV, DnsCache, and DHCP services.**

  **Note** For Windows XP Service Pack 1 and Windows Server 2003 ,changing the service DACLs on the NetBT service is not supported by using the Microsoft Group Policy Object Editor. Therefore, the NetBT service DACL change is not included in the security template for Windows Server 2003.

  **Note** For Windows Server 2003 ,NetBT, DHCP, and DnsCache are the only identified affected services. In the Windows Server 2003 scenario, a member of the Network Configuration Operators group must launch an attack. This group is empty by default and is rarely populated.

  **Impact of Workaround:** In addition to setting the Services DACLs the same as those for Windows XP Service Pack 2, the security template that is provided sets the service startup type for the affected service to its original default configuration of âAutomatic.â Because Windows Server 2003 the supports the ability to configure startup type settings, the startup type is unchanged for Windows Server 2003.
* **Modify the Windows registry to modify access controls for each of the identified services.**

  The preferred method of service modification is by using the **sc.exe** command. However, you can use the following command to modify the security DACLs of the affected services to the same level as Windows XP Service Pack 2. Users are encouraged to back up the registry before they make any modifications. For more information about registry scripts and about how to modify the Windows registry, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 214752](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/214752).

#### FAQ for Permissive Windows Services DACLs could allow elevation of privilege - CVE-2006-0023

**What is the scope of this vulnerability?**

This is a [privilege elevation](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21142) vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could change the default binary that is associated with the affected services. Then an attacker could stop and restart the services to run a malicious program or binary. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

On Windows XP Service Pack 1, permissions on the identified Windows services are set by default to a level that may allow a low-privileged user to change properties that are associated with the service. On Windows Server 2003, permissions on the identified services are set to a level that may allow a user who belongs to the Network Configuration Operators group to change properties that are associated with the service.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

By changing the default associated program that is set to run by an identified service, a low-privileged user may be able run commands or executables that would normally require higher privileged access.

**Who could exploit the vulnerability?**

To try to exploit the vulnerability, an attacker must have valid logon credentials to the affected system.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would first need valid logon credentials to the affected system. An attacker could then access the affected component and run a standard application that could exploit the vulnerability and gain complete control over the affected system.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations and servers are both at risk from this vulnerability.

**Are Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition, or Windows Millennium Edition critically affected by this vulnerability?**

No. Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition, and Windows Millennium Edition do not contain the affected components.

**Is Windows 2000 affected by this vulnerability?**

Scenarios have been identified that involve members of the Power User administrative group, but such users should be considered trusted users who have extensive privileges and the ability to change computer-wide settings. For more information about rights that are associated with the Power Users administrative group, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 825069](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/825069). Windows 2000 may become vulnerable if third-party application code is installed that adds services that have overly-permissive access controls.

**How do I determine if a third party application is affected?**

Users are encouraged to contact their third-party software vendors whose products require services installation to determine if any non-default Windows services are affected\*\*.\*\* Software developers are encouraged to visit [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 914392](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/914392) for additional information and best practices on how to apply secure access controls to services.

**Could the vulnerability be exploited over the Internet?**

No. An attacker must have valid logon credentials to the specific system that is targeted for attack.

**What does the update do?**

The update changes the default DACLs on Windows XP Service Pack 1 and on Windows Server to the enhanced security DACLs that are used on Windows XP Service Pack 2 and Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

Yes. This vulnerability has been publicly disclosed. It has been assigned Common Vulnerability and Exposure number [CVE-2006-0023](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=can-2006-0023).

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had seen examples of proof of concept code published publicly but had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

#### Windows Server 2003

**Prerequisites**

This security update requires a release version of Windows Server 2003.

**Inclusion in Future Service Packs:**

The update for this issue is included Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1.

**Installation Information**

This security update supports the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/help** | Displays the command-line options |
| Setup Modes |  |
| **/passive** | Unattended Setup mode. No user interaction is required, but installation status is displayed. If a restart is required at the end of Setup, a dialog box will be presented to the user with a timer warning that the computer will restart in 30 seconds. |
| **/quiet** | Quiet mode. This is the same as unattended mode, but no status or error messages are displayed. |
| Restart Options |  |
| **/norestart** | Does not restart when installation has completed |
| **/forcerestart** | Restarts the computer after installation and force other applications to close at shutdown without saving open files first. |
| **/warnrestart[:x]** | Presents a dialog box with a timer warning the user that the computer will restart in *x* seconds. (The default setting is 30 seconds.) Intended for use with the **/quiet** switch or the **/passive** switch. |
| **/promptrestart** | Display a dialog box prompting the local user to allow a restart |
| Special Options |  |
| **/overwriteoem** | Overwrites OEM files without prompting |
| **/nobackup** | Does not back up files needed for uninstall |
| **/forceappsclose** | Forces other programs to close when the computer shuts down |

Advisory Version: 2.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

Microsoft issued a security bulletin summary for March 2006 which
contained two security advisories: MS06-011 and MS06-012. Microsoft
also
released an update for MS06-011 on June 13, 2006. The advisories
describe vulnerabilities in various Microsoft Windows Operating Systems.
A
description of the vulnerabilities can
be found at:

* <http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms06-mar.mspx>

Certain Avaya products utilize Microsoft Operating Systems and may be
affected by these vulnerabilities.
## 2. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose Operating
Systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying
Operating
System or applications which come with the Operating System. These
vulnerabilities often do not impact the software-only product directly
but may
threaten the integrity of the underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not
affected by
these vulnerabilities directly but the underlying Microsoft platform may
be impacted. For affected Microsoft Operating Systems, Microsoft
recommends
installing patches. Detailed instructions for patching the Operating
System are given by Microsoft at the following links:

## 4. Recommended Actions:

Avaya recommends that the Microsoft patches and/or workaround
solutions are
applied for the vulnerability outlined in the above system product
table.
Although certain Avaya system products utilize Microsoft Operating
Systems and
may be affected by these vulnerabilities, Avaya recommends that the use
of
e-mail clients and Internet browsers be restricted on Avaya system
products
(i.e. Outlook Express and Internet Explorer). The use of browsers should
be
restricted to authorized users-only as well as limited to the
operational-needs
of the product. Unrestricted access to the Intranet or Internet should
be
prohibited beyond the necessary functions of the product's web
administration
interface and to obtaining patches. This reduces the risk of
vulnerabilities in
these applications.

products
is below:

**MS06-011** [Permissive Windows Services DACLs Could Allow Elevation of Privilege
(914798)](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS06-011.mspx):
A vulnerability has been discovered in Windows XP SP1 and Windows 2003

could allow for an attacker which is already validated as a member of
the
Network Configuration Operators group on the targeted machine to take
complete

## Microsoft Windows privilege escalation vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#953860

Original Release Date: 2006-02-08 | Last Revised: 2006-04-21

---

### Overview

Microsoft Windows access controls may be improperly configured potentially allowing a local attacker to gain elevated privileges on a vulnerable system.

### Description

| Microsoft Windows provides numerous, fine grained permissions and privileges to control access to Windows components, such as services, files, and registry entries.  Recent [research](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~sudhakar/papers/winval.pdf) has uncovered insecure configurations within user accounts and groups on Microsoft Windows systems. These configurations may allow local attackers to gain access to, and manipulate system resources. The researchers have developed a model that analyzes permissions to expose privilege escalation vulnerabilities. The research focused on three particular components of the Windows architecture:**Services**Windows services may be installed and configured with unnecessary privileges. This may allow a lesser privileged user to access and change the settings for a service that runs with greater privileges. Of particular concern are the following privileges: The SERVICE\_CHANGE\_CONFIG access right allows a user to change the a service's configuration. This includes the executable that services launches and the user account with which a service runs as. According to Microsoft, "Because this grants the caller the right to change the executable file that the system runs, it should be granted only to administrators." The SERVICE\_ALL\_ACCESS access right allows a user full control over a service. **Files and Directories**Any privileges that allow the contents of a file or a directory to be modified should be granted to only trusted users. The following access rights a of particular concern:The FILE\_ALL\_ACCESS access right allows a user to completely control a file, including read, write and execute privileges.The FILE\_APPEND\_DATA access right allows a user to add data to a file.The FILE\_WRITE\_DATA access right allows a user to write and rewrite data to a file.**Registry Keys**Users with KEY\_SET\_VALUE permissions can modify registry keys that specify executables, DLLs, and/or Globally Unique Identifiers (GUIDs).The WRITE\_DAC access right provides the ability to modify the access control list for a resource. Users granted this right have the ability to change the way they, or other users, access a resource. This may allow attackers to grant themselves, or others arbitrary permissions over a resource.Note that these issues can affect all software that is developed for the Microsoft Windows platform. Known Windows services that have weak permissions include, but may not belimited to     + Microsoft SSDP Discovery service (SSDPSRV) + NetBios over TCP/IP service (NetBT) + Smart Card service (SCardSvr) + Universal Plug and Play Device Host service (upnphost) + DNS Client service (Dnscache) + DHCP Client service (Dhcp) |
| --- |

### Impact

| A local user with valid login credentials may be able gain elevated privileges on a vulnerable Windows system.We are aware of publicly available exploit code that claims to be a tool to identify vulnerable services. Installing and running this code may allow a remote attacker to gain access to a system. |
| --- |

### Solution

| These issues are corrected in Service Pack 2 for Microsoft Windows XP and Service Pack 1 for Microsoft Windows Server 2003. In addition, Microsoft Security Advisory [914457](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/advisory/914457.mspx) and Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS06-011](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS06-011.mspx) contain numerous workarounds to mitigate these vulnerabilities. |
