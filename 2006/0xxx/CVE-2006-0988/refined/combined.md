# DOMAIN NAME SERVERS: PERVASIVE AND CRITICAL, YET OFTEN OVERLOOKED

## The Measurement Factory DNS SurveyExecutive Summary

The Measurement Factory has conducted two surveys of Internet-connected
domain name servers (DNS) on behalf of [Infoblox](http://www.infoblox.com). The surveys
consisted of several queries directed at each of a large set of
external DNS servers to estimate the number of systems deployed
today and determine specific configuration details.

The survey results revealed that many organizations often disregard
these critical systems, which perform the functions necessary to
make their presence available and accessible on the Internet. The
Internet Systems Consortium's BIND software, which performs the
domain name resolution function, is often out of date, opening the
door to malicious attacks. And, the systems are sometimes
mis-configured, potentially compromising network availability.

Following is a summary of the significant survey results:

* There are an estimated 7.5 million external DNS servers on the public Internet* Over 75% domain name servers (of roughly 1.3 million sampled)
    allow recursive name service to arbitrary queriers. This opens a
    name server to both cache poisoning and denial of service attacks.* Over 40% allow zone transfers from arbitrary queriers. This
      exposes a name server to denial of service attacks and gives attackers
      information about internal networks.* In almost 33% of the cases, all authoritative name
        servers for a zone were on the /24 same subnetwork. This leaves
        network open to accidental and deliberate denial of service attacks.* Only 60% of the name server records delegating each zone matched
          the intrazone name server records . Mis-matched records may decrease
          the number of servers available for resolution, reduce redundancy,
          increase load, and leave a zone susceptible to denial of service
          attacks.* 57% run the most recent, secure versions of BIND (9.x):

            | BIND 9.3, 9.2, 9.1 | 57% |
            | --- | --- |
            | BIND 8.3, 8.2, 8.1 | 20% |
            | Windows 2000 | 6.5% |
            | Windows 2003 | 3.5% |
            | Other | 13% |
