How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Debian Security Advisory DSA 956-1                     security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                             Martin Schulze
January 26th, 2006                      <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : lsh-utils
Vulnerability  : filedescriptor leak
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2006-0353
Debian Bug     : 349303

Stefan Pfetzing discovered that lshd, a Secure Shell v2 (SSH2)
protocol server, leaks a couple of file descriptors, related to the
randomness generator, to user shells which are started by lshd.  A
local attacker can truncate the server's seed file, which may prevent
the server from starting, and with some more effort, maybe also crack
session keys.

After applying this update, you should remove the server's seed file
(/var/spool/lsh/yarrow-seed-file) and then regenerate it with
"lsh-make-seed --server" as root.

For security reasons, lsh-make-seed really needs to be run from the
console of the system you are running it on.  If you run lsh-make-seed
using a remote shell, the timing information lsh-make-seed uses for
its random seed creation is likely to be screwed.  If need be, you can
generate the random seed on a different system than that which it will
eventually be on, by installing the lsh-utils package and running
"lsh-make-seed -o my-other-server-seed-file".  You may then transfer
the seed to the destination system as using a secure connection.

The old stable distribution (woody) may not be affected by this problem.

For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.1-3sarge1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.1cdbs-4.

We recommend that you upgrade your lsh-server package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
