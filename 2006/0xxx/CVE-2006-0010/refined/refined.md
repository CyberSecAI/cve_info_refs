{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the way Microsoft Windows processes embedded web fonts, specifically within the T2EMBED.DLL library. The vulnerability occurs due to a lack of validation on the size of compressed embedded web fonts. The size is read from the font data itself, and an attacker can manipulate this value.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap-based buffer overflow",
      "Insufficient input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the vulnerable application, potentially leading to complete system compromise.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Visiting a malicious web page containing a specially crafted embedded web font",
      "Opening a specially crafted HTML email containing a malicious embedded web font",
      "Compromised web sites or advertisements hosting malicious content"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious embedded web font and host it on a webpage or include it in an email. They also need to persuade a user to visit the page or open the email."
  },
  "affected_systems": [
    "Windows 98",
    "Windows 98 Second Edition",
    "Windows ME",
    "Windows NT",
    "Windows 2000",
     "Windows XP SP1",
     "Windows XP SP2",
     "Windows Server 2003 SP0",
     "Windows Server 2003 SP1"
  ],
  "additional_notes": "The vulnerability is triggered when Windows attempts to uncompress a malformed Embedded Open Type (EOT) font, where the font data is compressed using Agfa MicroType Express format. The lack of validation occurs in the `MTX_LZCOMP_UnPackMemory` function within T2EMBED.DLL, where the size of the buffer allocated is not validated against the actual size of the decompressed data, leading to a heap overflow. The advisory also mentions that although .eot is the typical extension, any extension can be used for this exploit."
