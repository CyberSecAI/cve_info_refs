  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A NULL pointer dereference occurs when writing a 2 or 4 channel JPEG image, or a 2 channel TGA image to a scalar.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "NULL pointer dereference"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service (segmentation fault).",
    "attack_vectors": "User-assisted attackers can trigger the vulnerability by providing a specially crafted image to the application. If the library is used to process images from remote sources, this problem can be exploited to perform a DoS attack.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to provide the application with a 2 or 4 channel JPEG image, or a 2 channel TGA image.",
    "more_info": "The issue occurs when the Imager library attempts to write specific image types to a scalar. This vulnerability existed since at least Imager 0.41"
