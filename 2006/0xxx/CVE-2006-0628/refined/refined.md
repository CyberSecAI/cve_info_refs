Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the MyQuiz script not properly sanitizing the `$ENV{'PATH_INFO'}` variable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Arbitrary Shell Command Execution:** The lack of sanitization allows an attacker to inject shell commands directly into the `$ENV{'PATH_INFO'}` variable.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **System Access:** Successful exploitation could grant the attacker full system access on the server where the vulnerable script is hosted.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request:** The attack vector is through a specially crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable script (`myquiz.pl`).
*   **Path manipulation**: By appending `/ask/;command|` to the URL the attacker injects commands to be executed by the server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable `myquiz.pl` script.
*   No special privileges are needed to execute the attack besides the ability to send HTTP requests.

**Additional Information:**
* The vulnerability was discovered by Aliaksandr Hartsuyeu of eVuln.com
*  A patch was released by the vendor, which involved implementing input validation to ensure that only valid data is passed to the script.
*  The vendor responded within minutes of being notified of the vulnerability.
