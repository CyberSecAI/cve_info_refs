    "related_content": true,
    "summary": "The Cisco Security Monitoring, Analysis and Response System (CS-MARS) software contains a default password for an undocumented administrative account, allowing attackers to gain full administrative privileges.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "A hidden, default administrative account with a pre-set password is included in CS-MARS software.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Hardcoded credentials",
        "Undocumented administrative account"

      "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain full administrative privileges on the CS-MARS device.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "Local access",
         "Remote access"

      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to authenticate to the CS-MARS command line interface using the 'pnadmin' account. After that, they can access the 'root' account using the undocumented 'expert' command with the default password."

       "affected_products": [
        "All versions of CS-MARS prior to version 4.1.3"

    "additional_details": "The vulnerability is a design flaw, not a software bug. Cisco made free software available to address this vulnerability. CS-MARS version 4.1.3 and later provides a method to modify the root password, mitigating the risk. Upgrading to version 4.1.3 and using the 'passwd expert' command is recommended."
