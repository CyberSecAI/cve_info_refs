The problem occurs during exit processing when a task has
done a pfm_context_create() (and pfm_smpl_buffer_alloc()).

To trigger the problem requires:
 - that the task be interrupted (so that it does not unmap its smpl buffer)
 - that there is another process accessing its mm_struct

At exit:
  - sets its task->mm to null
  - calls mmput(). But the task's vmas are not unmapped because the mm_users
    count is still 1
    though pfm_flush() is unable to unmap the buffer vma, but it does
    "put" the buffer pages when it frees the kernel mapping (vm_struct).
  - closes the pfm file with pfm_flush() and pfm_close(), which un-reserve
    the smpl buffer pages, but the buffer vma is not released.

When that external task does the final mmput() on this mm_struct,
  the sampling buffer's vma is unmapped. This does the second put on its
  pages and trips the BUG_ON(page_count(p) == 0) in put_page_testzero(p)

This patch maintains a list of active pfm tasks and their mm_structs.
The list allows pfm_flush() to locate the exiting task's mm_struct so that
it can unmap the vma.
(this could be done without a list, but would require another field in the
 task_struct)
(this fix is not necessary for Stephane Eranian's perfmon2)

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.
