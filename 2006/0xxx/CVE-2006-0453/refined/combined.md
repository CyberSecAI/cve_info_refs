How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=179135#c0)  Rich Megginson    2006-01-27 16:55:30 UTC  ``` There are many places in our code where we assume that if ber_scanf returns an error, this means it did not allocate any memory.  That is not the case.  ber_get_stringa first reads the length, then allocates the memory to read into, then does the actual reading.  If it receives an error from ber_read while reading the buffer, it will short circuit and return with an allocated (but uninitialized) buffer that must be freed by the caller. ber_get_stringal does not have this problem, but suffers from a different problem which will be addressed in the ldap sdk. There is a similar problem with using ber_scanf 'v' or 'V' to read in arrays.  However, in that case, cleanup is problematic due to a bug in the ldap sdk - after allocating space for the array, we do not set the array element (the string) to NULL, so if we try to free it, we get a free of uninitialized memory.  This will also be fixed in the ldap sdk.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=179135#c1)  Rich Megginson    2006-01-27 17:23:57 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 123783](attachment.cgi?id=123783 "files for fix") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=123783&action=edit "files for fix") files for fix   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=179135#c2)  Rich Megginson    2006-01-27 17:24:20 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 123784](attachment.cgi?id=123784 "diffs for fix") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=123784&action=edit "diffs for fix") diffs for fix   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=179135#c3)  Mark J.

Files: <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/attachment.cgi?id=123783> Branch: HEAD Fix Description:  <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=179135#c0> I basically did a search through our code for all calls to ber_scanf,  ber_get_stringa, and ber_get_stringal and made sure we properly free any  arguments that may have been allocated.  There was a bug in the ldapsdk  <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=179135> that causes  us to free uninitialized memory when trying to clean up the result of  ber_get_stringal (or ber_scanf with 'V').  I had to initialize some  variables to NULL so that we could properly clean them up, and added  some additional clean ups that were missing.  Also, in repl_extop.c, we  were calling free on an array that we should have been calling  ch_array_free on.  Yet another lesson in the evils of slapi_ch_free and  disabling compiler type checks in general. Platforms tested: Fedora Core 4 Flag Day: no Doc impact: no   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=179135#c6)  To Ngan    2006-04-04 17:03:38 UTC  ``` Ran various iterations of Rich's ber test script (Thanks a lot Rich!).  Verified against DS 7.1 SP2 20060314.1 and DS 6.21 SP3 20060310.1.  20k loop runs in addition to 100k loop runs didn't show significant memory usage increase against the above candidate builds.  Note that 100k runs took about 3 weeks to complete, while 20k took about 2 days.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=179135#c9)  Orla Hegarty    2006-05-26 17:50:05 UTC  ``` Somehow the errata system did not automatically close these bugs even though DS SP 2 is shipped and available live on RHN   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=179135#c10)  Orla Hegarty    2006-05-26 17:53:26 UTC  ``` trying to manually close   ``` |  |
