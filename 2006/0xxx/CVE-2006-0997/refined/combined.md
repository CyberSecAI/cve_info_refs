KB 7004507

# SSL Allows the use of Weak Ciphers.

* **Document ID:***7004507*
* **Creation Date:**23-Sep-2009
* **Modified Date:**16-Jul-2019
* + **Micro Focus Products:**eDirectoryNetWareOpen Enterprise Server

## Environment

 Novell Open Enterprise Server (OES)
 Novell NetWare 6.5

## Situation

 SSL Allows the use of Weak Ciphers.
 SSL Server Allows Cleartext Communication Vulnerability port 443/tcp over SSL
 SSL Server Supports Weak Encryption Vulnerability port 443/tcp over SSL
 SSL Server May Be Forced to Use Weak Encryption Vulnerability port 443/tcp over SSL
 The Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol allows for secure communication between a client and a server.
The client-server communication is generally encrypted using a symmetric cipher such as RC2, RC4, DES or 3DES.

Some implementations of SSL allow for weak cipher communication.

Technically it is encryption but with a NULL key, so the various checks go through the exact same code path as the standard higher encryption ciphers.
When the SSL session starts, the client (in most cases, a browser) sends the list of ciphers and compression algorithms.
This list, by default, does not send any NULL encryption ciphers.
However some browsers will allow you to configure it to send NULL encryption ciphers by default.

NOTE:

Some ways to verify if a port is allowing weak ciphers.  This is useful if detection software shows a fault positive.

openssl s\_client -connect <ipaddress:port> -ssl2 -state
EX:  openssl s\_client -connect 192.168.1.100:443 -ssl2 -state

openssl s\_client -connect <ipaddress:port> -cipher LOW -state
EX: openssl s\_client -connect 192.168.1.100:443 -cipher LOW -state

## Resolution

 NILE.NLM has been modified so that strong ciphers are preferred over weak ciphers by default during SSL handshakes.

The updated version of NILE.NLM is available for download in NILE65SP5A.EXE.

## Additional Information

 Each of the vulnerabilities and their associated CVE numbers are listed below:

CVE- 2006- 0997 - SSL Server Allows Cleartext Communication Vulnerability port 443/tcp over SSL
CVE- 2006- 0998 - SSL Server Supports Weak Encryption Vulnerability port 443/tcp over SSL
CVE- 2006- 0999 - SSL Server May Be Forced to Use Weak Encryption Vulnerability port 443/tcp over SSL
 In order to revert back to allowing weak ciphers it is necessary to modify the SYS:\ETC\NILE.CFG and enter the following:
[WeakCrypto]
Enabled=Y|N

NOTE: After modifying the settings in the SYS:\ETC\NILE.CFG file it is necessary to restart the server to have the changes take effect.
 SSL Digger by Foundstone was used to test this vulnerability.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
