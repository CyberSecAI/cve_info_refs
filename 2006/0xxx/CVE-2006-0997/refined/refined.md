Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2006-0997:

**CVE-2006-0997:** SSL Server Allows Cleartext Communication Vulnerability port 443/tcp over SSL

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that some SSL implementations allow for weak cipher communication, effectively allowing cleartext communication despite using SSL. This occurs because the encryption can be done with a NULL key.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Cleartext Communication:** The primary vulnerability is that the server allows communication using NULL encryption ciphers, resulting in cleartext communication over SSL, which is intended to be secure.
- **Weak Ciphers:** The server's support for weak ciphers, such as RC2, RC4, DES or 3DES, makes it vulnerable to attacks that can break these ciphers relatively easily. While these are not directly related to cleartext, they contribute to a lack of secure communication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker can intercept and read the communication between the client and the server, as the data is not properly encrypted. This leads to a loss of confidentiality.
- **Data Manipulation:** If an attacker can intercept and decrypt data, they can also potentially manipulate the data before relaying it to either the client or server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** An attacker positioned between the client and server can intercept the communication.
- **Cipher Downgrade Attack:** An attacker may attempt to force the server to use weaker encryption algorithms.
- **Direct Connection:** If the browser is configured to send NULL ciphers, the client can trigger the vulnerability by establishing a connection using them.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Position:** The attacker needs to be in a network position to intercept communication between the client and server (MitM).
- **Technical Knowledge:** An attacker needs knowledge of how to exploit SSL/TLS vulnerabilities and use tools to initiate connections and test cipher suites.
- **Client Configuration (In some cases):** In some scenarios, the attacker might have to force a client to use a weak cipher or NULL encryption which might require control over the client.

**Additional Information:**
- **Affected Products:** Novell Open Enterprise Server (OES) and Novell NetWare 6.5 are mentioned as affected products.
- **Mitigation:** The vulnerability was addressed by modifying `NILE.NLM` to prefer strong ciphers.  An updated version of `NILE.NLM` is available for download in `NILE65SP5A.EXE`.
- **Configuration:** It is possible to revert to allowing weak ciphers by modifying the `SYS:\ETC\NILE.CFG` file.
- **Testing:** Tools like `openssl s_client` and SSL Digger were used to test this vulnerability.

The content from support.novell.com provides more detail than the CVE description itself, outlining specific products, configuration details, and testing methods. The information clearly explains that a "cleartext communication" vulnerability exists when a NULL key is negotiated in the SSL handshake.
