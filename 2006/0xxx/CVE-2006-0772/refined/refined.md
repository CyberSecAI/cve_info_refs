Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2006-0772:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in the Hitachi Business Logic - Container. Specifically, the "extended receiving box function" is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) and SQL injection attacks because it does not perform necessary escape processing on external API parameters.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-site scripting (XSS):**  A malicious user can inject client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
- **SQL injection:** A malicious user can insert arbitrary SQL commands through input fields, potentially leading to unauthorized data access or modification.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **XSS:** Execution of arbitrary scripts in the context of other users' browsers. This can lead to data theft, session hijacking, and defacement.
- **SQL injection:** Execution of arbitrary SQL commands on the backend database, which can result in data disclosure, modification, or deletion. This could also allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote attack vectors. The vulnerabilities are exploited through the "extended receiving box function" of the Hitachi Business Logic - Container, likely via web-based interfaces or API calls.
- The specific method involves sending malicious input via external API parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- A remote attacker is needed to exploit the vulnerabilities.
- The attacker needs to be able to send malicious input to the application through API or web interfaces to trigger the XSS and SQL injection vulnerabilities.

**Additional Information:**
- Hitachi Business Logic Container versions: P-2443-9114 (02-03 to 03-00-/B) and P-9S43-9111 (03-00 to 03-00-/B) are affected
- Fixed versions are 03-01 for Windows and 03-01 for Linux
- The vulnerability exists because BLC does not perform internal escape processing on external API parameters.
- Users of the affected software are required to implement their own escape processing for security if they use the BLC API.
- The affected product is also part of Electronic Form Workflow product sets.
