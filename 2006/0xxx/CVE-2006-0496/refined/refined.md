Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the `-moz-binding` CSS property in Mozilla Firefox, which allows associating Extensible Binding Language (XBL) files with HTML elements. The core issue is that the same-origin policy was not enforced when loading XBL files via CSS. This allowed an attacker to load an XBL file from a different domain, which could then execute JavaScript with full access to the content of the victim's page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary weakness is the ability to execute arbitrary JavaScript from a different domain through XBL bindings. This allows an attacker to perform XSS attacks.
*   **Lack of Same-Origin Policy:** The absence of a same-origin check when loading XBL files from CSS is the key vulnerability that enables the XSS.
*   **Unrestricted JavaScript Execution:** XBL files can contain JavaScript code, which runs with the full privileges of the web page, including access to cookies, the DOM, and other sensitive information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Theft:** An attacker can steal cookies, session tokens, and other sensitive data from the user's browser.
*   **DOM Manipulation:** An attacker can modify the content and behavior of the web page, potentially leading to phishing attacks or other malicious actions.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By injecting malicious JavaScript, an attacker can execute arbitrary code within the user's browser.
*   **Complete compromise of the webpage** The attacker can modify the page content, redirect the user, or steal sensitive user information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **CSS Injection:** An attacker can inject a style tag or attribute with the `-moz-binding` property that points to a malicious XBL file hosted on a different domain.
*   **Third-party CSS Hosting:** Sites that allow users to host CSS files offsite (e.g., LiveJournal) are especially vulnerable because attackers can inject malicious CSS with XBL bindings.
*   **HTML Injection:** Attackers who can inject arbitrary HTML can include a style tag with a malicious `-moz-binding` attribute.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to inject CSS:**  An attacker needs to find a way to inject a style tag with a malicious `-moz-binding` attribute into the target web page. This can happen if a web application allows users to provide user-generated content, if an attacker controls a third-party stylesheet, or in other ways.
*   **Hosting an XBL file:** The attacker needs to host a malicious XBL file containing the exploit code on a domain they control.
*   **No user interaction required:** Once a page is loaded, the XBL binding will be executed without the need for user interaction.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The provided example demonstrates how to use the `-moz-binding` property within a `<style>` tag to associate an element with a remote XBL file.
*   The malicious XBL file contains JavaScript code within the `<constructor>` tag, which gets executed when the binding is loaded.
*   The bug report mentions the possibility of using `javascript:` URLs in CSS to trigger JavaScript execution, highlighting another XSS attack vector.
*   The discussion in the bug report also notes that Internet Explorer had similar issues with CSS expressions and external stylesheets.
*   The discussion in the comments suggests that a potential fix is to implement a same-origin check when loading XBL files via CSS, which was eventually implemented.

**Mitigation (from bug report):**

*  The vulnerability was fixed by implementing a same-origin check for XBL files loaded via CSS, as well as loading the XBL file in a more restricted scope. This prevents malicious XBL files from accessing resources or information on the page if the XBL file's origin does not match the page origin.
