{
  "CVE-2006-0046": {
    "Description": "squid_redirect script in adzapper before 2006-01-29 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a URL with a large number of trailing / (forward slashes), which might produce inefficient regular expressions.",
    "Root cause": "The squid_redirect script within adzapper used inefficient regular expressions when processing URLs containing a large number of trailing forward slashes.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Inefficient regular expressions processing"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service (DoS) due to excessive CPU consumption. The server becomes unresponsive, effectively making the squid proxy unusable.",
    "Attack vectors": "Remote attackers can cause a denial of service by sending a crafted URL with many trailing forward slashes to the vulnerable adzapper via the squid proxy.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests through the squid proxy. No authentication is required.",
    "Additional details": "The bug report indicates that on a Pentium 1 200MHz machine, processing a crafted URL would cause squid_redirect to take approximately 8 hours to return to a normal state. Even on a Pentium 4 2.8GHz machine, it would take several minutes."
