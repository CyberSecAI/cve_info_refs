Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a failure in the `index.php` script of the Oi! Email Marketing 3.0 application to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries. This allows for SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability in the login page of the application. The application fails to sanitize user input (username and password) before using it in SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Compromise of the Application:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the application.
- **Disclosure or Modification of Data:** The attacker can read, modify, or delete sensitive data stored in the database.
- **Exploitation of Underlying Database Implementation:** An attacker could potentially leverage the SQL injection to exploit vulnerabilities in the database system itself.
- **Disclosure of FTP Password:** By exploiting the SQL injection and logging in as a super administrator, an attacker could access the server's FTP password which is present in the configuration section of the application's source code, hidden by asterisks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the login page of the application, located at `http://www.site.com/oi/index.php`.
- The attacker manipulates the username and password fields in the login form to inject malicious SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have network access to the application's login page.
- The attacker needs to know or guess a valid username (e.g. admin), or be able to create one.
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious SQL injection string.
- The attacker needs the ability to view the page source code after logging in.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was discovered by Illuminatus and h4cky0u of h4cky0u Security Forums.
- The vendor was contacted but did not respond.
- The advisory mentions that the ftp password is hidden in the source code, and can be discovered after logging in as a super admin.
