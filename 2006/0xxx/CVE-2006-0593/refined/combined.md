How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

4. Couple of minor fixes
[![Couple of minor fixes](../../infusions/news/news_cats/bugs.svg)](../../infusions/news/news_cats/bugs.svg)**This morning I received information about an XSS exploit in the shoutbox. A user can plant malicious code via the shout\_name field. Knowing my code, I immediatey knew the same trick can be done in comments. Two fixes then which are comments\_include.php and shoutbox\_panel.php. Existing v6.00.303 users can download the file '6.00.304 update for v6.00.303'. Simply upload the inluded files and click upgrade under System Admin. The Sourceforge packages have also been updated as usual. Thanks to Ruyn for the heads up ![smile](../../images/smiley/smile.png)

**Feb 11 2006 @ 19:30 Update** I've been informed of a weakness in the $srch\_text variable in [messages.php](http://www.php-fusion.co.uk/infusions/cvs/view_file.php?file_id=27). I've added the updated file to the 304 patch and have updated the Sourceforge packages. Thanks to system\_meltdown for letting me know.

[Download PHPFusion 6.00.304 Update for v6.00.303](http://www.php-fusion.co.uk/downloads.php?cat_id=3) (5Kb).**
