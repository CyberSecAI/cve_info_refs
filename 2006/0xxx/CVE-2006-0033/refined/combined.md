### General Information

## Executive Summary

**Executive Summary:**

This update resolves two newly discovered, privately reported vulnerabilities. Each vulnerability is documented in its own "Vulnerability Details" section in this bulletin.

On vulnerable versions of Office, if a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the client workstation. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

We recommend that customers apply the update immediately.

**Severity Ratings and Vulnerability Identifiers:**

| Vulnerability Identifiers | Impact of Vulnerability | Microsoft Office 2003 | Microsoft Project 2003 | Microsoft OneNote 2003 | Microsoft FrontPage 2003 | Microsoft Office XP | Microsoft Office 2000 | Microsoft Project 2002 | Microsoft Project 2000 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Microsoft Office Remote Code Execution Using a Malformed PNG Vulnerability - [CVE-2006-0033](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2006-0033) | Remote Code Execution | Important | Important | Important | Important | Important | Critical | Important | Not Applicable |
| Microsoft Office Remote Code Execution Using a Malformed GIF Vulnerability - [CVE-2006-0007](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2006-0007) | Remote Code Execution | Moderate | Moderate | Moderate | Moderate | Moderate | Moderate | Moderate | Moderate |
| **Aggregate Severity of All Vulnerabilities** |  | **Important** | **Important** | **Important** | **Important** | **Important** | **Critical** | **Important** | **Moderate** |

**Note** The severity ratings for Microsoft Works Suite maps to the Microsoft Word versions as follows:

* The Microsoft Works Suite 2004, 2005, and 2006 severity rating is the same as the Microsoft Office XP severity rating.

This [assessment](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21140) is based on the types of systems that are affected by the vulnerability, their typical deployment patterns, and the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would have on them.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to this Security Update

**Why does Microsoft Works Suite appear in the Affected Software list?**

Microsoft Works Suite appears in the Affected Software list because it includes Microsoft Word. Microsoft Works users should use [Office Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21135) to detect and to install the appropriate update.

**Can I use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) to determine whether this update is required?**

The following table provides the MBSA detection summary for this security update.

| Product | MBSA 1.2.1 | MBSA 2.0 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Microsoft Office 2003 | Yes | Yes |
| Microsoft Office XP | Yes | Yes |
| Microsoft Office 2000 | Yes | No |
| Microsoft Project 2002 | Yes | Yes |
| Microsoft Project 2000 | Yes | No |

**Note** MBSA 1.2.1 uses an integrated version of the Office Detection Tool (ODT) which does not support remote scans of this security update. For more information about MBSA, visit the [MBSA Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).

For more information about MBSA, visit the [MBSA Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134). For more information about the programs that Microsoft Update and MBSA 2.0 currently do not detect, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 895660](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/895660).

**Can I use Systems Management Server (SMS) to determine whether this update is required?**

The following table provides the SMS detection summary for this security update.

| Software | SMS 2.0 | SMS 2003 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Microsoft Office 2003 | Yes | Yes |
| Microsoft Office XP | Yes | Yes |
| Microsoft Office 2000 | Yes | No |
| Microsoft Project 2002 | Yes | Yes |
| Microsoft Project 2000 | Yes | No |

SMS uses MBSA for detection. Therefore, SMS has the same limitation that is listed earlier in this bulletin related to programs that MBSA does not detect.

For SMS 2.0, the SMS SUS Feature Pack, which includes the Security Update Inventory Tool, can be used by SMS to detect security updates. SMS SUIT uses the MBSA 1.2.1 engine for detection. For more information about the Security Update Inventory Tool, visit the following [Microsoft Web site](https://www.microsoft.com/smserver/downloads/2003/featurepacks/suspack). For more information about the limitations of the Security Update Inventory Tool, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 306460](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/306460). The SMS SUS Feature Pack also includes the Microsoft Office Inventory Tool to detect required updates for Microsoft Office applications.

For SMS 2003, the SMS 2003 Inventory Tool for Microsoft Updates can be used by SMS to detect security updates that are offered by [Microsoft Update](https://update.microsoft.com/microsoftupdate) and that are supported by [Windows Server Update Services](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=50120). For more information about the SMS 2003 Inventory Tool for Microsoft Updates, visit the following [Microsoft Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=50757). SMS 2003 can also use the Microsoft Office Inventory Tool to detect required updates for Microsoft Office applications.

For more information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

## Vulnerability Details

#### Microsoft Office Remote Code Execution Using a Malformed PNG Vulnerability- CVE-2006-0033

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Office and could be exploited when Office opened a malformed PNG file. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted PNG file that could allow remote code execution.

If a user were logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less affected than users who operate with administrative user rights.

#### Mitigating Factors for Microsoft Office Remote Code Execution Using a Malformed PNG Vulnerability - CVE-2006-0033:

* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* The vulnerability can not be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message.
* On Office XP and Office 2003, this vulnerability could not be exploited automatically through a Web-based attack scenario. An attacker would have to host a Web site that contains an Office file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site.
* The default PNG filter provided by the operating system without Office installed is not affected by this vulnerability.

**Note** Office 2000 does not prompt the user to **Open**, **Save**, or **Cancel** before opening a document.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
