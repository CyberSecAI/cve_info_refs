{
  "CVE-2006-0033": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "Microsoft Office applications fail to properly parse PNG images. When an Office document containing a malformed PNG image is opened with an Office application, system memory can be corrupted.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper handling of malformed PNG images, leading to memory corruption.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code.",
      "Attack vectors": "Opening a specially crafted Office document containing a malformed PNG image.",
       "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to create a malicious PNG file and embed it within an Office document. The user must then open this document."
    },
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Office PNG filter file may corrupt system memory when opening a malformed PNG file.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Memory corruption due to improper parsing of malformed PNG files.",
       "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution, allowing the attacker to take control of the affected system.",
      "Attack vectors": "Web-based attacks involving a malicious website hosting a crafted PNG file, or email attacks where the user is persuaded to open a malicious PNG file.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious PNG file and either host it on a website, or send it via email. User interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability."
