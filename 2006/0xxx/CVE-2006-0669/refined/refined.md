**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The initial report for CVE-2006-0669 claimed an SQL injection vulnerability in GA Forum Light.
*   However, the vendor disputed this, stating GA Forum Light does not use an SQL database but flat files.
*   Further investigation indicates that the issue is likely a VBScript parsing error, not SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   The initial vulnerability report claimed an SQL injection, but the real weakness is a VBScript parsing error.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   The initial report implied a possibility of data access or manipulation through SQL injection.
*   The VBScript parsing error impact is not specified here but would depend on the nature of the parsing error.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The initial attack vector was through a potential SQL injection, which is incorrect.
*   The real attack vector is a flaw related to how VBScript is being parsed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker would need to be able to send input that can trigger the VBScript parsing error. Specific details about the necessary input are not provided.

**Additional Details:**

*   This content provides more details than the official CVE description by clarifying the misidentification of the vulnerability as SQL injection and the correct issue being a VBScript parsing error.
*   The vendor has disputed the SQL injection claim and further investigation seems to confirm a VBScript parsing error.
