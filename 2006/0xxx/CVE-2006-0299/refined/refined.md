{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The implementation of E4X introduced an internal \"AnyName\" object which was unintentionally exposed to web content.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Exposure of internal object to web content",
      "Lack of access control on Object.prototype's class getter and setter",
      "Lack of access control on chrome window's getter and setter"
    ],
    "impact": "Two cooperating domains could use this singleton object as a communication channel to bypass same-origin restrictions. If a chrome script stored a reference to the anyname object, content scripts could perform malicious actions. The first context to use `*` would have its global object entrained via the AnyName singleton's prototype object.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A chrome script stores `*` in a long-lived property.",
      "An extension uses `AnyName.prototype` or `new AnyName` to get a reference to the singleton object.",
      "Cooperating domains use the singleton object to share information."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to have a way to execute javascript code in the vulnerable application, e.g., via a malicious extension or a compromised website.  Additionally, the attacker would need a separate domain to cooperate to make use of the communication channel created by the exposed singleton object."
  },
  "additional_notes": "The vulnerability was fixed by preventing access to the internal AnyName object and nulling the singleton's proto slot to avoid bloat. This issue could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if not mitigated. The provided information also mentions that extensions were using E4X and therefore could potentially be affected by this vulnerability.  Thunderbird was vulnerable only if JavaScript was enabled in mail, which is not the default."
