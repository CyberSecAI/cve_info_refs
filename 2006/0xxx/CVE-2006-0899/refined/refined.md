        "attack_vector": "HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.",
        "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.  They also need valid user credentials to log in and upload the malicious image.",
        "additional_details": "The exploit script leverages a vulnerability in the 'template' parameter of index.php to include arbitrary local files. It uploads a specially crafted JPG file containing malicious PHP code in its EXIF metadata. The script also creates a backdoor on the target server and uses it to execute system commands."
