Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2006-0664

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to missing input sanitization in the `config_defaults_inc.php` file of the Mantis bug tracking system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary weakness is a cross-site scripting vulnerability. This occurs because user-supplied input is not properly sanitized before being displayed in web pages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Execution of Arbitrary Web Script Code:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject and execute malicious web script (e.g., JavaScript) code within the context of a user's browser when they access the vulnerable application. This could lead to:
    - Stealing user cookies or session tokens.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Defacing the website.
    - Performing other actions on behalf of the user without their consent.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote:** The attack can be carried out remotely.
- **Injection through web input:** Malicious scripts are injected via user input that is not properly sanitized.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to influence input that is subsequently displayed on a page. This can happen via various means such as adding data through input fields, query parameters, etc. No special privileges are needed on the system other than the capability to influence user input.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is part of a group of XSS vulnerabilities identified in the Mantis bug tracking system.
- The provided content indicates that the issue was fixed in versions 0.19.2-5sarge4.1 for the stable distribution (sarge) and 0.19.4-3.1 for the unstable distribution (sid) of Debian.
