How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Vulnerability Details

#### MSDTC Invalid Memory Access Vulnerability - CVE-2006-0034:

A [denial of service](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21142) vulnerability exists that could allow an attacker to send a specially crafted network message to an affected system. An attacker could cause the Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator (MSDTC) to stop responding. Note that the denial of service vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate their user rights, but it could cause the affected system to stop accepting requests.

#### Mitigating Factors for MSDTC Invalid Memory Access Vulnerability - CVE-2006-0034:

* This is a denial of service vulnerability. This issue would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate their user rights, but it could cause the affected service to stop accepting requests.
* If the Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator stops responding because of an attack, services that are not dependant on the Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator would continue to function normally. The affects of an attack will not typically affect the general stability of the system.
* For customers who require the affected component, firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.

#### Workarounds for MSDTC Invalid Memory Access Vulnerability - CVE-2006-0034:

* **Disable the Distributed Transaction Coordinator**

  Disabling the Distributed Transaction Coordinator helps protect the affected system from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. To disable the Distributed Transaction Coordinator, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Control Panel**. Alternatively, click Start, point to **Settings**, and then click **Control Panel**.
  2. Double-click **Administrative Tools**.
  3. Double-click **Component Services**.
  4. Click **Services**.
  5. Double-click **Distributed Transaction Coordinator**.
  6. In the **Startup type** list, click **Disabled**.
  7. Click **Stop**, and then click **OK**.

  You can also stop and disable the Distributed Transaction Coordinator by using the following command at the command prompt:

  `sc stop MSDTC & sc config MSDTC start= disabled`

  **Impact of Workaround:** If you disable the Distributed Transaction Coordinator, you cannot use any service or application that is dependant on the Distributed Transaction Coordinator. This could include other applications such as SQL Server, BizTalk Server, Exchange Server, or Message Queuing. Also, this service is required in most clustering configurations. Therefore, we recommend this workaround only on systems that cannot install the security update.
* **Use the Group Policy settings to disable the Distributed Transaction Coordinator on all affected systems that do not require this feature.**

  Because the Distributed Transaction Coordinator is a possible attack vector, disable it by using the Group Policy settings. You can disable the startup of this service at the local, site, domain, or organizational unit level by using Group Policy object functionality in Windows 2000 domain environments or in Windows Server 2003 domain environments. For more information about how to disable this service through logon scripts, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 297789](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/297789)

  **Note** You may also review the [Windows 2000 Security Hardening Guide](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=15e83186-a2c8-4c8f-a9d0-a0201f639a56&displaylang;=en). This guide includes information about how to disable services.

  For more information about Group Policy, visit the following Web sites:

  + [Step-by-Step Guide to Understanding the Group Policy Feature Set](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windowsserver2003/technologies/directory/activedirectory/stepbystep/gpfeat.mspx)
  + [Windows 2000 Group Policy](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windows2000serv/howto/grpolwt.mspx)
  + [Group Policy in Windows Server 2003](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windowsserver2003/technologies/management/gp/default.mspx)

  **Impact of Workaround:** If you disable the Distributed Transaction Coordinator, you cannot use any service or application that is dependant on the Distributed Transaction Coordinator. This could include other applications such as SQL Server, BizTalk Server, Exchange Server, or Message Queuing. Also, this service is required in most clustering configurations. Therefore, we recommend this workaround only on systems that cannot install the security update.
* **Disable Network DTC Access**

  If you cannot install the security update, and you cannot disable the Distributed Transaction Coordinator, you may want to disable Network DTC Access. This option is only available on Windows XP and later operating system versions. This still allows local transactions to complete, but it helps protect from network based attacks that try to exploit this issue. For information about how to configure Network DTC Access, visit the following [Microsoft Web site](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ms680682.aspx). To disable Network DTC Access, follow these steps:

  **Warning** Performing this procedure causes the affected service to start if it was not started previously. Stop the MSDTC service on the MSDTC tab before you close the configuration dialog boxes.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Control Panel.** Alternatively, click **Start**, point to **Settings**, and then click **Control Panel**.
  2. Double-click **Administrative Tools**.
  3. Double-Click **Component Services**, expand **Component Services**, expand **Computers**, right-click **My Computer** and then click **Properties**,
  4. Click the **MSDTC** tab, and then click **Security Configuration.**
  5. In the **Security Configuration** dialog box, click to clear the **Network DTC Access** check box.

     **Note** This sets the following DWORD registry entry to 0 on non-clustering environments. Clustering environments do not read the following registry key. For Clustering environments, follow the steps that are listed in the âDisable the Distributed Transaction Coordinatorâ bullet point.

     `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\MSDTC\Security\NetworkDtcAccess`

     **Note** You can also apply this setting to multiple systems by using Group Policy. For more information about Group Policy, visit the following [Microsoft Web site](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windowsserver2003/technologies/directory/activedirectory/stepbystep/gpfeat.mspx).
  6. Click **OK**, close the **Component Services** dialog box, and then close the **Administrative Tools** dialog box.

  **Impact of Workaround:** If you disable Network DTC Access, distributed transaction could fail. This could impact other applications such as SQL Server, BizTalk Server, or Message Queuing. Therefore, we recommend this workaround only on systems that cannot install the security update.
* **Block the following at the firewall:**

  + **All unsolicited inbound traffic on ports greater than 1024**
  + **Any other specifically configured RPC port**

  These ports can be used to initiate a connection with MSDTC. Blocking them at the firewall will help protect systems that are behind that firewall from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. Also, make sure that you block any other specifically-configured RPC port on the remote system. We recommend that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet to help prevent attacks that may use other ports. While RPC can use UDP ports 135, 137, 138, 445, and TCP ports 135, 139, 445, and 593, the MSDTC service is not vulnerable over those ports.

  **Note** Other protocols, such as Sequenced Packet Exchange (SPX) or NetBEUI, could be used to communicate with the MSDTC service. If you are using these protocols, you should block the appropriate ports for those protocols. For more information about IPX and SPX, visit the following [Microsoft Web site](https://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/reskit/prch_cnn_goue.asp).
* **To help protect from network-based attempts to exploit this vulnerability, use a personal firewall, such as the** [**Internet Connection Firewall**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33335)**, which is included with Windows XP and with Windows Server 2003.**

  By default, the Internet Connection Firewall feature in Windows XP and in Windows Server 2003 helps protect your Internet connection by blocking unsolicited incoming traffic. We recommend that you block all unsolicited incoming communication from the Internet.

  To enable the Internet Connection Firewall feature by using the Network Setup Wizard, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Control Panel**.
  2. In the default Category View, click **Network and Internet Connections**, and then click **Setup or change your home or small office network**. The Internet Connection Firewall feature is enabled when you select a configuration in the Network Setup Wizard that indicates that your system is connected directly to the Internet.

  To configure Internet Connection Firewall manually for a connection, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Control Panel**.
  2. In the default Category View, click **Networking and Internet Connections**, and then click **Network Connections**. (Windows Sever 2003 displays this as **Network Connections**)
  3. Right-click the connection on which you want to enable Internet Connection Firewall, and then click **Properties**.
  4. Click the **Advanced** tab.
  5. Under **Windows Firewall**, click **Settings.**
  6. Click **On,** and then click **OK**.
  7. Click the **Exceptions** tab. You may need to click **Settings** to display the exceptions tab.
  8. Verify that MSDTC.exe is not in the list of firewall exceptions, and then click **OK**.

  **Note** If you want to enable certain programs and services to communicate through the firewall, click **Settings** on the **Advanced** tab, and then select the programs, the protocols, and the services that are required.
* **To help protect from network-based attempts to exploit this vulnerability, enable advanced TCP/IP filtering on systems that support this feature.**

  You can enable advanced TCP/IP filtering to block all unsolicited inbound traffic. For more information about how to configure TCP/IP filtering, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 309798](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/309798).
* **To help protect from network-based attempts to exploit this vulnerability, block the affected ports by using IPsec on the affected systems.**

  Use Internet Protocol security (IPsec) to help protect network communications. Detailed information about IPsec and about how to apply filters is available in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 313190](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/313190) and [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 813878](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/813878). RPC uses a broad range of ports, which may make it difficult to try to secure them all by using IPsec. [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 908472](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/908472) documents how to restrict RPC communication to a set of fixed ports and how to secure those ports by using IPsec.

  **Impact of Workaround:** If you disable the Distributed Transaction Coordinator, you cannot use any service or application that is dependant on the Distributed Transaction Coordinator. This could include other applications such as SQL Server, BizTalk Server, Exchange Server, or Message Queuing. Also, this service is required in most clustering configurations. Therefore, we recommend this workaround only on systems that cannot install the security update.
* **Disable Network DTC Access**

  If you cannot install the security update, and you cannot disable the Distributed Transaction Coordinator, you may want to disable Network DTC Access. This option is only available on Windows XP and later operating system versions. This still allows local transactions to complete, but it helps protect from network based attacks that try to exploit this issue. For information about how to configure Network DTC Access, visit the following [Microsoft Web site](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ms680682.aspx). To disable Network DTC Access, follow these steps:

  **Warning** Performing this procedure causes the affected service to start if it was not started previously. Stop the MSDTC service on the MSDTC tab before you close the configuration dialog boxes.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Control Panel.** Alternatively, click **Start**, point to **Settings**, and then click **Control Panel**.
  2. Double-click **Administrative Tools**.
  3. Double-Click **Component Services**, expand **Component Services**, expand **Computers**, right-click **My Computer** and then click **Properties**,
  4. Click the **MSDTC** tab, and then click **Security Configuration.**
  5. In the **Security Configuration** dialog box, click to clear the **Network DTC Access** check box.

     **Note** This sets the following DWORD registry entry to 0 on non-clustering environments. Clustering environments do not read the following registry key. For Clustering environments, follow the steps that are listed in the âDisable the Distributed Transaction Coordinatorâ bullet point.

     `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\MSDTC\Security\NetworkDtcAccess`

     **Note** You can also apply this setting to multiple systems by using Group Policy. For more information about Group Policy, visit the following [Microsoft Web site](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windowsserver2003/technologies/directory/activedirectory/stepbystep/gpfeat.mspx).
  6. Click **OK**, close the **Component Services** dialog box, and then close the **Administrative Tools** dialog box.

  **Impact of Workaround:** If you disable Network DTC Access, distributed transaction could fail. This could impact other applications such as SQL Server, BizTalk Server, or Message Queuing. Therefore, we recommend this workaround only on systems that cannot install the security update.
* **Block the following at the firewall:**

  + **All unsolicited inbound traffic on ports greater than 1024**
  + **Any other specifically configured RPC port**

  These ports can be used to initiate a connection with MSDTC. Blocking them at the firewall will help protect systems that are behind that firewall from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. Also, make sure that you block any other specifically-configured RPC port on the remote system. We recommend that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet to help prevent attacks that may use other ports. While RPC can use UDP ports 135, 137, 138, 445, and TCP ports 135, 139, 445, and 593, the MSDTC service is not vulnerable over those ports.

  **Note** Other protocols, such as Sequenced Packet Exchange (SPX) or NetBEUI, could be used to communicate with the MSDTC service. If you are using these protocols, you should block the appropriate ports for those protocols. For more information about IPX and SPX, visit the following [Microsoft Web site](https://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/reskit/prch_cnn_goue.asp).
* **To help protect from network-based attempts to exploit this vulnerability, use a personal firewall, such as the** [**Internet Connection Firewall**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33335)**, which is included with Windows XP and with Windows Server 2003.**

  By default, the Internet Connection Firewall feature in Windows XP and in Windows Server 2003 helps protect your Internet connection by blocking unsolicited incoming traffic. We recommend that you block all unsolicited incoming communication from the Internet.

  To enable the Internet Connection Firewall feature by using the Network Setup Wizard, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Control Panel**.
  2. In the default Category View, click **Network and Internet Connections**, and then click **Setup or change your home or small office network**. The Internet Connection Firewall feature is enabled when you select a configuration in the Network Setup Wizard that indicates that your system is connected directly to the Internet.

  To configure Internet Connection Firewall manually for a connection, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Control Panel**.
  2. In the default Category View, click **Networking and Internet Connections**, and then click **Network Connections**. (Windows Sever 2003 displays this as **Network Connections**)
  3. Right-click the connection on which you want to enable Internet Connection Firewall, and then click **Properties**.
  4. Click the **Advanced** tab.
  5. Under **Windows Firewall**, click **Settings.**
  6. Click **On,** and then click **OK**.
  7. Click the **Exceptions** tab. You may need to click **Settings** to display the exceptions tab.
  8. Verify that MSDTC.exe is not in the list of firewall exceptions, and then click **OK**.

  **Note** If you want to enable certain programs and services to communicate through the firewall, click **Settings** on the **Advanced** tab, and then select the programs, the protocols, and the services that are required.
* **To help protect from network-based attempts to exploit this vulnerability, enable advanced TCP/IP filtering on systems that support this feature.**

  You can enable advanced TCP/IP filtering to block all unsolicited inbound traffic. For more information about how to configure TCP/IP filtering, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 309798](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/309798).
* **To help protect from network-based attempts to exploit this vulnerability, block the affected ports by using IPsec on the affected systems.**

  Use Internet Protocol security (IPsec) to help protect network communications. Detailed information about IPsec and about how to apply filters is available in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 313190](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/313190) and [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 813878](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/813878). RPC uses a broad range of ports, which may make it difficult to try to secure them all by using IPsec. [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 908472](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/908472) documents how to restrict RPC communication to a set of fixed ports and how to secure those ports by using IPsec.

#### FAQ for MSDTC Denial of Service Vulnerability - CVE-2006-1184:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

A [denial of service](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21142x) vulnerability exists that could allow an attacker to send a specially crafted network message to an affected system. An attacker could cause the Distributed Transaction Coordinator to stop responding. Note that the denial of service vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate their user rights, but it could cause the affected system to stop accepting requests.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

An unchecked buffer in the MSDTC service.

**What is the Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator?**

The Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator (MSDTC) is a distributed transaction facility for Microsoft Windows platforms. MSDTC uses proven transaction processing technology. It is robust despite system failures, process failures, and communication failures; it exploits loosely coupled systems to provide scalable performance; and it is easy to install, configure, and manage. The DTC service provides the following benefits:

* Reduces the cost of enterprise computing.
  The DTC provides a sophisticated, low-cost distributed transaction facility for users of networked, commodity-priced PCs and servers.
* Simplifies application development.
  DTC transactions greatly simplify the application task of preserving consistency, despite failures that can occur when updating application data.
* Provides a consistent transaction model.
  The DTC supports a variety of resource managers, including relational databases, object-oriented databases, file systems, document storage systems, and message queues.
* Enables software development using distributed software components.
  The DTC provides a simple, object-oriented application programming interface for initiating and controlling transactions.

**Notes** When you install these security updates, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.
If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the Update.exe installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you can use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. MBSA allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).

**Notes** When you install these security updates, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.
If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you can use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. MBSA allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).
* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.
     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.
     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry keys.

  For Windows XP Home Edition Service Pack 1, Windows XP Professional Service Pack 1, Windows XP Tablet PC Edition, Windows XP Media Center Edition, Windows XP Home Edition Service Pack 2, Windows XP Professional Service Pack 2, Windows XP Tablet PC Edition 2005, and Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005:

  HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows XP\SP3\KB913580\Filelist

  **Note** These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly if an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams the 913580 security update into the Windows installation source files.

#### Windows 2000 (all versions)

The length of your first term depends on your purchase selection. 30 days before your first term is expired, your subscription will be automatically renewed on an annual basis and you will be charged the renewal subscription price in effect at the time of your renewal, until you cancel (Vermont residents must opt-in to auto-renewal.)
* Unless otherwise stated, if a savings amount is shown, it describes the difference between the introductory first term price (available only to customers without an existing McAfee subscription) and the renewal subscription price (e.g., first term price vs. each year thereafter).
