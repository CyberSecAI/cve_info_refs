{
  "CVE-2006-0062": {
    "Description": "xlockmore 5.13 allows potential xlock bypass when FVWM switches to the same virtual desktop as a new Gaim window.",
    "Root cause": "xlock fails to check window handles received in X events, leading to a crash when FVWM switches to the same virtual desktop as a new Gaim window. Specifically, xlock tries to XRaiseWindow on an invalid window handle.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient validation of window handles received from X server events.",
       "Lack of proper error handling when using the XRaiseWindow function with invalid window handles."
    ],
    "Impact": "xlock crashes, allowing unauthorized access to the user's account.",
    "Attack vectors": "Exploitation requires a specific configuration of the FVWM window manager and the Gaim application (or similar application that opens new windows on a different virtual desktop).",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to trigger FVWM to switch to the same virtual desktop as a new Gaim window while xlock is active.",
    "Additional Information": "The vulnerability is triggered by the window manager (FVWM) placing a new window (e.g., from Gaim) on the same virtual desktop as the locked screen. The xlock program fails to validate the received window event data before using the XRaiseWindow call, causing a crash. A patch was created to fix the issue by properly sanitizing all input from X server events and checking for valid window handles before calling XRaiseWindow. This issue also affected older versions of xlockmore, but can be patched by applying the same fix. The severity is considered 'grave' due to the user security hole it presents, allowing potential bypass of the screen lock."
