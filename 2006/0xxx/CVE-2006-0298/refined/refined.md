{
  "Root cause": "An incorrect calculation in `nsExpatDriver::ParseBuffer` when determining the `startOffset` resulted in reading past the end of a buffer.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "Buffer Overflow",
    "Out-of-bounds Read"
  ],
  "Impact": "The vulnerability could lead to crashes and, potentially, the exposure of sensitive memory contents into the DOM of an XML document.",
  "Attack vectors": "Parsing of a specially crafted XML document.",
  "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to provide a malicious XML document to the vulnerable software."
