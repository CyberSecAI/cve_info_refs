- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `topics.php` script in phpWebSite 0.10.0-full is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization of the `topic` parameter in the URL when handling user input.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can bypass authentication and extract sensitive information from the database, such as usernames and password hashes.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited via an HTTP GET request to `topics.php` with a specially crafted `topic` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target web server hosting the vulnerable phpWebSite application. No authentication is required to exploit this specific vulnerability.
