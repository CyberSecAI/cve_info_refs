  "CVE-2006-0759": {
    "Description": "Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in HiveMail 1.3 and earlier allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via (1) the contactgroupid parameter in addressbook.update.php, (2) the messageid parameter in addressbook.add.php, (3) the folderid parameter in folders.update.php, and possibly certain parameters in (4) calendar.event.php, (5) index.php, (6) pop.download.php, (7) read.bounce.php, (8) rules.block.php, (9) language.php, and (10) certain other scripts; and allow remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary SQL commands via (11) the folderid parameter in index.php and (12) possibly other parameters in certain other scripts, because $_SERVER['PHP_SELF'] is improperly handled.",
    "Root cause": "Improper sanitization of user-supplied input in multiple PHP scripts, particularly within the `eval()` function and SQL queries, as well as improper handling of `$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']`.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection",
      "Remote Code Execution via unsafe eval calls",
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to unsanitized $_SERVER['PHP_SELF'] references"
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary SQL commands and PHP code on the target server, potentially leading to complete compromise of the web server. Cross-site scripting can be used to steal session cookies.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "HTTP GET/POST requests with malicious parameters (e.g., contactgroupid, messageid, folderid)",
       "Unsanitized `$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']` variable in URL paths"
    ],
     "Required attacker capabilities": "Remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit most of the vulnerabilities. Certain SQL injection attacks require authenticated users."
