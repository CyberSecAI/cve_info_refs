### General Information

## Executive Summary

**Executive Summary:**

This update resolves a newly-discovered, privately-reported vulnerability that could allow an attacker to run arbitrary code on the system. The vulnerability is documented in the âVulnerability Detailsâ section of this bulletin.

On vulnerable versions of Outlook, Office Language Interface Packs, Office MultiLanguage Packs or Office Multilingual User Interface Packs, if a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the client workstation. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

On vulnerable versions of Exchange, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. This vulnerability could be exploited automatically without user interaction. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

We recommend that customers apply the update immediately.

## Frequently asked questions (FAQ) related to this security update

**What are Office 2000 MultiLanguage Packs (MUI)?**

Office 2000 MultiLanguage Packs provide features that allow users to change the language of their Office user interface and online Help. It includes the Microsoft Office Proofing Tools, which provide spelling checkers, grammar checkers, and other tools for editing in a variety of languages.

**What are Office XP and Office 2003 Multilingual User Interface Packs (MUI)?**

Office 2003 Multilingual Packs and Office 2003 Editions with MUI Pack can help simplify worldwide Microsoft Office deployment for multinational organizations or for organizations that have multilingual employees. With the MUI Pack, organizations can deploy a single version of Office 2003 Editions and still meet the requirements of users who work in other languages. IT administrators simply provide the user interface (UI) and Help files for different languages based on each individual's needs.

**What is Office 2003 Language Interface Pack (LIP)?**

Office 2003 Language Interface Packs are designed for regional markets that currently do not have local versions, the Language Interface Pack (LIP) provides computer users with the ability to adapt their copy of Office to display many commonly used features in their native language. It includes the Microsoft Office Proofing Tools; the Proofing Tools provide spelling checkers, grammar checkers, and other tools for editing in a variety of languages.

**Why are there separate updates for Outlook Exchange Server 2003 (MUI), Office 2000 MultiLanguage Packs (MUI), Office XP Multilingual User Interface Packs (MUI) Office 2003 Multilingual User Interface Packs (MUI) or Office 2003 Language Interface Pack (LIP)?**

The reason that this issue is addressed separately in versions of Exchange Server and Office software is that Transport Neutral Encapsulation Format (TNEF) decoding components differ between server and client software. Customers must apply all relevant updates.

**I do not have Outlook installed, but I have Office 2000 MultiLanguage Packs (MUI), Office 2003 Multilingual User Interface Packs(MUI), Office XP Multilingual User Interface Packs (MUI) or Office 2003 Language Interface Packs (LIP) installed. Do I need to apply the update?**

Although the only identified attack vector is Outlook, we recommend that you install the security updates if you have any of the affected software installed.

**I am using Outlook and I have Office 2000 MultiLanguage Packs (MUI), Office XP Multilingual User Interface Packs (MUI),Office 2003 Multilingual User Interface Packs (MUI) installed or Office 2003 Language Interface Packs (LIP). Am I vulnerable?**

Yes. You should install the Outlook security update and relevant security updates for the Office 2000 MultiLanguage Packs, the Office XP Multilingual User Interface Packs the Office 2003 Multilingual User Interface Packs, and the Office 2003 Language Interface Pack.

**I am still using Microsoft Exchange 5.0 Server or Microsoft Exchange 5.5 Server. Originally, extended security update support ended on December 31, 2005. This bulletin has a security update for Microsoft Exchange 5.0 Server or Microsoft Exchange 5.5 Server. Why is that?**

Microsoft Exchange 5.0 Server or Microsoft Exchange 5.5 Server had reached the end of their life cycles on December 31, 2005. However, in order to create greater consistency and predictability for customers, Microsoft is matching the date that the product support lifecycle ends, with the regular monthly security update release cycle.
Exchange 5.0 Server or Exchange 5.5 Server extended security support ends on January 10, 2006.

## Vulnerability Details

#### TNEF Decoding Vulnerability - CVE-2006-0002

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Exchange Server because of the way that it decodes the Transport Neutral Encapsulation Format (TNEF) MIME attachment.

An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted TNEF message that could potentially allow remote code execution when a user opens or previews a malicious e-mail message or when the Microsoft Exchange Server Information Store processes the specially crafted message.

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system.

#### Mitigating Factors for TNEF Decoding Vulnerability - CVE-2006-0002:

* Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

#### Workarounds for TNEF Decoding Vulnerability - CVE-2006-0002:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

* **Block MS-TNEF on Microsoft Exchange Server to help protect against attempts to exploit this vulnerability through SMTP e-mail.**
  Systems can be configured to block certain types of files from being received as e-mail attachments. Microsoft TNEF-encoded e-mail messages, commonly known as rich text format (RTF) e-mail messages, can contain malicious OLE objects. These e-mail messages contain a file attachment that stores the TNEF information. This file attachment is usually named Winmail.dat. Blocking this file, and blocking the ms-tnef MIME type, could help protect Exchange servers and other affected programs from attempts to exploit this vulnerability if customers cannot install the available security update. To help protect an Exchange Server computer from attacks through SMTP, block the Winmail.dat file and all application/ms-tnef MIME type content before it reaches the Exchange Server computer.
  **Note** You cannot mitigate this vulnerability by setting **the Exchange rich-text format** option in Exchange Server to **Never used** or by disabling TNEF processing by editing the registry.
  **Note** Exchange supports other messaging protocols, such as X.400, that these workarounds do not protect. We recommend that administrators require authentication on all other client and message transport protocols to help prevent attacks using these protocols.
  **Note** Filtering only for attachments that have the file name Winmail.dat may not be sufficient to help protect your system. A malicious file attachment could be given another file name that could then be processed by the Exchange Server computer. To help protect against malicious e-mail messageâs, block all application/ms-tnef MIME type content.
  There are many ways to block the Winmail.dat file and other TNEF content. Here are some suggestions:

  + You can use ISA Server 2000 SMTP Message Screener to block all file attachments or to block only the Winmail.dat file. Blocking all file attachments provides the most protection for this issue if you use ISA Server 2000 because ISA Server 2000 does not support blocking content based on MIME content types. For more information, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 315132](https://support.microsoft.com/?id=315132).
  + You can use ISA Server 2000 SMTP Filter to block all file attachments or to block only the Winmail.dat file. Blocking all file attachments provides the most protection for this issue if you use ISA Server 2000 because ISA Server 2000 does not support blocking content based on MIME content types. For more information, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 320703](https://support.microsoft.com/?id=320703).
  + You can use ISA Server 2004 SMTP Filter and Message Screener block all file attachments or just the Winmail.dat file. Blocking all file attachments provides the most protection for this issue if you use ISA Server 2004 because ISA Server 2004 does not support blocking content based on MIME content types. For more information, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 888709](https://support.microsoft.com/?id=888709).
  + You can use third-party e-mail filters to block all application/ms-tnef MIME type content before it is sent to the Exchange Server computer or to a vulnerable application.

  **Impact of workaround:** If TNEF attachments are blocked, e-mail messages that are formatted as RTF will not be received correctly. In some cases, users could receive blank e-mail messages instead of the original RTF-formatted e-mail message. In other cases, users may not receive e-mail messages that are formatted as RTF at all. Blocking the TNEF attachments will not affect e-mail messages that are formatted as HTML or that are formatted as plain text. Perform this workaround only if you cannot install the available security update or if a security update is not publicly available for your configuration.
* **Require authentication for connections to a server that is running Microsoft Exchange Server for all client and message transport protocols.**
  Requiring authentication for all connections made to the Exchange Server computer will help protect against anonymous attacks. This will not protect against an attack from a malicious user who can successfully authenticate.
  **Impact of workaround:** Anonymous communication from clients through IMAP, POP3, HTTP, LDAP, SMTP, and NNTP will no longer be possible. Server to server anonymous communication through RPC, X.400, foreign gateway, and third-party connector protocols will also no longer be possible. In most configurations of Exchange Server, authenticated access is already required for all protocols except SMTP. If all application/ms-tnef MIME type message parts and the Winmail.dat file are blocked, as described in the previous workaround, anonymous SMTP connections could still be accepted.
* **Do not accept incoming public newsfeeds through the NNTP protocol on Microsoft Exchange Server.**

  Incoming newsfeeds are not enabled by default for Exchange Server. If you have subscribed to incoming newsfeeds from public newsgroups, an attacker could post a malicious message to such a newsgroup. Even if you require authentication between the news server and your Exchange Server computer, such a message could still be transferred to your Exchange Server computer. Therefore, you should disable incoming newsfeeds from any NNTP server that could let a user post a malicious message.
  **Impact of workaround:** Exchange access to public newsgroup feeds will no longer be possible.

#### FAQ for TNEF Decoding Vulnerability - CVE-2006-0002:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

Microsoft Exchange Server and Outlook both use the TNEF protocol. The vulnerability lies in the fact that Outlook or Exchange decodes a specially formed e-mail message that uses the TNEF protocol.

**What is TNEF?**

Transport Neutral Encapsulation (TNEF) is a format used by the Microsoft Exchange Server and Outlook e-mail clients when sending messages formatted as Rich Text Format (RTF). When Microsoft Exchange thinks that it is sending a message to another Microsoft e-mail client, it extracts all the formatting information and encodes it in a special TNEF block. It then sends the message in two parts - the text message with the formatting removed and the formatting instructions in the TNEF block. On the receiving side, a Microsoft e-mail client processes the TNEF block and re-formats the message.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system.

**Who could exploit the vulnerability?**

Any anonymous user who could deliver a specially crafted message to a user who is running Outlook or Exchange Server could try to exploit this vulnerability.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations and Microsoft Exchange servers are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if users who do not have sufficient administrative permissions are given the ability to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that Outlook and Microsoft Exchange Server validate the length of a message before it passes the message to the allocated buffer.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update is installed on an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool, which allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).
* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.
     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.
     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.

#### Administrative Installation Information

If you installed your application from a server location, the server administrator must update the server location with the administrative update and deploy that update to your computer.

**Installation Information**

The following setup switches are relevant to administrative installations as they allow an administrator to customize how the files are extracted from within the security update.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/?** | Displays the command-line options. |
| **/q** | Specifies quiet mode, or suppresses prompts, when files are being extracted. |
| **/t:path** | Specifies the target folder for extracting files. |
| **/c** | Extracts the files without installing them. If **/t:path** is not specified, you are prompted for a target folder. |
| **/c:path** | Overrides the install command that is defined by author. Specifies the path and name of the Setup.inf or .exe file. |

For additional information about the supported setup switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 197147](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/197147).

**Administrative Deployment Information**

To update your administrative installation, perform the following procedure:

1. [Download the administrative version of this security update.](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=64d0336d-f962-4ab1-a724-9f6ba2108cb9)
2. Click **Save this program to disk**, and then click **Save** again.
3. Using Windows Explorer, locate the folder that contains the saved file and run the following command line to extract the .msp file:

*[path\name of EXE file]* /c /t:C:\AdminUpdate

**Note** Double-clicking the .exe file does not extract the .msp file; it applies the update to the local computer. In order to update an administrative image, you must first extract the .msp file.

1. Click **Yes** to accept the License Agreement.
2. Click **Yes** if you are prompted to create the folder.
3. If you are familiar with the procedure for updating your administrative installation, click **Start**, and then click **Run**. Type the following command in the **Open** box:

msiexec /a Admin Path\MSI File /p C:\adminUpdate\MSP File SHORTFILENAMES=TRUE

Where Admin Path is the path of your administrative installation point for your application (for example, C:\Office2000), MSI File is the .msi database package for the application (for example, Data1.msi), and MSP File is the name of the administrative update (for example, SHAREDff.msp).

**Note** You can append /**qb+** to the command line so that the **Administrative Installation** dialog box and the **End User License Agreement** dialog box do not appear.

1. Click **Next** in the provided dialog box. Do not change your CD Key, installation location, or company name in the provided dialog box.
2. Click **I accept the terms in the License Agreement**, and then click **Install**.

At this point, your administrative installation point is updated. Next, you must update the workstations that were originally installed from this administrative installation. To do this, please review the Workstation Deployment section. Any new installations that you run from this administrative installation point will include the update.

**Warning** Any workstation that was originally installed from this administrative installation before you installed the update cannot use this administrative installation for actions like repairing Office or adding new features until you complete the steps in the Workstation Deployment section for this workstation.

**Workstation Deployment Information**

To deploy the update to the client workstations, click **Start**, and then click **Run**. Type the following command in the **Open** box:

msiexec /i Admin Path\MSI File /qb REINSTALL=Feature List REINSTALLMODE=vomu

Where Admin Path is the path of your administrative installation point for your application (for example, C:\Office2000), MSI File is the .msi database package for the application (for example, Data1.msi), and Feature List is the list of feature names (case sensitive) that must be reinstalled for the update. To install all features, you can use **REINSTALL=ALL**. or you can install the following features.

| Product | Feature |
| --- | --- |
| Microsoft Outlook 2000 | OutlookCDO,OutlookMAPICONTAB,OutlookMAPIEMS,OutlookMessaging,OutlookMAPI,OUTLOOKNonBootFiles,OutlookOMI |

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update is installed on an affected system you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool, which allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).
* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.
     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.
     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.

#### Administrative Installation Information

If you installed your application from a server location, the server administrator must update the server location with the administrative update and deploy that update to your computer.

**Installation Information**

The following setup switches are relevant to administrative installations as they allow an administrator to customize how the files are extracted from within the security update.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/?** | Displays the command-line options. |
| **/q** | Specifies quiet mode, or suppresses prompts, when files are being extracted. |
| **/t:path** | Specifies the target folder for extracting files. |
| **/c** | Extracts the files without installing them. If **/t:path** is not specified, you are prompted for a target folder. |
| **/c:path** | Override install command defined by author. Specifies the path and name of the Setup.inf or .exe file. |

For additional information about the supported setup switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 197147](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/197147).

3. Using Windows Explorer, locate the folder that contains the saved file and run the following command line to extract the .msp file:

*[path\name of EXE file]* /c /t:C:\AdminUpdate

**Note** Double-clicking the .exe file does not extract the .msp file; it applies the update to the local computer. In order to update an administrative image, you must first extract the .msp file.

1. Click **Yes** to accept the License Agreement.
2. Click **Yes** if you are prompted to create the folder.
3. If you are familiar with the procedure for updating your administrative installation, click **Start**, and then click **Run**. Type the following command in the **Open** box:

msiexec /a Admin Path\MSI File /p C:\adminUpdate\MSP File SHORTFILENAMES=TRUE

Where Admin Path is the path of your administrative installation point for your application (for example, C:\OfficeXP), MSI File is the .msi database package for the application (for example, PRO.msi), and MSP File is the name of the administrative update (for example, OLKINTLff.msp).

**Note** You can append /**qb+** to the command line so that the **Administrative Installation** dialog box and the **End User License Agreement** dialog box do not appear.

1. Click **Next** in the provided dialog box. Do not change your CD Key, installation location, or company name in the provided dialog box.
2. Click **I accept the terms in the License Agreement**, and then click **Install**.

**Installation Information:**

This security update supports the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/help** | Displays the command-line options. |
| Setup Modes |  |
| **/passive** | Unattended Setup mode. No user interaction is required, but installation status is displayed. If a restart is required at the end of Setup, a dialog box will be presented to the user with a timer warning that the computer will restart in 30 seconds. |
| **/quiet** | Quiet mode. This is the same as unattended mode, but no status or error messages are displayed. |
| Restart Options |  |
| **/norestart** | Does not restart when installation has completed. |
| **/forcerestart** | Restarts the computer after installation and force other applications to close at shutdown without saving open files first. |
| **/warnrestart[:x]** | Presents a dialog box with a timer warning the user that the computer will restart in *x* seconds. (The default setting is 30 seconds.) Intended for use with the **/quiet** switch or the **/passive** switch. |
| **/promptrestart** | Display a dialog box prompting the local user to allow a restart. |
| Special Options |  |
| **/overwriteoem** | Overwrites OEM files without prompting. |
| **/nobackup** | Does not back up files needed for uninstall. |
| **/forceappsclose** | Forces other programs to close when the computer shuts down. |

**Software Update Services:**

By using Microsoft Software Update Services (SUS), administrators can quickly and reliably deploy the latest critical updates and security updates to Windows 2000 and Windows Server 2003-based servers, and to desktop systems that are running Windows 2000 Professional or Windows XP Professional.

For more information about how to deploy security updates by using Software Update Services, visit the [Software Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21133).

**Windows Server Update Services:**

By using Windows Server Update Services (WSUS), administrators can quickly and reliably deploy the latest critical updates and security updates for Windows 2000 operating systems and later, Office XP and later, Exchange Server 2003, and SQL Server 2000 onto Windows 2000 and later operating systems.

For more information about how to deploy security updates using Windows Server Update Services, visit the [Windows Server Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=50120).

**Systems Management Server:**

Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) delivers a highly-configurable enterprise solution for managing updates. By using SMS, administrators can identify Windows-based systems that require security updates and can perform controlled deployment of these updates throughout the enterprise with minimal disruption to end users. For more information about how administrators can use SMS 2003 to deploy security updates, visit the [SMS 2003 Security Patch Management Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=22939). SMS 2.0 users can also use [Software Updates Service Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33340) to help deploy security updates. For information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

**Note** SMS uses the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer, the Microsoft Office Detection Tool, and the Enterprise Update Scanning Tool to provide broad support for security bulletin update detection and deployment. Some software updates may not be detected by these tools. Administrators can use the inventory capabilities of the SMS in these cases to target updates to specific systems. For more information about this procedure, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33341). Some security updates require administrative rights following a restart of the system. Administrators can use the Elevated Rights Deployment Tool (available in the [SMS 2003 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33387) and in the [SMS 2.0 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21161)) to install these updates.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Original Release Date: 2006-01-10 | Last Revised: 2006-01-17

---

### Overview

Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Exchange contain a buffer overflow vulnerability that may allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on a system running the vulnerable software.

### Description

| **Transport Neutral Encapsulation Format (TNEF)**  [TNEF](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/224817) is a proprietary Microsoft format for encoding rich text email messages. Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Exchange support the use of TNEF-encoded messages.**The problem**Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Exchange do not properly validate TNEF MIME attachments, potentially allowing a buffer overflow to occur. The overflow occurs in in the process that decodes TNEF MIME attachments. A remote attacker may be able trigger the buffer overflow by sending a specially crafted TNEF MIME attachment to a vulnerable Outlook or Exchange installation. Note that on user workstations, exploitation may require a user to open or preview a malicious mail message in Outlook. However, on Exchange servers, this vulnerability can be exploited without human interaction. For more information, please see Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS06-003](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS06-003.mspx). |

### Impact

| A remote unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on a system running the vulnerable software. Microsoft Outlook can trigger the vulnerability when it opens or displays a preview for a specially crafted message. Microsoft Exchange can trigger the vulnerability when it processes a specially crafted message. |

# Security Update Severity Rating System

Attacks that impact customers' systems rarely result from attackers' exploitation of previously unknown vulnerabilities. Rather, they exploit vulnerabilities for which patches are available but not applied. For this reason, Microsoft recommends that customers make patching a priority. Currently available updates are listed in the [Security Update Guide](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/).

However, not all vulnerabilities are equally severe. To help customers understand the risk associated with each vulnerability we patch, we have published a severity rating system that rates each vulnerability according to the worst theoretical outcome were that vulnerability to be exploited.

| Rating | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Critical | A vulnerability whose exploitation could allow code execution ***without*** user interaction. These scenarios include self-propagating malware (e.g. network worms), or unavoidable common use scenarios where code execution occurs without warnings or prompts. This could mean browsing to a web page or opening email.  Microsoft recommends that customers apply Critical updates immediately. |
| Important | A vulnerability whose exploitation could result in compromise of the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of user data, or of the integrity or availability of processing resources. These scenarios include common use scenarios where client is compromised ***with***warnings or prompts regardless of the prompt's provenance, quality, or usability. Sequences of user actions that do not generate prompts or warnings are also covered.  Microsoft recommends that customers apply Important updates at the earliest opportunity. |
| Moderate | Impact of the vulnerability is mitigated to a significant degree by factors such as authentication requirements or applicability only to non-default configurations.  Microsoft recommends that customers consider applying the security update. |
| Low | Impact of the vulnerability is comprehensively mitigated by the characteristics of the affected component. Microsoft recommends that customers evaluate whether to apply the security update to the affected systems. |

The measure of a vulnerability’s severity is distinct from the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited. To assess that likelihood, the [Microsoft Exploitability Index](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/cc998259) provides additional information to help customers better prioritize the deployment of Microsoft security updates. This index provides customers with guidance on the likelihood of functioning exploit code being developed for vulnerabilities addressed by Microsoft security updates, within the first thirty days of that update's release.

While this severity rating system is intended to provide a broadly objective assessment of each issue, we strongly encourage customers to evaluate their own environments and make decisions about which updates are required to protect their systems.

## 1. Overview:

Microsoft issued a security bulletin summary for January 2006 which contained
three security advisories: MS06-001, MS06-002, and MS06-003. The MS06-001
advisory has already been addressed by Avaya in [ASA-20
06-001](http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/ASA-2006-001.htm): WMF vulnerability in Windows (MS06-001). The advisories describe
vulnerabilities in the Microsoft Operating System. A description of the
vulnerabilities can be found at:

<http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms06-jan.mspx>

Certain Avaya products utilize Microsoft Operating Systems and may be
affected by these vulnerabilities.
## 2. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose Operating Systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying Operating
System or applications which come with the Operating System. These
vulnerabilities often do not impact the software-only product directly but may
threaten the integrity of the underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by
the vulnerabilities directly but the underlying Microsoft platform may be
impacted. For affected Microsoft Operating Systems, Microsoft recommends
installing patches. Detailed instructions for patching the Operating System are
given by Microsoft at the following link:

<http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms06-jan.mspx>

The following Avaya software-only products run on Microsoft Operating Systems
and may have been installed on a vulnerable Microsoft Operating System.
Customers should determine on which Microsoft Operating System the product was
installed and then follow Microsoft's guidance for applying patches:

## 4. Recommended Actions:

Avaya recommends that the Microsoft patches and/or workaround solutions are
applied for the vulnerability outlined in the above system product table.
Although certain Avaya system products utilize Microsoft Operating Systems and
may be affected by these vulnerabilities, Avaya recommends that the use of
e-mail clients and Internet browsers be restricted on Avaya system products
(i.e. Outlook Express and Internet Explorer). The use of browsers should be
restricted to authorized users-only as well as limited to the operational-needs
of the product. Unrestricted access to the Intranet or Internet should be
prohibited beyond the necessary functions of the product's web administration
interface and to obtaining patches. This reduces the risk of vulnerabilities in
these applications.

Further information regarding the Microsoft patches on Avaya system products
is below:

**MS06-002** Vulnerability in Embedded Web Fonts Could Allow Remote Code
Execution (908519): A vulnerability has been discovered that could allow an
attacker to take control of an affected system. A local user must open an e-mail
or web site for this vulnerability to be exploited. This vulnerability impacts
S8100/DefinityOne/IP600 Media Servers, Modular Messaging Message Application
Server (MAS), and Unified Communication Center. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) had assigned the name [C
VE-2006-0010](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-0010) to this issue.

**MS06-003** Vulnerability in TNEF Decoding in Microsoft Outlook and
Microsoft Exchange Could Allow Remote Code Execution (902412): A vulnerability
has been discovered that affects Outlook, Office Language Interface Packs,
Office MultiLanguage Packs or Office Multilingual User Interface Packs. If a
user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully
exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the client
workstation. Avaya system products do not ship with Outlook, Exchange, or any
Office Language Packs installed, and are therefore not vulnerable. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE
-2006-0002](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-0002) to this issue.
