  "CVE-2006-0557": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `get_nodes` function in the Linux kernel does not properly validate the maxnodes parameter, leading to a potential local denial-of-service (DoS). Specifically, when `get_nodes` is called with a `maxnodes` value between `(-2 * (BITS_PER_LONG - 1))` and `0`, it can overwrite the `start` variable in the `sys_mbind` or `set_mempolicy` functions, potentially causing improper syscall behavior.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
        "Improper input validation of the `maxnodes` parameter in the `get_nodes` function.",
        "Potential stack overwrite vulnerability in `sys_mbind` and `set_mempolicy` system calls due to the unchecked `maxnodes` value."
      ],
      "Impact of exploitation": "A local unprivileged user can cause a denial of service by calling the `get_nodes` function with a crafted maxnodes parameter. It could also lead to unexpected behavior of the `mbind` or `set_mempolicy` system calls, but it does not necessarily cause a crash in all vulnerable versions.",
      "Attack vectors": "Local attack by an unprivileged user able to make `sys_mbind` or `set_mempolicy` system calls.",
       "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be a local user capable of executing system calls."
    },
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability exists due to a missing sanity check in the `sys_mbind` function when the parameter 'maxnodes' is negative. If the value of maxnodes is between  (-2 * (BITS_PER_LONG - 1)) and 0, it causes the local variable `start` to be overwritten in the sys_mbind function, potentially causing improper syscall behavior.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
        "Missing input sanitization or validation.",
        "Incorrect calculation of required resources based on user-provided values.",
        "Potential for overwriting local variables on the stack."
      ],
      "Impact of exploitation": "A local user can cause a denial-of-service or possibly overwrite critical memory locations, leading to unpredictable behavior, but does not always result in a crash.",
      "Attack vectors": "A local attacker makes calls to sys_mbind or set_mempolicy with a crafted maxnodes parameter.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local access and ability to execute system calls is required."
