How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=185316#c0)  Doug Chapman    2006-03-13 17:33:00 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  This problem was seen on a 64CPU ia64 system running the HP proprietary "hazard" test suite.  The storage was ~80 72GB LUNs on MSA1000 arrays spread accros 8 qlogic FC controllers.  The default qlogic driver shipped with RHEL was used.  No data corruption or other issues causing the test to fail were seen but the "Badness" debug message was seen approx once every 15 minutes.  I have found 14 unique stack traces.  All give the same error but took different paths to get there.  I will attach a text file containing all of the unique traces.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):  kernel-2.6.9-34.EL  How reproducible:  I ran this for a 48 hour test and saw the message regularly.  The storage I am using is currently borrowed so I may not be able to recreate the configuration needed to reproduce.  If this is needed please inform me and I will see if I can borrow storage again.   Steps to Reproduce: 1. obtain a 64cpu system 2. obtain the HP proprietary "hazard" test sutie 3. obtain a TON of storage 4. run hazard with the -c3 option (filesystem only)    Actual results:   Expected results:   Additional info:   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=185316#c1)  Doug Chapman    2006-03-13 17:33:00 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 126054](attachment.cgi?id=126054 "various unique stack traces seen") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=126054&action=edit "various unique stack traces seen") various unique stack traces seen   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=185316#c2)  Doug Chapman    2006-04-11 16:32:37 UTC  ``` FYI,  I am now able to reproduce this on a much smaller system.  I have a 4cpu ia64 system in my private rack in the Red Hat lab connected to a single MSA1000.  I am able to hit these stack traces (although not nearly as often as on the 64 cpu with 8 MSA1000's).     ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=185316#c3)  Doug Chapman    2006-06-26 18:32:16 UTC  ``` I filed this quite some time back when I was the only one seeing it however we are now seeing this more often in other testing inside HP.  It is no longer just seen on massive systems like the one I originally reported it on so I am increasing the severity.  It has been reported to be easily reproduced on a 2 socket dual core ia64 system.  Here is a stacktrace as seeon on RHEL4 U4 partner beta:  VFS: brelse: Trying to free free buffer Badness in __brelse at fs/buffer.c:1372  Call Trace:  [<a000000100016da0>] show_stack+0x80/0xa0                                 sp=e00000003d997940 bsp=e00000003d991058  [<a000000100016df0>] dump_stack+0x30/0x60                                 sp=e00000003d997b10 bsp=e00000003d991040  [<a000000100129990>] __brelse+0xd0/0x100                                 sp=e00000003d997b10 bsp=e00000003d991020  [<a0000002001de770>] __try_to_free_cp_buf+0x1b0/0x220 [jbd]                                 sp=e00000003d997b10 bsp=e00000003d990ff0  [<a0000002001de930>] __journal_clean_checkpoint_list+0x150/0x180 [jbd]                                 sp=e00000003d997b10 bsp=e00000003d990f98  [<a0000002001d9090>] journal_commit_transaction+0x6d0/0x3080 [jbd]                                 sp=e00000003d997b10 bsp=e00000003d990ea0  [<a0000002001e18d0>] kjournald+0x170/0x580 [jbd]                                 sp=e00000003d997d80 bsp=e00000003d990e38  [<a000000100018c70>] kernel_thread_helper+0x30/0x60                                 sp=e00000003d997e30 bsp=e00000003d990e10  [<a000000100008c60>] start_kernel_thread+0x20/0x40                                 sp=e00000003d997e30 bsp=e00000003d990e1     ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=185316#c4)  RHEL Program Management    2006-08-16 20:32:12 UTC  ``` This request was evaluated by Red Hat Product Management for inclusion in a Red Hat Enterprise Linux maintenance release.  Product Management has requested further review of this enhancement by Red Hat Engineering, for potential inclusion in a Red Hat Enterprise Linux Update release for currently deployed products.  This enhancement is not yet committed for inclusion in an Update release.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=185316#c5)  Alexander Viro    2006-08-22 13:22:48 UTC  ``` Er... the obvious question: can you reproduce it with different controller?  I.e. is that a memory corruptor in SCSI that happens to hit buffer cache under that specific load or is that a bug in fs/buffer.c and/or VM and/or fs code?  Is it dependent on the fs type, while we are at it?   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=185316#c6)  Doug Chapman    2006-08-22 15:09:39 UTC  ``` Alexander,  The one common card in all of the systems we have seen this on is a qlogic 4GB fibre chanel card.  I have asked people back in HP to see if they can reproduce this with other cards.  Did you intend to remove the issue tracker link when you updated this BZ?  You removed IT 96777 on your last update.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=185316#c10)  Jason Baron    2006-09-01 17:25:24 UTC  ``` looks like a duplicate of 168301  *** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of [168301](show_bug.cgi?id=168301) ***   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=185316#c13)  Jay Turner    2007-02-08 13:23:04 UTC  ``` Pulling in ack from 168301.   ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=184510#c0)  Mark J. Cox    2006-03-09 13:16:01 UTC  ``` Mike O'Connor noted to vendor-sec that the following commit fixes a local DoS where an unprivileged user calls get_nodes with maxnodes set to between between ((-2 * (BITS_PER_LONG - 1) and 0.  Fixed by [http://linux.bkbits.net:8080/linux-2.6/cset@43f64992qvJ8Nep24rdzy0AROhhGiw](http://linux.bkbits.net:8080/linux-2.6/cset%4043f64992qvJ8Nep24rdzy0AROhhGiw) but then corrected to [http://linux.bkbits.net:8080/linux-2.6/cset@43fa9051sxog2Snggt2j_-aUDTdMwA](http://linux.bkbits.net:8080/linux-2.6/cset%4043fa9051sxog2Snggt2j_-aUDTdMwA)   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=184510#c1)  Ernie Petrides    2006-05-11 22:40:35 UTC  ``` I've determined that RHEL4 U4 is *not* vulnerable to this DoS because of the difference in stack layout of the callers of get_nodes().  Please downgrade this bug to a non-security issue and record that RHEL4 isn't vulerable to [CVE-2006-0557](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-0557).  However, there is still a bug in RHEL4 in the validation of "maxnodes", although I have yet determined how to verify what improper syscall behavior might occur.  A value of of -(BITS_PER_LONG-1) to -1 will cause the local variable "start" inside sys_mbind() to be overwritten, which is likely to cause improper mbind(2) syscall operation (but no crash).   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=184510#c2)  Ernie Petrides    2006-05-11 22:50:39 UTC  ``` A similar situation exists for the set_mempolicy(2) syscall, which also causes the same get_nodes() function call (but no crash).   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=184510#c4)  Ernie Petrides    2006-05-12 00:30:58 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 128925](attachment.cgi?id=128925&action=diff "RHEL4 U4 patch resolving this problem") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=128925&action=edit "RHEL4 U4 patch resolving this problem") RHEL4 U4 patch resolving this problem  Note that the upstream patch refers to the identifier BITS_PER_BYTE, which is not defined in RHEL4.	It's more efficient to test for a zero "nlongs" value anyway.  Patch posted for review on 11-May-2006.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=184510#c7)  Ernie Petrides    2006-05-12 18:17:28 UTC  ``` Another relevant aspect of this problem is that the code with the bug is only compiled into kernels with CONFIG_NUMA enabled.  The following config files set this:    config-i686-hugemem   config-ia64-generic   config-ppc64-generic   config-x86_64-generic  Thus, the only potential exposure on RHEL4 is with these configs.  I've only tested x86_64.  Jason is going to test the x86 hugemem kernel shortly.  The test program in [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=184510#c3) should be used with the -1L parameter set to -31L (for i686) or -63L (for ia64 or ppc64) to check for crashses.    ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=184510#c8)  Ernie Petrides    2006-05-12 18:22:27 UTC  ``` Correction to last comment: the i686-hugemem config is not used on RHEL4.  Thus, there is no possible exposure to this bug on any x86 RHEL4 kernel.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=184510#c9)  Jason Baron    2006-05-12 20:00:20 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 183665](show_bug.cgi?id=183665 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - sys_mbind sanity checking") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=184510#c11)  Jason Baron    2006-08-21 20:42:01 UTC  ``` committed in stream U5 build 42.2. A test kernel with this patch is available from <http://people.redhat.com/~jbaron/rhel4/>    ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=184510#c12)  RHEL Program Management    2006-09-07 19:29:23 UTC  ``` This request was evaluated by Red Hat Product Management for inclusion in a Red Hat Enterprise Linux maintenance release.  Product Management has requested further review of this request by Red Hat Engineering, for potential inclusion in a Red Hat Enterprise Linux Update release for currently deployed products.
