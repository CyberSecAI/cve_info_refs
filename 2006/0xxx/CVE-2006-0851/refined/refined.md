  "CVE-2006-0851": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "The ilchClan exploit reveals a SQL Injection vulnerability that allows an attacker to extract user passwords from the database.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization when handling the `tid` parameter in the forum's `newpost` functionality within the `index.php` script. Specifically, the `tid` parameter is directly included in an SQL query without being sanitized.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "SQL Injection vulnerability"
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass authentication and retrieve sensitive information such as user credentials, leading to complete compromise of user accounts.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to `index.php` with specific parameters, exploiting the vulnerable `tid` parameter."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server and have knowledge about the forum structure including the post id and user id. A script is provided to automate this process."
