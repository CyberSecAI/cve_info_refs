```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The SSL protocol allows for weak cipher communication, potentially due to a NULL key. Some browsers can be configured to send NULL encryption ciphers by default, and if the server accepts these, a weak connection is established.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SSL server may be forced to use weak encryption, specifically NULL encryption ciphers, on port 443/tcp over SSL.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could potentially eavesdrop on communication due to the use of weak or no encryption.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker could configure their client (e.g., a browser) to offer NULL encryption ciphers during the SSL handshake. If the server accepts such ciphers, communication will occur with weak or no encryption.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to initiate an SSL connection to the vulnerable server and configure their client to offer weak or NULL ciphers."
