# RHSA-2006:0178 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

ImageMagick security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2006%3A0178)

## Topic

Updated ImageMagick packages that fix two security issues are now available.

This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

ImageMagick(TM) is an image display and manipulation tool for the X Window
System that can read and write multiple image formats.

A shell command injection flaw was found in ImageMagick's "display"
command. It is possible to execute arbitrary commands by tricking a user
into running "display" on a file with a specially crafted name. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) assigned the name
CVE-2005-4601 to this issue.

A format string flaw was discovered in the way ImageMagick handles
filenames. It may be possible to execute arbitrary commands by tricking a
user into running a carefully crafted ImageMagick command. (CVE-2006-0082)

Users of ImageMagick should upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches and are not vulnerable to these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# ImageMagick: Format string vulnerability — GLSA **200602-06**

A vulnerability in ImageMagick allows attackers to crash the application
and potentially execute arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-gfx/imagemagick** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **6.2.5.5** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **6.2.5.5** |

### Background

ImageMagick is an application suite to manipulate and convert
images. It is often used as a utility backend by web applications like
forums, content management systems or picture galleries.

### Description

The SetImageInfo function was found vulnerable to a format string
mishandling. Daniel Kobras discovered that the handling of "%"-escaped
sequences in filenames passed to the function is inadequate. This is a
new vulnerability that is not addressed by GLSA 200503-11.

### Impact

By feeding specially crafted file names to ImageMagick, an
attacker can crash the program and possibly execute arbitrary code with
the privileges of the user running ImageMagick.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All ImageMagick users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-gfx/imagemagick-6.2.5.5"
```

# USN-246-1: imagemagick vulnerabilities

25 January 2006

imagemagick vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 5.10](/security/notices?release=breezy)
* [Ubuntu 5.04](/security/notices?release=hoary)
* [Ubuntu 4.10](/security/notices?release=warty)

## Details

Florian Weimer discovered that the delegate code did not correctly

handle file names which embed shell commands ([CVE-2005-4601](/security/CVE-2005-4601)). Daniel

Kobras found a format string vulnerability in the SetImageInfo()

function ([CVE-2006-0082](/security/CVE-2006-0082)). By tricking a user into processing an image

file with a specially crafted file name, these two vulnerabilities

could be exploited to execute arbitrary commands with the user's

privileges. These vulnerability become particularly critical if

malicious images are sent as email attachments and the email client

uses imagemagick to convert/display the images (e. g. Thunderbird and

Gnus).

In addition, Eero Häkkinen reported a bug in the command line argument

processing of the 'display' command. Arguments that contained

wildcards and were expanded to several files could trigger a heap

overflow. However, there is no known possiblity to exploit this

remotely. (<http://bugs.debian.org/345595>)

# GraphicsMagick: Format string vulnerability — GLSA **200602-13**

A vulnerability in GraphicsMagick allows attackers to crash the application
and potentially execute arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-gfx/graphicsmagick** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.1.7** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.1.7** |

### Background

GraphicsMagick is a collection of tools to read, write and
manipulate images in many formats.

### Description

The SetImageInfo function was found vulnerable to a format string
mishandling. Daniel Kobras discovered that the handling of "%"-escaped
sequences in filenames passed to the function is inadequate in
ImageMagick GLSA 200602-06 and the same vulnerability exists in
GraphicsMagick.

### Impact

By feeding specially crafted file names to GraphicsMagick an
attacker can crash the program and possibly execute arbitrary code with
the privileges of the user running GraphicsMagick.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All GraphicsMagick users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-gfx/graphicsmagick-1.1.7"
```

Subject: imagemagick: New format string vulnerability in SetImageInfo().
Date: Wed, 4 Jan 2006 02:05:20 +0100
```
[[Message part 1](bugreport.cgi?att=0;bug=345876;msg=5) (text/plain, inline)]
```
```
Package: imagemagick
Version: 6:6.2.3.0-1
Severity: grave
Tags: security patch
Justification: user security hole

Specially crafted file names cause programs using ImageMagick to crash
due to a format string vulnerability. It might be possible to execute
arbitrary code due to this bug.

I've discovered the vulnerability while investigating the upstream fix
for #297990 (CAN-2005-0397). It turns out that this fix is buggy and
doesn't plug the security hole. Originally, the format string
vulnerability could be demonstrated with

convert foo.jpg foo%n.jpg	# (or several %n until overflow happens)

Now all we need is one additional, valid, numeric format string, eg.

convert foo.jpg foo%d%n.jpg	# (or several %n until overflow happens)

The new code just checks for the presence of any of %%, %d, %o, or %x.
If one if them is found, it passes the rest of the string as a format
string to an sprintf()-style function just like in the CAN-2005-0397
vulnerability. It all happens in SetImageInfo() that is usually called
on the target filename in write operations, eg. the target filename of a
'convert'.

I'm not sure which upstream version was the first to contain this new
incarnation of the vulnerability, but 6:6.2.3.0-1 was the first that
appeared in Debian. While sarge contains an earlier version, etch and
sid are affected. As this is really is a new vulnerability, I assume
CAN-2005-0397 should not be reused. Security team, can you please
confirm and possibly provide a new CVE ID?

I'm attaching an untested patch that should give an idea on how to plug
this hole once and for all. Note that the original fix that went into
sarge was buggy as well: The code is actually supposed to expand an
optional numeric format specifier to support multi-frame images. The
sarge security patch broke this by preventing any format string
expansion, but that's a different story.

Regards,

Daniel.

Thanks a lot! Still not complete, though. I just noticed that animate.c
(or command.c in graphicsmagick) is affected in a similar way. There
might be even more of those lurking...

Daniel.

I don't doubt that there are more vulnerabilities lurking in
ImageMagick, but I don't see how this same problem occurs in
animate.c...

Which version are you looking at? The code in question recently moved
from magick/animate.c to wand/animate.c. Anyway, the underlying problem
is the same in all cases: A single numeric format expansion should be
allowed in user-supplied strings. In animate.c, look for a call to
FormatMagickString() following a comment "Form filename for multi-part
images.". The format string is taken verbatim from the command line.
Admittedly though, animate will rarely be called from scripts or as a
mime handler, so the security impact is quite low compared to, say,
convert.

Regards,

Daniel.

Yes, but there are still a few more places to fix. The attached patch
for 6.2.4.5 should be fairly complete, apart from a few odd places in
coders/, but those fall more into the scope of [CVE-2005-4601](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-4601). Mind,
though, that I'm still testing the fix, so some polishing might be
needed still.

Regards,

Daniel.

Hi,

You should have recently received (or will soon receive) an e-mail
telling you that I've closed Debian bug #345876 in the imagemagick
package, which you reported.

Due to the fact that the package was uploaded by someone who does not
normally do so, the bug was marked as "fixed" rather than closed.

Debian's bug tracking system now allows for this information to be
recorded in a more useful manner, enabling these bugs to be closed.

Due to the volume of bugs affected by this change, we are unfortunately
not sending individualized explanations for each bug. If you have
questions about the fix for your particular bug or about this email,
please contact me directly or follow up to the bug report in the Debian
BTS.

[It's possible you may receive multiple messages stating that the bug
was fixed in several different versions of the package. There are two
common reasons for this:

  - the bug was fixed in one version but subsequently found to exist
    in a later version

  - the bug existed in multiple distributions (for instance, "unstable"
    and "stable") and was thus fixed in a separate upload to each
    distribution
]

Regards,

Adam

```

 .
 imagemagick (7:6.2.4.5-0.8) unstable; urgency=low
 .
   * Non-maintainer upload.
   * Back to 6.2.4.5 as requested by the release team to maintain binary
     compatibility. Bumped epoch once more.
 .
 imagemagick (6:6.2.6.7-1) unstable; urgency=low
 .
   * New upstream version.
 .
 imagemagick (6:6.2.4.5-0.7) unstable; urgency=high

 .
   * Non-maintainer upload to resolve buildability/installability.
   * debian/{control,rules}: Disable DPS support, which is no longer shipped
     in Xorg 6.9/7.0 (and was making us both FTBFS and uninstallable in sid)
   * debian/control: explicitely build-depend on libxext-dev, since we both
     test for and use it directly, rather than indirectly.
 .
 imagemagick (6:6.2.4.5-0.3) unstable; urgency=low
 .
   * Non-maintainer upload.
   * debian/control: Rename libmagick++9 to libmagick++9c2a, following a
     C++ ABI transition. Conflicts with and Replaces old version.
   * debian/*: Rename various debhelper support files due to above name
     change.
 .
 imagemagick (6:6.2.4.5-0.2) unstable; urgency=medium
 .
   * Non-maintainer upload.
   * debian/control: libmagick9-dev Conflicts/Replaces libmagick6-dev.

 .

   * New upstream version.

     library packages names in multiple places.
 .
 imagemagick (6:6.2.4.4-0.1) experimental; urgency=low
 .
   * Non-maintainer upload.
   * New upstream version.
     + Version in library soname was increased from 6 to 7 due to
       changes in binary interface starting with 6.0.7. (Yes, this
       should have happened earlier.) Closes: #[318176](bugreport.cgi?bug=318176), #[325651](bugreport.cgi?bug=325651), #[325720](bugreport.cgi?bug=325720)
   * debian/*: Rename packages from libmagick6 to libmagick7, and similar.
     Adjust version in various places accordingly. Drop c2 suffix from
     C++ library package.
   * debian/control: Use shlibs information to generate Depends line for
     imagemagick binary package.
   * debian/control: Remove Pre-Depends on prehistoric version of dpkg.
   * debian/control: Package complies with policy version 3.6.2. Bump
     Standards-Version accordingly.
   * Patches to upstream sources:
     + [bin/Magick++-config.1.debdiff]
       Stray file that seems to have slipped into the previous Debian
       diffs by mistake. Removed now.
     + [magick/blob.c]
       Originally a patch from upstream, now mostly merged. Retaining a
       single hunk that upstream reverted later on, though it still looks
       correct.
     + [configure.ac, configure]
       Override location of documentation files to Debian's default
       /usr/share/doc/imagemagick. Patch to configure was present before.
       This release promotes it back to configure.ac as well. (No ill
       effects because AM_MAINTAINER_MODE is used.)
     + [coders/magick.c]
       Drop patch that exchanges upstream's logo for a DFSG-free version.
       This attempt to address #214623 (distribution of non-free logo)
       missed several other instances of the logo, must be applied to
       the orig.tar.gz rather than the Debian diff, and should have
       some input from upstream, so no point in carrying it around still.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# ImageMagick: Filename handling vulnerability — GLSA **200503-11**

A format string vulnerability exists in ImageMagick that may allow an
attacker to execute arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-gfx/imagemagick** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **6.2.0.4** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **6.2.0.4** |

### Background

ImageMagick is a collection of tools and libraries for manipulating a
wide variety of image formats.

### Description

Tavis Ormandy of the Gentoo Linux Security Audit Team has identified a
flaw in the handling of filenames by the ImageMagick utilities.

### Impact

Successful exploitation may disrupt web applications that depend on
ImageMagick for image processing, potentially executing arbitrary code.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All ImageMagick users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-gfx/imagemagick-6.2.0.4"
```

# ImageMagick: Format string vulnerability — GLSA **200602-06**

A vulnerability in ImageMagick allows attackers to crash the application
and potentially execute arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-gfx/imagemagick** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **6.2.5.5** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **6.2.5.5** |

### Background

ImageMagick is an application suite to manipulate and convert
images. It is often used as a utility backend by web applications like
forums, content management systems or picture galleries.

### Description

The SetImageInfo function was found vulnerable to a format string
mishandling. Daniel Kobras discovered that the handling of "%"-escaped
sequences in filenames passed to the function is inadequate. This is a
new vulnerability that is not addressed by GLSA 200503-11.

### Impact

By feeding specially crafted file names to ImageMagick, an
attacker can crash the program and possibly execute arbitrary code with
the privileges of the user running ImageMagick.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All ImageMagick users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-gfx/imagemagick-6.2.5.5"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Severity: Normal
Title: GraphicsMagick: Format string vulnerability
Date: February 26, 2006
Bugs: #119476
ID: 200602-13
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Synopsis
========
A vulnerability in GraphicsMagick allows attackers to crash the
application and potentially execute arbitrary code.
Background
==========
GraphicsMagick is a collection of tools to read, write and manipulate
images in many formats.
Affected packages
=================
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Package / Vulnerable / Unaffected
-------------------------------------------------------------------
1 media-gfx/graphicsmagick < 1.1.7 >= 1.1.7
Description
===========
The SetImageInfo function was found vulnerable to a format string
mishandling. Daniel Kobras discovered that the handling of "%"-escaped
sequences in filenames passed to the function is inadequate in
ImageMagick GLSA 200602-06 and the same vulnerability exists in
GraphicsMagick.
Impact
======
By feeding specially crafted file names to GraphicsMagick an attacker
can crash the program and possibly execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running GraphicsMagick.
Workaround
==========
There is no known workaround at this time.
Resolution
==========
All GraphicsMagick users should upgrade to the latest version:
# emerge --sync
# emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-gfx/graphicsmagick-1.1.7"
References
==========
[ 1 ] GLSA 200602-06
http://www.gentoo.org/security/en/glsa/glsa-200602-06.xml
Availability
============
This GLSA and any updates to it are available for viewing at
the Gentoo Security Website:
http://security.gentoo.org/glsa/glsa-200602-13.xml
Concerns?
=========
Security is a primary focus of Gentoo Linux and ensuring the
confidentiality and security of our users machines is of utmost
importance to us. Any security concerns should be addressed to
security (at) gentoo (dot) org [email concealed] or alternatively, you may file a bug at

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=176925#c0)  Josh Bressers    2006-01-04 14:14:11 UTC  ``` ImageMagick format string vulnerability.  The fix for [CVE-2005-0397](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2005-0397) is incomplete.
