Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in the context of CVE-2006-0479:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in PHP's handling of `register_globals` when enabled, combined with insufficient sanitization of global variables in PmWiki. Specifically, the vulnerability exploits a PHP bug that allows overwriting the `$GLOBALS` array using a specially crafted GPC variable (GET/POST/COOKIE) named `GLOBALS[variable]`, bypassing the intended protection mechanisms. This bug should have been fixed in PHP 5.0.5, but tests showed it worked on later versions (5.1.1 and 5.1.2).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **PHP `register_globals` vulnerability:** The primary weakness is the re-emergence of a PHP vulnerability allowing the manipulation of the `$GLOBALS` array via GPC variables when `register_globals` is enabled, despite previous fixes.
*   **Insufficient sanitization:** PmWiki's attempt to unset global variables using `foreach($_REQUEST as $k=>$v) unset(${$k});` is ineffective against the `$GLOBALS[variable]` injection, which allows bypassing the intended security measures.
*   **Remote file inclusion:**  By manipulating the `FarmD` variable, which is used to construct include paths, attackers can include arbitrary remote files.
*   **Path disclosure:** Attackers can trigger path disclosure by manipulating variables like `_SERVER`,`_REQUEST`, `_GET`, `_POST`, and `_ENV`.
*   **Cross-site scripting (XSS):** It is possible to inject malicious JavaScript and HTML code into variables that are later echoed, resulting in XSS vulnerabilities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote code execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary code on the server by including remote files, taking full control over the system.
*   **Information disclosure:** Attackers can potentially access sensitive information through path disclosure.
*   **Cross-site scripting attacks:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts, leading to various client-side attacks like stealing cookies, redirecting users, or defacing pages.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET/POST/COOKIE parameters:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerability by crafting specific GET, POST, or COOKIE parameters. The key to the exploitation is the injection of a `GLOBALS[variable]` parameter to override global variables.
*   **Remote file inclusion:** By manipulating the FarmD variable through crafted GPC parameters, attackers can include remote files.
*   **Directory traversal:** It's also possible to exploit the vulnerability to perform directory traversal attacks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network access:** Attackers need network access to the target server hosting the vulnerable PmWiki instance.
*   **`register_globals` enabled:** The server hosting PmWiki must have PHP's `register_globals` setting enabled for the vulnerability to be exploited.
*   **Knowledge of PmWiki code:** To achieve arbitrary remote file inclusion or XSS, the attacker needs a good understanding of how PmWiki handles global variables.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability affects PmWiki version 2.1 beta 20 (and likely older versions).
*   The vulnerability is contingent upon the server having `register_globals` enabled, which is considered a security risk and should be disabled.
*   Disabling remote file includes will mitigate remote file inclusion vulnerability, turning it to arbitrary file include.
*   The vendor has released a patch for this vulnerability.
*   The content provides more details than a typical CVE description, specifically regarding the technical implementation of the attack, the specific PHP bug, and the multiple vectors of attack.
