Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a double-free issue in PAM-MySQL when handling a pointer returned by `pam_get_item()`. Specifically, the module does not securely handle this pointer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Double-Free:** The core vulnerability is a double-free, which occurs when a memory location is freed twice. This can lead to memory corruption.
- **Insecure Handling of `pam_get_item()`:** The module does not correctly manage the pointer received from `pam_get_item()`, which is the trigger for the double-free.
- **Stacking Issue:** The vulnerability is triggered when PAM-MySQL is not the first module in a stacked PAM configuration and when preceding modules are not marked as "requisite."

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause a crash of the PAM-MySQL process, preventing users from logging in.
- **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** Although not explicitly confirmed, the double-free vulnerability may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely by supplying a specially crafted password to a vulnerable PAM-MySQL installation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the authentication process, likely through a service that utilizes PAM for authentication.

**Summary of Findings**
- Multiple sources confirm that the vulnerability is a double-free in the PAM-MySQL module. The vulnerability is related to how the module handles the output of `pam_get_item()`. An attacker can trigger this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted password, potentially leading to a denial-of-service condition or arbitrary code execution. The issue is exacerbated if PAM-MySQL isn't the first module in the stack and preceding modules are not marked as 'requisite'.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was initially reported in September 2005 and publicly disclosed in 2006.
- Upgrading to PAM-MySQL version 0.6.2 or 0.7pre3 or later is the recommended fix.
