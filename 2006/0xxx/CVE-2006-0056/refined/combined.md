# PAM-MySQL: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200606-18**

Vulnerabilities in PAM-MySQL can lead to a Denial of Service, making it
impossible to log into a machine.

### Affected packages

| Package | **sys-auth/pam\_mysql** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.7\_rc1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.7\_rc1** |

### Background

PAM-MySQL is a PAM module used to authenticate users against a MySQL
backend.

### Description

A flaw in handling the result of pam\_get\_item() as well as further
unspecified flaws were discovered in PAM-MySQL.

### Impact

By exploiting the mentioned flaws an attacker can cause a Denial of
Service and thus prevent users that authenticate against PAM-MySQL from
logging into a machine. There is also a possible additional attack
vector with more malicious impact that has not been confirmed yet.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All PAM-MySQL users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sys-auth/pam_mysql-0.7_rc1"
```

## PAM-MySQL contains a double-free vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#693909

Original Release Date: 2006-02-09 | Last Revised: 2006-05-17

---

### Overview

PAM-MySQL contains a double-free vulnerability that may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial-of-service condition.

### Description

| PAM-MySQL provides a Pluggable Authentication Module ([PAM)](http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/pam/whatispam.html) interface to a MySQL database. PAM-MySQL does not securely handle a pointer returned by the pam\_get\_item() routine, which results in a double-free vulnerability. The vulnerability exists if the following conditions are present:   1. Two or more PAM modules are stacked. 2. The PAM-MySQL module is not the first in the stack. 3. Any of the modules preceding the PAM-MySQL module are not marked as requisite. |
| --- |

### Impact

| If a remote attacker supplies a specially crafted password to a vulnerable PAM-MySQL installation, that attacker may be able to crash the PAM-MySQL process. Note that it may be possible to exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade PAM-MySQL**Upgrading to PAM-MySQL version [0.6.2](http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/pam-mysql/pam_mysql-0.6.2.tar.gz) or PAM-MySQL version [0.7pre3](http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/pam-mysql/pam_mysql-0.7pre3.tar.gz) will correct this issue. |
