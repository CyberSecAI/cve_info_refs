Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2006-0959

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw in the `misc.php` file of MyBB (MyBulletinBoard) versions prior to 1.3. The code improperly handles user-supplied data when constructing a SQL query to fetch buddy list information. Specifically, the `$comma` variable is not properly sanitized.

**Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The primary vulnerability is the SQL injection, which allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker can potentially read sensitive information from the database, including user credentials, personal data, and other private information.
- **Data Manipulation:** The attacker could modify data within the database, leading to potential integrity issues.
- **Privilege Escalation:** By exploiting the SQL injection, an attacker might be able to escalate privileges within the application.
- **Application Compromise:** The overall application can be compromised, potentially leading to further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Cookie Manipulation:** The attack vector involves injecting malicious SQL code through the `comma` cookie. The code leverages the fact that the `GLOBALS unset` function does not unset `$_COOKIES`, allowing the attacker to control the `$comma` variable via a crafted cookie.
- **URL Access:** After setting the cookie, the attacker accesses the vulnerable page (`misc.php?action=buddypopup`) to trigger the injection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Registered User:** The attacker needs to be a registered user of the MyBB forum.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable MyBB server.
- **Cookie Manipulation:**  The attacker needs to be able to manipulate HTTP cookies to inject malicious data.
- **Exploit Knowledge:** The attacker needs to know the injection syntax and vulnerable parameters.
