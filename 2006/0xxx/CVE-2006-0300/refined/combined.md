How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2006-0300
Debian Bug     : 314805

Jim Meyering discovered several buffer overflows in GNU tar, which may
lead to the execution of arbitrary code through specially crafted tar
archives.

The old stable distribution (woody) is not affected by this problem.

For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.14-2.1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.15.1-3.

We recommend that you upgrade your tar package.

## [Bug-tar] tar 1.15.90 released

```
Hello,

I am pleased to announce the release of GNU tar 1.15.90. This is an
alpha version, fixing the bugs found so far in version 1.15.1 and
introducing a number of new features.

GNU tar is an archiver that creates and handles file archives in various
formats. You can use tar to create file archives, to extract files from
previously created archives, store additional files, or update or list
files which were already stored.

For more information on tar, including links to file downloads,
please see the tar web page: <http://www.gnu.org/software/tar>
and the the project page <http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/tar>.

Alpha releases of GNU tar are available from ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/tar.

Files in this release and their SHA1 checksums:

580d361aedbc752a10706dc07c8fbd131eee68fe  tar-1.15.90.shar.gz
019661dbcf339495b15f99f7a1b7ad683b596644  tar-1.15.90.tar.bz2
7efbc4171a98218fdf3fa357e718313a53d07b4b  tar-1.15.90.tar.gz

Noteworthy changes in this release:

* New features

* Any number of -T (--files-from) options may be used in the command line.
The file specified with -T may include any valid `tar' options,
including another -T option.
Compatibility note: older versions of tar do not recognize any options
within the file list file, except -C.  Starting from this release any
file whose name starts with a dash is handled as an option.  To insert
file names starting with dash, use the --add-file option.

* List files containing null-separated file names are detected and processed
automatically.  It is no longer necessary to give the --null option.

* New option --no-unquote disables the unquoting of input file names.
This is useful for processing output from `find dir -print0'.
An orthogonal option --unquote is provided as well.

* New option --test-label tests the archive volume label.
If an argument is specified, the label is compared against its value.
Tar exits with code 0 if the two strings match, and with code 2 if
they do not.

If no argument is given, the --verbose option is implied.  In this case,
tar prints the label name if present and exits with code 0.

* New option --show-stored-names.  When creating an archive in verbose mode,
it lists member names as stored in the archive, i.e., with any eventual
prefixes removed.  The option is useful, for example, while comparing
`tar cv' and `tar tv' outputs.

* New option --to-command pipes the contents of archive members to the
specified command.

* New option --atime-preserve=system, which uses the O_NOATIME feature
of recent Linux kernels to avoid some problems when preserving file
access times.

* New option --delay-directory-restore delays restoring modification times
and permissions of extracted directories until the end of extraction.
This is necessary for restoring from archives with unusual member
ordering (in particular, those created with --no-recursion option).
This option is implied when restoring from incremental archives.

* New option --restrict prohibits use of some potentially harmful tar
options.  Currently it disables '!' escape in multi-volume name menu.

* New options --quoting-style and --quote-chars control the way tar
quotes member names on output. The --quoting-style takes an argument
specifying the quoting style to use (allowed values are: literal, shell,
shell-always, c, escape, locale, clocale). The argument to --quote-chars
is a string specifying characters to quote, even if the selected quoting
style would not quote them otherwise. The option --no-quote-chars is
provided to disable quoting certain characters.

* The end-of-volume script (introduced with --info-script option) can
get current archive name from the environment variable TAR_ARCHIVE and
the volume number from the variable TAR_VOLUME.  It can alter the
archive name by writing new name to the file descriptor 3.

* Better support for full-resolution time stamps.  Tar cannot restore
time stamps to full nanosecond resolution, though, until the kernel
guys get their act together and give us a system call to set file time
stamps to nanosecond resolution.

* The -v option now prints time stamps only to 1-minute resolution,
not full resolution, to avoid using up too many output columns.
Nanosecond resolution is now supported, but that would be too much.

* Bug fixes

** Allow non-option arguments to be interspersed with options.
** Fixed buffer overflow in handling PAX extended headers.
** When extracting or listing archives in old GNU format, tar
used to read an extra block of data after a long name header
if length of the member name was divisible by block size (512).
Consequently, the file pointer was set off and the next member
was not processed correctly.
** Previous version created invalid archives when files shrink
during reading.
** Compare mode (tar d) hanged when trying to compare file contents.
** Previous versions in certain cases failed to restore directory
modification times.
** When creating an archive, do not attempt to store files whose
meta-data cannot be stored in the header due to format limitations
(for ustar and v7 formats).
** The --version option now also outputs information about copyright,
license, and credits.  This reverts to the behavior of tar 1.14 and
earlier, and conforms to the GNU coding standards.  The --license (-L)
option introduced in tar 1.15 has been removed, since it's no longer
needed.

Regards,
Sergey

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# GNU tar: Buffer overflow — GLSA **200603-06**

A malicious tar archive could trigger a Buffer overflow in GNU tar,
potentially resulting in the execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-arch/tar** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.15.1-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.15.1-r1** |

### Background

GNU tar is the standard GNU utility for creating and manipulating
tar archives, a common format used for creating backups and
distributing files on UNIX-like systems.

### Description

Jim Meyering discovered a flaw in the handling of certain header
fields that could result in a buffer overflow when extracting or
listing the contents of an archive.

### Impact

A remote attacker could construct a malicious tar archive that
could potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
user running GNU tar.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All GNU tar users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-arch/tar-1.15.1-r1"
```

> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.
