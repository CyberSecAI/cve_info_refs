Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2006-0079:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw in the `auth.php` script of ScozBook.
*   The `$adminname` variable is not properly sanitized before being used in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:**  The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The lack of input sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code through the `$adminname` variable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** By injecting specific SQL code, an attacker can bypass the authentication mechanism, gaining unauthorized access to the admin panel.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP request to the `auth.php` script.
*   **Input Parameter:** The vulnerable parameter is the `username` field, which maps to the `$adminname` variable in the PHP code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web server hosting the vulnerable ScozBook application.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs knowledge of the SQL injection vulnerability in the `auth.php` script.
*   **Ability to Send HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs the ability to craft and send HTTP requests.
*   **Magic Quotes Setting:** The exploit is conditional on the server having `magic_quotes_gpc` set to `off`.

**Technical Details:**

*   **Vulnerable Script:** `auth.php`
*   **Vulnerable Variable:** `$adminname`
*   **SQL Injection Payload Example:** `username: a' or 'a'='a'/*`
