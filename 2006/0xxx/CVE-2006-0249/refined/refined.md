Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* The vulnerability is an SQL injection flaw in the `viewcat.php` script of geoBlog.
* The `$tmpCategory` variable, derived from the `cat` parameter in the URL, is not properly sanitized before being used in an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **SQL Injection:** The lack of input sanitization allows attackers to inject arbitrary SQL code through the `cat` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Arbitrary SQL Queries:** Attackers can execute any SQL query against the database.
* **Data Breach:** Attackers can potentially extract sensitive information such as administrator usernames and password hashes from the database.
* **System Access:** The ability to upload arbitrary files through the admin interface, coupled with the SQL injection, allows for a path to potential system compromise.
* **Full System Compromise:** By exploiting the SQL injection, an attacker can gain access to the administrator's credentials and leverage the file upload functionality for further malicious actions, including gaining control of the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to `viewcat.php` with a malicious SQL payload in the `cat` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server running the vulnerable geoBlog application.
* **Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs knowledge of SQL to craft the injection payload effectively.
* **`magic_quotes_gpc` off:** This is a required condition for the attack to work.

**Additional Details:**
* The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrates the SQL injection vulnerability using a UNION statement: `http://host/geoblog/viewcat.php?cat=I'%20union%20select%201,2,3,4,5,6,7/\*`
* The software affected is geoBlog MOD_1.0.
* The vulnerability was discovered by Aliaksandr Hartsuyeu (eVuln.com).
* No official solution or patch was available at the time of the report.
