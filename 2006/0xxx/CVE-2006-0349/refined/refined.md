Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2006-0349:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is improper sanitization of user-defined data within the `eggblog` application. Specifically, the application fails to properly sanitize user inputs before using them in SQL queries and when displaying content.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks due to the lack of input sanitization. This allows attackers to inject arbitrary SQL code into queries.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is also susceptible to XSS attacks because it doesn't sanitize user input when displaying content, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:** An attacker can exploit the SQL injection vulnerability to:
    *   Execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches by viewing or modifying sensitive data.
    *   Bypass authorization checks, gaining unauthorized access to restricted areas of the application.
*  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** An attacker can use the XSS vulnerability to:
    *   Inject malicious JavaScript code that executes in the browser of other users, leading to session hijacking or data theft.
    *   Redirect users to malicious sites.
    *   Perform other client-side attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Attackers can inject SQL code through HTTP GET parameters.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Attackers can inject JavaScript code when posting new messages in the forum.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   The attacker does not need any special privileges or credentials to exploit the vulnerability.
*   For XSS, the attacker must be able to post content.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability affects `eggblog` version 2.0.
*   The vulnerabilities have been discovered by Aliaksandr Hartsuyeu (eVuln.com).
*   A Proof of Concept (PoC) for both SQL injection and XSS is provided.
*   There is no available fix for the vulnerability at the time of the report.
