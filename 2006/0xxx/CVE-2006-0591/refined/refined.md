{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A bug in the password salt generation within PostgreSQL.",
    "weaknesses": "The generated password salts had half the expected size, making password hashes easier to brute-force.",
     "impact": "Easier brute-forcing of password hashes, potentially leading to unauthorized access to user accounts.",
     "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is present in how password salts are generated. An attacker with access to the password hashes could more easily perform brute-force attacks.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs access to the password hashes stored by PostgreSQL. They would then leverage the reduced salt length to more easily crack those hashes."
