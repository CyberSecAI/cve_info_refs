How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Albatross - a Toolkit for Stateful Web Applications

#### News

##### 27 April 2011 - Albatross 1.42 released

Incompatibilities

* As of version 1.42, Albatross **no longer supports Python 2.3** -
  version 2.4 or up is required (Python 3 is not supported at this time).
* Application.handle\_exception(ctx, req) no longer escapes the
  python and template tracebacks before executing any application-supplied
  trackback template. As this change could result in a potential security
  problem, the application-supplied exception template has been renamed from
  traceback.html to uncaught\_exception.html. If you used
  this functionality, you **must remove "noescape" from your
  traceback.html template** before renaming it to
  uncaught\_exception.html.
* SessionExpired handling was made consistent across session
  models and SessionExpired is now caught by the
  Application.run() method. When run() catches a
  SessionExpired exception, it calls
  Application.handle\_session\_expired(). This method attempts to
  display an application-supplied session\_expired.html template
  before falling back to an internal "Your session has expired" message.
* The noescape attribute (which disables the escaping of
  special HTML characters) is now only honoured for tag content, not tag
  attributes. Formerly, noescape on a tag would turn off escaping
  of all attributes and tag content. On reflection, this is too broad to be
  used safely. The noescape attribute will now raise an exception
  if used on any tag other than <al-option>,
  <al-select>, <al-textarea> or
  <al-value>, and only applies to the tag content. The new
  htmlsafe() mechanism provides an alternative way to disable
  escaping of evaluated attributes (see "Escaping generated content" in the
  "Templates Reference" section of the manual for more information).
* The session daemon al-session-daemon and the stand-alone
  development server al-httpd are now part of the Albatross command
  line tool. Usage remains largely the same, but rather than invoking
  al-session-daemon start, use albatross session-server
  start, and rather than al-httpd module.app 8080, use
  albatross serve --port=8080 module.app. You can also symlink the
  albatross script to al-session-daemon and
  al-httpd. For more information on the session server, see "Session
  Server Daemon" in the "Guide to Building Applications" section of the
  manual, and for more information on the stand-alone development server, see
  "Stand-alone Python HTTP Server Deployment".

New Features

* **Template evaluation namespaces**

  Evaluation of expressions in templates normally takes place within the
  scope of ctx.locals. The new <al-namespace> tag
  allows you to switch temporarily to a subordinate namespace. Expression
  evaluation will take place with respect to that namespace, and input names
  will automatically be prefixed with the name of the namespace.

  A namespace="..." attribute has also been added to the
  <al-expand> and <al-for> tags allowing you to
  execute their contained content in the specified namespace.
* **Easier selection of Application and Context classes**

  A new get\_app\_classes(page\_model, context\_model) function has
  been added that makes choosing Application and Context classes easier.
  Previously, you had to choose between one of twelve Application classes and
  match this with an appropriate Context class. With the
  get\_app\_classes() function, you just need to choose a page model
  and a session model, and the appropriate Application and Context classes are
  returned. For more information, see the "Prepackaged Application and
  Execution Context Classes" section of the manual.
* **Albatross command line and quick-start application skeleton**

  An **albatross** command line utility has been added. This utility
  currently has four sub-commands:

  + **create** - creates the basic framework of an application.
  + **add-page** - adds a page to an application so created.
  + **serve** - starts a stand-alone development server for the specified application.
  + **session-server** - starts a session server (see "Session Server
    Daemon" in the "Guide to Building Applications" section of the manual for
    more information).

  This makes it very easy to get started writing Albatross
  applications:

  ```
  $ albatross create myapp
      $ cd myapp
      $ ls
      app.ini  app.py  pages	session  static
      $ ls pages
      environment.html  macros.html  new_session.py       session_expired.html
      environment.py    main.html    page_not_found.html  uncaught_exception.html
      __init__.py       main.py      raise_exception.py   unhandled_exception.html
      1$ ls static
      alxform.css  favicon.ico  logo.png  style.css
      $ albatross serve
      Starting web server for "myapp" on port 8000
      Stop the server with Ctrl-C
      http://localhost:8000/

  ```

Enhancements

* A new alternative to the noescape attribute has been implemented that
  allows a data source to signal that a given string does not require
  escaping when it is rendered by template execution by casting it to the
  htmlsafe() type. This moves the responsibility for this
  potentially risky action from the template closer to the code that
  generated the string. The htmlsafe() type can also be used to
  selectively disable the escaping of evaluated attributes.

  While the "noescape" attribute still works, it's scope has been
  reduced, and it should be considered deprecated.
* RandomModular applications will now attempt to render an
  application-supplied page\_not\_found.html template, before falling
  back to an internal "URL .. was not found on this server" message.
* A simple logging mechanism has been added. Calling the
  Application.set\_logger(logger) method with a logger compatible
  with the standard python logging module registers that logger with the
  application. Exceptions will be logged to the logger at "error" level, and
  a ctx.log(msg) method allows messages to be logged at "info"
  level.

Bug Fixes

* If an application supplied it's own traceback.html template, the HTML
  headers would be emitted twice. **Also see the important note above
  regarding escaping of the tracebacks and renaming the template.**
* PageModuleMixin.load\_page\_module() now raises a new
  PageNotFound exception (a subclass of
  ApplicationError) if the page module is not found. This
  addresses a bug where the RandomPageModuleMixin would not
  reliably handle an unknown page.
* The standard exception handling bypasses the context logic, writing
  directly to the Request object. This created an issue with the session
  cookie not being cleared when an exception occurred. The exception handler
  now explicitly adds a "Set-Cookie:" header to clear the application
  cookie.

##### 15 March 2010 - Albatross 1.40 released

Major Changes

* **Conversion of documentation to reStructuredText** - With the
  Python documentation moving from LaTeX markup to [reStructuredText](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html)
  and the [Sphinx documentation
  generator](http://sphinx.pocoo.org/), we could no longer rely on the documentation utilities
  released with Python. The Albatross documentation has been converted
  to ReST, and uses Sphinx to render this to HTML and PDF formats.
* **Albatross Forms** -
  A simple HTML form generation and validation framework has been
  added to Albatross (as an optional extension under the module name [albatross.ext.form](http://www.object-craft.com.au/projects/albatross/albatross/forms.html)).

Bug Fixes

* Redirects were not calling ***req.return\_code()*** - for
  FastCGI deployment, this would result in the request hanging [11164].
* The python built-in ***\_\_import\_\_()*** gained extra arguments
  with python 2.6 - the decode session import hook has been changed to
  pass all arguments (positional and keyword) [14823].
* When rendering tags to HTML, the handling of the noescape attribute
  was not consistently honoured. Attribute rendering has been moved
  to the common Tag base class as the ***write\_attrib()*** method
  [15398].
* Relaxed tag recognition regular expressions, so that malformed tag
  attributes with no value, such as ***<al-input name= />***,
  are still recognised as valid Albatross tags, albeit with a null name
  attribute (which subsequently generates an error) [15398].

Miscellaneous Changes

* Miscellaneous changes to RedHat, Ubuntu, Solaris and OS X packaging
  rules.
* Reorganised the unit tests to eliminate the use of explicitly
  assembled test suites, relying instead on the unittest module to
  collect methods of TestCase subclasses. The documentation example
  tests were also reimplemented as TestCase subclasses, allowing them
  to be run via common test driver.

##### 19 March 2007 - Albatross 1.36 released

New Features

* A "vars" attribute has been added to <al-for> - this inserts
  the iterator value into the local namespace. The iterator value was
  previously only accessible via the iterator value() method.
* <al-for> now loops over sequences using the iterator protocol
  by default. The previous behaviour of indexing the sequence is retained
  where pagination or columns are requested.
* New <al-setdefault> tag which allows macros to define default
  values for their arguments (suggested by Greg Bond).
* Macro expansion can now specify macro arguments via attributes on
  the <al-expand> tag (suggested by Greg Bond).
* Added get\_param() method to Request classes, which deployment
  method agnostic access to http "environment" variables.

Functional Changes

* NameRecorderMixin no longer falls back to merging all request
  fields if no \_\_albform\_\_ field is present. Applications using the
  NameRecorderMixin and GET-style requests will need to explicitly merge
  relevent fields with the ctx.merge\_vars(...) method.
* Pickles embedded in hidden fields are now signed using the HMAC-SHA1
  algorithm (was MD5).
* The experimental FastCGI driver included in version 1.35 now becomes
  the default. The old driver has been renamed fcgiappold. This driver
  implements the FastCGI protocol itself, rather than depending on an
  external module.

Bug Fixes

* If the <al-option> tag was not immediately enclosed within an
  <al-select> tag, it would be silently ignored. <al-option>
  now works within containing flow control tags such as <al-for>
  or <al-if>, and supports attributes for dynamically setting
  value and label.
* Communication with the session server has been made more
  robust. EINTR is handled, as are partial reads and writes, and requests
  are restarted if the socket closes.
* Mixing radio inputs with other inputs of the same name did not
  raise an exception (reported by Michael Neel).
* fixed FCGI\_MAX\_DATA, which was incorrect due to an operator
  precedence mistake. Found by Tom Limoncelli.

Miscellaneous Changes

* Clean up and replace many pre-python 2.2 constructs.
* Many new tests have been added, and existing tests restructured.

##### 20 June 2006 - Albatross 1.35 released

Note that release 1.34 was an internal release.

New Features

* A drop-in replacement for the fcgiapp module, called fcgiappnew has
  been added. This version implements the FastCGI protocol itself, rather
  than relying on an external module to implement the protocol. This
  new module addresses several minor problems with fcgi.py, and should
  be faster, although it should not be used in critical applications
  until it has received wider testing.

Functional Changes

* When extension tags (alx-\*) are registered, their name is now checked
  against the template parsing regexp to ensure they can subsequently
  be matched.

Bug Fixes

* The AnyTag functionality was given knowledge of HTML tags for which
  the close tag is forbidden, so it can avoid generating XHTML empty tag
  (which could cause the page to fail HTML validation).
* When the disabledbool attribute was used on input tags, the disabled
  state was not being passed through to the input registry within the
  NameRecorderMixin.
* If a client closed it's connection to the session server while the
  server had data pending for the client, a subsequent del\_write\_file
  would generate an exception, killing the session server.

##### 16 December 2005 - Albatross 1.33 released

This release contains a security fix:

* Fixed a vulnerability in the handling of submitted form fields
  (CVE-2006-0044, DSA-942-1).

##### 16 August 2005 - Albatross 1.32 released

This release contains only bugfixes:

* To obtain a reference to the current frame, \_caller\_globals was raising
  and catching an exception, then extracting the tb\_frame member of
  sys.exc\_traceback. sys.exc\_traceback was deprecated in python 1.5
  as it is not thread-safe. It now appears to be unreliable in 2.4,
  so \_caller\_globals has been changed to use sys.\_getframe().
* If ctx.set\_page() was called from within the start page, then the wrong
  page methods (page\_enter, page\_display, etc) would be called (those
  of the initial page, rather than the page requested via set\_page).
* Fixes to handling of missing RandomPage page modules.

##### 31 May 2005 - Albatross 1.30 released

* Any HTML tag can now be prefixed with "al-" allowing any attribute to be
  the result of python evaluation. For example:
  ```

         <al-td colspanexpr="i.span()">

  ```
  could produce
  ```

         <td colspan="3">

  ```
  and:
  ```

         <al-input name="abc.value" disabledbool="abc.isdisabled()">

  ```
  could produce
  ```

         <input name="abc.value" disabled>

  ```
* Since macros and lookups are an application global resource, they can
  only be defined once per application, however this was not previously
  checked. Redefinition of macros or lookups will now result in an
  ApplicationError exception.
* an in-line version of the <al-lookup> tag has been
  introduced, which is expanded in place if the tag has an expr=
  attribute.
* a new <al-require> tag has been added to allow templates
  to assert that
  specific Albatross features are available, or templating scheme
  version number is high enough.
* "Cache-Control: no-cache" is now set in addition to "Pragma: no-cache"
  - the former is defined for HTTP/1.1, the later for HTTP/1.0.
* Simplified session cookie handling.
* FastCGI apps were not being explicitly finalised, relying
  instead on their object destructor, with the result that writing
  application output (or errors) would be indefinitely deferred if
  object cycles existed. We now call "fcgi.Finish()" from the fcgiapp
  Request.return\_code() method.
* When handling exceptions, the traceback is now explicitly deleted
  from the local namespace to prevent cycles (otherwise the garbage
  collection of other objects in the local namespace will be delayed).
* Two fixes to the <al-select> tag: the albatross-specific "list"
  attribute was leaking into resulting markup, and the use of the "expr"
  attribute would result in invalid markup being emitted.
* Thanks to Robert Fendt for picking this up: the Albatross-generated
  hidden field input element must not appear naked inside a form
  element for strict HTML conformance. The solution is to wrap the
  input elements in div.
* BranchingSession sessions could not be "deleted" - the solution is
  to add a dummy "session" shared by all branches, which is deleted
  when one branch "logs out".

##### 19 October 2004 - Albatross 1.20 released

> Changes in this release include:
>
> * A new BranchingSessionContext application context class, that
>   provides better syncronisation between browser state and application
>   state when the application state is stored server-side.
> * Improved adapters for the different deployment modes (CGI,
>   FastCGI, mod\_python, standalone, etc). Application status codes
>   (such as HTTP\_INTERNAL\_SERVER\_ERROR) are now returned to the browser.
> * The page module loader in PageModuleMixin has been reimplemented
>   so that it does not pollute sys.modules. Page modules are now loaded
>   into a synthetic module's namespace, rather than the global module
>   namespace. This will break code that defined classes in page modules
>   and placed instances of those classes into the session.
> * Multi-instance response headers are now supported (so, for example,
>   more than one Cookie can be set. The ResponseMixin.get\_header()
>   method now returns a list rather than a single string.
> * ctx.req\_equals(name) now checks for name.x if name is not
>   found. This makes using image maps as buttons easier.
> * Under some circumstances, redirect\_url() would redirect to
>   incorrect or invalid URLs (for example, an https app would redirect
>   to http) - the URI parsing has been refactored, and this bug has been
>   fixed. Tests were also added for the refactored URI parsing.
> * Several cookie handling bugs were fixed.

##### 20 July 2003 - Albatross 1.10 released

> This release contains many new features, most of which are described
> below.
>
> * Matt Goodall developed support for deployment of applications
>   via FastCGI. FastCGI applications import their Request class from
>   albatross.fcgiapp.
> * Matt Goodall developed support for standalone deployment of
>   applications via the standard Python BaseHTTPServer module. The
>   al-httpd program can be used to deploy a CGI application as a
>   standalone BaseHTTPServer server.
> * All Albatross exceptions have been redefined to indicate the
>   source of the error; user (UserError), programmer
>   (ApplicationError), or Albatross itself (InternalError). The
>   ServerError exception reports problems related to the session
>   server, SecurityError reports either a programmer error, or a user
>   attempt to access restricted values in the execution context, and
>   TemplateLoadError reports failures to load templates. All of the
>   exceptions inherit from AlbatrossError.
> * All response header management has been moved to the
>   ResponseMixin class. The AppContext class now inherits from
>   ResponseMixin. The Request class no longer tracks whether or not
>   headers have been sent.
> * The Application.run() method no longer unconditionally returns
>   an HTTP response code of 200. The returned response code is
>   retrieved from the Request.status() method. You can call the
>   Request.set\_status() method to override the default HTTP response
>   code of 200.
> * The <al-input> tag now supports type="file"
>   input tags. When you use file input tags the enclosing
>   <al-form> tag automatically adds the
>   enctype="multipart/form-data" attribute to the generated
>   <form> tag.
> * The Application.run() method now saves the session before
>   flushing the response to the browser. This allows applications to
>   support dynamically generated images.
> * The exception formatting in Application.handle\_exception() has
>   been moved into the format\_exception() method. Applications can
>   perform their own exception formatting and/or send formatted
>   exceptions to locations other than the browser.
> * The ExecuteMixin.write\_content() method now converts unicode to
>   UTF-8.
> * During NamespaceMixin.eval\_expr() the execution context is
>   temporary placed into the local namespace as the variable
>   \_\_ctx\_\_.
> * The <al-lookup> tag now registers the lookup during
>   template parsing rather than during evaluation. This allows
>   template code to make use of lookups that are defined later in the
>   same file. The item dictionary is created the first time that the
>   lookup is used rather than when the template is interpreted.
> * Macro arguments are now evaluated when they are referenced
>   rather than before they are passed to a macro. This removes a
>   limitation where you could not define macros including
>   <al-form> tags that retrieved <al-input> tags from
>   their arguments. Previously the <al-input> tags passed as
>   macro arguments would have been evaluated outside of the context of
>   the form defined in the macro. This effectively made the input tags
>   invisible to the form recorder.
> * The templates reference documentation has been completely
>   restructured to improve clarity. All attributes of each tag have
>   been documented.

##### 28 October 2002 - Albatross 1.01 released

> Changes in this release include:
>
> * Prevent variables starting with an underscore from being merged
>   into the context local namespace from request objects. This
>   prevents attackers spoofing variables such as \_\_page\_\_, and any
>   user variables such as authentication data.
> * Updated documentation to explain underscore prefixed names in
>   execution context are protected from browser modification.
> * Applied bugfix from Detlef Lannert - null attributes would
>   raise a TypeError (for example: <AL-IMG EXPR="..."
>   ALT="">). Once fixed, this exposed another bug where
>   an attribute with a null value would lose it's value altogether
>   (XHTML requires attributes to have a value, null or
>   otherwise).
> * Exception text is now escaped before being sent to
>   browser.
> * The PageModuleMixin does not reload a page module if was
>   previously loaded by unpickling the session. This is to avoid a
>   problem with new code in the Python 2.2 pickle/cPickle module which
>   causes the following to fail.
>   ```
>
>   import pickle, copy
>   o = copy._EmptyClass()
>   reload(copy)
>   pickle.dumps(o, 1)
>
>   ```
> * Pickling errors are now trapped by looking for the PickleError
>   exception.
> * Bug prevented nameexpr from being used in <AL-TEXTAREA> and
>   <AL-SELECT>.
> * Radio input was converting "value\_attr" to str(), but
>   not "value", which was causing the "checked"
>   test to fail if value was anything but a string. Also changed
>   checkbox input to convert both to strings before doing the
>   comparison.

##### 20 August 2002 - Albatross 1.00 released

> Changes in this release include:
>
> * PageModuleError is raised when a page module is loaded which does not
>   define one of page\_enter(), page\_leave(), page\_process() or
>   page\_display().
> * Application merge\_request() method now defers browser request merging to
>   the execution context. This allows the RecorderMixin class to define the
>   correct request merging process.
> * Include filename in template load errors - when templates are loaded by
>   any means other than <al-include>, the filename was often not in the
>   traceback.
> * When you use FormRecorderMixin you must now specify LIST attribute on
>   <AL-INPUT> and <AL-TEXTAREA> tags if more than one field in a
>   form has the same name. This also causes the request merging to always
>   place those input values into a list in the local namespace regardless of
>   how many values were sent by the browser. FieldTypeError is raised when
>   LIST attribute value is inconsistent with multiple/singular instances of an
>   input field in a form.
> * Replaced all relative module imports with absolute imports to avoid
>   namespace clashes.
> * Several SessionFileAppMixin portability fixes - use "rb" and "wb" mode
>   on open of session files for windows portability, and improvements to
>   handling of platforms without /dev/urandom.
> * albatross.random module renamed to albatross.randompage.
> * SessionFileAppMixin now checks that the session-id returned from the
>   browser does not contain any filesystem path components that could be used
>   to access files outside the session file directory.
> * Tag constructors are now passed the execution context as the first
>   argument, which makes them consistent with other methods, and allows greater
>   flexibility in code placement.
> * Macros are now registered at load time, rather than execution (to\_html)
>   - this allows forward references, and other tricks.
> * New "ellipsis" mode for tree iterator, which are a variant of lazy trees
>   where nodes at shallower levels are progressively collapsed into ellipses as
>   the user opens deeper nodes. The user can reopen the collapsed nodes by
>   selecting an ellipsis.
> * TreeIterators now support get\_open\_aliases(), get\_selected\_aliases(),
>   set\_open\_aliases(), set\_selected\_aliases() methods to set and get open and
>   selected nodes for the TreeIterator. This allows you to enter a page with
>   tree nodes already open or selected, and also to save the state of the tree
>   for future use.
> * Added a basic /etc/init.d style rc script for the TCP session server.
>   The session server script is now installed to you scripts directory
>   (typically /usr/local/bin). Session server component modules simpleserver
>   and pidfile are now installed into the albatross module directory, along
>   with the rest of albatross.

##### 15 March 2002 - Albatross 0.06 released

> Changes in this release include:
>
> * The template parse has been enhanced to handle attribute values
>   enclosed with either single or double quotes. The enclosing quote
>   character can be used in the attribute string if it is escaped by a
>   backslash ('\'). Attribute values can be broken over multiple lines.
> * All pickles sent to browser are now MD5 signed to detect and prevent
>   modification. New pickle security techniques can be defined by defining a
>   replacement for the PickleSignMixin class.
> * The new RandomPageModuleMixin class now allows you to build applications
>   which use the request URL to determine which page module will be used to
>   process the browser request.
> * A set of classes for implementing file based server side sessions has
>   been added.
> * The simple session server can now be run as a daemon under Unix.
> * Program mainline for mod\_python deployment has been simplified. You now
>   hook into mod\_python like this:
>   ```
>   def handler(req):
>       return app.run(Request(req))
>   ```
>   instead of this:
>   ```
>   from mod_python import apache
>       :
>   def handler(req):
>       app.run(Request(req))
>       return apache.OK
>   ```
> * New redirect() execution context method for doing browser
>   redirection.
> * Session saving can be disabled via the new set\_save\_session()
>   method.
> * The samples have been completely reorganised and documentation updated
>   to make them less confusing. An installation program has been provided to
>   reduce the pain of running the samples.
> * Many documentation improvements.

##### 14 January 2002 - Albatross 0.05 released

> Changes in this release include:
>
> * Many documentation fixes.
> * Documentation for macro tags has been completed.
> * New calendar example extension tag.
> * Fixed infinite recursion bug in nested macro expansion.
> * All interactive examples in documentation are now validated via 'make
>   test' in the doc directory.
> * Lots of new unit tests.

##### 26 December 2001 - Albatross 0.04 released

> First public release of Albatross.

Package        : albatross
Vulnerability  : design error
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2006-0044

A design error has been discovered in the Albatross web application
toolkit that causes user supplied data to be used as part of template
execution and hence arbitrary code execution.

The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain albatross packages.

For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.20-2.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.33-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your albatross package.
