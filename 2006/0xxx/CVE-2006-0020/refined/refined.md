Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2006-0020:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a memory corruption issue within Internet Explorer's handling of Windows Metafile (WMF) images. Specifically, when processing a specially crafted WMF image, the software incorrectly manages memory allocation, leading to a buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of WMF image files leading to memory corruption.
- Lack of proper validation of the length of messages before passing them to allocated buffer.
- Buffer overflow vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution, enabling an attacker to gain complete control of the affected system.
- Ability to install programs, view, change, or delete data, and create new user accounts with full privileges.
- Compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of user data and processing resources.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-based attacks:** Hosting a malicious website containing a specially crafted WMF image that exploits the vulnerability when a user visits the site. This includes websites accepting user-provided content, advertisements, and compromised websites.
- **Email-based attacks:** Embedding a malicious WMF image in an email message and exploiting the vulnerability when the user opens/previews the email or an attachment.
- Other vectors: banner advertisements, instant messenger links to malicious websites, etc.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious WMF image.
- For web-based attacks, they need to host this image on a web server and entice the victim to visit the page.
- For email-based attacks, they need to send an email with the malicious image to the victim.
- The attacker does not need access to the victim's machine.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Internet Explorer 5.01 Service Pack 4 on Windows 2000 Service Pack 4.
- Systems running Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 or later are not vulnerable.
- Microsoft released a security update ([MS06-004](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS06-004.mspx)) to address the issue.
- The vulnerability is separate from issues addressed in MS05-053 and MS06-001.

This vulnerability is classified as **Critical** because it allows for remote code execution without user interaction.
