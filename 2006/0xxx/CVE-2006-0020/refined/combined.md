How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## In this article

## Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer (910620)

Published: February 14, 2006

**Version:** 1.0

#### Summary

**Who should read this document:** Customers who use Microsoft Windows

**Impact of Vulnerability:** Remote Code Execution

**Maximum Severity Rating:** Critical

**Recommendation:** Customers should apply the update immediately.

**Security Update Replacement:** This update replaces the update that is included with Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS05-054](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=53511). That update is also a cumulative update.

**Caveats:** [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 910620](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/910620) documents the currently known issues that customers may experience when they install this security update. The article also documents recommended solutions for these issues. For more information, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 910620](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/910620).

This update does include hotfixes that have been released since the release of [MS04-004](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=22189) and [MS04-025](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=31981), but they will only be installed on systems that need them.

## Vulnerability Details

#### WMF Image Parsing Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2006-0020:

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Internet Explorer because of the way that it handles Windows Metafile (WMF) images. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted WMF image that could potentially allow remote code execution if a user visited a malicious Web site, opened or previewed an e-mail message, or opened a specially crafted attachment in e-mail. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system.

Note that this vulnerability in Internet Explorer is separate from the vulnerabilities addressed in Windows in MS05-053 and MS06-001.

#### Mitigating Factors for WMF Image Parsing Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2006-0020:

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. Also, Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements, and compromised Web sites, may contain malicious content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger request that takes users to the attackerâs Web site.
* In an e-mail based attack of this exploit, customers would have to open a malicious e-mail message, preview a malicious e-mail message in the Outlook Express preview pane, click on a link that would take them to a malicious Web site, or open an attachment that could exploit the vulnerability. Users can disable the preview pane in Outlook Express and delete the suspicious e-mail message without opening the e-mail message. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* In an e-mail based attack of this exploit, customers would have to open a malicious e-mail message, preview a malicious e-mail message in the Outlook preview pane, click on a link that would take them to a malicious Web site, or open an attachment that could exploit the vulnerability. Users can disable the preview pane in Outlook and delete the suspicious e-mail message without opening the e-mail message. Customers who read e-mail in plain text in Outlook would have to click on a link that would take them to a malicious Web site, or open an attachment to be at risk from this vulnerability.
* Customers who have installed [Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/downloads/critical/ie6sp1/default.mspx) are not affected by this vulnerability and are also not affected by exploits attempting to utilize this vulnerability using the e-mail mail vector.
* Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 is the only supported version for Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition, and Windows Millennium.
* This issue does not affect Windows XP Service Pack 1, Windows XP Service Pack 2, Windows XP Professional x64 Edition, Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1, Windows Server 2003 for Itanium-based Systems, Windows Server 2003 with Service Pack 1 for Itanium-based Systems, or Windows Server 2003 x64 Edition. These Windows versions include Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 or later versions.

#### Workarounds for WMF Image Parsing Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2006-0020:

No workarounds have been identified for this vulnerability.

Customers using Windows 2000 Service pack 4 with Internet Explorer 5.01 Service Pack 4 are strongly encouraged to apply the update or install [Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/downloads/critical/ie6sp1/default.mspx).

#### FAQ for WMF Image Parsing Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2006-0020:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could remotely take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

When Internet Explorer displays a Web page that contains a specially crafted WMF image, system memory may be corrupted in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code.

**What is the Windows Metafile (WMF) image format?**

A Windows Metafile (WMF) image is a 16-bit metafile format that can contain both vector information and bitmap information. It is optimized for the Windows operating system.

For more information about image types and formats, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 320314](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/320314) or visit the [MSDN Library Web site](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ms536391.aspx).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability by posting a specially crafted WMF image on a Web site?**

An attacker could host a malicious Web site that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then persuade a user to view the Web site. This can also include Web sites that accept user-provided content or advertisements, Web sites that host user-provided content or advertisements, and compromised Web sites. These Web sites could contain malicious Windows Metafile (WMF) images that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or in an Instant Messenger request that takes users to the attacker's Web site. It could also be possible to display specially crafted Web content by using banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver Web content to affected systems.

**Could this vulnerability be exploited through other vectors?**

Yes. An attacker could, for example, embed a specially crafted WMF image in an e-mail message.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability requires that a user is logged on and visits a Web site for any malicious action to occur. Therefore, any systems where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability.

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that Internet Explorer validates the length of a message before it passes the message to the allocated buffer.

**Does this vulnerability affect image formats other than Windows Metafile (WMF)?**

The only image format affected is the Windows Metafile (WMF) format. It is possible, however, that an attacker could rename the file name extension of a WMF file to that of a different image format. In this situation, Internet Explorer could detect and render the file as a WMF image by using its [MIME type detection](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/aa302360) functionality, which could allow exploitation.

Users can block file types by extension to provide additional defense in depth safeguards. However, it is important for content filtering to be performed on file headers that are associated with content downloaded from the Internet or that are received in e-mail messages.

**If I block .wmf images by extension, can this protect me against attempts to exploit this vulnerability?**

No. Internet Explorer does not determine file types by the file name extensions that they use. Therefore, if an attacker alters the file name extension of a WMF image, Internet Explorer could still render the file in a way that could exploit the vulnerability.

**Is this issue related to Microsoft Security Bulletin MS05-053 - Vulnerabilities in Graphics Rendering Engine Could Allow Code Execution (896424), which was released in November 2005?**

No, these are different and separate issues.

**Is this issue related to Microsoft Security Bulletin MS06-001 - Vulnerabilities in Graphics Rendering Engine Could Allow Code Execution (912919), which was released in January 2006?**

No, these are different and separate issues.

**Is this issue related to a public posting discussing specially crafted WMF images that could potentially cause the application using the Windows Graphics Rendering Engine to crash?**

No, these are different and separate issues. That posting has been discussed in the [Microsoft Security Response Center Blog](https://blogs.technet.com/msrc/archive/2006/01/09/417198.aspx)

**Are Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition, or Windows Millennium Edition critically affected by the vulnerability that is addressed in this security bulletin?**

No. This vulnerability does not exist on Windows 98, on Windows 98 Second Edition, or on Windows Millennium Edition with Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1, which is the only supported version of Internet Explorer on these versions of Windows. For more information about severity ratings, visit the following Web site. Microsoft will provide security updates on the operating systems that are affected and the severity rating is critical through June 30, 2006. It should be a priority for customers who have these operating system versions to migrate to supported versions to prevent potential exposure to vulnerabilities. For more information about the Windows Product Lifecycle, visit the following Microsoft Support Lifecycle Web site.

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you can use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. MBSA allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).

* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.
     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.
     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry key:

HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Internet Explorer 5.01\SP4\KB910620-IE501SP4-20060112.143924\Filelist

**Note** This registry key may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, this registry key may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams the 910620 security update into the Windows installation source files.

**Systems Management Server:**

Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) delivers a highly-configurable enterprise solution for managing updates. By using SMS, administrators can identify Windows-based systems that require security updates and can perform controlled deployment of these updates throughout the enterprise with minimal disruption to end users. For more information about how administrators can use SMS 2003 to deploy security updates, visit the [SMS 2003 Security Patch Management Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=22939). SMS 2.0 users can also use [Software Updates Service Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33340) to help deploy security updates. For information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

**Note** SMS uses the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer, the Microsoft Office Detection Tool, and the Enterprise Update Scanning Tool to provide broad support for security bulletin update detection and deployment. Some software updates may not be detected by these tools. Administrators can use the inventory capabilities of the SMS in these cases to target updates to specific systems. For more information about this procedure, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33341). Some security updates require administrative rights following a restart of the system. Administrators can use the Elevated Rights Deployment Tool (available in the [SMS 2003 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33387) and in the [SMS 2.0 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21161)) to install these updates.

## Microsoft WMF memory corruption vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#312956

Original Release Date: 2006-02-09 | Last Revised: 2006-02-14

---

### Overview

Microsoft applications fail to properly handle Windows Metafile (WMF) images potentially allowing a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.

### Description

| The Microsoft Windows Graphics Rendering Engine supports a number of [image formats](http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;320314) including WMF images. Windows WMF processing routines do not properly handle WMF images. This may allow a remote attacker to manipulate memory management routines resulting in a buffer overflow. Note that WMF processing is used in many Windows programs including Internet Explorer and Outlook.  For more information, including a list of affected versions of Internet Explorer, please see Microsoft Security Advisory [913333](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/advisory/913333.mspx) and Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS06-004](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS06-004.mspx). |
| --- |

### Impact

| By persuading a user to open a specially crafted WMF image file, an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user. |
| --- |

### Solution

| This issue is corrected in [Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/downloads/critical/ie6sp1/default.mspx). In addition, Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS06-004](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS06-004.mspx) contains a cumulative update to correct this vulnerability. |
| --- |

| **Do not accept WMF files from untrusted sources**  By only accessing WMF image files from trusted or known sources, the chances of exploitation are reduced. |

Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Security Update Severity Rating System

Attacks that impact customers' systems rarely result from attackers' exploitation of previously unknown vulnerabilities. Rather, they exploit vulnerabilities for which patches are available but not applied. For this reason, Microsoft recommends that customers make patching a priority. Currently available updates are listed in the [Security Update Guide](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/).

However, not all vulnerabilities are equally severe. To help customers understand the risk associated with each vulnerability we patch, we have published a severity rating system that rates each vulnerability according to the worst theoretical outcome were that vulnerability to be exploited.

| Rating | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Critical | A vulnerability whose exploitation could allow code execution ***without*** user interaction. These scenarios include self-propagating malware (e.g. network worms), or unavoidable common use scenarios where code execution occurs without warnings or prompts. This could mean browsing to a web page or opening email.  Microsoft recommends that customers apply Critical updates immediately. |
| Important | A vulnerability whose exploitation could result in compromise of the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of user data, or of the integrity or availability of processing resources. These scenarios include common use scenarios where client is compromised ***with***warnings or prompts regardless of the prompt's provenance, quality, or usability. Sequences of user actions that do not generate prompts or warnings are also covered.  Microsoft recommends that customers apply Important updates at the earliest opportunity. |
| Moderate | Impact of the vulnerability is mitigated to a significant degree by factors such as authentication requirements or applicability only to non-default configurations.  Microsoft recommends that customers consider applying the security update. |
| Low | Impact of the vulnerability is comprehensively mitigated by the characteristics of the affected component. Microsoft recommends that customers evaluate whether to apply the security update to the affected systems. |

The measure of a vulnerability’s severity is distinct from the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited. To assess that likelihood, the [Microsoft Exploitability Index](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/cc998259) provides additional information to help customers better prioritize the deployment of Microsoft security updates. This index provides customers with guidance on the likelihood of functioning exploit code being developed for vulnerabilities addressed by Microsoft security updates, within the first thirty days of that update's release.

While this severity rating system is intended to provide a broadly objective assessment of each issue, we strongly encourage customers to evaluate their own environments and make decisions about which updates are required to protect their systems.
