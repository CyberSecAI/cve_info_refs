Package        : squirrelmail
Vulnerability  : several

Debian Bug     : 354062 354063 354064 355424

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Squirrelmail, a
commonly used webmail system.  The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2006-0188

    Martijn Brinkers and Ben Maurer found a flaw in webmail.php that
    allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web pages into the right
    frame via a URL in the right_frame parameter.

CVE-2006-0195

    Martijn Brinkers and Scott Hughes discovered an interpretation
    conflict in the MagicHTML filter that allows remote attackers to
    conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via style sheet
    specifiers with invalid (1) "/*" and "*/" comments, or (2) slashes
    inside the "url" keyword, which is processed by some web browsers
    including Internet Explorer.

CVE-2006-0377

    Vicente Aguilera of Internet Security Auditors, S.L. discovered a
    CRLF injection vulnerability, which allows remote attackers to
    inject arbitrary IMAP commands via newline characters in the mailbox
    parameter of the sqimap_mailbox_select command, aka "IMAP
    injection." There's no known way to exploit this yet.

For the old stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.6-5.

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 2:1.4.4-8.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 2:1.4.6-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your squirrelmail package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

# SquirrelMail: Cross-site scripting and IMAP command injection — GLSA **200603-09**

SquirrelMail is vulnerable to several cross-site scripting vulnerabilities
and IMAP command injection.

### Affected packages

| Package | **mail-client/squirrelmail** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.4.6** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.4.6** |

### Background

SquirrelMail is a webmail package written in PHP. It supports IMAP
and SMTP protocols.

### Description

SquirrelMail does not validate the right\_frame parameter in
webmail.php, possibly allowing frame replacement or cross-site
scripting (CVE-2006-0188). Martijn Brinkers and Scott Hughes discovered
that MagicHTML fails to handle certain input correctly, potentially
leading to cross-site scripting (only Internet Explorer,
CVE-2006-0195). Vicente Aguilera reported that the
sqimap\_mailbox\_select function did not strip newlines from the mailbox
or subject parameter, possibly allowing IMAP command injection
(CVE-2006-0377).

### Impact

By exploiting the cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, an
attacker can execute arbitrary scripts running in the context of the
victim's browser. This could lead to a compromise of the user's webmail
account, cookie theft, etc. A remote attacker could exploit the IMAP
command injection to execute arbitrary IMAP commands on the configured
IMAP server.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All SquirrelMail users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-client/squirrelmail-1.4.6"
```

Note: Users with the vhosts USE flag set should manually use
webapp-config to finalize the update.
