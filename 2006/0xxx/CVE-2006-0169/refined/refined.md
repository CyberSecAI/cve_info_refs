{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of the `$pdbfile` variable within the `addresses.php3` script, and the absence of file type and content checks.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Arbitrary File Upload.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can upload arbitrary files to the server. The uploaded files will be placed in the `uploads/[username]_[filename]` directory which is not protected by default.",
  "Attack vectors": "By using the \"Load Pilot File\" page, an attacker can upload a file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to access the vulnerable 'Load Pilot File' page and upload a file."
