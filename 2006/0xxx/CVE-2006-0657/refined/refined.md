Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2006-0657:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of sanitization of user-provided input, specifically usernames and passwords, within the PHP Event Calendar application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** User-supplied usernames and passwords are not sanitized before being written to the `users.php` file. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts (XSS) into the application.
*   **User Data Corruption:**  The lack of sanitization also enables an attacker to corrupt user data by inserting arbitrary code into the `users.php` file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **XSS:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that could be executed in the browsers of other users, leading to actions such as:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites
    *   Stealing cookies
    *   Defacing the application.
*  **User Data Corruption:** By inserting malicious code, attackers can potentially cause the application to malfunction or alter user data, leading to incorrect information, loss of data or application errors.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote:**  The attack can be carried out remotely by a registered user of the PHP Event Calendar application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Registered User:** The attacker must be a registered user of the PHP Event Calendar application.
*   **Ability to Change Profile Information:** The attacker must be able to modify their username and password through the application's interface.
