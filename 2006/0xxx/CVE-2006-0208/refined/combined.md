# Hardened PHP

PHP is far and away the most popular backend programming
language today, with more than 80 websites worldwide taking advantage of PHP
solutions.

All of the most popular CMS platforms – including WordPress,
Joomla!, and Drupal (just to name a few) leverage this technology. It’s
flexibility and versatility make it a powerhouse programming language, but that
doesn’t necessarily mean that it is as secure as it could or should be “right
out of the box”, so to speak.

It’s popularity, it’s widespread adaptation, and its
relatively easy to learn structure has made PHP a major target for cyber
criminals and hackers to exploit. This is why it’s mission-critical that you
harden your PHP files server-side as much as possible, protecting your server,
your content, and your visitors from these kinds of dangerous exploits.

PHP can be hardened manually as well as with patching
protocols. Below we highlight the steps you’ll want to take to make sure that
your PHP installation is as locked down as possible.

**Locate the PHP Config File You’re Hardening on Your Server**

The very first step in hardening your PHP installation is
first finding the PHP configuration file on your server to begin with.

Depending on the hosting that you are taking advantage of
(the actual provider as well as the type of hosting you have selected) it can
be in a variety of different locations. The best way to quickly locate this
critical file is to simply do a server-side search for “PHP.ini” as this is the
actual file that you’ll want to modify, edit, and harden moving forward.

**Editing the File on Shared Hosting**

Individuals looking to harden their PHP on a shared hosting platform (see [The Blog Starter](https://www.theblogstarter.com/) for hosting options) will have a bit of a tougher hill to climb, if only because most providers do not offer root access to the server with this level of hosting.

You’ll have to contact your hosting provider directly to see
if you can edit the main PHP.ini file itself. In the event that you aren’t
allowed this kind of access, you can still request to have access to the
“.HTaccess” file on your server to make the changes you need to.

You won’t be able to make changes quite as quickly this way
as you would have been able to with a patch (like we highlight below), but you
can manually make individual line edits to your PHP settings this way to enjoy
a higher level of security.

Shared hosting may still have limitations on the PHP elements you can edit no matter how much access you are granted. If you want total control over hardening your PHP (and total control over the security of your web platform), it’s not a bad idea to move to Dedicated or VPS servers if you can afford it.

**Editing the File on Dedicated/VPS servers**

If you are moving forward with a Virtual Private Server
(VPS) or Dedicated server set up the process for hardening your PHP is a lot
easier, though it’s still not as quick as applying a server wide patch like we
highlight below.

In the backend administration toolset of your server
solution you’ll find a tool called the Web Host Manager. This is usually
located under the “Service Configuration” settings option in your backend
dashboard.

This tool is going to allow you to select the PHP
Configuration Editor, and editor that allows you to make changes to your
PHP.ini file through a more user-friendly interface than actually downloading
the file, opening it up in Notepad or a similar application, and then making
the edits individually with the actual source code itself.

There are a handful of individual settings that you’re going
to want to reconfigure manually when taking this approach to hardening your PHP
installation, including (but not limited to):

•           Remote
Connections

•           Run Time
Settings

•           Input Data
Restrictions

•           Error
Handling

•           Restrict
File Access

•           File
Uploads

•           Session
Security

•           Soap Cache

… And that’s just the tip of the iceberg.

**Use a Patch like Suhosin to Harden PHP Almost Instantly**

The big attraction behind PHP is that it is so easy to learn,
so easy to develop with, and about as flexible as a programming language gets –
and that’s why a lot of people feel comfortable hardening their PHP manually,
running line by line through their PHP.ini file and doing the heavy lifting of
securing their system on their own.

And while you may be a top-tier programmer and feel
completely confident in your coding prowess, the truth of the matter is that if
you allow ANY coding from ANY outside developers to run on your server you’ll
still have vulnerabilities that you may not be able to address independently –
vulnerabilities that can compromise your entire platform.

This is why patching your PHP systemwide is such a savvy
move, and why so many developers, programmers, and website/web application
owners utilizing PHP decide to move forward with a solution like Suhosin.

Engineered specifically to provide an advanced layer of
protection to PHP installations, the Suhosin patch is a dual action component
that provides a level of hardening that may not be possible through any other
manual approach.

On the one hand, Suhosin works to patch the PHP core on your
server. This allows this patch to protect against issues like format string
vulnerabilities, buffer overflows, and other issues that may plague your as of
yet unsecured PHP installation.

On the other hand, Suhosin also acts as an extension to the
PHP that has already been installed on your server. This extension runs 24/7,
around-the-clock, to protect against all kinds of vulnerabilities (including
runtime vulnerabilities) as well as individual session issues while adding a
whole host of logging, filtering, and administrative tools at the same time.

Best of all, the installation of this PHP hardening patch is
about as simple and as straightforward as it gets.

All of the features it has to offer exist within its
extension module and “flipping the switch” to allow that extension to run is as
easy as activating the individual extension inside of the PHP.ini file.
Sometimes you’ll have to manually add a couple of extra Configuration
Directives to trigger the full suite of extension capabilities, but most of the
time the Suhosin patch works just as soon as the edits to the PHP.ini file go
live.

php security update (RHSA-2006-0276)

Original Release Date: July 5, 2006

Last Revised: February 22, 2008

Number: ASA-2006-129

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 4.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

PHP is a general purpose scripting language widely used in World Wide Web
(WWW)pages and applications.

PHP's phpinfo() function was found to contain an issue in how it sanitized
long strings. If an attacker could identify a site using the phpinfo()
call in publicly-available PHP programs, they could possibly use cross-site
scriptings attacks against the site. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2006-0996](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-0996) to this issue.

PHP's html\_entity\_decode() function was discovered not to properly handle
binary content. This could possibly allow a malicious user to disclose the
contents of a certain part of memory. To take advantage of this, an
attacker would have to find a site using the html\_entity\_decode() function
accepting untrusted input from users and showing the results. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2006-1490](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-1490) to this issue.

A bug was found in PHP's error handling output that, under certain
conditions, would not properly escape HTML output. If a site had both the
"display\_errors" and "html\_errors" PHP enabled, an attacker could possibly
take advantage of this vulnerability to use cross-site scripting attacks
against the site. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2006-0208](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-0208) to the issue.

The mb\_send\_mail() function in PHP was found to contain an input validation
issue. Utilizing this bug, an attacker could inject arbitrary e-mail
headers into an email sent by a script calling the mb\_send\_mail() function,
particularly where the "To" e-mail header can be set by the attacker. The
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned
the name
[CVE-2005-3883](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-3883) to this issue.

The IMAP server provided by the University of Washington (uw-imap) was found
to contain a buffer overflow vulnerability. As the php-imap package in Red
Hat Enterprise Linux 3 was compiled against the static c-client libraries
from the vulnerable version of uw-imap, php-imap needed to be rebuilt
against the fixed version of uw-imap. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2005-2933](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-2933) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security
advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2006-0276.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with php installed:

**Recommended Actions:**
For all system products which use vulnerable
versions of php, Avaya recommends that customers restrict local and network
access to the server. This restriction should be enforced through the use of
physical security, firewalls, ACLs, VPNs, and other generally-accepted
networking practices until such time as an update becomes available and can
be installed.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating
system or applications that come with the operating system. These
vulnerabilities often do not impact the software-only product directly but
may threaten the integrity of the underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by
the vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be.
Customers should determine on which Linux operating system the product was
installed and then follow that vendors guidance:

## 4. Software-Only Products:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Interactive Response(IR) | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected packages may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IR application. The IR application does not require the software described in this advisory. |
| CVLAN | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected packages may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. The CVLAN application does not require the software described in this advisory. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite(IMS) | All | Low | See recommended actions below. |

**Recommended Actions:**
Avaya recommends installing the appropriate
patch from the Operating System Vendor (e.g. Red Hat).

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=178028#c0)  Josh Bressers    2006-01-17 15:11:40 UTC  ``` PHP 5.1.2 has been released: <http://www.php.net/release_5_1_2.php>  The release announcement mentions this security fix:     * Possible cross-site scripting problems in certain error conditions.  The problem exists in the way PHP displays error messages.  This issue is only exploitable when 'display_errors' and 'html_errors' are both set to 'On' in the PHP configuration file.  When a HTML error message was being generated, the output was not properly sanitized, which could allow an attacker to insert arbitrary HTML, thus allowing a XSS attack.  This issue is only exploitable if 'html_errors' is on, which the configuration file cleary states should not be used on production machines.  I have verified this flaw exists in the PHP 4.3 and 5.1 branches.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=178028#c1)  Josh Bressers    2006-01-17 15:42:43 UTC  ``` This issue also affects RHEL3 and RHEL2.1   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=178028#c4)  Red Hat Bugzilla    2006-04-25 14:28:31 UTC  ```  An advisory has been issued which should help the problem described in this bug report. This report is therefore being closed with a resolution of ERRATA. For more information on the solution and/or where to find the updated files, please follow the link below. You may reopen this bug report if the solution does not work for you.  <http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2006-0276.html>    ``` |  |

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2006%3A0276)

## Topic

Updated PHP packages that fix multiple security issues are now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and 4.

This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language commonly used with the Apache
HTTP Web server.

The phpinfo() PHP function did not properly sanitize long strings. An
attacker could use this to perform cross-site scripting attacks against
sites that have publicly-available PHP scripts that call phpinfo().
(CVE-2006-0996)

The html\_entity\_decode() PHP function was found to not be binary safe. An
attacker could use this flaw to disclose a certain part of the memory. In
order for this issue to be exploitable the target site would need to have a
PHP script which called the "html\_entity\_decode()" function with untrusted
input from the user and displayed the result. (CVE-2006-1490)

The error handling output was found to not properly escape HTML output in
certain cases. An attacker could use this flaw to perform cross-site
scripting attacks against sites where both display\_errors and html\_errors
are enabled. (CVE-2006-0208)

An input validation error was found in the "mb\_send\_mail()" function. An
attacker could use this flaw to inject arbitrary headers in a mail sent via
a script calling the "mb\_send\_mail()" function where the "To" parameter can
be controlled by the attacker. (CVE-2005-3883)

A buffer overflow flaw was discovered in uw-imap, the University of
Washington's IMAP Server. php-imap is compiled against the static c-client
libraries from imap and therefore needed to be recompiled against the fixed
version. This issue only affected Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3.
(CVE-2005-2933).

Users of PHP should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
backported patches that resolve these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

    pairs with the same key for cdb handler.
  + Added locking for those handlers that do not have their own locking.
  + Added support for magic\_quotes\_runtime php.ini option.

* PHP now has a new stream system that allows it to do some clever stuff with
  fopen() and fsockopen(). As a result:
  + URL wrappers natively supports https:// URLs if you have compiled
    OpenSSL support into PHP (shared extension does not support this).
  + Added support for fopen("ftps://...", ...) which allows to connect to FTP
    servers via SSL. (Stefan Esser)
  + fsockopen() adds support for ssl:// and tls:// connections via TCP/IP
  + copy($srcfilename, $destfilename) can now be used with URL wrappers
  + zlib wrappers/streams can be used even on systems without
    fopencookie()
  + Changed 'zlib:' fopen wrapper to 'compress.zlib://' and deprecate
    'zlib:' to avoid ambiguities when filenames have ':' characters. (Wez)
  + Added 'compress.bzip2://' stream and wrapper support.
  + Added user-space streams - it is now possible to define a class in PHP
    code and register it as a URL wrapper. (stream\_register\_wrapper)
  + Most extensions now support streams when passing files, which means
    that those extensions will now also support URL wrappers. (Wez)
  + Added URL-wrapper support to exif. (Marcus)
  + Added memory stream support. (Marcus)
  + Renamed:
    - socket\_set\_timeout() -> stream\_set\_timeout()
    - socket\_set\_blocking() -> stream\_set\_blocking()
    - set\_file\_buffer() -> stream\_set\_write\_buffer()
    - socket\_get\_status() -> stream\_get\_meta\_data()As these functions can (in theory) work on any type of stream. (Wez)
  + Raw POST data is now available as "php://input" stream. (Hartmut)
  + fopen("php://output", "wb") returns a stream that writes to the output
    buffer (like echo and print). (Wez)
  + Added stream\_context\_create(), stream\_context\_set\_params() and
    stream\_context\_set\_option and added an optional fourth parameter to
    fopen() which accepts a stream context. Contexts allow sharing of
    information between streams (a kind of "session") and setting
    notification callbacks. (Wez)
  + Made the "User-Agent" header sent by http:// and https:// wrappers
    configurable in php.ini or via a stream context. (Sterling)
  + Added stream\_filter\_prepend() and stream\_filter\_append() which apply
    a filter to either the top or the bottom of a stream filter stack.
    Implemented "string.rot13" filter as an example; more filters are
    expected to follow in later releases and other extensions. (Wez)
  + Added stream\_select() which works like socket\_select but works on
    streams returned by fopen(), fsockopen() and pfsockopen() instead.
    (Wez)
  + Added STDIN, STDOUT and STDERR constants for CLI sapi reflecting opened
    streams to their respective standard I/O counterparts. (Edin)
  + Added php.ini option "auto\_detect\_line\_endings" which enables PHP to
    detect Macintosh, Unix and Dos end-of-line characters in fgets() and
    file(). Fixes bugs [#16521](http://bugs.php.net/16521) and [#16708](http://bugs.php.net/16708). (Wez)
  + Fixed include(), require() and GD functions to work with remote files
    under win32.
  + Fixed bug [#18609](http://bugs.php.net/18609) (ImageCreateFromJPEG can't fetch from a URL). (Wez)
* Fixed bug [#18022](http://bugs.php.net/18022) (fopen does not work with php://stdin anymore on Solaris).
  (Wez)
* Added php.ini option "default\_socket\_timeout" to set the timeout limit for
  PHP network streams. (kalowsky, ilia@prohost.org, Wez)
* Added file\_get\_contents() which returns the contents of a file as a string.
  This function also supports the URL wrappers. (Wez)
* Fixed bug [#19595](http://bugs.php.net/19595) (Missing functions for GD2 format handling). (Edin)
* Fixed bug [#19633](http://bugs.php.net/19633) (Wrong directories in ext/ldap/config.m4). (Derick)
* Fixed bugs [#17274](http://bugs.php.net/17274) and [#19627](http://bugs.php.net/19627) (segfault in sem\_remove). (Wez)

  paramaters. Instead, use a temporary variable or an expression with the
  leftmost member being a temporary variable. ex.:
  socket\_select($w, $r, $e = NULL, 10); (Jason)

  caused 'Error in php\_OLECHAR\_to\_char()' warnings on various places.
  Also modified the API to consistently return NULL in case of an error.
  (Alan, Harald)
* Fixed a bug in the COM extension that caused outproc servers to 'hang'
  because of a missing Release() call. (Alan, Harald)

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=182719#c0)  Sander Steffann    2006-02-24 09:36:34 UTC  ``` Description of problem:   Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):  PHP 4.3.9  How reproducible:  Use the function ImageCreateFromGif  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Create a PHP script that uses the function ImageCreateFromGif    Actual results:  The tempfile created by ImageCreateFromGif still exists  Expected results:  No tempfiles should remain  Additional info:  This causes a full /tmp partition on webservers that use the  ImageCreateFromGif function. This leads to server problems and can be used  as a DoS attack on the webserver by a local user. This is especially important  for webhosting providers like us, where there are many 'external' users who  can upload PHP scripts.   The bug has been fixed by the PHP developers on 2004/11/02, so I am very  disappointed that Red Hat has nog included this (imho important) fix yet.

# PHP 5.1.2. Release Announcement

The PHP development team is proud to announce the release of [PHP 5.1.2](/downloads.php).
This release combines small feature enhancements with a fair number of
bug fixes and addresses three security issues. All PHP 5 users are encouraged to
upgrade to this release.

The security issues resolved include the following:

* HTTP Response Splitting has been addressed in ext/session and in the
  header() function. Header() can no longer be used to send multiple
  response headers in a single call.
* Format string vulnerability in ext/mysqli.
* Possible cross-site scripting problems in certain error conditions.

The feature enhancements include the following notables:

* Hash extension was added to core and is now enabled by default. This
  extension provides support for most common hashing algorithms without
  reliance on 3rd party libraries.
* XMLWriter was added and enabled by default.
* New OCI8 extension that includes numerous fixes.
* PNG compression support added to the GD extension.
* Added --enable-gcov configure option to enable C-level code coverage.
* getNamespaces() and getDocNamespaces() methods added to SimpleXML extension.

The release also includes over 85 bug fixes with a focus on:

* Correction of the many regressions in the strtotime() function.
* Fixes of several crashes, leaks and memory corruptions found in the
  imap, pdo, gd, mysqli, mcrypt and soap extensions.
* Corrected problems with the usage of SSI and virtual() in the Apache2 SAPI.
* Build fixes for iconv and sybase\_ct extensions.
* Fixed the previously broken Sun(rise|set) functions.
* SQLite libraries upgraded to 2.8.17 and 3.2.8* Win32 binaries now include libxml2-2.6.22 and libxslt-1.1.15.

For a full list of changes in PHP 5.1.2, see the
[ChangeLog](/ChangeLog-5.php#5.1.2).

php security update (RHSA-2006-0501)

Original Release Date: August 17, 2006

Last Revised: October 10, 2008

Number: ASA-2006-160

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 6.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

PHP is a general purpose scripting language widely used in World Wide Web
(WWW) pages and applications.

The version of PHP and some of the PHP addons shipped with Red Hat Enterprise
Linux version 2.1 were found to contain security vulnerabilities. The
details of these vulnerabilities are described below.

PHP's phpinfo() routine was found not to correctly validate long strings. As
a result, an attacker could possibly use this as an attack vector for
cross-site scripting attacks against websites that provide
publicly-accessible PHP scripts containing the phpinfo() function. The
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned
the name
[CVE-2006-0996](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-0996) to this issue.

In select circumstances, the output of PHP's error handling functions was not
properly formatted HTML. Due to this issue, an attacker could possibly use
this as an attack vector for cross-site scripting attacks against web
sites that have enabled the "display\_errors" and "html\_errors" options in
php.ini. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name
[CVE-2006-0208](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-0208) to this issue.

The University of Washington's IMAP server (uw-imap) was found to have a
buffer overflow vulnerability. As the php-imap package is built against a
static version of the c-client libraries (provided by uw-imap), php-imap
needed to be rebuilt against a fixed version of the c-client libraries. The
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned
the name
[CVE-2005-2933](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-2933) to this issue.

PHP's wordwrap() routine was found to have issues with integer overflow
checking while processing the "break" parameter. An attacker could possibly
cause a heap overflow if they had control over the string passed to the
"break" parameter. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2006-1990](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-1990) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security
advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2006-0501.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with php installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya S87XX/S8500/S8300 | CM 2.2 Load 126 and prior | Low | Upgrade to CM 2.2 Load 127 or later in the CM 2.2 series or CM 3.1 or later in the CM 3.x series to remove PHP. |
| Avaya Intuity LX | IALX 1.x | Low | Upgrade to IALX 2.0 or later. |
| Avaya Messaging Storage Server | MSS 1.x - 3.x | Low | Upgrade to MSS 3.1 or later. |
| Avaya Message Networking | MN 1.x - 2.0 | Low | Upgrade to MN 3.1 or later. |

**Recommended Actions:**
For all system products which use vulnerable
versions of php, Avaya recommends that customers restrict local and network
access to the server. This restriction should be enforced through the use of
physical security, firewalls, ACLs, VPNs, and other generally-accepted
networking practices until such time as an update becomes available and can
be installed.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating
system or applications that come with the operating system. These
vulnerabilities often do not impact the software-only product directly but
may threaten the integrity of the underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by
the vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be.
Customers should determine on which Linux operating system the product was
installed and then follow that vendors guidance:

## 4. Software-Only Products:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Interactive Response(IR) | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected packages may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IR application. The IR application does not require the software described in this advisory. |
| CVLAN | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected packages may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. The CVLAN application does not require the software described in this advisory. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite(IMS) | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected packages may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. The IMS application does not require the software described in this advisory. |

**Recommended Actions:**
Avaya recommends that customers follow
recommended actions supplied by the Operating System vendor (e.g. RedHat
Linux) or remove the affected packages.

## 5. Additional Information:

Additional information may also be available via the Avaya support
[website](http://support.avaya.com) and through your Avaya account
representative. Please contact your Avaya product support representative, or
dial 1-800-242-2121, with any questions.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# PHP: Format string and XSS vulnerabilities — GLSA **200603-22**

Multiple vulnerabilities in PHP allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary
HTTP headers, perform cross site scripting or in some cases execute
arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-lang/php** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.4.2**revision >= **5.1.1**revision >= **5.0.5**revision >= **5.0.4** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **5.1.2** |

### Background

PHP is a general-purpose scripting language widely used to develop
web-based applications. It can run on a web server with the mod\_php
module or the CGI version and also stand-alone in a CLI.

### Description

Stefan Esser of the Hardened PHP project has reported a few
vulnerabilities found in PHP:

* Input passed to the session
  ID in the session extension isn't properly sanitised before being
  returned to the user via a "Set-Cookie" HTTP header, which can contain
  arbitrary injected data.
* A format string error while
  processing error messages using the mysqli extension in version 5.1 and
  above.

### Impact

By sending a specially crafted request, a remote attacker can
exploit this vulnerability to inject arbitrary HTTP headers, which will
be included in the response sent to the user. The format string
vulnerability may be exploited to execute arbitrary code.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All PHP 5.x users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-lang/php-5.1.2"
```

All PHP 4.x users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-lang/php-4.4.2"
```

# Hardened PHP

PHP is far and away the most popular backend programming
language today, with more than 80 websites worldwide taking advantage of PHP
solutions.

All of the most popular CMS platforms – including WordPress,
Joomla!, and Drupal (just to name a few) leverage this technology. It’s
flexibility and versatility make it a powerhouse programming language, but that
doesn’t necessarily mean that it is as secure as it could or should be “right
out of the box”, so to speak.

It’s popularity, it’s widespread adaptation, and its
relatively easy to learn structure has made PHP a major target for cyber
criminals and hackers to exploit. This is why it’s mission-critical that you
harden your PHP files server-side as much as possible, protecting your server,
your content, and your visitors from these kinds of dangerous exploits.

PHP can be hardened manually as well as with patching
protocols. Below we highlight the steps you’ll want to take to make sure that
your PHP installation is as locked down as possible.

**Locate the PHP Config File You’re Hardening on Your Server**

The very first step in hardening your PHP installation is
first finding the PHP configuration file on your server to begin with.

Depending on the hosting that you are taking advantage of
(the actual provider as well as the type of hosting you have selected) it can
be in a variety of different locations. The best way to quickly locate this
critical file is to simply do a server-side search for “PHP.ini” as this is the
actual file that you’ll want to modify, edit, and harden moving forward.

**Editing the File on Shared Hosting**

Individuals looking to harden their PHP on a shared hosting platform (see [The Blog Starter](https://www.theblogstarter.com/) for hosting options) will have a bit of a tougher hill to climb, if only because most providers do not offer root access to the server with this level of hosting.

You’ll have to contact your hosting provider directly to see
if you can edit the main PHP.ini file itself. In the event that you aren’t
allowed this kind of access, you can still request to have access to the
“.HTaccess” file on your server to make the changes you need to.

You won’t be able to make changes quite as quickly this way
as you would have been able to with a patch (like we highlight below), but you
can manually make individual line edits to your PHP settings this way to enjoy
a higher level of security.

Shared hosting may still have limitations on the PHP elements you can edit no matter how much access you are granted. If you want total control over hardening your PHP (and total control over the security of your web platform), it’s not a bad idea to move to Dedicated or VPS servers if you can afford it.

**Editing the File on Dedicated/VPS servers**

If you are moving forward with a Virtual Private Server
(VPS) or Dedicated server set up the process for hardening your PHP is a lot
easier, though it’s still not as quick as applying a server wide patch like we
highlight below.

In the backend administration toolset of your server
solution you’ll find a tool called the Web Host Manager. This is usually
located under the “Service Configuration” settings option in your backend
dashboard.

This tool is going to allow you to select the PHP
Configuration Editor, and editor that allows you to make changes to your
PHP.ini file through a more user-friendly interface than actually downloading
the file, opening it up in Notepad or a similar application, and then making
the edits individually with the actual source code itself.

There are a handful of individual settings that you’re going
to want to reconfigure manually when taking this approach to hardening your PHP
installation, including (but not limited to):

•           Remote
Connections

•           Run Time
Settings

•           Input Data
Restrictions

•           Error
Handling

•           Restrict
File Access

•           File
Uploads

•           Session
Security

•           Soap Cache

… And that’s just the tip of the iceberg.

**Use a Patch like Suhosin to Harden PHP Almost Instantly**

The big attraction behind PHP is that it is so easy to learn,
so easy to develop with, and about as flexible as a programming language gets –
and that’s why a lot of people feel comfortable hardening their PHP manually,
running line by line through their PHP.ini file and doing the heavy lifting of
securing their system on their own.

And while you may be a top-tier programmer and feel
completely confident in your coding prowess, the truth of the matter is that if
you allow ANY coding from ANY outside developers to run on your server you’ll
still have vulnerabilities that you may not be able to address independently –
vulnerabilities that can compromise your entire platform.

This is why patching your PHP systemwide is such a savvy
move, and why so many developers, programmers, and website/web application
owners utilizing PHP decide to move forward with a solution like Suhosin.

Engineered specifically to provide an advanced layer of
protection to PHP installations, the Suhosin patch is a dual action component
that provides a level of hardening that may not be possible through any other
manual approach.

On the one hand, Suhosin works to patch the PHP core on your
server. This allows this patch to protect against issues like format string
vulnerabilities, buffer overflows, and other issues that may plague your as of
yet unsecured PHP installation.

On the other hand, Suhosin also acts as an extension to the
PHP that has already been installed on your server. This extension runs 24/7,
around-the-clock, to protect against all kinds of vulnerabilities (including
runtime vulnerabilities) as well as individual session issues while adding a
whole host of logging, filtering, and administrative tools at the same time.

Best of all, the installation of this PHP hardening patch is
about as simple and as straightforward as it gets.

All of the features it has to offer exist within its
extension module and “flipping the switch” to allow that extension to run is as
easy as activating the individual extension inside of the PHP.ini file.
Sometimes you’ll have to manually add a couple of extra Configuration
Directives to trigger the full suite of extension capabilities, but most of the
time the Suhosin patch works just as soon as the edits to the PHP.ini file go
live.
