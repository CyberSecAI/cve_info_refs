      "content": "The Debian Security Advisory DSA 976-1 indicates a buffer overflow in libast, a library used by eterm which is installed setgid uid, leading to a vulnerability to alter the utmp file. The advisory mentions that the issue was discovered by Johnny Mast, and can lead to the execution of arbitrary code. The vulnerability was addressed in version 0.4-3woody2 for woody and version 0.6-0pre2003010606sarge1 for sarge.\n\nRoot cause of vulnerability: A buffer overflow in the libast library.\n\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Stack-based buffer overflow in libast's configuration file handling.\n\nImpact of exploitation: Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the vulnerable application, potentially leading to privilege escalation in the case of setuid/setgid programs. Specifically, the advisory mentions the vulnerability can lead to alteration of the utmp file when exploited through eterm.\n\nAttack vectors: The vulnerability can be triggered by using an alternative configuration file name by the '-X' option of eterm. This leads to a call to the `conf_find_file()` function in `conf.c` of LibAST, triggering the overflow.\n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs the ability to execute the vulnerable application (e.g., eterm) with a crafted configuration file path. The attacker has to provide an overly long file path via the '-X' command line option.",

      "content": "The Gentoo Security Advisory GLSA 200601-14 describes a buffer overflow vulnerability in the LibAST library. The advisory notes that vulnerable versions are prior to 0.7. This vulnerability allows for the execution of arbitrary code with escalated privileges if the application using LibAST is setuid/setgid. It also mentions that the vulnerability is triggered when a specifically crafted filename is passed to LibAST's configuration engine.\n\nRoot cause of vulnerability: A buffer overflow in the LibAST library's configuration engine.\n\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities present:  A stack-based buffer overflow in the configuration engine of LibAST.\n\nImpact of exploitation: Execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the application using the library, potentially leading to privilege escalation for setuid/setgid applications.\n\nAttack vectors: The vulnerability is triggered when a specifically crafted filename is passed to LibAST's configuration engine.\n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted file path/name to an application utilizing the vulnerable libast, particularly if the vulnerable application is setuid/setgid.",

       "content": "The Rosiello Security advisory describes a stack overflow vulnerability in LibAST that allows an attacker to execute commands with 'utmp' group privileges. The vulnerability is triggered when an alternative configuration file name is used via the '-X' option in Eterm. The advisory details the vulnerable code snippet:\n```c\nif (dir) {\n  strcpy(name, dir);\n  strcat(name, \"/\");\n  strcat(name, file);\n}\n```\nIt also mentions that the vulnerability can be exploited to gain control of the return address of the executing function, and it affects all versions of Eterm using LibAST prior to version 0.7. An exploit is available at http://www.rosiello.org/archivio/eterm-exploit.c.\n\nRoot cause of vulnerability:  A stack buffer overflow within the `conf_find_file()` function of LibAST, specifically due to the use of strcpy and strcat without bounds checking.\n\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities present: A stack-based buffer overflow. The vulnerable code uses strcpy and strcat without checking the size of the input string, leading to a buffer overflow when processing a long path/filename.\n\nImpact of exploitation: Arbitrary code execution with the user group 'utmp' privileges. The attacker gains control of the return address of the executing function.\n\nAttack vectors: The vulnerability is triggered by using the '-X' option of Eterm with a long file path. Eterm passes this to the `conf_find_file` in `conf.c` of LibAST which has the insecure string handling.\n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs to be able to execute Eterm and supply a long path using the -X command line parameter. The attacker also needs access to execute arbitrary code in the local machine.",
      "additional_details": "This advisory provides specific technical details, including the vulnerable code, and confirms the 'utmp' group privilege escalation, and the availability of an exploit. It also provides the CVE ID and CVSS score, clarifying attack complexity as low."
