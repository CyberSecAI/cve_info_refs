A remote code execution flaw was detected in Coppermine Picture Gallery 1.4.3 - this affects installations where user registrations are allowed and users are allowed to upload files. However it is strongly recommended that everyone patches their installations.

To manually patch your install open the file include/init.inc.php find the line
Code Select Expand`$USER['lang'] = $_GET['lang'];`
This is around line 301 and replace it with the line below
Code Select Expand`$USER['lang'] = ereg("^[a-z0-9_-]*$", $_GET['lang']) ? $_GET['lang'] : $CONFIG['lang'];`

next open the file docs/showdocs.php find the line
Code Select Expand `@include($file);`
This is around line 51 and replace it with the line below
Code Select Expand `@include('index.htm');`

Thats it! If editing code is not your cup of tea then use the files in the zip attached

Thanks to  rgod <http://retrogod.altervista.org/> for discovering these flaws and thanks to the dev team members Amit and Abbas for helping me fix this

Once again - this is a nasty one - PATCH NOW! or be OWNED!!

[edit GauGau]
New package cpg1.4.4 that includes the above mentioned patch has been released, see announcement thread "[Coppermine maintenance release cpg1.4.4 - upgrade as soon as possible](http://forum.coppermine-gallery.net/index.php?topic=28445.0)"

Patch applied. And I was just about to bridge my two forums, too.

Code Select Expand`$USER['lang'] = $_GET['lang'];`
Code Select Expand`$USER['lang'] = ereg("^[a-z0-9_-]*$", $_GET['lang']) ? $_GET['lang'] : $CONFIG['lang'];`
Code Select Expand`@include($file);`
Code Select Expand`@include('index.htm');`

Would you please explain what these four codes do, and how they related to the remote code execution flaw?

It is generally best to avoid giving a "how to" on security issues.  If you don't know why those lines are dangerous, all you need to know is that they are, and if you've applied the fixes, you're safe.

Last Edit: February 22, 2006, 11:08:10 AM by fredag@oien.net

On the front page of your web site, you call the security flaw which was recently discovered a "cross site scripting vulnerability". It seems you are deliberately playing down the seriousness of this security flaw. Secunia labels it "System access From remote" and "The vulnerability can be further exploited by users who are allowed to upload image files to execute arbitrary PHP code." It seems to me that is rather more serious than just "cross site scripting".

Given the seriousness of the security flaw which was discovered, shouldn't you guys have released a new proper version of coppermine yesterday or the day before, and not just expect people to patch? By not releasing a new proper version, sysadmins can't tell their users to just upgrade to the latest version of coppermine, because your latest version (1.4.3) is vulnerable.

Also: The so-called "patch" you have outlined only work on version 1.4.3 and not older versions like 1.3.3. Perhaps you should post some info on the various versions of coppermine and their security status? Which is safe to use and which is not.

As Tarique described it: "This is a nasty one".

1) cpg1.3.x isn't affected by the vulnerability as far as I can tell
2) we're currently working on a maintenance release

@freedag: Given the fact that only two files need to be replaced asking people to reinstall everything is being a plain PIA - for those who cannot patch a zip with correct files was provided...

While I agree that the website front page should be updated ASAP the points mentioned by Gaugau stand.

@Gaugau - time we declared 1.3.x as unsupported and removed all those downloads - Upgrade or perish!

It's the same fix for 1.3, which is vulnerable.

find

Code Select Expand`$USER['lang'] = $HTTP_GET_VARS['lang'];`

replace with

Code Select Expand`$USER['lang'] = ereg("^[a-z0-9_-]*$", $HTTP_GET_VARS['lang']) ? $HTTP_GET_VARS['lang'] : $CONFIG['lang'];`

yes, you have to apply the patch as well. Right now we're preparing a cpg1.4.4 maintenance release that will include the fix.
CPG1.4.3 or older doesn't contain the fix, you have to apply it manually.

If you know how to make a backup copy of the file (for just in case), and edit text in wordpad or notepad, you can do it.

Or you can download the attachment that contains the files in the first post.

I think this illustrates the usefulness of an announcements RSS feed.  I have subscribed to this forum for now, but RSS is obviously the way forward.  It would be quite simple to hand-code a static RSS file for the purpose.  Please consider this...

Any slowdown caused by the patch would be insignificant.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
