Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2006-0690:

**Summary:**

The provided information indicates that CVE-2006-0690, along with CVE-2006-0689 and CVE-2006-0691, relates to multiple vulnerabilities found in "Time Tracking Software" version 3.0 from TTS Software.

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Unauthorized Data Modification:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `edituser.php` script does not properly check user names and passwords, allowing modification of any user's data without proper authentication.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of proper authorization and authentication checks in the `edituser.php` script.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Direct access to `edituser.php` with a modified `num` parameter.

2.  **SQL Injection:**
    *   **Root Cause:** User-defined data is not properly sanitized, allowing injection of arbitrary SQL code.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of input sanitization for user-supplied data.
    *   **Impact:** Can be used to bypass authentication or execute arbitrary SQL queries.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Malicious SQL code injected through various input fields, demonstrated by injecting SQL code in the 'num' parameter of `edituser.php` and the password field in `login.php`.

3.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `UserName` value in the registration form is not properly sanitized.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of output encoding/sanitization of user-provided input before rendering on the page.
    *   **Impact:** Allows injection of arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code, potentially enabling malicious actions.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Malicious scripts injected through the `UserName` field in `register.php`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Data Modification:** Attackers can modify other user accounts, including potentially their own access levels and data.
*   **SQL Injection:** Attackers could potentially gain complete access to the database and modify, extract or delete sensitive data, bypass authentication to access the software, or compromise the web server.
*   **XSS:** Attackers can execute malicious JavaScript code in the browser of other users of the application, potentially leading to session hijacking, stealing of credentials, or defacing the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have network access to the web application.
*   The attacker does not need any valid credentials to modify data or perform SQL Injection.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered on 2006-02-08.
*   No solution is available from the vendor at the time of the report (2006-02-18).
*   The advisory mentions that exploitation code is published (IDEV0069).

**In summary,** the vulnerability is due to a combination of flaws related to lack of input sanitization, lack of authentication checks and lack of proper output encoding in the application. The severity is considered medium, however, the impact of exploitation can be very high.
