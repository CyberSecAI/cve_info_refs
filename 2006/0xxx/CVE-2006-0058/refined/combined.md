sendmail security update (RHSA-2006-0264 & RHSA-2006-0265)

Original Release Date: March 24, 2006

Last Revised: March 24, 2006

Number: ASA-2006-074

Risk Level: High

Advisory Version: 1.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

Sendmail is a Mail Transport Agent (MTA) used to send mail between
machines.

A flaw in the handling of asynchronous signals was discovered in
Sendmail.
An attacker may be able to exploit a race condition to execute
arbitrary code as root. Exploitation of this vulnerability requires
Sendmail to
listen for remote or local connections. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project has assigned the name
[CVE-2006-0058](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-0058) to this issue.

Certain Avaya Systems Products have vulnerable versions of sendmail
installed, and therefore may be vulnerable.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the
security
advisories issued by RedHat Linux and CERT:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2006-0264.html>
* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2006-0265.html>
* <http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/834865>

## 2. Avaya System Products with sendmail installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya S87x0, S8500, S8300 Media Servers | Versions prior to CM 2.0 | High | Prior to Communication Manager 2.0, sendmail is configured to listen for local and remote connections. Avaya recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions of Communication Manager. |
| Avaya S87x0, S8500, S8300 Media Servers | CM 2.0 and later | None | Prior to Communication Manager 3.1, the sendmail package is installed, however by default sendmail is not listening for remote or local connections. Communication Manager 3.1 and later have removed the sendmail package. These versions of Communication Manager are not vulnerable. |
 Avaya SIP Enablement Services (SES) Converged Communication Server (CCS) | All | None | The sendmail package is installed, however by default sendmail is not listening for remote or local connections. This product is not vulnerable. | Avaya Intuity LX | All | None | The sendmail package is installed, however by default sendmail is not listening for remote or local connections. This product is not vulnerable. || Avaya Messaging Storage Server | All | None | The sendmail package is installed, however by default sendmail is not listening for remote or local connections. This product is not vulnerable. |
| Avaya Message Networking | All | None | The sendmail package is installed, however by default sendmail is not listening for remote or local connections. This product is not vulnerable. |

**Recommended Actions:**

For all system products which use vulnerable versions of sendmail, Avaya
recommends that customers restrict local and network access to the
server. This
restriction should be enforced through the use of physical security,
firewalls,
ACLs, VPNs, and other generally-accepted networking practices until such
time as
an update becomes available and can be installed.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating
systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying
operating
system or applications that come with the operating system. These
vulnerabilities often do not impact the software-only product directly
but may
threaten the integrity of the underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not
affected by
the vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be.
Customers
should determine on which Linux operating system the product was
installed and
then follow that vendors guidance:

## 4. Software-Only Products:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Interactive Response(IR) | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected packages may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IR application. The IR application does not require the software described in this advisory. |
| CVLAN | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected packages may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. The CVLAN application does not require the software described in this advisory. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite(IMS) | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected packages may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. The IMS application does not require the software described in this advisory. |

**Recommended Actions:**
Avaya recommends that customers follow
recommended actions supplied by the Operating System vendor (e.g. RedHat
Linux)
or remove the affected packages.

## 5. Additional Information:

Additional information may also be available via the Avaya support
[website](http://support.avaya.com) and through your Avaya

Patches for the OpenBSD base system are distributed as unified diffs.
Each patch contains usage instructions.
All the following patches are also available in one
[tar.gz file](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.8.tar.gz)
for convenience.

Patches for supported releases are also incorporated into the
[-stable branch](stable.html).

* **001: SECURITY FIX: January 5, 2006**
    *All architectures*

  A buffer overflow has been found in the Perl interpreter with the sprintf function which
  may be exploitable under certain conditions.

  [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.8/common/001_perl.patch)

  * **002: SECURITY FIX: January 5, 2006**
      *All architectures*

    Do not allow users to trick suid programs into re-opening files via /dev/fd.

    [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.8/common/002_fd.patch)

    * **003: RELIABILITY FIX: January 13, 2006**
        *i386 architecture*

      Change the implementation of i386 W^X so that the "execute line" can move around.
      Before it was limited to being either at 512MB (below which all code normally
      lands) or at the top of the stack. Now the line can float as
      [mprotect(2)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.8/mprotect.2)
      and
      [mmap(2)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.8/mmap.2)
      requests need it to. This is now implemented using only GDT selectors
      instead of the LDT so that it is more robust as well.

      [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.8/i386/003_i386pmap.patch)

      * **004: RELIABILITY FIX: January 13, 2006**
          *i386 architecture*

        Constrain
        [i386\_set\_ioperm(2)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.8/i386/i386_set_ioperm.2)
        so even root is blocked from accessing the ioports
        unless the machine is running at lower securelevels or with an open X11 aperture.

        [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.8/i386/004_i386machdep.patch)

        * **005: SECURITY FIX: February 12, 2006**
            *All architectures*

          Josh Bressers has reported a weakness in OpenSSH caused due to the insecure use of the
          [system(3)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.8/system.3)
          function in
          [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.8/scp.1)
          when performing copy operations using filenames that are supplied by the user from the command line.
          This can be exploited to execute shell commands with privileges of the user running
          [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.8/scp.1).

          [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.8/common/005_ssh.patch)

          * **006: SECURITY FIX: March 25, 2006**
              *All architectures*

            A race condition has been reported to exist in the handling by sendmail of
            asynchronous signals. A remote attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the
            privileges of the user running sendmail, typically root.

            [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.8/common/006_sendmail.patch)

            * **007: SECURITY FIX: May 2, 2006**
                *All architectures*

              A security vulnerability has been found in the X.Org server --
              [CVE-2006-1526](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-1526).
              Clients authorized to connect to the X server are able to crash it and to execute
              malicious code within the X server.

              [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.8/common/007_xorg.patch)

              * **008: SECURITY FIX: June 15, 2006**
                  *All architectures*

                A potential denial of service problem has been found in sendmail. A malformed MIME
                message could trigger excessive recursion which will lead to stack exhaustion.
                This denial of service attack only affects delivery of mail from the queue and
                delivery of a malformed message. Other incoming mail is still accepted and
                delivered. However, mail messages in the queue may not be reattempted if a
                malformed MIME message exists.

                [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.8/common/008_sendmail2.patch)

                * **009: SECURITY FIX: July 30, 2006**
                    *All architectures*

                  [httpd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.8/httpd.8)'s
                  mod\_rewrite has a potentially exploitable off-by-one buffer overflow.
                  The buffer overflow may result in a vulnerability which, in combination
                  with certain types of Rewrite rules in the web server configuration files,
                  could be triggered remotely. The default install is not affected by the
                  buffer overflow. CVE-2006-3747

                  [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.8/common/009_httpd.patch)

                  * **010: SECURITY FIX: August 25, 2006**
                      *All architectures*

                    A potential denial of service problem has been found in sendmail. A message
                    with really long header lines could trigger a use-after-free bug causing
                    sendmail to crash.

                    [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.8/common/010_sendmail3.patch)

                    * **011: SECURITY FIX: August 25, 2006**
                        *All architectures*

                      Due to an off-by-one error in
                      [dhcpd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.8/dhcpd.8),
                      it is possible to cause
                      [dhcpd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.8/dhcpd.8)
                      to exit by sending a DHCPDISCOVER packet with a 32-byte client identifier option.
                      [CVE-2006-3122](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-3122)

                      * **012: SECURITY FIX: August 25, 2006**
                          *All architectures*

                        It is possible to cause the kernel to panic when more than the default number of
                        semaphores have been allocated.

                        [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.8/common/012_sem.patch)

                            *All architectures*

                          A problem in
                          [isakmpd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.8/isakmpd.8)
                          caused IPsec to run partly without replay protection. If
                          [isakmpd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.8/isakmpd.8)
                          was acting as responder during SA negotiation, SA's with a replay window of size 0 were created.
                          An attacker could reinject sniffed IPsec packets, which will be accepted without checking the
                          replay counter.

                              *All architectures*

                            Due to the failure to correctly validate LCP configuration option lengths,
                            it is possible for an attacker to send LCP packets via an
                            [sppp(4)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.8/sppp.4)
                            connection causing the kernel to panic.

                              Two Denial of Service issues have been found with BIND.

                              to send a sufficiently large number of recursive queries, or is able to
                              get the DNS server to return more than one SIG(covered) RRsets can stop
                              the functionality of the DNS service.
                              An attacker querying an authoritative DNS server serving a RFC 2535
                              DNSSEC zone may be able to crash the DNS server.

                                  *All architectures*

                                Due to incorrect PKCS#1 v1.5 padding validation in OpenSSL, it is possible for
                                an attacker to construct an invalid signature which OpenSSL would accept as a
                                valid PKCS#1 v1.5 signature.

                                      *All architectures*

                                    Several problems have been found in OpenSSL. While parsing certain invalid ASN.1
                                    structures an error condition is mishandled, possibly resulting in an infinite
                                    loop. A buffer overflow exists in the SSL\_get\_shared\_ciphers function. A NULL
                                    pointer may be dereferenced in the SSL version 2 client code. In addition, many
                                    applications using OpenSSL do not perform any validation of the lengths of
                                    public keys being used.

## Sendmail signal I/O race condition

#### Vulnerability Note VU#834865

Original Release Date: 2006-03-22 | Last Revised: 2011-07-22

---

### Overview

A race condition in Sendmail may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code.

### Description

| **Sendmail**  Sendmail is a widely used mail transfer agent (MTA). **Mail Transfer Agents (MTA)** MTAs are responsible for sending an receiving email messages over the internet. They are also referred to as mail servers or SMTP servers.**The Problem**Sendmail contains a race condition caused by the improper handling of asynchronous signals. In particular, by forcing SMTP server to have an I/O timeout at exactly the correct instant, the attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Sendmail process.More information is available in the Sendmail version [8.13.6](http://www.sendmail.org/8.13.6.html) release page and the Sendmail MTA Security Vulnerability [Advisory](http://www.sendmail.com/company/advisory/).This vulnerability occurred as a result of failing to comply with recommndations [SIG32-C](https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/seccode/SIG32-C.%2BDo%2Bnot%2Bcall%2Blongjmp%28%29%2Bfrom%2Binside%2Ba%2Bsignal%2Bhandler) and [SIG30-C](https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/seccode/SIG30-C.%2BCall%2Bonly%2Basynchronous-safe%2Bfunctions%2Bwithin%2Bsignal%2Bhandlers) of the CERT C Programming Language Secure Coding Standard.**Considerations**Versions of Sendmail prior to [8.13.6](http://www.sendmail.org/8.13.6.html) are affected. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Sendmail process. If Sendmail is running as root, the attacker could take complete control of an affected system. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade**  This issue is corrected in Sendmail version [8.13.6](http://www.sendmail.org/8.13.6.html).Patches to correct this issue in Sendmail versions 8.12.11 and 8.13.5 are also available. |
| --- |

| Refer to the Sendmail MTA Security Vulnerability [Advisory](http://www.sendmail.com/company/advisory/#mitigation) for steps to reduce the impact of this vulnerability |

Notified:  March 08, 2006  Updated: March 21, 2006

**Statement Date:   March 21, 2006**

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

Red Hat distributes Sendmail packages in all Red Hat Enterprise Linux releases. Red Hat was provided with a patch for this issue in advance by the Sendmail security team, but we have not been able to verify if this issue is actually exploitable on Red Hat Enterprise Linux systems.

By default on Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Sendmail is configured to only accept connections locally. Only users who had configured Sendmail to listen to remote hosts and opened their firewall would have been potentially vulnerable to this issue.

Updates are available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux to correct this flaw. Updated Sendmail packages along with our advisory are available at the URL below and by using the Red Hat Network 'up2date' tool.

**Statement Date:   March 21, 2006**

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

Sendmail Consortium

The Sendmail Consortium strongly recommends that Open Source sendmail users upgrade to 8.13.6 whenever possible. If that is not possible, source code patches are available for 8.12.11 and 8.13.5, but these are fairly extensive and may be difficult to apply cleanly. There are no patches available for 8.11, nor will there be, since 8.11 and earlier versions do not have the necessary support infrastructure.

Further information is available at <http://www.sendmail.org>.

Sendmail, Inc.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : sendmail
Vulnerability  : programming error
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2006-0058
CERT advisory  : VU#834865

Mark Dowd discovered a flaw in the handling of asynchronous signals in
sendmail, a powerful, efficient, and scalable mail transport agent.
This allows a remote attacker may to exploit a race condition to
execute arbitrary code as root.

For the old stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 8.12.3-7.2.

For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 8.13.4-3sarge1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 8.13.6-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your sendmail package immediately.

Upgrade Instructions

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Sendmail's advisory concerning this issue may be found here:   http://www.sendmail.com/company/advisory/index.shtml  This issue will appear in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database at the following location:   http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-0058   Here are the details from the Slackware 10.2 ChangeLog: +--------------------------+ patches/packages/sendmail-8.13.6-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to sendmail-8.13.6.   This new version of sendmail contains a fix for a security problem   discovered by Mark Dowd of ISS X-Force.  From sendmail's advisory:     Sendmail was notified by security researchers at ISS that, under some     specific timing conditions, this vulnerability may permit a specifically     crafted attack to take over the sendmail MTA process, allowing remote     attackers to execute commands and run arbitrary programs on the system     running the MTA, affecting email delivery, or tampering with other     programs and data on this system.  Sendmail is not aware of any public     exploit code for this vulnerability.  This connection-oriented     vulnerability does not occur in the normal course of sending and     receiving email.  It is only triggered when specific conditions are     created through SMTP connection layer commands.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Sentrion is not for everyone, but if you are using open source email for a large complex environment and need an enterprise platform that will enable your messaging roadmap for years to come (virtualization, consolidation, cloud migration, etc.), [speak with a specialist](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/contact) to see if Sendmail Sentrion is right for you.

[Frequently Asked Questions](/us/sendmail/faq)

### Current Sendmail Open Source Release

Sendmail [8.18.1](https://ftp.sendmail.org/sendmail.8.18.1.tar.gz) is available from [ftp.sendmail.org](https://ftp.sendmail.org/). The release has a [gzipped tar](https://ftp.sendmail.org/sendmail.8.18.1.tar.gz) file and a [PGP signature](https://ftp.sendmail.org/sendmail.8.18.1.tar.gz.sig) file. The compressed/gzipped tar files are [signed](#Signing_Keys) by the [2024 signing key](https://www.proofpoint.com/sites/default/files/signing-keys/sendmail2024.asc). See the Security and PGP Signing Keys section for more information about how releases are signed.

### Signing Keys

Security advisories are issued by The Computer Emergency Response Team [CERT](http://www.cert.org/). Sendmail server related security problems should be sent to:

**sendmail-security-*YYYY*@support.sendmail.org**

Replace YYYY with the current year, e.g., 2015. This address is only for reporting security problems in sendmail. When reporting security problems, please use PGP-the public key is available in the file PGPKEYS of the sendmail distribution.

**Please do not use this address to report problems that are not related to the security of the sendmail server.**Questions about [avoiding spam risk](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-reference/spam), how to set up your own certificate authorities, etc. should be posted in comp.mail.sendmail, and Unix-related security in the comp.security.unix newsgroup.

All sendmail distributions are signed with a PGP key named "Sendmail Signing Key/*YYYY*" where *YYYY* is the year of release.

### Contact Us

These addresses are for contributing patches or reporting problems about V8 sendmail. The members of these lists do not have the resources to support vendor versions. Before sending to any of these addresses, please check the [FAQ](/us/sendmail/faq "Sendmail FAQ") and the files README, sendmail/README (on this web-site as Compiling Sendmail) and cf/README (on this web-site as the Configuration README pages) to see if they are already answered; about half of the questions received can be answered in this way.

**Notes**

* Do not send us mail in HTML format, use plain text only (even multipart/alternative with an HTML part will be classified as spam by some of our members and hence an answer will most likely be delayed).
* Do not use 8bit characters in the Subject: nor use some encoding, e.g., =?GB2312?B?, but only plain 7bit ASCII without any charset encoding.
* If you send e-mail to sendmail.org, the answer will most likely not come from a system in the sendmail.org domain. If you use some anti-spam techniques (e.g., challenge-response systems) or you block hosts that are connected via DSL then please do not expect an answer. More and more often replies are blocked which is very annoying. Do not block this address or make sure that your system accepts at least STARTTLS secured mail. A list of IPs is available in the sendmail.org SPF record.
* If you use a challenge/response system, make sure that it does NOT send us a challenge when we reply to your question or when you receive mail from the announce list. We will not reply to those annoying mails.
* If you are using the blacklist from spamlist.org then please do not send us e-mail, the reply of the sendmail maintainer will not reach you.
* Do not send us mail in proprietary formats.
* The mailservers for support.sendmail.org now (2004-11-24) use the following DNSBLs:
  + sbl-xbl.spamhaus.org
  + dnsbl.sorbs.net
  + list.dsbl.org
  + bl.spamcop.net
* The mailserver for support.sendmail.org performs strict RFC checks, for example, it does not accept mail if the domain part has an [MX record](/us/threat-reference/mx-record "MX Record") that points to an IP address (instead of hostname as required).

If you have a question about sendmail, then please post it to the Usenet group comp.mail.sendmail. This newsgroup is dedicated to sendmail. Please make sure you check the usual resources before posting and follow the netiquette.

E-mail addresses to contact sendmail.org are (do *not* send questions about sendmail to these addresses, see above instead; replace YYYY with the current year, e.g., 2006, in all of these addresses):

* sendmail-YYYY@support.sendmail.org for contributing patches, feature requests, and general comments but not questions how to use, install, or configure sendmail;
* sendmail-bugs-YYYY@support.sendmail.org to report implementation bugs;
* sendmail-faq-YYYY@support.sendmail.org only for comments / questions about the FAQ. Please mark your mail clearly with "FAQ: item" where item is the entry in the faq to which you are referring. If it is a general comment about the FAQ, use "FAQ: general", if it is an addition, use "FAQ: new".
* sendmail-security-YYYY@support.sendmail.org (use this only to report related bugs or problems in sendmail). Please do not use this to ask about problems with your configuration, including how to stop spam, how to set up your own certificate authority, how to make sendmail work with S/MIME, etc. All such questions should be asked in comp.mail.sendmail. Also, please do not tell us that you were able to forge mail by using telnet to connect to port 25; this is fundamental to the Internet design for [SMTP](/us/threat-reference/smtp-relay "SMTP Relay"), and not a sendmail bug. Please use encryption to send mail to this address.
* sendmail-mirror-YYYY@support.sendmail.org for updates about a mirror (e.g., a new mirror or an address change).
* webmaster-YYYY@support.sendmail.org for comments about the website.

These are not open lists, meaning that subscription is by invitation only.

### DKIM

The [Domain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM)](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/corporate-blog/post/what-is-dkim) Internet standard enables email senders to digitally sign their messages so that receivers can verify that those messages have not been forged. The DKIM sender authentication scheme allows the recipient of a message to confirm a message originated with the sender’s domain and that the message content has not been altered. A cryptography-based solution, DKIM provides businesses an industry-standard method for mitigating [email fraud](/us/products/email-protection/email-fraud-defense "Email Fraud Defense") and [protecting an organization’s brand](/us/solutions/digital-risk/digital-brand-protection "Digital Brand Protection") and reputation at a relatively low implementation cost.

DKIM has been approved by the IETF as a draft standard (RFC 4871). The protocol was developed through the cooperation of Sendmail, Cisco Systems and Yahoo!

Since being approved by the IETF, a new open source project was started. The OpenDKIM Project is a community effort to develop and maintain a C library for producing DKIM-aware applications and an open source milter for providing DKIM service.

The project started from a code fork of version 2.8.3 of the open source [dkim-milter](http://sourceforge.net/projects/dkim-milter/) package developed and maintained by Sendmail, Inc.

The Sendmail [Sentrion Message Processing Engine](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/products/email-protection/open-source-email-solution) comes standard with OpenDKIM. More information is available at [opendkim.org](http://opendkim.org/) and [dkim.org](http://dkim.org/)

### Current Sendmail Open Source Release

Sendmail [8.18.1](https://ftp.sendmail.org/sendmail.8.18.1.tar.gz) is available from [ftp.sendmail.org](https://ftp.sendmail.org/). The release has a [gzipped tar](https://ftp.sendmail.org/sendmail.8.18.1.tar.gz) file and a [PGP signature](https://ftp.sendmail.org/sendmail.8.18.1.tar.gz.sig) file. The compressed/gzipped tar files are [signed](#Signing_Keys) by the [2024 signing key](https://www.proofpoint.com/sites/default/files/signing-keys/sendmail2024.asc). See the Security and PGP Signing Keys section for more information about how releases are signed.

### Signing Keys

Security advisories are issued by The Computer Emergency Response Team [CERT](http://www.cert.org/). Sendmail server related security problems should be sent to:

**sendmail-security-*YYYY*@support.sendmail.org**

Replace YYYY with the current year, e.g., 2015. This address is only for reporting security problems in sendmail. When reporting security problems, please use PGP-the public key is available in the file PGPKEYS of the sendmail distribution.

**Please do not use this address to report problems that are not related to the security of the sendmail server.**Questions about [avoiding spam risk](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-reference/spam), how to set up your own certificate authorities, etc. should be posted in comp.mail.sendmail, and Unix-related security in the comp.security.unix newsgroup.

All sendmail distributions are signed with a PGP key named "Sendmail Signing Key/*YYYY*" where *YYYY* is the year of release.

### Contact Us

These addresses are for contributing patches or reporting problems about V8 sendmail. The members of these lists do not have the resources to support vendor versions. Before sending to any of these addresses, please check the [FAQ](/us/sendmail/faq "Sendmail FAQ") and the files README, sendmail/README (on this web-site as Compiling Sendmail) and cf/README (on this web-site as the Configuration README pages) to see if they are already answered; about half of the questions received can be answered in this way.

**Notes**

* Do not send us mail in HTML format, use plain text only (even multipart/alternative with an HTML part will be classified as spam by some of our members and hence an answer will most likely be delayed).
* Do not use 8bit characters in the Subject: nor use some encoding, e.g., =?GB2312?B?, but only plain 7bit ASCII without any charset encoding.
* If you send e-mail to sendmail.org, the answer will most likely not come from a system in the sendmail.org domain. If you use some anti-spam techniques (e.g., challenge-response systems) or you block hosts that are connected via DSL then please do not expect an answer. More and more often replies are blocked which is very annoying. Do not block this address or make sure that your system accepts at least STARTTLS secured mail. A list of IPs is available in the sendmail.org SPF record.
* If you use a challenge/response system, make sure that it does NOT send us a challenge when we reply to your question or when you receive mail from the announce list. We will not reply to those annoying mails.
* If you are using the blacklist from spamlist.org then please do not send us e-mail, the reply of the sendmail maintainer will not reach you.
* Do not send us mail in proprietary formats.
* The mailservers for support.sendmail.org now (2004-11-24) use the following DNSBLs:
  + sbl-xbl.spamhaus.org
  + dnsbl.sorbs.net
  + list.dsbl.org
  + bl.spamcop.net
* The mailserver for support.sendmail.org performs strict RFC checks, for example, it does not accept mail if the domain part has an [MX record](/us/threat-reference/mx-record "MX Record") that points to an IP address (instead of hostname as required).

If you have a question about sendmail, then please post it to the Usenet group comp.mail.sendmail. This newsgroup is dedicated to sendmail. Please make sure you check the usual resources before posting and follow the netiquette.

E-mail addresses to contact sendmail.org are (do *not* send questions about sendmail to these addresses, see above instead; replace YYYY with the current year, e.g., 2006, in all of these addresses):

* sendmail-YYYY@support.sendmail.org for contributing patches, feature requests, and general comments but not questions how to use, install, or configure sendmail;
* sendmail-bugs-YYYY@support.sendmail.org to report implementation bugs;
* sendmail-faq-YYYY@support.sendmail.org only for comments / questions about the FAQ. Please mark your mail clearly with "FAQ: item" where item is the entry in the faq to which you are referring. If it is a general comment about the FAQ, use "FAQ: general", if it is an addition, use "FAQ: new".
* sendmail-security-YYYY@support.sendmail.org (use this only to report related bugs or problems in sendmail). Please do not use this to ask about problems with your configuration, including how to stop spam, how to set up your own certificate authority, how to make sendmail work with S/MIME, etc. All such questions should be asked in comp.mail.sendmail. Also, please do not tell us that you were able to forge mail by using telnet to connect to port 25; this is fundamental to the Internet design for [SMTP](/us/threat-reference/smtp-relay "SMTP Relay"), and not a sendmail bug. Please use encryption to send mail to this address.
* sendmail-mirror-YYYY@support.sendmail.org for updates about a mirror (e.g., a new mirror or an address change).
* webmaster-YYYY@support.sendmail.org for comments about the website.

These are not open lists, meaning that subscription is by invitation only.

### DKIM

The [Domain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM)](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/corporate-blog/post/what-is-dkim) Internet standard enables email senders to digitally sign their messages so that receivers can verify that those messages have not been forged. The DKIM sender authentication scheme allows the recipient of a message to confirm a message originated with the sender’s domain and that the message content has not been altered. A cryptography-based solution, DKIM provides businesses an industry-standard method for mitigating [email fraud](/us/products/email-protection/email-fraud-defense "Email Fraud Defense") and [protecting an organization’s brand](/us/solutions/digital-risk/digital-brand-protection "Digital Brand Protection") and reputation at a relatively low implementation cost.

DKIM has been approved by the IETF as a draft standard (RFC 4871). The protocol was developed through the cooperation of Sendmail, Cisco Systems and Yahoo!

Since being approved by the IETF, a new open source project was started. The OpenDKIM Project is a community effort to develop and maintain a C library for producing DKIM-aware applications and an open source milter for providing DKIM service.

The project started from a code fork of version 2.8.3 of the open source [dkim-milter](http://sourceforge.net/projects/dkim-milter/) package developed and maintained by Sendmail, Inc.

The Sendmail [Sentrion Message Processing Engine](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/products/email-protection/open-source-email-solution) comes standard with OpenDKIM. More information is available at [opendkim.org](http://opendkim.org/) and [dkim.org](http://dkim.org/)

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

##### **Tips**

To return expected results, you can:

* **Reduce the number of search terms.** Each term you use focuses the search further.
* **Check your spelling.** A single misspelled or incorrectly typed term can change your result.
* **Try substituting synonyms for your original terms.** For example, instead of searching for "java classes", try "java training"
* **Did you search for an IBM acquired or sold product ?** If so, follow the appropriate link below to find the content you need.
