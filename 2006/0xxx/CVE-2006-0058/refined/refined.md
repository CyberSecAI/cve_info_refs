Exploitation of this vulnerability requires\nSendmail to\nlisten for remote or local connections.

Avaya recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions of Communication Manager. |\n| Avaya S87x0, S8500, S8300 Media Servers | CM 2.0 and later | None | Prior to Communication Manager 3.1, the sendmail package is installed, however by default sendmail is not listening for remote or local connections. Communication Manager 3.1 and later have removed the sendmail package. These versions of Communication Manager are not vulnerable. |\n\nRecommended Actions:\n\nFor all system products which use vulnerable versions of sendmail, Avaya\nrecommends that customers restrict local and network access to the\nserver. This\nrestriction should be enforced through the use of physical security,\nfirewalls,\nACLs, VPNs, and other generally-accepted networking practices until such\ntime as\nan update becomes available and can be installed.",
