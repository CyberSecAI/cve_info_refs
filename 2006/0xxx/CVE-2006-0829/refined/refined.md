Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2006-0829:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by the lack of proper sanitization of the `HTTP_REFERER` environment variable in the `Code/Routines.pl` script of E-Blah Platinum.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application fails to sanitize the `HTTP_REFERER` header before displaying it, which allows an attacker to inject malicious HTML or script code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious code through a crafted `Referer` header.
- When an administrator views the "Click Log" in E-Blah Platinum, this malicious code is executed within their browser session.
- The execution of malicious script code in the administrator's browser can lead to the potential compromise of their login credentials.

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through crafting a malicious HTTP request with a `Referer` header containing the XSS payload.
- The vulnerability is triggered when an administrator views the "Click Log" within the application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted HTTP request with a malicious `Referer` header.
- The attacker does not need to be an administrator, but relies on an administrator viewing the "Click Log" to execute the XSS payload.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `Code/Routines.pl` script of E-Blah Platinum.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Aliaksandr Hartsuyeu (eVuln.com) on 2006.02.16.
