    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2006-0683",
      "root_cause": "Multiple vulnerabilities in VHCS (Virtual Hosting Control System)",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        {
          "weakness": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
          "description": "The application logs user input without sanitization. Specifically, the username field during login is not filtered before being stored in the logs. This allows an attacker to inject HTML and/or JavaScript code into the username field. When an administrator views the logs via the \"Admin Log\" page, the injected code will be executed within the context of the administrator's browser.",
          "impact": "The attacker can execute arbitrary code in the administrator's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or further exploitation of other vulnerabilities. The attacker effectively owns the VHCS GUI with admin privileges.",
          "attack_vector": "By entering malicious code as the username in the login form.",
            "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to interact with the VHCS login page."
        },
         {
          "weakness": "Weak Password Change Mechanism",
          "description": "The `admin/change_password.php` script allows changing a user's password without requiring the old password, making it easier to exploit other vulnerabilities by changing the password of another user.",
          "impact": "Allows attackers to change user passwords without knowing the original password, facilitating account takeover.",
          "attack_vector": "Directly accessing the vulnerable script.",
            "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to access the admin interface to use this script."
         },
        {
          "weakness": "Authentication Bypass in `check_login()`",
           "description": "The `check_login()` function in `gui/include/login.php` does not properly terminate execution after a redirection, causing the calling script to continue running despite an authentication failure. The HTTP redirection is implemented via the header() PHP function. The execution flow is not interrupted after the header() function, thus the calling script will continue to run, before the redirection to the login page happens.",
           "impact": "Allows unauthenticated users to execute arbitrary PHP scripts, potentially leading to full system compromise. For example, the attacker can add a new admin user via `admin/add_user.php`.",
           "attack_vector": "By directly accessing vulnerable scripts.",
            "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker does not need to authenticate to exploit this vulnerability."
        },
       {
          "weakness":"Privilege Escalation in `admin/add_user.php`",
          "description": "The `admin/add_user.php` script does not check whether the logged-in user has the necessary privileges to create new admin accounts. This allows lower-privileged users such as domain users to create new admin users.",
          "impact": "Allows a domain user to create a new admin account, leading to complete compromise of the system. This can lead to unauthorized access and control over the entire VHCS system.",
          "attack_vector": "By accessing the vulnerable script after logging in as a domain user.",
           "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be an authenticated domain user."
       }
      ],
        "affected_versions": "VHCS 2.4.7.1, 2.4.6.2 and lower versions",
        "fixed_versions": "2.4.7.1 + patch v.3",
        "additional_notes": "The vendor initially released a flawed patch (v.1) which introduced an XSS vulnerability by removing existing protection. A second patch (v.2) corrected the XSS issues but only partially fixed the authentication bypass bug. The vendor did not communicate these issues clearly to their users."
