  "vulnerability": "CVE-2006-0884",
  "description": "The vulnerability allows JavaScript code embedded in an email to execute when forwarding the email in-line using the default HTML \"rich mail\" editor in Mozilla Suite, SeaMonkey, and Thunderbird. This occurs when forwarding via the \"Forward As\" menu item, where the email's content is included in the body of the new message.  Additionally, when replying to an email in Thunderbird 1.0.7 and below and Mozilla Suite 1.7.12 and below, JavaScript code can be executed but limited to the sandbox of the message. This script can spy or alter the message you are composing.",
  "affected_products": [
    "Mozilla Suite",
    "SeaMonkey",
    "Thunderbird"
  ],
  "root_cause": "The default HTML \"rich mail\" editor does not properly sanitize or disable JavaScript embedded in the email when forwarding inline, causing it to execute with the full privileges of the client.  Additionally, the message sandbox is not secure when replying, allowing script execution.",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    "JavaScript Execution",
    "Privilege Escalation",
        "Cross-Site Scripting(XSS)"
   ],
  "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code with the full privileges of the email client. This could lead to malware installation, data theft, sending of spam, spying on user message and alterations of the messages while composing.",
  "attack_vectors": [
    "Crafted Email with embedded JavaScript",
    "Forwarding email inline",
    "Replying to email in HTML mode"
  ],
  "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to craft a malicious email with JavaScript embedded in the message body.",
  "required_attacker_position": "The attacker can be a remote user who sends email to the victim."
