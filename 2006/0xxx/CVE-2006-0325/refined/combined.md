# Luca Ercoli

IT Security Specialist

### About Me

Currently living in a quiet town near the Italian coast, I work as Cyber Security Specialist employed by one of the largest hosting provider of the country.

During the course of my career, researching for new techniques and issues on the wider field of InfoSec, hence vulnerabilities that affects Operating Systems, Web Application Security, Penetration Testing, Reverse Engeenering, Malware Analisys and Digital Forensics, I was been acknowledged for reporting security flaws affected by widely recognized companies like IBM, Apache Foundation, MySQL and Microsoft.

Demonstrable experience approved by [Harvard's Office of the Vice Provost for Advances in Learning](https://harvardx.credential.getsmarter.com/usj2pv2r?key=532b83ba11193efba714fc6a6b127e7d36f372bc13df7ff57e8885d19ee6db38), 3 Cisco certifications, develop and organization of 3 Ethical Hacking national level competitions, 20 security advisories and 2 books published.

Proud to have achieved the third position in the World Ranking for the years 2022 and 2023 in the 'OWASP Injection' category at HackerOne, the world's largest community of trusted ethical hackers.

My background includes project leading, design and implementation, system libraries and Linux Kernel modules programming, iOS mobile game development, studies of Search Engine Optimization and experience in design and implementation of communication systems using SDR technology.

In my leisure time enjoys building stuff with 3D printer and home made Milling Machines, prototyping projects and little inventions etching circuits or using Arduino platform, playing the piano and watching documentaries.
