Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2006-0687:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization and initialization of the `$includeModule` variable within the `modules/center/admin/accounts/process.php` file of DocMGR.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Arbitrary Remote File Inclusion:** The code directly includes files based on the value of the `$includeModule` variable and a related path stored in the `$siteModInfo` array. If `register_globals` is enabled in PHP, and the `$includeModule` variable is not initialized, an attacker can set this variable to an arbitrary value using a request parameter. Additionally, since `$siteModInfo` array is also not initialized, the attacker can inject a path using `siteModInfo[$includeModule][module_path]` to be included.
*   **Path Traversal:** The vulnerability allows for path traversal if magic quotes are off, enabling the inclusion of arbitrary local files when used with PHP4 (e.g. `/etc/passwd`).
*   **Remote File Inclusion (PHP5):** On PHP5 the `file_exists()` function, if the server permits it, can utilize ftp resources, which permits an attacker to include arbitrary remote files via a crafted `ftp://` URL

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a file containing malicious PHP code, the attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability can be used to read sensitive files such as `/etc/passwd`.
*   **Server Compromise:** Successful exploitation can lead to complete compromise of the affected server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Parameter Manipulation:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP GET requests to the `process.php` script, setting the `includeModule` and `siteModInfo` parameters to include arbitrary files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable DocMGR server.
*  **PHP configuration**:
   * `register_globals` needs to be enabled for PHP4 exploitation, though this is commonly deprecated nowadays.
   * `short_open_tag` must be set to `On`
*   **FTP Access (for Remote Inclusion on PHP5):** For remote file inclusion on PHP5, the attacker requires access to an FTP server where they can host their malicious PHP script.
*   No authentication is required.

**Additional Details:**

* The provided exploit code targets PHP5 systems by exploiting the ftp functionality.
*   The exploit code demonstrates a proof of concept by including a remote PHP script that allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands via the 'cmd' parameter.

This vulnerability is a classic example of a lack of input sanitization and insecure use of `include` functions, leading to a severe security risk.
