    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2006-0852",
      "description": "Admbook 1.2.2 is vulnerable to remote command execution via the 'X-Forwarded-For' HTTP header. By injecting malicious PHP code into this header, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server.",
      "root_cause": "The application improperly handles the 'X-Forwarded-For' HTTP header, allowing for the injection of malicious PHP code that gets executed.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of HTTP headers",
        "Remote code execution",
        "Lack of input sanitization"
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise, data theft, or denial of service.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted POST request to write.php, with the malicious payload injected into the X-Forwarded-For HTTP header.",
		"A subsequent GET request is made to content-data.php, triggering the execution of the injected payload."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No authentication is required."
