{
  "CVE-2006-0603": {
    "Description": "Multiple Vulnerabilities in phphg Guestbook",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper sanitization of user-supplied input in multiple scripts",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in signed.php: Variables $HTTP_POST_VARS[location], $HTTP_POST_VARS[website], and $HTTP_POST_VARS[message] are not properly sanitized, allowing for injection of arbitrary HTML or script code.",
         "SQL Injections in admin panel scripts: Vulnerable scripts include admin/edit_smilie.php, admin/add_theme.php, admin/ban_ip.php, admin/add_lang, and admin/edit_filter. The $HTTP_GET_VARS[id] variable isn't properly sanitized, which can lead to SQL injection attacks if magic_quotes_gpc is off."
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": [
      "XSS: Attackers can inject malicious scripts into the guestbook, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other client-side attacks.",
      "SQL Injection: Attackers can manipulate SQL queries to access or modify database information in the administrator control panel."
    ],
    "Attack vectors": [
      "XSS: Injecting malicious code through the location, website, or message fields in the signed.php script via HTTP POST requests.",
       "SQL Injection: Crafting malicious SQL code in the id parameter via HTTP GET requests to admin panel scripts."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to submit HTTP requests to the vulnerable scripts (signed.php for XSS and admin panel scripts for SQL injection). The attacker needs to be able to provide malicious input in the form of POST parameters for XSS, and GET parameters for SQLi.",
        "Additional Information": "The vulnerability report indicates that these issues were discovered by Aliaksandr Hartsuyeu of eVuln.com. The vulnerable software is phphg Guestbook version 1.2, and a solution is available, implying an update to a newer version. The report provides specific Proof of Concept (PoC) URLs and parameters to demonstrate the exploitability of the listed vulnerabilities."
