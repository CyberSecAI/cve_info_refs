  "cve": "CVE-2006-0354",
  "description": "A vulnerability exists in Cisco Aironet Wireless Access Points (AP) running IOS which may allow a malicious user to send a crafted attack via IP address Resolution Protocol (ARP) to the Access point which will cause the device to stop passing traffic and/or drop user connections. Repeated exploitation of this vulnerability will create a sustained DoS (denial of service).",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the handling of ARP messages by Cisco IOS-based Aironet Wireless Access Points.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The access points are vulnerable to ARP spoofing attacks, allowing an attacker to add entries to the ARP table of the device until memory exhaustion."
    ],
     "impact": "Successful exploitation results in a denial of service (DoS), rendering the access point unable to pass traffic, drop user connections, and become unavailable until rebooted.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A malicious user who has associated with the Cisco IOS Wireless Access Point may send spoofed ARP messages to the management interface of the access point."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to have successfully associated with a vulnerable Cisco IOS Wireless Access Point."

        "Cisco Aironet 350 Series Access Points running IOS"
    ],
  "additional_notes": "The issue is resolved in IOS version 12.3-7-JA2, available for download on cisco website. In addition to the software upgrade, a configuration change is also necessary, specifically adding the command `L2-FILTER BLOCK-ARP` to each radio interface. A workaround involves using VLANs to isolate wireless clients from the access point's management interface. The vulnerability is tracked as Cisco Bug ID CSCsc16644."
