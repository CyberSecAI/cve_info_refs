Based on the provided content, here's information regarding CVE-2006-0768:

*   **Vulnerability:** Remote Denial of Service
*   **Affected Software:** Kadu 0.4.3, potentially other versions.
*   **Root Cause:** Kadu crashes due to a SIGPIPE signal when it receives a large number of image send requests.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker adds themselves to the victim's contact list and then sends numerous image send requests to the victim.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**

    *   Kadu crashes, leading to a denial of service.
    *   The victim's Gadu-Gadu number may be blocked, preventing them from sending messages for an extended period. This is likely due to the server detecting the image request packets Kadu sends in response to the attacker.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker must be on the victim's contact list.
*   **Technical Details:** The provided backtrace from GDB shows the crash occurring during the handling of image requests:
    *   `GaduProtocol::sendImageRequest()`
    *   `GaduProtocol::messageReceived()`
    *   `GaduSocketNotifiers::socketEvent()`

    The provided POC code in assembly sends a flood of image request packets to the target user.
