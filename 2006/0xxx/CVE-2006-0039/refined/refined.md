  "CVE-2006-0039": {
    "description": "A race condition in netfilter's do_add_counters() function, which allows information disclosure of kernel memory by exploiting a race condition. Like CVE-2006-0038, it requires CAP_NET_ADMIN privileges.",
    "root_cause": "A race condition exists in the do_add_counters() function within the netfilter module. The function does not properly synchronize access to a shared data structure (paddc).",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Race Condition",
       "Information Disclosure"
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploit could allow an attacker with CAP_NET_ADMIN privileges to leak potentially sensitive kernel memory through counter increments.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by manipulating netfilter rules or other network configurations that lead to calls to the affected `do_add_counters()` function, while racing for shared memory access.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker requires CAP_NET_ADMIN privileges to exploit this vulnerability. This privilege is usually given to the root user or users within a virtualized environment.",
        "additional_details": "The beginning of paddc is supposed to be the same as tmp which was sanity-checked above, but it might not be the same in reality. In case the integer overflow and/or the race condition are triggered, paddc->num_counters might not match the allocation size for paddc. If the check below (t->private->number != paddc->num_counters) nevertheless passes (perhaps this requires the race condition to be triggered), IPT_ENTRY_ITERATE() would read kernel memory beyond the allocation size, potentially leaking sensitive data (e.g., passwords from host system or from another VPS) via counter increments."
