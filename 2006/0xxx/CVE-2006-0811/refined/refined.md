      "vulnerability": "PHP Code Injection",
      "description": "Administrator has an ability to edit values of variables in config.php. This can be used to inject arbitrary PHP code. System access is possible.",

        "vulnerability": "SQL Injection",
       "description": "The variable `$_POST[usern]` in includes/root/sendpass.php isn't properly sanitized before being used in a SQL query. This can be used to make any SQL query by injecting arbitrary SQL code. Condition: magic_quotes_gpc - off",
