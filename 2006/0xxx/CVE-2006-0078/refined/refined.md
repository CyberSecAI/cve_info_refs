{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in several scripts, specifically `shout.php` and `guestbook.php`.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML or script code that will be executed in the browser of users who visit the affected pages. This can lead to various malicious activities such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious websites.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is remote. An attacker injects malicious code into vulnerable input fields (name, shout, title, message) through the web interface of the shoutbox and guestbook.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs no authentication and can be remote. The attacker needs to identify the vulnerable input parameters and inject crafted malicious script."
