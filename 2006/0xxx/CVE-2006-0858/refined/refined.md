- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper handling of file paths during process creation by Safe'n'Sec. The application fails to enclose the file paths in quotes when using `CreateProcess()`. This allows a malicious executable with a name like `program.exe`, `program.bat` or `program.com` to be executed if placed in the root of the C:\ drive, instead of the intended application when Safe'n'Sec starts up, during autostart, or during installation.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure file execution, specifically related to process creation and autostart handling. The lack of proper quoting around the file paths in `CreateProcess()` creates an opportunity for path traversal attacks.

- **Impact of exploitation**: Privilege escalation. Because the rogue application is executed with the privileges of the calling Safe'n'Sec process, an attacker can gain elevated privileges by replacing the target process with a malicious one.

- **Attack vectors**: Placing a malicious executable file (such as program.exe, program.bat, or program.com) in the root directory (C:\) of the system and waiting for Safe'n'Sec to launch. This can happen during startup, autostart or during installation of the Safe'n'Sec application.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to write to the root directory of the C: drive. However, it's mentioned that this is only a real issue in Windows 2000 because in Windows XP, restricted users don't typically have write access to C:\.
