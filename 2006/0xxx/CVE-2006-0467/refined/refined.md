{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A large chat buffer sent by a client could cause the server to crash, or the server would forward the large buffer to other clients, which would then crash.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Buffer overflow or excessive memory consumption due to a lack of proper input validation when handling chat messages.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service, causing the server and/or clients to crash.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a large chat message from a client to the server.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be a connected client, which can also be a 'viewer' that isn't actively playing."
