RHSA-2008:0630 - Security Advisory

# RHSA-2008:0630 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Low: Red Hat Network Satellite Server security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Low

## Topic

Red Hat Network Satellite Server version 5.1.1 is now available. This
update includes fixes for a number of security issues in Red Hat Network
Satellite Server components.

This update has been rated as having low security impact by the Red Hat
Security Response Team.

## Description

During an internal security audit, it was discovered that Red Hat Network
Satellite Server shipped with an XML-RPC script, manzier.pxt, which had a
single hard-coded authentication key. A remote attacker who is able to
connect to the Satellite Server XML-RPC service could use this flaw to
obtain limited information about Satellite Server users, such as login
names, associated email addresses, internal user IDs, and partial
information about entitlements. (CVE-2008-2369)

This release also corrects several security vulnerabilities in various
components shipped as part of Red Hat Network Satellite Server 5.1. In a
typical operating environment, these components are not exposed to users
of Satellite Server in a vulnerable manner. These security updates will
reduce risk in unique Satellite Server environments.

A denial-of-service flaw was fixed in mod\_perl. (CVE-2007-1349)

Multiple cross-site scripting flaws were fixed in the image map feature in
the JFreeChart package. (CVE-2007-6306)

A flaw which could result in weak encryption was fixed in the
perl-Crypt-CBC package. (CVE-2006-0898)

Multiple flaws were fixed in the Apache Tomcat package. (CVE-2005-4838,
CVE-2006-0254, CVE-2007-1355, CVE-2007-1358, CVE-2007-2449, CVE-2007-5461,
CVE-2008-0128)

Users of Red Hat Network Satellite Server 5.1 are advised to upgrade to
5.1.1, which resolves these issues.

## Solution

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<http://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/satellite/Red_Hat_Network_Satellite-5.1.0/html/Installation_Guide/s1-maintenance-update.html>

#### Description

Reported by oliver karow:

The Web-Access-Log viewer does no filtering for html-/script-tags, and

therefore allows attacks against the user of the admin-console:

<http://10.10.10.10:8080/jsp-examples/cal/cal2.jsp?time=>"/><script>alert(document.cookie)</script>

Also reported:

The first one is a classical cross-site scripting in the jsp-examples:

<http://10.10.10.10:8080/jsp-examples/cal/cal2.jsp?time=>"/><script>alert('Gotcha')</script>

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Apache Geronimo 1.0 - CSS and persistent HTML-Injection vulnerabilities
=======================================================================
Product:
========
Apache Geronimo is the J2EE server project of the Apache Software Foundation.
Version:
========
Apache Geronimo 1.0, Jetty 5.1.9
Vulnerabilities
===============
The first one is a classical cross-site scripting in the
jsp-examples:
http://10.10.10.10:8080/jsp-examples/cal/cal2.jsp?time="/>
The second one is a persistant html-/script-Injection vulnerability
which is a little more critical than the first one:
The Web-Access-Log viewer does no filtering for html-/script-tags, and
therefore allows attacks against the user of the admin-console.
For example the request:
http://10.10.10.10:8080/script-that-dont-has-to-exist.jsp?foobar="/>
is stored without sanitizing inside the logfile and the script part is
executed, if the geronimo-admin is accessing the web-access-log-viewer.
An example attack can steal the current session-id of the admin, which
is stored as a cookie.
Vendor:
=======
URL: http://geronimo.apache.org
Bug: http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GERONIMO-1474
Fix: Upgrade to version 1.0.1 or 1.1
Discovered
==========

Remote attacker able to connect to Satellite could use this to obtain some information about RHN Satellite users (such as login names, associated email addresses, internal user IDs, partial information about entitlements).   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=452461#c4)  Mark J.
