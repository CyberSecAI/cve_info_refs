  "CVE-2006-0254": {
    "description": "Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Apache Geronimo 1.0 allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the (1) time parameter to cal2.jsp and (2) any invalid parameter, which causes an XSS when the log file is viewed by the Web-Access-Log viewer.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input within the Apache Geronimo web application, specifically within the jsp-examples and log viewer components.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
       "Improper Input Handling"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject malicious HTML or JavaScript into the web application. This could lead to:\n\n*   Session hijacking.\n*   Defacement of the web application.\n*   Redirection of users to malicious websites.\n*   Theft of sensitive information.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "By injecting malicious code via the `time` parameter in cal2.jsp",
        "By injecting malicious code through any invalid parameter which is then logged and later viewed using the Web Access Log viewer"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected web application. No authentication is needed to inject the malicious code."
