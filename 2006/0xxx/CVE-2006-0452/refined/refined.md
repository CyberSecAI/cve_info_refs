```
- Root cause of vulnerability: A malformed Distinguished Name (DN) consisting of a large number of commas (e.g., 100,000) leads to a recursive loop within the `dn2ancestor` function, specifically when processing the DN one comma at a time.

- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The vulnerability lies in the recursive implementation of the `dn2ancestor` function when handling a malformed DN, leading to excessive resource consumption and ultimately a denial-of-service.

- Impact of exploitation: The primary impact is a denial-of-service (DoS). The recursive calls to `dn2ancestor` exhaust CPU resources and consume all available RAM, leading to an out-of-memory (OOM) condition and server crash.

- Attack vectors: An attacker sends a crafted ModDN operation containing an extremely malformed DN with numerous consecutive commas.

- Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs the ability to send LDAP ModDN requests to the server, which is possible for both authenticated and unauthenticated users depending on the configuration.
