    "Source": "www.exploit-db.com_96a5b736_20250124_120312.html",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization of the 'pass' cookie parameter.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can gain unauthorized access to sensitive information, potentially including user credentials (hashes), by injecting malicious SQL code into the vulnerable cookie parameter.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attacker injects malicious SQL code into the 'pass' cookie, which is then processed by the vulnerable application.",
     "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests with a crafted cookie to the target application. The attacker must know a valid user ID and username in order to confirm the successful retrieval of the hash."
