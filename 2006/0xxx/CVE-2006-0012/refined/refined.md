  "cveId": "CVE-2006-0012",
  "related": true,
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "The vulnerability is due to how Windows Explorer handles COM objects, allowing them to execute arbitrary code without proper user interaction.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of COM objects in Windows Explorer.",
      "Lack of proper warnings or prompts before executing COM objects."
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system with the privileges of the user running Windows Explorer. This could lead to complete system compromise.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Convincing a user to visit a malicious website that forces a connection to a remote file server.",
      "Opening a malicious file or link through email.",
       "Network traffic on TCP ports 139 and 445 for malicious service connections."
    ],
    "requiredCapabilities": "The attacker needs to host a malicious website or send a malicious email/file, and convince a user to interact with it."
  },
  "affectedSystems": [
     "Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 4",
    "Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 1 and Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 2",
    "Microsoft Windows XP Professional x64 Edition",
    "Microsoft Windows Server 2003 and Microsoft Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1",
    "Microsoft Windows Server 2003 for Itanium-based Systems and Microsoft Windows Server 2003 with SP1 for Itanium-based Systems",
    "Microsoft Windows Server 2003 x64 Edition",
    "Microsoft Windows 98, Microsoft Windows 98 Second Edition (SE), and Microsoft Windows Millennium Edition (ME)"
  ],
  "additionalNotes": "The vulnerability is addressed in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS06-015. Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately.  A revised version of the security update was released to address compatibility issues with some third-party software.  Windows 98, 98SE, and ME are critically affected, but Microsoft could not provide an update for them due to the architecture limitations. Microsoft recommends that users of these OSes protect them by using a perimeter firewall.  The update introduces a new file, Verclsid.exe, to verify COM objects before instantiation. The update also includes a Defense in Depth change that ensures that prompting occurs consistently in Internet zone drag and drop scenarios.  Microsoft had not received any information indicating that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued."
