{
  "CVE-2006-0684": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The VHCS (Virtual Hosting Control System) login page does not filter user-supplied input, specifically usernames, before logging them into a database. This allows an attacker to inject HTML/JavaScript code into the log.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
        "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
		"Authentication bypass",
		"Privilege escalation"
      ],
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code in the context of the VHCS administrator's browser by injecting malicious code into the username field and then having the admin view the logs. This could lead to account compromise, further exploitation of other vulnerabilities, and full control of the VHCS GUI with admin privileges.",
      "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the VHCS login form where the username field is vulnerable to injection.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to access the VHCS login page and submit a malicious username. The administrator must then view the Admin logs."
    },
		{
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `check_login()` function in `gui/include/login.php` does not properly terminate execution after redirecting to the login page using `header()`, allowing the calling script to continue execution even if the user is not authenticated.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
        "Authentication bypass"
      ],
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can bypass authentication and execute any PHP script in VHCS, potentially leading to complete system takeover by, for instance, adding a new admin user.",
       "Attack vectors": "By directly accessing vulnerable PHP scripts.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker does not need to authenticate. They need the URL to the vulnerable script and be able to send an HTTP request to it."
    },
		{
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The script `admin/add_user.php`, used to add new administrator users, does not properly check if the user running the script has the necessary administrative privileges.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
        "Privilege escalation"
      ],
      "Impact of exploitation": "An authenticated user, including a normal domain user with limited privileges, can execute `admin/add_user.php` and create a new admin user. This can lead to full control of the VHCS system by an attacker.",
      "Attack vectors": "The attacker must be an authenticated user with a VHCS session cookie.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be logged in as a user on the system and needs access to the vulnerable script via a web browser."
