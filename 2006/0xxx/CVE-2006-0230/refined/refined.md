Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2006-0230:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Symantec Scan Engine's administrative web interface uses a client-side Java applet for authentication. Critically, no server-side authentication is performed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Lack of server-side authentication: The web interface relies solely on the client-side applet for authentication, meaning the server does not verify login attempts. This design flaw allows an attacker to bypass authentication completely.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthorized access: A remote, unauthenticated attacker can gain full administrative access to the Symantec Scan Engine.
- Password change: Exploit code was available to remotely change the administrator password.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network access: The administrative web interface is enabled by default on port 8004/tcp, making it accessible over the network.
- Remote exploitation: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, allowing attackers from outside the network perimeter to gain access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network connectivity: The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable port (8004/tcp).
- No prior authentication: No valid credentials are required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability was publicly disclosed on 2006-04-21.
- Exploit code was available for remote password changes at the time of publication of the vulnerability note.
- Symantec provided a patch in their document SYM06-008.
- This vulnerability was reported by Rapid7 and disclosed by Symantec.
