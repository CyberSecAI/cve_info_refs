```
We are pleased to announce the availability of GnuTLS version 1.2.10,
a security bug-fix release on the stable 1.2.x branch.

This release fixes several serious bugs that would make the DER
decoder in libtasn1 crash on invalid input.  The problems were
reported by Evgeny Legerov on the 31th of January.

We invite more detailed analysis of the problem, following our general
security advisory approach explained on:

<http://www.gnu.org/software/gnutls/security.html>

Particularly, it would be useful to answer the question of whether
these bugs are possible to exploit remotely.  It is certainly possible
to cause the server to crash.  We don't have resources to investigate
this problem more ourselves currently.

To make it easier for you to review this problem, I have prepared a
self test that trigger three bugs in the old libtasn1.  It will be
part of GnuTLS 1.3.4, in tests/certder.c.  A diff between libtasn1
0.2.17 and libtasn1 0.2.18 is also available, for those wishing to
analyze the changes made to address the problems.  It contains a few
unrelated fixes too, but it is not too large.  It is available from:

<http://josefsson.org/gnutls/releases/libtasn1/libtasn1-0.2.18-from-0.2.17.patch>

Please send your analysis to [gnutls-dev at gnupg.org](http://lists.gnupg.org/mailman/listinfo/gnutls-dev) and I'll update the
security advisory web page pointing to it.

GnuTLS is a modern C library that implement the standard network
security protocol Transport Layer Security (TLS), for use by network
applications.

Noteworthy changes since version 1.2.9:
- Fix read out bounds bug in DER parser.  Reported by Evgeny Legerov
  <[admin at gleg.net](http://lists.gnupg.org/mailman/listinfo/gnutls-dev)>, and debugging help from Protover SSL.
- Libtasn1 0.2.18 is now required (contains the previous bug fix).
  The included version has been updated too.
- Fix gnutls-cli STARTTLS hang when SIGINT is sent too quickly, thanks to
  Otto Maddox <[ottomaddox at fastmail.fm](http://lists.gnupg.org/mailman/listinfo/gnutls-dev)> and Nozomu Ando <[nand at mac.com](http://lists.gnupg.org/mailman/listinfo/gnutls-dev)>.
- Corrected a bug in certtool for 64 bit machines. Reported
  by Max Kellermann <[max at duempel.org](http://lists.gnupg.org/mailman/listinfo/gnutls-dev)>.
- Corrected bugs in gnutls_certificate_set_x509_crl() and
  gnutls_certificate_set_x509_trust(), that caused memory corruption if
  more than one certificates were added. Report and patch by Max Kellermann.
- Fixed bug in non-blocking gnutls_bye(). gnutls_record_send() will no
  longer invalidate a session if the underlying send fails, but it will
  prevent future writes. That is to allow reading the already received data.
  Patches and bug reports by Yoann Vandoorselaere <[yoann at prelude-ids.org](http://lists.gnupg.org/mailman/listinfo/gnutls-dev)>

Improving GnuTLS is costly, but you can help!  We are looking for
organizations that find GnuTLS useful and wish to contribute back.
You can contribute by reporting bugs, improve the software, or donate
money or equipment.

Commercial support contracts for GnuTLS are available, and they help
finance continued maintenance.  Simon Josefsson Datakonsult, a
Stockholm based privately held company, is currently funding GnuTLS
maintenance.  We are always looking for interesting development
projects.

If you need help to use GnuTLS, or want to help others, you are
invited to join our help-gnutls mailing list, see:
<<http://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/help-gnutls>>.

Vulnerability  : buffer overflows
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2006-0645
Bugtraq ID     : 16568

Evgeny Legerov discovered several out-of-bounds memory accesses in the
DER decoding component component of the Tiny ASN.1 Library that allows
attackers to crash the DER decoder and possibly execute arbitrary code.

The old stable distribution (woody) is not affected by these problems.

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 2_0.2.10-3sarge1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your gnutls packages.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

# libtasn1, GNU TLS: Security flaw in DER decoding — GLSA **200602-08**

A flaw in the parsing of Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) has been
discovered in libtasn1, potentially resulting in the execution of arbitrary
code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-libs/libtasn1** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.2.18** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.2.18** |

| Package | **net-libs/gnutls** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.2.10** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.2.10** |

### Background

Libtasn1 is a library used to parse ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax
Notation One) objects, and perform DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules)
decoding. Libtasn1 is included with the GNU TLS library, which is used
by applications to provide a cryptographically secure communications
channel.

### Description

Evgeny Legerov has reported a flaw in the DER decoding routines
provided by libtasn1, which could cause an out of bounds access to
occur.

### Impact

A remote attacker could cause an application using libtasn1 to
crash and potentially execute arbitrary code by sending specially
crafted input.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All libtasn1 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/libtasn1-0.2.18"
```

All GNU TLS users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-libs/gnutls-1.2.10"
```

Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2006-0645
BugTraq ID     : 16568

Evgeny Legerov discovered several out-of-bounds memory accesses in the
DER decoding component component of the Tiny ASN.1 Library, which is
also present and used in GnuTLS, the GNU implementation for Transport
Layer Security (TLS) 1.0 and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) 3.0 protocols
and which allows attackers to crash the DER decoder and possibly
execute arbitrary code.

The old stable distribution (woody) is not affected by these problems.

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.16-13.2.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your gnutls packages.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=180903#c0)  Mark J. Cox    2006-02-10 14:32:38 UTC  ``` Reported at <http://lists.gnupg.org/pipermail/gnutls-dev/2006-February/001058.html>  "this release fixes several serious bugs that would make the DER decoder in libtasn1 crash on invalid input."  GNU TLS includes Libtasn1, a library developed for ASN.1 strutures management which includes DER encoding and decoding.  Several flaws were found in the way libtasn1 decodes DER.  An attacker could create a carefully crafted invalid X.509 certificate in such a way that could trigger this flaw if parsed by an application linked to GNU TLS.  This could lead to a denial of service (application crash).  It is not yet known if this issue could be escalated to allow arbitrary code execution.  In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, only Evolution makes use of this functionality.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=180903#c1)  Martin Stransky    2006-02-10 17:08:57 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 124516](attachment.cgi?id=124516&action=diff "proposed patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=124516&action=edit "proposed patch") proposed patch   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=180903#c2)  Josh Bressers    2006-02-10 17:38:48 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 124519](attachment.cgi?id=124519 "Testcase") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=124519&action=edit "Testcase") Testcase   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=180903#c3)  Red Hat Bugzilla    2006-02-10 21:38:42 UTC  ```  An advisory has been issued which should help the problem described in this bug report. This report is therefore being closed with a resolution of ERRATA. For more information on the solution and/or where to find the updated files, please follow the link below.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

protocols such as TLS. GNU TLS includes Libtasn1, a library developed for
ASN.1 structures management that includes DER encoding and decoding.

Several flaws were found in the way libtasn1 decodes DER. An attacker
could create a carefully crafted invalid X.509 certificate in such a way
that could trigger this flaw if parsed by an application that uses GNU TLS.
This could lead to a denial of service (application crash). It is not
certain if this issue could be escalated to allow arbitrary code execution.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assigned the name
CVE-2006-0645 to this issue.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, the GNU TLS library is only used by the
Evolution client when connecting to an Exchange server or when publishing
calendar information to a WebDAV server.

Users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a
backported patch from the GNU TLS maintainers to correct this issue.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

This release solves the DER security issue on the experimental branch
too.  It contains a few other fixes too.

GnuTLS is a modern C library that implement the standard network
security protocol Transport Layer Security (TLS), for use by network
applications.

Noteworthy changes since version 1.3.3:
- Fix read of out bounds bug in DER parser.
Reported by Evgeny Legerov <[admin at gleg.net](http://lists.gnupg.org/mailman/listinfo/gnutls-dev)>, and debugging help from
Protover SSL.  Libtasn1 0.2.18 is now required, which contains the
previous bug fix.  The included libtasn1 version in GnuTLS has been
updated.

- Fixed bug in non-blocking gnutls_bye(). gnutls_record_send() will no
longer invalidate a session if the underlying send fails, but it will
prevent future writes. That is to allow reading the already received data.
Patches and bug reports by Yoann Vandoorselaere <[yoann at prelude-ids.org](http://lists.gnupg.org/mailman/listinfo/gnutls-dev)>

- Corrected bugs in gnutls_certificate_set_x509_crl() and
gnutls_certificate_set_x509_trust(), that caused memory corruption if
more than one certificates were added. Report and patch by Max Kellermann.

- Fix build problems of OpenCDK on AIX.
Thanks to "Heiden, John" <[JHeiden at UTNet.UToledo.Edu](http://lists.gnupg.org/mailman/listinfo/gnutls-dev)>.

- API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

Improving GnuTLS is costly, but you can help!  We are looking for
organizations that find GnuTLS useful and wish to contribute back.
You can contribute by reporting bugs, improve the software, or donate
money or equipment.

Commercial support contracts for GnuTLS are available, and they help
finance continued maintenance.  Simon Josefsson Datakonsult, a
Stockholm based privately held company, is currently funding GnuTLS
maintenance.  We are always looking for interesting development
projects.

If you need help to use GnuTLS, or want to help others, you are
invited to join our help-gnutls mailing list, see:
<<http://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/help-gnutls>>.

# [gnutls-dev] Libtasn1 0.2.18 - Tiny ASN.1 Library - Security release

All,

this release fixes several serious bugs that would make the DER
decoder in libtasn1 crash on invalid input.  The problems were
reported by Evgeny Legerov on the 31th of January.  New releases of
GnuTLS will follow later today.

We invite more detailed analysis of the problem, following our general
security advisory approach explained on:

<http://www.gnu.org/software/gnutls/security.html>

Particularly, it would be useful to answer the question of whether
these bugs are possible to exploit remotely.  It is certainly possible
to cause the server to crash.  We don't have resources to investigate
this problem more ourselves currently.

To make it easier for you to review this problem, I have prepared a
self test that trigger three bugs in the old libtasn1.  It will be
part of GnuTLS 1.3.4, in tests/certder.c.  I have also created a diff
between libtasn1 0.2.17 and libtasn1 0.2.18.  I contains unrelated
fixes too, but it is not too large.  It is available from:

<http://josefsson.org/gnutls/releases/libtasn1/libtasn1-0.2.18-from-0.2.17.patch>

Please send your analysis to [gnutls-dev at gnupg.org](http://lists.gnupg.org/mailman/listinfo/gnutls-dev) and I'll update the
security advisory web page pointing to it.

Libtasn1 is a standalone library written in C for manipulating ASN.1
objects including DER encoding and DER decoding.  It is used by GnuTLS
to manipulate X.509 objects and by GNU Shishi to handle Kerberos
packets.

Version 0.2.18
- Fix out-of-bounds access in DER decoding, reported by Evgeny Legerov.
- Add 'const' keyword to some prototypes, thanks to Frediano ZIGLIO.
- Fixed typo in src/Makefile.am to make it build with objdir != srcdir,
  thanks to Bernard Leak.
- Update of gnulib files.
- Typo fixes in comments, e.g. finish libasn1 to libtasn1 renaming,
  use LGPL boiler plate on some files in lib/.

Commercial support contracts for Libtasn1 are available, and they help
finance continued maintenance.  Simon Josefsson Datakonsult, a
Stockholm based privately held company, is currently funding Libtasn1
maintenance.  We are always looking for interesting development
projects.

If you need help to use Libtasn1, or want to help others, you are
