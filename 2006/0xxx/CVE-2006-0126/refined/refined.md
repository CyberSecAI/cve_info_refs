{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is related to the handling of escape sequences, specifically the ESC G (query rxvt graphics mode) sequence, which was vulnerable to exploitation.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure handling of escape sequences",
      "Unvalidated input leading to arbitrary code execution"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution within the urxvt process.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending a malicious crafted escape sequence to the terminal"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to control the output to the terminal.",
     "additional_details": "The vulnerability is exploitable in versions 9.25 and 9.26, while it is present, it should not be exploitable in 9.30. The fix involves disabling the ESC G query and improving the sanitization of terminal input."
