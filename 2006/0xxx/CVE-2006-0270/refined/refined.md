{
  "CVE-2006-0270": [
    {
      "Root cause": "The Oracle security feature \"Transparent Data Encryption\" stores the master key unencrypted in the SGA.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
        "Information disclosure: Master key for Transparent Data Encryption is stored in plaintext in the SGA."
      ],
      "Impact of exploitation": "A skilled attacker or non-security DBA can retrieve the plaintext master key, potentially compromising encrypted data.",
      "Attack vectors": "Attacker needs access to the server and the ability to run `dumpsga` and `strings` utilities or directly access the SGA memory.",
       "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to have shell access and be able to execute commands on the database server, or have direct access to memory to read from the SGA."
    },
     {
      "Root cause": "Multiple vulnerabilities exist in numerous Oracle products.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
        "Remote execution of arbitrary code",
        "Disclosure of sensitive information",
        "Denial of service conditions"
      ],
      "Impact of exploitation": "Remote execution of arbitrary code, disclosure of sensitive information, and denial-of-service conditions. Database compromises may result in the disclosure of sensitive personal information, such as credit card numbers, social security numbers, and health and patient information.",
      "Attack vectors": "Varied depending on the particular application and vulnerability being attacked.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Varies based on the vulnerability being exploited."
