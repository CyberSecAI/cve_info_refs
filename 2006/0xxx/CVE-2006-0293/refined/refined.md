  "CVE-2006-0293": {
    "description": "The function allocation code allows attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code.",
    "root_cause": "A garbage collection hazard exists in the JavaScript engine. When allocating a function object, some routines use temporary variables that were not properly protected (rooted). A user-defined method triggered during the temporary's lifetime could cause garbage collection. When the user-defined routine returns, the engine might operate on an unexpectedly freed temporary object.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper object dereferencing in the JavaScript interpreter"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service and possible arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": "Specially crafted Javascript code can be injected into a web page or email.",
        "required_capabilities": "Remote attacker can create a malicious web page or email"
  }
