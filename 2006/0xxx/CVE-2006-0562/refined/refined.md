Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of input sanitization in the `problem.php` script of Pluggedout Blog version 1.9.9c. Specifically, the script directly prints the value of the `$_REQUEST["data"]` parameter without any form of encoding or filtering.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS. Since user-supplied input is directly echoed to the page without proper handling, an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code, which would be executed in the browser of anyone who visits a crafted URL using the `problem.php` script.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser.
- **Potential for various attacks:** This could lead to various malicious activities like:
    - Session hijacking by stealing cookies.
    - Defacement of the website.
    - Redirection to phishing websites.
    - Stealing sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct Request:** The identified attack vector is a direct request to the `problem.php` script using a crafted URL with the malicious JavaScript code injected via the `data` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL containing the malicious JavaScript and send it to a potential victim who will access the URL through their browser.

**Technical Details:**

The relevant code snippet from the provided message is:
```php
switch ($_REQUEST["id"]){
...
	case "1":
...
		print "Problem with Database Result Code<br><br>".$_REQUEST["data"];
```
This code directly uses the `$_REQUEST["data"]` variable in an HTML context without any sanitization, making the XSS possible.
