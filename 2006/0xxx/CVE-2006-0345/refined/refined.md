{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "User-defined data is not properly sanitized, leading to SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "SQL Injection: Arbitrary SQL code can be injected due to insufficient sanitization of user input.",
    "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Arbitrary javascript code can be inserted through the website variable in view.php."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries to potentially access, modify, or delete data in the database. Also, an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the website, which can be executed in the browsers of other users.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "SQL Injection: By manipulating the 'id' parameter in the 'viewprofile.php' script. Also, by manipulating search fields.",
    "XSS: By injecting JavaScript code into the 'website' parameter when adding a new comment."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application, which is typically done via a web browser. For the SQL injection, the attacker needs to be able to manipulate URL parameters. For the XSS, they need to be able to submit comments."
