Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2006-0492:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input before it's used in SQL queries within the Calendarix application. Specifically, the variables `$catview` in `cal_functions.inc.php` and `$login` in `admin/cal_login.php` are not sanitized.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:**  The lack of sanitization allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the application's queries through the vulnerable variables.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** When `magic_quotes_gpc` is disabled (off), an attacker can bypass authentication using a specially crafted username.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary SQL Query Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially allowing them to access, modify, or delete data within the database.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the administrative interface and potentially take full control of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Requests:** The vulnerable parameters are accessible via HTTP GET requests.
    *   `$catview` parameter in `cal_day.php`
    *   `$login` parameter in `admin/cal_login.php`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target Calendarix application.
*   For the authentication bypass, the attacker needs to target a system where the PHP configuration setting `magic_quotes_gpc` is turned off.
*   Basic understanding of SQL injection techniques is required.

**Detailed Exploitation Examples:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:**  Sending a login request to `http://host/calendarix/admin/cal_login.php` with a username like `' or 1/*` and any password will bypass authentication.
*   **SQL Injection:** Sending a request to `http://host/calendarix/cal_day.php?op=day&date=2006-01-10&catview=99%20union%20select%2012345` injects SQL code through the `catview` parameter.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered on 2006-01-26 by Aliaksandr Hartsuyeu (eVuln.com).
*   The vulnerable software is Calendarix version 0.6.20050830.
*   A proof-of-concept exploit is available.
*   No solution is available as of the time of the advisory.
