Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2006-0136:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Chimera Web Portal System version 0.2 suffers from multiple vulnerabilities due to insufficient input sanitization in `modules.php` and `linkcategory.php`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   The `modules.php` script does not sanitize user-supplied input in variables like `comment_poster`, `comment_poster_email`, `comment_poster_homepage`, and `comment_text`.
    *   This allows attackers to inject arbitrary script code, leading to XSS attacks.
2.  **SQL Injection:**
    *   The `linkcategory.php` script does not properly sanitize the `$id` variable before using it in a SQL query.
    *   An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code to perform unauthorized database operations.
    *   This vulnerability is exploitable when `magic_quotes_gpc` is disabled.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **XSS:** Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to execute malicious JavaScript in the context of the victim's browser. This can be used for actions like stealing session cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, or performing actions on behalf of the user.
*   **SQL Injection:** Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to read, modify, or delete data from the database. The provided exploit shows the ability to extract the admin password.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **XSS:**
    *   Attackers can inject malicious scripts through the guestbook feature within `modules.php` by manipulating input parameters.
*  **SQL Injection:**
    *   Attackers can inject SQL code via the `id` parameter in `linkcategory.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **XSS:** An attacker needs to be able to post data through the guestbook feature. No special access is needed to exploit the XSS vulnerability.
*   **SQL Injection:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the `linkcategory.php` page. The `magic_quotes_gpc` setting needs to be off for the SQL injection to work.

**Additional Notes**
*   The provided information also specifies that no solution for these vulnerabilities is available at the time of discovery.
*   The vendor of the vulnerable software is Phanatic Softwares.
*   The vulnerabilities were discovered by Aliaksandr Hartsuyeu (eVuln.com).
