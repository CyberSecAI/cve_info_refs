Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The primary root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of the `$HTTP_POST_VARS[username]` variable in the `check.php` script before it is used in an SQL query. This allows for SQL injection.
- Additionally, the `check.php` script does not perform password comparison when identifying a user via cookies, enabling authentication bypass.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection because user-supplied input (`username`) is directly incorporated into an SQL query without proper sanitization/validation.
- **Authentication Bypass:** The application has flawed cookie-based authentication logic, as it does not verify the password against the stored user information when using cookies.
- **Multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL Injection:** The administrator's control panel has multiple XSS and SQL injection vulnerabilities (though the details of these are not specified in the provided content).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Complete Authentication Bypass:** Attackers can bypass the authentication mechanism using SQL injection or by crafting specific cookies.
- **Arbitrary SQL Execution:** Through SQL injection, attackers can execute arbitrary SQL queries, which can potentially allow them to access, modify, or delete sensitive data stored in the database, and even compromise the entire database.
- **Cross-Site Scripting:** Attackers could potentially inject malicious scripts into the administrator control panel.
- **Complete System Compromise:** Through successful exploitation, an attacker could potentially gain complete access to the application and underlying system, depending on the level of access the application has and how well the database is secured.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** Attackers can inject SQL code via the `username` parameter of an HTTP POST request to the `login.php` page.
- **Manipulated Cookies:** Attackers can bypass authentication by crafting specific cookies such as `loged=yes`, `username=admin`, and `user_level=1`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable web application.
- **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** Attackers need to be able to craft HTTP requests.
- **SQL Injection Knowledge:** To exploit the SQL injection vulnerability, attackers must understand SQL syntax and how to craft malicious SQL queries.
- **Cookie Manipulation:** To exploit the cookie-based authentication bypass, the attacker needs to be able to set or manipulate cookies in their browser or HTTP client.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is present in `phpstatus` version 1.0.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Aliaksandr Hartsuyeu.
- A proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit is available.
- No patch was available at the time of the advisory.
- The vulnerability is considered a medium risk.
- The vulnerability is located in the `check.php` script.
