- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the `forum.php` script in oaBoard not initializing the `$inc` and `$inc_stat` variables before using them in an `include()` statement. This allows for the inclusion of arbitrary remote files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Uninitialized variables leading to arbitrary file inclusion. The code relies on user-supplied input without proper sanitization or validation, especially when the `register_globals` PHP setting is enabled.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code by including a malicious PHP file from a remote server. This can lead to complete compromise of the web server, data theft, or further attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the HTTP GET method by providing a malicious URL in the `inc` parameter of the `forum.php` script.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and have a server to host the malicious PHP file. The `register_globals` setting in the vulnerable server must also be enabled.
