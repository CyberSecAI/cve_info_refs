{
  "CVE-2006-0898": {
    "description": "The perl-Crypt-CBC package had a flaw which could result in weak encryption.",
    "root_cause": "The Crypt::CBC Perl module, when running in RandomIV mode, uses an initialization vector (IV) of 8 bytes, which results in weaker encryption when used with a cipher that requires a larger block size than 8 bytes, such as Rijndael.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use of an insufficient initialization vector (IV) size when using a cipher block chaining (CBC) mode of operation with a block cipher. If the IV is smaller than the block size of the encryption algorithm, part of the encryption block is initialized to zeros, leading to less randomness in the encryption and reduced security."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could exploit weak ciphertext produced by Crypt::CBC to bypass certain security restrictions or to gain access to sensitive data.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Exploitation would occur through the use of vulnerable software that uses the Crypt::CBC module for encryption."
    ],
   "required_capabilities": "The attacker would need the ability to access or intercept communications encrypted using the vulnerable version of Crypt::CBC, knowledge of the used algorithm, and the ability to perform cryptanalysis on the resulting ciphertext."
