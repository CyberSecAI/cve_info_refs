H D Moore mentioned that Wine contains vulnerable code similar to
Microsoft Windows:

<<http://lists.immunitysec.com/pipermail/dailydave/2006-January/002806.html>>

The fix seems to be to remove that case label.

Subject: different CVE for wine SETABORTPROC WMF issue
Date: Mon, 9 Jan 2006 14:11:22 -0500 (EST)
```

All,

I have assigned [CVE-2006-0106](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-0106) for the WMF issue in Wine.  This is a
separate candidate than [CVE-2005-4560](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-4560).  This could justifiably be
argued as a design problem in WMF itself, but lately CVE has been
splitting these issues - the rationale being "if it's a design error
then each implementation has its own responsibility to work around
it."

gdi/driver.c and gdi/printdrv.c in Wine 20050930, and other versions,
implement the SETABORTPROC GDI Escape function call for Windows
Metafile (WMF) files, which allows attackers to execute arbitrary
code, the same vulnerability as [CVE-2005-4560](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-4560) but in a different
codebase.

Closes: [346197](bugreport.cgi?bug=346197)
Changes:
 wine (0.9.2-1) unstable; urgency=low
 .
   * New upstream release 0.9.2.
     - Winelib Explorer app (just a wrapper around winefile for now).
     - Debugger cleanups and improvements.
     - Many wininet fixes.
     - Better autogenerated API manpages.
     - A bunch of Korean translations.
     - Lots of bug fixes.
   * This version was released Nov 22, 2005.
   * Installed the explorer program into wine-utils.
   * Renamed wineeject back to eject, and decided to go with upstream's
     way to avoid the naming conflict: launch with "wine eject", not
     with a wrapper script in /usr/bin.
   * Grabbed the WMF patch by Marcus Meissner from Wine CVS.
     It suppresses the dispatch of SETABORTPROC escapes from metafile
     records (dlls/gdi/metafile.c). Some security-minded people seem to
     want this to be fixed right away, even though it's obvious Wine
     could never be a 100% secure program.
     Closes: #[346197](bugreport.cgi?bug=346197).

Vulnerability  : design flaw
Problem-Type   : local (remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2006-0106
Debian Bug     : 346197

H D Moore that discovered that Wine, a free implemention of the Microsoft
Windows APIs, inherits a design flaw from the Windows GDI API, which may
lead to the execution of code through GDI escape functions in WMF files.

The old stable distribution (woody) does not seem to be affected by this
problem.

For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.0.20050310-1.2.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.2-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your wine packages.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Wine: Windows Metafile SETABORTPROC vulnerability — GLSA **200601-09**

There is a flaw in Wine in the handling of Windows Metafiles (WMF) files,
which could possibly result in the execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-emulation/wine** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **20060000**> **20040000** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.9** |

### Background

Wine is a free implementation of Windows APIs for Unix-like systems.

### Description

H D Moore discovered that Wine implements the insecure-by-design
SETABORTPROC GDI Escape function for Windows Metafile (WMF) files.

### Impact

An attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted Windows
Metafile (WMF) file from within a Wine executed Windows application,
possibly resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the rights
of the user running Wine.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Wine users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-emulation/wine-0.9.0"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
