## Oracle Database Data Pump Metadata API SQL injection vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#983340

Original Release Date: 2006-01-25 | Last Revised: 2006-04-19

---

### Overview

Oracle Database Data Pump Metadata API is vulnerable to SQL injection, which could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands on a vulnerable Oracle installation.

### Description

| The Oracle Database Data Pump Metadata API fails to properly filter user-supplied input. This may allow a remote attacker to insert arbitrary SQL commands, which may be executed by the database. We believe that this package is accessible by users with PUBLIC privileges.  Based on research into public information, we believe that this issue is Oracle vuln# DB06 in the Oracle CPU for January 2006. However, there is not sufficient information to authoritatively relate Oracle vulnerability information to information provided by other parties. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker may be able to execute SQL queries on a server, possibly with elevated privileges. As a result, attackers may be able to view or modify the contents of an Oracle database. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply patches**This issue is corrected in the [Oracle Critical Patch Update for January 2006](http://www.oracle.com/technology/deploy/security/pdf/cpujan2006.html). |

Oracle delivers a so-called [password checking tool](http://updates.oracle.com/ARULink/PatchDetails/process_form?patch_num=4926128) (Patch 4926128). This tool is just a SQL-Select statement which checks the existance of some password hashes. This SELECT statement is incomplete. You should always access the table SYS.USER$ to avoid hidden users (details see [Oracle rootkits](http://www.red-database-security.com/wp/db_rootkits_us.pdf) ).  ``` ----------------Oracle Password Checking Tool ------------------  SELECT username "Account Name", account_status "Account Status" FROM dba_users WHERE (username, password) IN ( ('SYS',                         '5638228DAF52805F'), ('SYS',                         'D4C5016086B2DC6A'), ('SYSTEM',                      'D4DF7931AB130E37'), ('CTXSYS',                      '24ABAB8B06281B4C'), ('DBSNMP',                      'E066D214D5421CCC'), ('MDSYS',                       '72979A94BAD2AF80'), ('MDSYS',                       '9AAEB2214DCC9A31'), ('OUTLN',                       '4A3BA55E08595C81'), ('SCOTT',                       'F894844C34402B67'), ('ORDCOMMON',			'9B616F5489F90AD7')) AND account_status <> 'EXPIRED \& LOCKED' ORDER BY username;----------------Oracle Password Checking Tool ------------------  ```  If you need a good, free and fast password checker you could use [checkpwd](http://www.red-database-security.com/software/checkpwd.html) from Red-Database-Security GmbH.
