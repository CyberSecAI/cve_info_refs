Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `$_GET[post]` variable in `index.php` is not properly sanitized.
*   Configuration directories are not protected by `.htaccess` in default installations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Directory Traversal:** The lack of sanitization of the `$_GET[post]` variable allows an attacker to traverse directories and access arbitrary files.
*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:**  Unprotected configuration directories expose sensitive data, including user logins and password hashes (likely MD5).
*  **Arbitrary File Upload**: The administrator can upload arbitrary files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access to Files:** Attackers can read arbitrary files with the `.txt` extension.
*   **Exposure of User Credentials:**  Attackers can obtain usernames and password hashes.
*   **System Access:** The combination of file access and file upload can potentially lead to full system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by crafting a malicious GET request to `index.php` with a manipulated `post` parameter to include directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable RCBlog instance.
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the directory traversal vulnerability or access the unprotected configuration files.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was found in RCBlog versions 1.0.2 and 1.0.3.
*   The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates the directory traversal: `http://host/rcblog/index.php?post=../config/password`
*  The `evuln.com` content also notes that the administrator can upload arbitrary files, which could further escalate the impact of this vulnerability.
*  There is no solution provided for this vulnerability.
