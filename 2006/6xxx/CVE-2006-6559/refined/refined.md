Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2006-6559

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of this vulnerability is an SQL injection flaw in the `ProductDetails.asp` page of the "Request For Travel 1.0" application. This occurs due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input within the URL parameters, specifically the `CID`, `RID`, and `PID` parameters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary vulnerability is an SQL injection flaw. The application directly incorporates user-provided parameters into an SQL query without proper sanitization or escaping.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to:
*   Modify existing data in the database.
*   Potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive information stored in the database.
*   Alter the application's behavior by modifying stored procedures or other SQL elements.
* In the provided example, the attacker is shown modifying news titles.

**Attack Vectors:**
The vulnerability is exposed through the HTTP GET method on `ProductDetails.asp`. By crafting a malicious URL containing SQL injection payloads within parameters like `CID`, `RID`, and `PID`, an attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands on the backend database.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   The attacker does not require prior authentication or access to the server other than the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application
*   A basic understanding of SQL injection techniques is needed to craft a successful attack.
*   The attacker must have knowledge of the application's path.

**Summary of Exploit (From exploit-db.com):**
The exploit involves injecting SQL code into the `ProductDetails.asp` page via the `CID`, `RID`, and `PID` parameters. For example:

```
//ProductDetails.asp?from=desc&mod=region&CID=-1&RID=-1&PID=-1;update%20gtsNews%20set%20NewsTitle='kro'--
```
This injects a SQL query to update the `NewsTitle` field in the `gtsNews` table to the value 'kro'.
