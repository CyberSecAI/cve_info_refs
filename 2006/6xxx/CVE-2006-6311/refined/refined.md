Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2006-6311:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the way Internet Explorer 6 handles CSS "expression" properties, specifically related to dynamic width calculations within tables. The `expression()` function allows for dynamic Javascript code execution within CSS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CSS Expression Vulnerability:** The use of the `expression()` function allows the execution of arbitrary Javascript code within the style property.
- **Recursive Function Calls:** The provided exploits leverage the ability to dynamically calculate table widths with nested function calls, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can cause Internet Explorer 6 to become unresponsive, consuming significant system resources and ultimately crashing. This results in a denial of service to the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote:** The attack can be performed remotely by an attacker hosting a malicious website.
- **Web Browsing:** The vulnerability is triggered by an unsuspecting user browsing a website containing the malicious CSS code within a HTML page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Malicious Website Hosting:** The attacker needs to host a website containing the malicious code.
- **No authentication:** No user authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits demonstrate the following:

*   **Exploit 1:** Uses `expression(document.getElementById('foo').offsetWidth+'px')` within the `width` property of a table, dynamically calculating and updating the table's width based on an outer div's width. The nested calls to get the width trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Exploit 2:** Uses `expression(window.open(self.location))` within the `width` style property which attempts to open a new window to the same location resulting in a rapid chain of actions that hangs the browser.
*   **Exploit 3:** Combines the concepts of both, by using `expression(parseInt(window.open(self.location))+document.getElementById('foo').offsetWidth+'px')` to dynamically modify table width, and trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

- The exploit has a low risk classification with a CVSS base score of 5/10.
- The exploitability subscore is rated as 10/10 indicating the ease of exploitation.
- The attack complexity is low.
- The confidentiality and integrity impacts are none with a partial impact on availability.
- The vulnerability affects Internet Explorer 6, tested on Windows XP SP2 (MSIE 6.0.2900.2180).
