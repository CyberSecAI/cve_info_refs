      "source": "securityreason.com_5a3c1a75_20250125_222339.html",
      "root_cause": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user input in the `main` parameter of the `/default.asp` URL.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "SQL Injection",
		"Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
      ],
        "impact": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries against the database, potentially leading to data theft, modification, or complete database compromise. Additionally, the presence of XSS vulnerabilities allows the attacker to inject malicious scripts, possibly leading to session hijacking or further attacks against other users.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "The SQL injection vulnerability can be exploited through HTTP GET requests to `/default.asp` with a malicious `main` parameter.",
		"The XSS vulnerabilities can be exploited through HTTP GET requests to `/default.asp` with a malicious `cat` parameter in `action=view1`."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "An attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely without authentication."

       "root_cause": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection in the `main` parameter of `/default.asp` due to insufficient input sanitization.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "SQL Injection"
      ],
        "impact": "An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries and potentially extract sensitive information such as admin usernames and passwords.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "HTTP GET request to `/default.asp` with a crafted `main` parameter. Example payload: `-1%20union%20select%200,username,0,0%20from%20admin%20where%20id%20like%20<ID>`."
