{
  "CVE-2006-6303": {
    "Description": "An error was found in Ruby's CGI library that did not correctly quote the boundary of multipart MIME requests. Using a crafted HTTP request, a remote user could cause a denial of service, where Ruby CGI applications would end up in a loop, monopolizing a CPU.",
    "Root cause": "The read_multipart function in Ruby's CGI library (cgi.rb) does not properly check boundaries in MIME multipart content.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of multipart MIME boundaries"
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) by sending a crafted HTTP request that triggers an infinite loop within Ruby CGI applications, leading to high CPU usage and service disruption.",
    "Attack vectors": "Sending a crafted HTTP request with multipart MIME encoding containing a malformed MIME boundary specifier.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Remote attacker capable of sending HTTP requests to a vulnerable server."
