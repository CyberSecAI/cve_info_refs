Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** SQL injection vulnerability in the `id_user` parameter of the `administre2.php` script.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   SQL Injection: The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input passed through the `id_user` parameter before using it in a SQL query.

*   **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   Database Information Disclosure: Attackers can use SQL injection to extract sensitive data from the database, such as user credentials (`passe` in the example).
    *   Potential for further compromise:  Depending on the database permissions, the attacker might be able to modify or delete data, or potentially execute system commands.

*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   HTTP GET Request: The vulnerability is exploited by crafting a malicious URL, specifically modifying the `id_user` parameter within the `administre2.php` script.
    *   Specifically, the injection occurs within the `id_user` parameter which is part of the query string.

*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   Network Access: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
    *   No Authentication Required (in the provided example): The provided exploit does not appear to require prior authentication.
    
* **Exploit details**:
    *   The provided exploit uses a `UNION SELECT` SQL injection technique to extract data from the `connect_upload_fichier` table by bypassing the intended query logic.
    *   The attacker supplies `-1` to the vulnerable `id_user` parameter which forces the application to not find a valid user which is then followed by a `UNION SELECT` statement which bypasses the original query and returns results from the attacker's query instead of the application's query.
    *   The `passe` field is selected which indicates that user credentials are being targeted.
