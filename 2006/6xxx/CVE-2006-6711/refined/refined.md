{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application uses an unsanitized, user-supplied `chemin` parameter in the `mapage.php` file, to include a file using the `REQUIRE` function, leading to Remote File Inclusion.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server by including a malicious file from a remote location.",
  "Attack vectors": "HTTP GET request with a crafted `chemin` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and have access to a server where the malicious payload is hosted."
