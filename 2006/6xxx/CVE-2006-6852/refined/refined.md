Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the ability to execute arbitrary Ruby scripts within the tDiary application. This occurs due to insufficient input sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to execute arbitrary Ruby code. This means an attacker can run any code they choose on the server hosting tDiary.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The vulnerability suggests that user-supplied input is not properly sanitized or validated before being processed by the tDiary application, leading to the ability to inject malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could lead to a range of severe impacts:
- **File Leakage:** Attackers could read sensitive files, including configuration files and potentially password files.
- **File Modification:** Attackers could modify or corrupt files on the server.
- **Data Breaches:**  Sensitive data, like passwords, user information, and blog content, could be stolen.
- **Website Defacement:**  The attacker could alter the content of the blog.
- **System Compromise:** In severe cases, attackers could gain full control of the server where tDiary is hosted.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves injecting malicious Ruby code through a flaw in the tDiary application.
- The exact method of injection isn't specified in the provided text, but it would likely involve some form of user-supplied input that isn't properly validated.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the vulnerable part of the tDiary application where the malicious code is injected.
- They would need to have some level of access to the tDiary system to trigger the vulnerability. The specific access level is not provided in the text, but it could potentially be something available to standard users of the blog.
- Knowledge of Ruby programming language is required to construct malicious payloads.

**Affected Versions:**
- tDiary 2.0.3
- tDiary 2.1.4.20061127
