{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The Apple AirPort Extreme wireless driver fails to properly handle malformed 802.11 frames, leading to an out-of-bounds memory access.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of malformed 802.11 frames",
      "Out-of-bounds memory access"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker within 802.11 radio range can cause a denial-of-service condition by crashing a vulnerable system (kernel panic).",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending specially crafted 802.11 frames over a wireless network."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker must be within 802.11 radio range of the vulnerable system and be able to send crafted 802.11 frames.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability affects the Core Duo version of Mac mini, MacBook, and MacBook Pro computers. Wireless encryption (WEP/WPA) may not mitigate this vulnerability because 802.11b and 802.11g management frames are not encrypted."
