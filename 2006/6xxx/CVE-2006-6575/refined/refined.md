Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

* **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `ldap.php` script of yaplap versions 0.6 and 0.6.1. The script includes a file based on user-controlled input through the `LOGIN_style` parameter, leading to remote file inclusion.
* **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application directly includes a file based on user-supplied input without proper sanitization or validation. Specifically the vulnerable code is `include $LOGIN_style."_form.php";` where `$LOGIN_style` is directly controlled by the user via the `LOGIN_style` GET parameter.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can include and execute arbitrary remote files on the server, potentially leading to:
    *   **Code Execution:** By including a malicious PHP script, the attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.
    *   **Data Theft:** The attacker could potentially access sensitive data on the server.
    *   **Denial of Service:** The attacker could disrupt the normal operation of the server.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker sends a crafted GET request to the `ldap.php` file, providing the URL of a malicious script via the `LOGIN_style` parameter.
        * The exploit example shows an attack using a GET request to `ldap.php?LOGIN_style=[shell_location]`

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
    *   **Malicious File Hosting:** The attacker needs a publicly accessible location to host the malicious PHP script.
