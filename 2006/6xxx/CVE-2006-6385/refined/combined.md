## Intel network drivers privilege escalation vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#296681

Original Release Date: 2006-12-18 | Last Revised: 2007-01-19

---

### Overview

A buffer overflow vulnerability in Intel PRO Ethernet drivers may allow local attackers to execute code with elevated privileges.

### Description

| [Intel network adapter](http://support.intel.com/support/network/sb/cs-006103.htm) drivers are developed and maintained by Intel for Windows and Linux operating systems.  A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in all PCI, PCI-X and PCIe Intel network adapter drivers. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may allow a local attacker to run commands with additional privileges or gain other unintended access.Note that Intel has provided [instructions](http://support.intel.com/support/network/sb/CS-023453.htm) to determine what driver version is installed on Windows or Linux systems. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A local authenticated attacker may be able to gain SYSTEM privileges. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade**Intel has released upgraded drivers for [PCI](http://support.intel.com/support/network/sb/cs-006103.htm), [PCI-X](http://support.intel.com/support/network/sb/cs-006120.htm) and [PCIe](http://support.intel.com/support/network/adapter/pro100/sb/cs-008402.htm) network adapters. |

Hi,

I found an advisory
(<http://www.intel.com/support/network/sb/CS-023726.htm>) from intel for
their LAN driver for the eepro100 and gigabit network cards.

Is the FreeBSD em driver in any way affected by this problem? Looks like
it is at least derived from the intel driver.

greetings,
philipp wuensche

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
