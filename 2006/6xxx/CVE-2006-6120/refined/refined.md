{
  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "root_cause": "An integer overflow occurs in `KLaola::readBigBlockDepot()` within `klaola.cc` when reading a PowerPoint (.ppt) file. The `num_of_bbd_blocks` variable, which determines the size of the `bigBlockDepot` buffer, is populated from the file without proper sanitization. This can lead to an integer overflow, causing the allocation of a smaller buffer than intended.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Integer Overflow",
        "Heap Overflow"
      ],
      "impact": "Opening a specially crafted PowerPoint file can lead to a denial of service (application crash) and potentially arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running KOffice. The heap is overwritten, leading to memory corruption.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Malicious file exploitation"
      ],
      "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a specially crafted PowerPoint file and entice the victim to open it."
