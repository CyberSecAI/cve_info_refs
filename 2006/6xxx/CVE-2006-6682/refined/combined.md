"chetpasswd uses the HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR for authentication purposes(...). \
Obviously, HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR is not a trusted variable, and can be spoofed by any \
scriptkiddie who can read the man page of wget (...).

Furthermore, this cgi script doesn't seem to implement any rate limiting for the \

is wrong, thereby exposing the names of user accounts to external attackers (...)."

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

```
Subject: uses HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR for authentication (and other security holes)
Package: chetcpasswd
Version: 2.3.3-1
Severity: critical
Tags: security

chetpasswd uses the HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR for authentication purposes:

   if(getenv("HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR"))
      sprintf(IP,"%s",getenv("HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR"));
    else sprintf(IP,"%s",getenv("REMOTE_ADDR"));

and then goes on to check IP against
/etc/chetcpasswd/chetcpasswd.allow.

Obviously, HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR is not a trusted variable, and can be
spoofed by any scriptkiddie who can read the man page of wget.  Simply
spoofing it to 127.0.0.1 will give access to the password changing app
from any remote host.

Furthermore, this cgi script doesn't seem to implement any rate
limiting for the passwd checks, thereby  allowing for a dictionary
attack via http.  Also, it seems to give different a error message if
the user is not found then if the entered password is wrong, thereby
exposing the names of user accounts to external attackers.

There are also issues with the package not using pam, and its
circumventing of any checks the admin might have in place.

I really think this package needs a security audit.

The upstream author is not willing to cooperate on fixing the reported
bugs and considers Debian to be "too demanding". Still, the upstream
disrespected the Debian Project (used swear-word). I'm not willing to
fork his work nor maintain an ever growing patch to fix chetcpasswd
security flaws.

According to <http://secunia.com/advisories/23024>, there are more
security issues in chectpasswd.

It should be removed from Debian if no fix is expected.

Cheers,
Stefan
