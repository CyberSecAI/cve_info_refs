      "content": "Windows Media Player does not properly handle malformed Windows Media Metafiles. This vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or crash Windows Media Player.\n\nWindows Media Player (WMP) is a multimedia application that comes with Microsoft Windows. According to [Microsoft](http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;Q316992):  Advanced Stream Redirector (.asx) files, also known as Windows Media Metafiles, are text files that provide information about a file stream and its presentation. ASX files go beyond the simple task of defining playlists to provide Windows Media Player with information about how to present particular media items of the playlist.\nWindows Media Metafiles are based on XML syntax and can be encoded in either ANSI or UNICODE (UTF-8) format. They are made up of various elements with their associated tags and attributes. Each element in a Windows Media metafile defines a particular setting or action in Windows Media Player. WMP fails to properly handle Windows Media Metafiles. Specifically, if a URL with an unsupported protocol is embdedded in a Windows Media Metafile and accessed with WMP, a limited heap-based buffer overflow may occur.\n\nAlthough the buffer overflow is limited, it may still be possible to corrupt memory in a way that can allow an attacker to execute code or crash WMP.",

      "weaknesses": "Heap-based buffer overflow due to insufficient validation of URLs in ASX files. Limited buffer overflow.",

      "attack_vectors": "User opens a malicious Windows Media Metafile (e.g. .asx, .wax, .wvx, .wmx) containing a URL with an unsupported protocol.",
       "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a specially crafted Windows Media Metafile and convince a user to open it. This can be achieved through social engineering, malicious web links, or compromised websites."
