    "vulnerability": {
      "root_cause": "The `module_root_path` parameter in `mx_common.php` is vulnerable to remote file inclusion.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can include arbitrary remote files, potentially executing malicious code on the server.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "HTTP GET request with a crafted `module_root_path` parameter."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and have access to a publicly accessible malicious file.",
       "details": "The vulnerable code is in the `include_once` function within `mx_common.php`, which uses a user-controlled parameter `$module_root_path` to construct the path to the included file. Specifically, the code is: `include_once($module_root_path . 'includes/cal_settings.'.$phpEx);`. By manipulating `module_root_path`, an attacker can include remote PHP files. The provided exploit demonstrates how to include a remote file with the URL http://Y0urSh3LL?. This will execute the php code included in that remote file on the targeted webserver."
