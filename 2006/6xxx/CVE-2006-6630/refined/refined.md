{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `ListRecords.php` script in osprey 1.0 is vulnerable to Remote File Inclusion (RFI) due to the lack of proper sanitization of the `lib_dir` parameter.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include a malicious remote file into the vulnerable script, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exploited via HTTP GET requests, by manipulating the `lib_dir` parameter in the URL to point to a malicious external file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server where the vulnerable script is hosted and have a publicly accessible location where to host the malicious file. No authentication is required."
