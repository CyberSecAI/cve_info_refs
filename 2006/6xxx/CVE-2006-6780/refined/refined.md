        "vulnerability_details": {
          "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to an SQL injection flaw in the `hlstats.php` script of HLStats versions 1.20 to 1.34.",
          "weaknesses": [
            "SQL Injection: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary SQL code into database queries."
          ],
          "impact": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to:\n\n  - Extract sensitive information from the database, such as user credentials and database configuration details.\n  - Read arbitrary files on the server.\n  - Potentially execute arbitrary code on the server by writing files to the filesystem via SQL injection.",
          "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is exploited via HTTP requests to `hlstats.php`, specifically targeting the `mode=playerinfo` parameter. By manipulating the `killLimit` parameter with crafted SQL queries, an attacker can trigger the vulnerability.",
          "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable `hlstats.php` script on a target server. No authentication is required to exploit the SQL injection vulnerability itself. However, database credentials may be required to exploit some of the file system access related attacks.",
           "additional_details": "The provided exploit code details multiple attack vectors including:\n  - Obtaining HLStats logins (username and password hashes)\n  - Obtaining MySQL user logins\n  - Path Disclosure\n  - Reading configuration file for hlstats and extract plain text database login information\n  - Reading other files from the server file system\n  - Uploading PHP code to the server via SQL injection"

          "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application on a target server. The exploit works even if `magic_quotes_gpc` is enabled. The provided exploit code includes functionality for using a proxy server to connect to the target."
