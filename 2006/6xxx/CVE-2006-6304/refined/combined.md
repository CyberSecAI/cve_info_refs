| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=537273#c0)  Dave Maley    2009-11-13 01:13:57 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 369360](attachment.cgi?id=369360&action=diff "upstream patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=369360&action=edit "upstream patch") upstream patch  Description of problem: In do_coredump() the flag variable is set but isn't used during the filp_open() call.  This leaves a re-write attack vulnerability exposed.  <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-6304>   Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): 2.6.18-164.el5   How reproducible: N/A   Steps to Reproduce: 1. N/A 2. 3.    Actual results:   Expected results:   Additional info: upstream commit: 6d4df677f8a60ea6bc0ef1a596c1a3a79b1d4882   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=537273#c2)  Dave Maley    2009-11-25 17:14:02 UTC  ``` Hi Furuta-san - This bug is not specific to the 2.6.19 kernel.  The necessary fix was included in 2.6.19.1 and versions prior to that are vulnerable.  Thus RHEL5 is affected.     This vulnerability could allow a local attacker to modify certain files during a core dump.  According to [1] there are no known exploits of this bug.  So there should be no need to implement a workaround.  However the vulnerability does exist in RHEL5 and so we should include the fix.  I'd also like to receive confirmation from engineering, however I am fairly confident in my findings/analysis.  ~dmaley  [1] <http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/21591/exploit>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=537273#c3)  Dave Anderson    2009-12-02 14:19:16 UTC  ``` > I'd also like to receive confirmation from engineering, however I am fairly > confident in my findings/analysis.  Certainly the bug exists in RHEL5 -- is that what you're asking for confirmation?   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=537273#c4)  Dave Maley    2009-12-02 17:00:38 UTC  ``` > Certainly the bug exists in RHEL5 -- is that what you're asking for > confirmation?  yes, but also that there's no apparent risk associated for which we should be providing guidance/workarounds?   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=537273#c5)  Dave Anderson    2009-12-02 18:52:35 UTC  ``` I have no idea.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=537273#c6)  Dave Maley    2009-12-03 20:59:02 UTC  ``` OK then since there's a CVE assigned and the actual risks are unclear I'm adding the "Security" keyword.  If there's something more/else I should do to ensure the security folks are made aware pls let me know.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=537273#c13)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2009-12-04 06:17:14 UTC  ``` This issue did not affect the versions of Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 when it was first reported back in 2006 with [CVE-2006-6304](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-6304). However, the issue was introduced last July 2008 with a patch for "[misc] pipe support to /proc/sys/net/core_pattern".  In the do_coredump() function, the flag is only set (to O_EXCL) if mm->dumpable is 2.  fs/exec.c:         /*          *      We cannot trust fsuid as being the "true" uid of the          *      process nor do we know its entire history. We only know it          *      was tainted so we dump it as root in mode 2.          */          if (mm->dumpable == 2)          /* Setuid core dump mode */         {                 flag = O_EXCL;          /* Stop rewrite attacks */                 current->fsuid = 0;     /* Dump root private */         }         mm->dumpable = 0;  "And then filp_open follows with "flag" totally ignored."  Note that this issue only matters if dumpable is set to 2. The default is 0.  See man 5 proc: /proc/sys/fs/suid_dumpable (since Linux 2.6.13) The value in this file determines whether core dump files are produced for set-user-ID or otherwise protected/tainted binaries. Three different integer values can be specified: [...] 2 ("suidsafe") Any binary which normally would not be dumped (see "0" above) is dumped readable by root only. This allows the user to remove the core dump file but not to read it. For security reasons core dumps in this mode will not overwrite one another or other files. This mode is appropriate when administrators are attempting to debug problems in a normal environment.  Ensure that suid_dumpable is always set to 0.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=537273#c14)  Neil Horman    2009-12-04 16:40:52 UTC  ``` So, I'm reviewing this, and while clearly its a good patch to take on priciple, I really don't think the impact of this bug warrants  zstream release. By omitting O_EXCL, we simply inform the the kernel that it shold fail if the attempted file creation already exists.  By not doing that, we simply offer an attacker the opportunity to append data to a core file (by guesssing the file name and creating a very large file (larger than the core), prior to crashing the prcoess whos core will map to that same name.  Potentially irritating, yes, but certainly not serious from a security standpoint.  I get putting it in 5.5, but do we really need to crack open 5.4.z for this?   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=537273#c15)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2009-12-07 03:00:40 UTC  ``` As discussed last week, we will fix this in 5.4.z.   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=537273#c17)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-01-19 23:37:10 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2010:0046 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0046.html>   ``` |  |

kernel security and bug fix update (RHSA-2010-0046)

Original Release Date: February 3, 2010

Last Revised: November 4, 2010

Number: ASA-2010-026

Risk Level: Medium

Advisory Version: 3.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

Security fixes:

\* an array index error was found in the gdth driver. A local user could
send a specially-crafted IOCTL request that would cause a denial of service
or, possibly, privilege escalation. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2009-3080](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2009-3080.html) to this issue.

\* a flaw was found in the FUSE implementation. When a system is low on
memory, fuse\_put\_request() could dereference an invalid pointer, possibly
leading to a local denial of service or privilege escalation.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2009-4021](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2009-4021.html) to this issue.

\* a deficiency was discovered in the fasync\_helper()
implementation. This could allow a local, unprivileged user to leverage a
use-after-free of locked, asynchronous file descriptors to cause a denial
of service or privilege escalation. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2009-4141](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2009-4141.html) to this issue.

\* it was reported that the [RHSA-2009:1243](https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1243.html)
update introduced two flaws in the routing implementation. If an attacker
was able to cause a large enough number of collisions in the routing hash
table (via specially-crafted packets) for the emergency route flush to
trigger, a deadlock could occur. Secondly, if the kernel routing cache was
disabled, an uninitialized pointer would be left behind after a route
lookup, leading to a kernel panic. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2009-4272](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2009-4272.html) to this issue.

\* the [RHSA-2009:0225](https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-0225.html) update introduced a rewrite attack flaw in the
do\_coredump() function. A local attacker able to guess the file name a
process is going to dump its core to, prior to the process crashing, could
use this flaw to append data to the dumped core file. This issue only
affects systems that have "/proc/sys/fs/suid\_dumpable" set to 2 (the
default value is 0). The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2006-6304](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2006-6304.html) to this issue.

The fix for [CVE-2006-6304](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2006-6304.html) changes the expected behavior: With suid\_dumpable
set to 2, the core file will not be recorded if the file already exists.
For example, core files will not be overwritten on subsequent crashes of
processes whose core files map to the same name.

\* an information leak was found in the Linux kernel. On AMD64 systems,
32-bit processes could access and read certain 64-bit registers by
temporarily switching themselves to 64-bit mode. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2009-2910](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2009-2910.html) to this issue.

\* the [RHBA-2008:0314](https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2008-0314.html) update introduced N\_Port ID Virtualization (NPIV)
support in the qla2xxx driver, resulting in two new sysfs pseudo files,
"/sys/class/scsi\_host/[a qla2xxx host]/vport\_create" and "vport\_delete".
These two files were world-writable by default, allowing a local user to
change SCSI host attributes. This flaw only affects systems using the
qla2xxx driver and NPIV capable hardware. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2009-3556](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2009-3556.html) to this issue.

\* permission issues were found in the megaraid\_sas driver. The "dbg\_lvl"
and "poll\_mode\_io" files on the sysfs file system ("/sys/") had
world-writable permissions. This could allow local, unprivileged users to
change the behavior of the driver. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names [CVE-2009-3889](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2009-3889.html) and [CVE-2009-3939](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2009-3939.html) to these issues.

\* a NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the firewire-ohci driver
used for OHCI compliant IEEE 1394 controllers. A local, unprivileged user
with access to /dev/fw\* files could issue certain IOCTL calls, causing a
denial of service or privilege escalation. The FireWire modules are
blacklisted by default, and if enabled, only root has access to the files
noted above by default. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2009-4138](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2009-4138.html) to this issue.

\* a buffer overflow flaw was found in the hfs\_bnode\_read() function in the
HFS file system implementation. This could lead to a denial of service if a
user browsed a specially-crafted HFS file system, for example, by running
"ls". The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2009-4020](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2009-4020.html) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

**Recommended Actions for System Products:**
Avaya strongly recommends that customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place; risk to Avaya's
product and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as a product
action is applied. Further restrictions as deemed
necessary based on the customer's security policies
may be required during this interim period.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be. Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and then follow
that vendor's guidance.

| Product: | Actions: |
| --- | --- |
| CVLAN | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite (IMS) | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. |
| Voice Portal | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the Voice Portal application. |
| Avaya Aura™ Application Enablement Services 4.x | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the AES application. |

**Recommended Actions for Software-Only Products:**
In the event that the affected package is installed, Avaya recommends that customers follow recommended actions supplied by RedHat Linux.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=538734#c0)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2009-11-19 09:02:33 UTC  ``` Description of problem: fuse_direct_io() has a loop where requests are allocated in each iteration. if allocation fails, the loop is broken out and follows into an unconditional fuse_put_request() on that invalid pointer."  Upstream commit: <http://git.kernel.org/linus/f60311d5f7670d9539b424e4ed8b5c0872fc9e83>  This can be triggered when the system is low on memory, and when the fuse_request_alloc() function called from fuse_get_req() fails. The fuse_put_request() function will then dereference the invalid pointer returned, resulting in a kernel oops.  This was introduced in 413ef8cb (v2.6.14-rc1) and fixed in v2.6.32-rc7.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=538734#c2)  Jan Lieskovsky    2009-11-25 16:55:30 UTC  ``` Mitre's [CVE-2009-4021](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-4021) entry: ----------------------------  The fuse_direct_io function in fs/fuse/file.c in the fuse subsystem in the Linux kernel before 2.6.32-rc7 might allow attackers to cause a denial of service (invalid pointer dereference and OOPS) via vectors possibly related to a memory-consumption attack.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=538734#c3)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-01-19 23:36:53 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2010:0046 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0046.html>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=538734#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-01-21 14:10:40 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    MRG for RHEL-5  Via RHSA-2010:0041 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0041.html>   ``` |  |

## Topic

Updated kernel packages that fix multiple security issues and several bugs
are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

Security fixes:

* an array index error was found in the gdth driver. A local user could

send a specially-crafted IOCTL request that would cause a denial of service
or, possibly, privilege escalation. (CVE-2009-3080, Important)

* a flaw was found in the FUSE implementation. When a system is low on

memory, fuse\_put\_request() could dereference an invalid pointer, possibly
leading to a local denial of service or privilege escalation.
(CVE-2009-4021, Important)

* Tavis Ormandy discovered a deficiency in the fasync\_helper()

implementation. This could allow a local, unprivileged user to leverage a
use-after-free of locked, asynchronous file descriptors to cause a denial
of service or privilege escalation. (CVE-2009-4141, Important)

* the Parallels Virtuozzo Containers team reported the RHSA-2009:1243

update introduced two flaws in the routing implementation. If an attacker
was able to cause a large enough number of collisions in the routing hash
table (via specially-crafted packets) for the emergency route flush to
trigger, a deadlock could occur. Secondly, if the kernel routing cache was
disabled, an uninitialized pointer would be left behind after a route
lookup, leading to a kernel panic. (CVE-2009-4272, Important)

* the RHSA-2009:0225 update introduced a rewrite attack flaw in the

do\_coredump() function. A local attacker able to guess the file name a
process is going to dump its core to, prior to the process crashing, could
use this flaw to append data to the dumped core file. This issue only
affects systems that have "/proc/sys/fs/suid\_dumpable" set to 2 (the
default value is 0). (CVE-2006-6304, Moderate)

The fix for CVE-2006-6304 changes the expected behavior: With suid\_dumpable
set to 2, the core file will not be recorded if the file already exists.
For example, core files will not be overwritten on subsequent crashes of
processes whose core files map to the same name.

* an information leak was found in the Linux kernel. On AMD64 systems,

32-bit processes could access and read certain 64-bit registers by
temporarily switching themselves to 64-bit mode. (CVE-2009-2910, Moderate)

* the RHBA-2008:0314 update introduced N\_Port ID Virtualization (NPIV)

support in the qla2xxx driver, resulting in two new sysfs pseudo files,
"/sys/class/scsi\_host/[a qla2xxx host]/vport\_create" and "vport\_delete".
These two files were world-writable by default, allowing a local user to
change SCSI host attributes. This flaw only affects systems using the
qla2xxx driver and NPIV capable hardware. (CVE-2009-3556, Moderate)

* permission issues were found in the megaraid\_sas driver. The "dbg\_lvl"

and "poll\_mode\_io" files on the sysfs file system ("/sys/") had
world-writable permissions. This could allow local, unprivileged users to
change the behavior of the driver. (CVE-2009-3889, CVE-2009-3939, Moderate)

* a NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the firewire-ohci driver

used for OHCI compliant IEEE 1394 controllers. A local, unprivileged user
with access to /dev/fw\* files could issue certain IOCTL calls, causing a
denial of service or privilege escalation. The FireWire modules are
blacklisted by default, and if enabled, only root has access to the files
noted above by default. (CVE-2009-4138, Moderate)

* a buffer overflow flaw was found in the hfs\_bnode\_read() function in the

HFS file system implementation. This could lead to a denial of service if a
user browsed a specially-crafted HFS file system, for example, by running
"ls". (CVE-2009-4020, Low)

Bug fix documentation for this update will be available shortly from
www.redhat.com/docs/en-US/errata/RHSA-2010-0046/Kernel\_Security\_Update/
index.html

Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported
patches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for this
update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use

RHSA-2010:0095 - Security Advisory

Issued:

# RHSA-2010:0095 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: rhev-hypervisor security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

An updated rhev-hypervisor package that fixes security issues and several
bugs is now available.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

The rhev-hypervisor package provides a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
(RHEV) Hypervisor ISO disk image. The RHEV Hypervisor is a dedicated
Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. It includes everything
necessary to run and manage virtual machines: A subset of the Red Hat
Enterprise Linux operating environment and the Red Hat Enterprise
Virtualization Agent.

Note: RHEV Hypervisor is only available for the Intel 64 and AMD64
architectures with virtualization extensions.

A flaw was found in the IPv6 Extension Header (EH) handling
implementation in the Linux kernel. The skb->dst data structure was not
properly validated in the ipv6\_hop\_jumbo() function. This could possibly
lead to a remote denial of service. (CVE-2007-4567)

The Parallels Virtuozzo Containers team reported two flaws in the routing
implementation. If an attacker was able to cause a large enough number of
collisions in the routing hash table (via specially-crafted packets) for
the emergency route flush to trigger, a deadlock could occur. Secondly, if
the kernel routing cache was disabled, an uninitialized pointer would be
left behind after a route lookup, leading to a kernel panic.
(CVE-2009-4272)

A flaw was found in each of the following Intel PRO/1000 Linux drivers in
the Linux kernel: e1000 and e1000e. A remote attacker using packets larger
than the MTU could bypass the existing fragment check, resulting in
partial, invalid frames being passed to the network stack. These flaws
could also possibly be used to trigger a remote denial of service.
(CVE-2009-4536, CVE-2009-4538)

A flaw was found in the Realtek r8169 Ethernet driver in the Linux kernel.
Receiving overly-long frames with a certain revision of the network cards
supported by this driver could possibly result in a remote denial of
service. (CVE-2009-4537)

The x86 emulator implementation was missing a check for the Current
Privilege Level (CPL) and I/O Privilege Level (IOPL). A user in a guest
could leverage these flaws to cause a denial of service (guest crash) or
possibly escalate their privileges within that guest. (CVE-2010-0298,
CVE-2010-0306)

A flaw was found in the Programmable Interval Timer (PIT) emulation. Access
to the internal data structure pit\_state, which represents the data state
of the emulated PIT, was not properly validated in the pit\_ioport\_read()
function. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to crash the host.
(CVE-2010-0309)

This updated package provides updated components that include fixes for
security issues; however, these issues have no security impact for RHEV
Hypervisor. These fixes are for kernel issues CVE-2006-6304, CVE-2009-2910,
CVE-2009-3080, CVE-2009-3556, CVE-2009-3889, CVE-2009-3939, CVE-2009-4020,
CVE-2009-4021, CVE-2009-4138, and CVE-2009-4141; ntp issue CVE-2009-3563;
dbus issue CVE-2009-1189; dnsmasq issues CVE-2009-2957 and CVE-2009-2958;
gnutls issue CVE-2009-2730; krb5 issue CVE-2009-4212; bind issue
CVE-2010-0097; gzip issue CVE-2010-0001; openssl issues CVE-2009-2409 and
CVE-2009-4355; and gcc issue CVE-2009-3736.

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* on systems with a large number of disk devices, USB storage devices may

get enumerated after "/dev/sdz", for example, "/dev/sdcd". This was not
handled by the udev rules, resulting in a missing "/dev/live" symbolic
link, causing installations from USB media to fail. With this update, udev
rules correctly handle USB storage devices on systems with a large number
of disk devices, which resolves this issue. (BZ#555083)

As RHEV Hypervisor is based on KVM, the bug fixes from the KVM update
RHSA-2010:0088 have been included in this update:

<https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0088.html>

Users of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor are advised to
upgrade to this updated package, which corrects these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/docs/DOC-11259>
