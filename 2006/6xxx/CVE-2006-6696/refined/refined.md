Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability details related to CVE-2006-6696:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the incorrect way the Windows Client/Server Run-time Subsystem (CSRSS) handles error messages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the CSRSS process. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in how CSRSS processes error messages, which can be exploited by a specially crafted application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can allow an attacker to gain complete control of the affected system. This includes the ability to:
    - Install programs
    - View, change, or delete data
    - Create new accounts with full user rights

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Attack:** An attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to the affected system to exploit the vulnerability by executing a specially crafted application.
- **Web-based Attack:** An attacker can host a malicious web page designed to exploit the vulnerability. Users visiting this page can be compromised if they perform certain actions after clicking a link. This includes being convinced to visit a malicious website.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- For local attacks, the attacker needs:
    - Valid logon credentials on the target system
    - Ability to execute code on the target system
- For web-based attacks, the attacker needs:
    - Ability to host a malicious web page.
    - To trick users into visiting the malicious website.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was publicly disclosed after being initially reported through responsible disclosure.
- At the time the security bulletin was issued, Microsoft had seen proof-of-concept code published but no evidence of exploitation in the wild.
- The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how CSRSS processes error messages.
- The vulnerability is described as a "Critical" severity issue.
- The issue is referred to as "Vista Memory Corruption Zero-Day" by the wider security community.
