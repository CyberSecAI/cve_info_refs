### General Information

## Executive Summary

**Executive Summary:**

This update resolves several newly discovered, privately and publicly disclosed vulnerabilities. Each vulnerability is documented in its own subsection in the Vulnerability Details section of this bulletin.

An attacker who successfully exploited the most severe of these vulnerabilities could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

We recommend that customers apply the update immediately.

**Severity Ratings and Vulnerability Identifiers:**

| Vulnerability Identifiers | Impact of Vulnerability | Windows 2000 Professional Service Pack 4 | Windows 2000 Server Service Pack 4 | Windows XP Service Pack 2 | Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1, and Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 2 | Windows Vista |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MsgBox (CSRSS) Remote Code Execution Vulnerability - [CVE-2006-6696](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2006-6696) | Remote Code Execution | Critical | Critical | Critical | Critical | Critical |
| CSRSS Local Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability - [CVE-2007-1209](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-1209) | Elevation of Privilege | Not Affected | Not Affected | Not Affected | Not Affected | Important |
| CSRSS DoS Vulnerability - [CVE-2006-6797](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2006-6797) | Denial of Service | Low | Moderate | Low | Moderate | Low |
| **Aggregate Severity of All Vulnerabilities** |  | **Critical** | **Critical** | **Critical** | **Critical** | **Critical** |

This [assessment](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21140) is based on the types of systems that are affected by the vulnerability, their typical deployment patterns, and the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would have on them.

**Note** The severity ratings for non-x86 operating system versions map to the x86 operating system versions as follows:

* The Windows XP Professional x64 Edition and Windows XP Professional x64 Edition Service Pack 2 severity rating is the same as the Windows XP Service Pack 2 severity rating.
* The Windows Server 2003 for Itanium-based Systems severity rating is the same as the Windows Server 2003 severity rating.
* The Windows Server 2003 with SP1 for Itanium-based Systems severity rating is the same as the Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 severity rating.
* The Windows Server 2003 with SP2 for Itanium-based Systems severity rating is the same as the Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 2 severity rating.
* The Windows Server 2003 x64 Edition severity rating is the same as the Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 severity rating.
* The Windows Server 2003 x64 Edition Service Pack 2 severity rating is the same as the Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 2 severity rating.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update

**What are the known issues that customers may experience when installing this security update?**

[Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 930178](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/930178) documents the currently known issues that customers may experience when they install this security update, including a blank notification message box when attempting to import a certificate using the Certificate Import Wizard, a missing Low Battery notification, and degraded performance on XP Service Pack 2 systems when the low battery notification occurs. The article also documents recommended solutions for these issues.

**Why does this update address several reported security vulnerabilities?**

This update contains support for several vulnerabilities because the modifications that are required to address these issues are located in related files. Instead of having to install several updates that are almost the same, customers can install only this update.

**I am using an older version of the software discussed in this security bulletin; what should I do?**

The supported software called out under in this bulletin has been tested to determine whether the versions are affected. Other versions are past their support life cycle. To determine the support life cycle for your product and version, visit the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742).

It should be a priority for customers who have older versions of the software to migrate to supported versions to prevent potential exposure to vulnerabilities. For more information about the Windows Product Lifecycle, visit the following [Microsoft Support Lifecycle Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742).

## Vulnerability Details

#### MsgBox (CSRSS) Remote Code Execution Vulnerability - CVE-2006-6696:

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Windows Client/Server Run-time Subsystem (CSRSS) process because of the way that it handles error messages. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted application that could potentially allow remote code execution.

Additionally, if a user viewed a specially crafted Web site, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system.

#### Mitigating Factors for MsgBox (CSRSS) Remote Code Execution Vulnerability - CVE-2006-6696:

* In a local attack scenario an attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to exploit this vulnerability. The vulnerability could not be exploited remotely or by anonymous users.
* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to convince them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's Web site. After they click the link, they would be prompted to perform several actions. An attack could only occur after they performed these actions.

#### Workarounds for MsgBox (CSRSS) Remote Code Execution Vulnerability - CVE-2006-6696:

We have not identified any workarounds for this vulnerability.

**Notes** When you install these security updates, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the frequently asked question, "Can I use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) to determine whether this update is required?" in the section, Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update, earlier in this bulletin.
* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry keys.

  For Windows XP Home Edition Service Pack 2, Windows XP Professional Service Pack 2, Windows XP Tablet PC Edition 2005, and Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005:

  HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows XP\SP3\KB930178\Filelist

  For Windows XP Professional x64 Edition and Windows XP Professional x64 Service Pack 2:

  HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows XP Version 2003\SP3\KB930178\Filelist

  **Note** These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly if an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams the security update into the Windows installation source files.

#### Windows Server 2003 (all versions)

**Prerequisites**

This security update requires Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1, Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 2, Windows Server 2003 for Itanium-based Systems, Windows Server 2003 with SP1 for Itanium-based Systems, Windows Server 2003 with SP2 for Itanium-based Systems, Windows Server 2003 x64 Edition, or Windows Server 2003 x64 Edition Service Pack 2.

**Installation Information**

This security update supports the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/help** | Displays the command-line options. |
| Setup Modes |  |
| **/passive** | Unattended Setup mode. No user interaction is required, but installation status is displayed. If a restart is required at the end of setup, a dialog box will be presented to the user with a timer warning that the computer will restart in 30 seconds. |
| **/quiet** | Quiet mode. This is the same as unattended mode, but no status or error messages are displayed. |
| Restart Options |  |
| **/norestart** | Does not restart when installation has completed. |
| **/forcerestart** | Restarts the computer after installation and forces other applications to close at shutdown without saving open files first. |
| **/warnrestart[:x]** | Displays a dialog box with a timer warning the user that the computer will restart in *x* seconds. (The default setting is 30 seconds.) Intended for use with the **/quiet** switch or the **/passive** switch. |
| **/promptrestart** | Display a dialog box prompting the local user to allow a restart. |
| Special Options |  |
| **/overwriteoem** | Overwrites OEM files without prompting. |
| **/nobackup** | Does not back up files needed for uninstallation. |
| **/forceappsclose** | Forces other programs to close when the computer shuts down. |
| **/log: path** | Allows the redirection of installation log files. |
| **/integrate:path** | Integrates the update into the Windows source files. These files are located at the path that is specified in the switch. |
| **/extract[:path]** | Extracts files without starting the Setup program. |
| **/ER** | Enables extended error reporting. |
| **/verbose** | Enables verbose logging. During installation, creates %Windir%\CabBuild.log. This log details the files that are copied. Using this switch may cause the installation to proceed more slowly. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports many of the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841).

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the frequently asked question, "Can I use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) to determine whether this update is required?" in the section, Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update, earlier in this bulletin.
* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start** and then enter an update file name in **Start Search**.
  2. When the file appears under **Programs**, right-click on the file name and click **Properties**.
  3. Under the **General** tab, compare the file size with the file information tables provided earlier in this section.
  4. You may also click on the **Details** tab and compare information, such as file version and date modified, with the file information tables provided earlier in this section.
  5. On the Details tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.

**Software Update Services:**

By using Microsoft Software Update Services (SUS), administrators can quickly and reliably deploy the latest critical updates and security updates to Windows 2000 and Windows Server 2003-based servers, and to desktop systems that are running Windows 2000 Professional or Windows XP Professional.

For more information about how to deploy security updates by using Software Update Services, visit the [Software Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21133).

**Windows Server Update Services:**

By using Windows Server Update Services (WSUS), administrators can quickly and reliably deploy the latest critical updates and security updates for Windows 2000 operating systems and later, Office XP and later, Exchange Server 2003, and SQL Server 2000 onto Windows 2000 and later operating systems.

For more information about how to deploy security updates using Windows Server Update Services, visit the [Windows Server Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=50120).

**Systems Management Server:**

Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) delivers a highly configurable enterprise solution for managing updates. By using SMS, administrators can identify Windows-based systems that require security updates and can perform controlled deployment of these updates throughout the enterprise with minimal disruption to end users. For more information about how administrators can use SMS 2003 to deploy security updates, visit the [SMS 2003 Security Patch Management Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=22939). SMS 2.0 users can also use [Software Updates Service Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33340) to help deploy security updates. For information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

**Note** SMS uses the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer, the Microsoft Office Detection Tool, and the Enterprise Update Scan Tool to provide broad support for security bulletin update detection and deployment. Some software updates may not be detected by these tools. Administrators can use the inventory capabilities of the SMS in these cases to target updates to specific systems. For more information about this procedure, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33341). Some security updates require administrative rights following a restart of the system. Administrators can use the Elevated Rights Deployment Tool (available in the [SMS 2003 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33387) and in the [SMS 2.0 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21161)) to install these updates.
