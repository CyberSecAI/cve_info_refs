```
{
  "Root cause": "The Magnatune downloader in Amarok does not properly sanitize the 'm_currentAlbumFileName' parameter when calling the 'unzip' shell command.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "Improper Input Sanitization",
    "OS Command Injection"
  ],
  "Impact": "A malicious Magnatune server can inject and remotely execute arbitrary shell commands on the client with the privileges of the user running Amarok.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Compromised or malicious Magnatune server",
    "Man-in-the-middle attack between client and Magnatune server"
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to control or compromise a Magnatune server or be able to perform a man-in-the-middle attack to intercept the client's requests."
