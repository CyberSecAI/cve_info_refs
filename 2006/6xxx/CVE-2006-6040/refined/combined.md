  ## vBulletin 3.6.4 Released

  Wed 22 Nov '06, 6:57am

  **vBulletin 3.6.4**

  The discovery of a potential cross-site scripting (XSS) issue in the administrators control panel has necessitated the preventative release of vBulletin 3.6.4 Due to several mitigating factors, this issue is hard to exploit and careful browsing by the admins can prevent it entirely. Nonetheless, we strongly recommend that all of our customers upgrade or apply the patch as soon as possible.

  Additionally, vBulletin 3.6.4 includes fixes for several non-security-related bugs, see [here](http://www.vbulletin.com/forum/bugs36.php?s=&do=list&vbversion=3.6.3&status=20) for a full list.

  **Updating your vBulletin to combat the XSS issue**:

  Please note that this issue is present in other versions of vBulletin as well. Please see the appropriate announcement!

  You have two options to fix the XSS issue:
  1. **Full Upgrade**: The best way to fix the problem is to perform a full upgrade, downloading the complete 3.6.4 package from the [vBulletin Members' Area](http://members.vbulletin.com/) and following the regular [upgrade instructions](http://www.vbulletin.com/docs/html/upgrade?manualversion=30602500).
  2. **Patch**: A second option is to download the patch files discussed in this thread and upload them to your web server, overwriting the existing files. The patch is available from the [Members' Area patch page](http://members.vbulletin.com/patches.php)!**If you absolutely cannot apply the patch or upgrade...**

  We strongly recommend you actively take steps to address this issue. However, if this is not possible, we recommend that administrators only log into the control panel when work is necessary. While you are logged into the control panel, do not click unknown links. Log out from the control panel using the link in the upper right of the screen immediately after finishing your work. If you are unexpectedly presented with the control panel login screen after clicking a link, do not login.

  **PHP and MySQL Requirements**

  Please note that vBulletin 3.6.x **requires** at least **PHP 4.3.3** and **MySQL 4.0.16** or later.

  **Tags:**
  None

  Wed 22 Nov '06, 7:00am

  Patching

  Patches are now available in the members' area. You may view available patches [**here**](http://members.vbulletin.com/patches.php).

  Go to the page mentioned above and download the **Security patch for 3.6.3**. Extract the zip archive, then connect to your web server using FTP and overwrite the following files using the replacement versions from the zip.
  + admincp/index.php
  1. You do **not** need to download this patch if you perform a full upgrade to 3.6.4.
  2. If you only apply a patch, your version number will **not** change. Your version number will only be updated to 3.6.4 if you perform a full upgrade.

  Templates Changed (since 3.6.3)

  **These are the template changes since 3.6.3 ONLY**

  **If you are not running 3.6.3 yet, there are significantly more changed templates than are listed here. Use "Find Updated Templates" to find the templates that have changed and incorporate those changes. You may even wish to start with a default style!**

  **Note:**

  You need to only look through this post for templates you have customized. You do not need to take any action to ensure that your uncustomized templates are the latest versions.

  If you find a template you have customized in this list, you will likely want to include the changes made here. However, this is not *always* required. Under each change listed here, you will see "requires revert?" This refers to whether the changes are **mandatory** (yes). If the changes are mandatory, things *will break* if you do not incorporate the changes made. It is *strongly recommended* that you revert and recustomize any templates that say they require a revert.

  Additionally, you may wish to use the "Find Updated Template" feature in the control panel to find templates that have been changed since your last edit to them.

  --------------------------------------

  **bbcode\_code**

  **bbcode\_html**

  **bbcode\_php**

  Changes to HTML for XHTML validation purposes

  Requires revert? No (unless XHTML validation is important to you)

  **calendar\_edit\_customfield**

  Added maxlength parameter to the optional input to limit the amount of text to what is defined for the field.

  Requires Revert? No, see bug [1199](http://www.vbulletin.com/forum/bugs36.php?do=view&bugid=1199)

  **newreply**

  Added style="border-top-width:0px" to the topic review bits table to prevent a border from doubling up.

  Requires revert? No.

  **pm\_showpm**

  Added style="border-bottom-width:0px" to the PM title table to prevent a border from doubling up.

  Requires revert? No.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world‚Äôs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft‚Äôs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren‚Äôt normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
