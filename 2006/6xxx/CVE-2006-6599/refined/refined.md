{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `announce` variable in `maketorrent.php` is not sanitized before being used in an `exec()` function call.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Command Injection",
      "Lack of Input Sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote command execution on the server hosting TorrentFlux.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "By manipulating the `announce` parameter in a GET request to `maketorrent.php`."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "A valid TorrentFlux user account is required for authentication. An attacker needs to send a crafted GET request with a malicious command within the `announce` parameter."
  },
    "additional_notes": "The exploit uses a semicolon (;) to terminate the initial command and then start a new one within the exec() function. The htmlspecialchars() function in TorrentFlux can cause issues when injecting commands with certain characters like < and >."
