Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `register.asp` file of ASPNuke. Specifically, the `StateCode` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Data Modification:** An attacker can modify database content, as demonstrated by the example that updates the `tblPoll` table, setting the `Question` field to 'hacked'.
    *   **Potential for further compromise:**  Successful SQL injection can allow the attacker to read sensitive data, escalate privileges, and potentially gain full control of the web application and the server.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability by crafting a malicious URL with the vulnerable parameter `StateCode`.

*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
    *   No prior authentication is needed as the vulnerability is in the registration page.
    *   The attacker can inject SQL using the `StateCode` parameter.

**Additional Information**
* The exploit example shows how to inject SQL code into the `StateCode` parameter and modify the `tblPoll` table.
* The application is ASPNuke version 0.80 and prior
* The vulnerable file is `register.asp`
