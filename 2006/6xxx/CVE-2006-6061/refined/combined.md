How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### More MOKB-20-11-2006 related news

Apparently, it isn't enough to explain these issues in the most simple possible way. There will be always someone else who doesn't bother reading, checking and, well, there will be always someone willing to say something that doesn't make sense at all.

A [blog post](http://alastairs-place.net/2006/11/dmg-kernel-pani/) is claiming that 'crashing a Mac with a .dmg, has been known for ages'. It doesn't stop there, it even falls in the now clueless logical fallacy that has been used over and over by Mac Zealots and other creatures of Neverland for enough time now:
> conveniently ignoring the fact that this is still just a crash, not an exploit, and that not all crashes are actually exploitable anyway.

Too many things mixed there and getting screwed up. Time to stop, space cowboy. Going back to Earth, the definition of a 'crash' in kernel-land has quite a few possible meanings:

* locking issues
* infinite loops (ex. filesystem code looking for non-existent blocks)
* unhandled exceptions (ex. invalid memory access, ala page faults, etc)
* handled exceptions (ex. known unsupported condition, poorly written code panicking for no real reason, ala fpathconf() bug, etc).
* ...

Now define exploit in the context of a kernel-land issue. Basically exploiting a bug a in kernel-land requires some conditions to be met:

* influence memory operations (ex. land at controlled memory)
* avoid hard locks
* avoid corrupting essential spots
* change execution flow gracefully

In any case, once you have abused the vulnerable condition, you will have only one chance (normally, although there are exceptions, like modules and other interfaces that can be dynamically loaded and not necessarily get totally screwed up) to subvert the execution flow, until it goes wild and causes your so-called 'crash'. So, what happens upon successful exploitation? You're pwned, Michael Knight.

So, leaving the humorous style. Mac Zealots, please get a life. If something is well beyond your understanding capability, don't worry. Go watch TV, or the iTunes Store.

Reading documentation, debugging, checking the problem, spending hours to understand how something actually works, is obviously a tedious task. It's easier to smoke some pot and mixed hash while listening to Massive Attack and Modest Mouse.

Signed, a proud Macbook, Mac OS X and iPod (it has some indie music too, but not the brainwashing kind it seems, fortunately) user.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
