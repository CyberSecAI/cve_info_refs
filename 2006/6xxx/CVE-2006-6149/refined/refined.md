Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2006-6149

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the `index.asp` file of JiRos FAQ Manager v1.0. Specifically, the `tID` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `tID` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker can extract sensitive data from the database, including usernames and passwords stored in `JFS_tblusers`.
- **Potential for Further Compromise:** Depending on database user privileges, an attacker may potentially modify database data or execute OS commands.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is carried out by crafting a malicious URL with the `tID` parameter containing SQL injection payload.
   -  Example:  `http://[target]/[path]//index.asp?tID=-1%20union%20select%200,uPassword,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0%20from%20JFS_tblusers%20where%20no%20like%200`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
- **Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs to be familiar with SQL syntax to craft the injection payload.
