- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Heap-based buffer overflow, infinite loop, and other unspecified vulnerabilities.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Heap-based buffer overflow, infinite loop, and other unspecified vulnerabilities.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker could send an email containing a malicious file that would trigger the buffer overflow vulnerability, leading to the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running F-Prot (potentially root).
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a specially crafted email containing a malicious file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker can be remote and needs to send the crafted email to a target using F-Prot.
