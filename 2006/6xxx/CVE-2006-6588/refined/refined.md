Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from the reliance on client-side JavaScript (specifically `whyzzywig.js`) for filtering HTML tags in forum messages. 
- The server does not perform adequate sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** HTML tags are filtered on the client side by javascript. If the Javascript is disabled or bypassed, malicious HTML code, including `<script>` tags, can be injected.
- **Insecure Hidden Fields:**  The usage of hidden fields for parameters like `dataResourceTypeId`, `contentTypeId`, and others could allow users to manipulate these values, potentially creating arbitrary content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **XSS:**  An attacker could inject malicious scripts into forum messages. When other users view these messages, the script will execute in their browser session, potentially leading to:
    - Stealing user cookies.
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.
- **Hidden Field Manipulation:**  An attacker could manipulate hidden fields, potentially leading to:
    - Creation of unauthorized or malicious content.
    - Data corruption or manipulation.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Forum Message Injection:** An attacker can post a forum message with malicious HTML if Javascript is disabled or manipulated.
- **Hidden Field Tampering:** An attacker could modify hidden input values when submitting a request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Post on Forums:** The attacker must have the ability to post messages in the forum.
- **Technical Knowledge:** The attacker must be able to manipulate client-side scripts, or have a way to bypass the client-side javascript sanitization, or manipulate HTTP requests to modify hidden fields.
