How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## SUSE Security

# A Process That Never Ends

### SUSE is committed to delivering best effort security to its customers and to the Open Source community. We believe that trust in Open Source Software security in general, and the user's privacy in particular, are both indispensable and indefeasible.

We treat software security as a process that never ends. This means we:

* Promptly react to security incidents and deliver premium quality security updates
* Continuously improve the security-related functionality in SUSE products
* Continuously contribute to the rapidly growing maturity of Open Source Software
* Respect the Open Source Software security principles of openness, transparency and traceability

Software security is a complex challenge. Software can provide many of its own security features, such as authentication methods, encryption, intrusion prevention and detection, and backup.

At the same time, it can also contain errors (both deliberate and accidental) that can affect the system's security, including design flaws, programming errors, and backdoors.

The SUSE Security Team addresses all of these aspects of software security, on an ongoing basis. Software security cannot be thought of as a state you can achieve at a specific point in time. Instead, it is a process that must be executed with professional expertise and continuous development. This persistent focus is what has given Open Source Software, Linux and SUSE such an excellent reputation for security.

CVE ID         : CVE-2006-6406 CVE-2006-6481

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Clam anti-virus
toolkit. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:

CVE-2006-6406

    Hendrik Weimer discovered that invalid characters in base64 encoded
    data may lead to bypass of scanning mechanisms.

CVE-2006-6481

| Bypassing Virus Scanners Using MIME Encoding Tricks 2006-12-06  [Print version](/security/virus-scanner-bypass.print)  [Slashdot me!](http://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=basic&url=http%3A%2Fwww.quantenblog.net%2Fsecurity%2Fvirus-scanner-bypass) [Digg me!](http://www.digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.quantenblog.net/security/virus-scanner-bypass&ei=utf-8) [Stumble me!](http://www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.quantenblog.net%2Fsecurity%2Fvirus-scanner-bypass) [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.quantenblog.net/security/virus-scanner-bypass) [Reddit me!](http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http://www.quantenblog.net/security/virus-scanner-bypass)  From time to time a vulnerability is found in a virus scanner that allows an attacker to disguise malicious content so that the scanner won't detect it but the virus is still fully functional. Much rarer are discoveries of new attack classes that are able to blindfold not one but many virus scanners. Here is one.  When sending files via e-mail they first have to be encoded in a special way so that they don't break the SMTP protocol, which was invented in a time when all e-mails were just plain text. The internet standard for this procedure is called Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions ([MIME](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIME)). One method to do this is [Base64](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) encoding in which every three bytes of input result in four bytes of output. While this makes the content larger the result will always be conforming to the relevant e-mail standards. As the name says, Base64 is made up of an alphabet of 64 characters, each representing a previously defined value.  Base64 encoding for MIME is defined in RFC 2045, which lists such an alphabet and clearly states: *All line breaks or other characters not found in [the alphabet] must be ignored by decoding software.* So it shouldn't make any difference if we insert some random characters not in the alphabet into a Base64 encoded version of our good old [EICAR string](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eicar_test_file), right? Wrong. Some virus scanners will happily pass viruses once they come in an unusual but still RFC-compliant encoding. This is even more astonishing given such attacks have already been [discussed](http://www.vuxml.org/freebsd/85e19dff-e606-11d8-9b0a-000347a4fa7d.html) before.  Things start to get really nasty if some levels of multipart/mixed content are wrapped around the harmful attachment. Then, only one of the six tested virus scanners was able to detect the EICAR file. A simple [perl script](http://www.quantenblog.net/download/perl/virus) is provided as a proof of concept. You may have to play with the $loop variable, which controls the number of multipart nestings, depending on your virus scanner and mail server. Note that your mail client may not be able to properly decode the attachment as well (e.g. [Gnus](http://www.osreviews.net/reviews/comm/gnus) doesn't, but [Mutt](http://www.mutt.org/) or Outlook will do the job). Vulnerable products:  * BitDefender Mail Protection for SMB 2.0 * ClamAV 0.88.7 * F-Prot Antivirus for Linux x86 Mail Servers 4.6.61 * Kaspersky Anti-Virus for Linux Mail Server 5.5.10   1: "Less vulnerable" when using scan-mail.pl, which does not work with all mail servers. "Not vulnerable" if and only if the e-mail is passed to F-Prot with an .eml extension.  For large values of $loop, ClamAV prior to 0.88.7 even crashes due to a [stack overflow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_overflow), creating a denial of service attack. However, arbitrary code execution is probably not possible. Version 0.88.7 issues a warning when a multipart nesting level is exceeded, but still allows the EICAR string to pass if it is nested deeper than the limit. Using the "–block-max" configuration switch does not help either.  Virus scanners for other platforms are probably vulnerable as well. Less vulnerable: A virus scanner listed here is unable to detect the EICAR string, however it reports that it could not properly scan the e-mail. The final action depends on the configured policy. Note that this behavior is only a result of deep multipart nesting and has nothing to do with Base64 decoding.   * ClamAV 0.90.2 * F-Secure Anti-Virus for Linux Gateways 4.65  Not vulnerable:  * avast! for Linux/Unix Servers 2.0.0 * Barracuda Spam Firewall (Firmware version 3.4.10.071)  Workaround: Use a separate daemon performing correct MIME decoding (e.g. [amavisd-new](http://www.ijs.si/software/amavisd/)). Note that not all mail anti-virus products provide the necessary command-line scanner.  If you have any information on other vendors' status, please let me know.
