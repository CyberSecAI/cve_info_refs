  {
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Invalid characters in base64 encoded data and deeply nested multipart/mime MIME data.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of invalid characters in Base64 encoding",
        "Insufficient checks on the depth of nested MIME structures",
        "Failure to reject malformed MIME content",
         "Lack of proper input validation",
         "Stack overflow due to excessive recursion"
      ],
      "impact": "Bypass of scanning mechanisms, potentially leading to undetected malware. Also, denial of service due to stack overflow when processing deeply nested MIME data.",
      "attack_vectors": [
          "Sending specially crafted emails with malformed base64 encoding",
           "Sending emails with deeply nested multipart/mime data."
       ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to send specially crafted email messages to a vulnerable system, including manipulating MIME encoding and nesting levels."
    },
    "additional_notes": "The vulnerability can be exploited by including invalid characters in base64 encoded data, causing a bypass of virus scanning mechanisms. Additionally, deeply nested multipart/mime MIME data can lead to a denial of service.  Some scanners may not detect the malicious file if the MIME structure is nested too deeply. The provided perl script demonstrates how to generate such email messages."
