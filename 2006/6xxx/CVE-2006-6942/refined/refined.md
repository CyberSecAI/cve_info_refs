Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2006-6942:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in various parts of phpMyAdmin. Specifically, the vulnerability arises when comments, database names, table names, and query history, including position parameters, are not properly encoded before being rendered in the user's browser.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored or persistent XSS. Malicious JavaScript can be injected into comments, database names, and table names and stored within phpMyAdmin, allowing execution of the script when other users view the affected content.
- **Full Path Disclosure:** Several script files reveal the server's full path in error messages and logs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **XSS:**
    - **Cookie Stealing:** Attackers can steal session cookies of authenticated users, potentially gaining access to their phpMyAdmin sessions.
    - **Account Hijacking:** By stealing session cookies, attackers can take complete control of user accounts.
    - **Malicious Actions:** Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript within the context of a victim's browser, enabling them to modify the page content, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform other unauthorized actions.
- **Full Path Disclosure:**
    - **Information Leakage:** Attackers can learn the server's file system structure, which can aid in planning more complex attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **XSS:**
    - **Comment Injection:** By inserting malicious JavaScript code into table or database comments through the "operation" page.
    - **Database Creation:** Injection of XSS in the "db" parameter during database creation.
    - **Database Copy:** Injection of XSS in the "newname" parameter when copying a database.
    - **Query History:** Injection of XSS in query history related parameters.
    - **Position Parameter:** Injecting XSS via the "pos" parameter in the URL.
- **Full Path Disclosure:**
    - By accessing specific phpMyAdmin pages, attackers can observe file paths through error messages.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **XSS:**
    - **Authenticated User (for stored XSS):** Attackers need to be an authenticated user of phpMyAdmin with permissions to create databases, tables, or add comments.
    - **Victim Access:** Victims need to access the affected parts of phpMyAdmin, which will then execute the injected script.
- **Full Path Disclosure:**
    - **Network Access:** Attackers need network access to the server hosting phpMyAdmin to make HTTP requests. No user authentication is required to access the file paths.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in phpMyAdmin versions up to 2.9.1
- The fix is to upgrade to phpMyAdmin 2.9.1.1 or newer
- Specific code commits have been made to address this issue as referenced in the phpMyAdmin security advisory.

**CWE Classification:**
- CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
- CWE-661: Improper Limitation of Operations within the Bounds of a Resource
