How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Original Release Date: 2006-12-11 | Last Revised: 2007-02-23

---

### Overview

A vulnerability in Microsoft Word could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.

### Description

| Microsoft Word fails to properly handle malformed data structures allowing memory corruption to occur. This vulnerability can be triggered by opening a specially crafted document with Microsoft Word. It is possible that the vulnerability can be exploited by opening a Microsoft Office document that includes an embedded Word document.  We are aware of public reports of active exploitation of this vulnerability.More information is available in Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS07-014](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS07-014.mspx). |
| --- |

### Impact

| By convincing a user to open a specially crafted Word document, an attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Word. If the user is logged in with administrative privileges, the attacker could take complete control of a vulnerable system. |

### Solution

| **Apply Update for Microsoft**Microsoft has addressed this vulnerability in Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS07-014](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS07-014.mspx). |
| --- |

| **Do not open untrusted Word documents**Do not open unfamiliar or unexpected Word or other Office documents, particularly those hosted on web sites or delivered as email attachments. Please see Cyber Security Tip [ST04-010](http://www.us-cert.gov/cas/tips/ST04-010.html).**Do not rely on file name extension filtering**In most cases, Windows will call Word to open a document even if the document has an unknown file extension. For example, if document.qwer contains the correct file header information, Windows will open document.qwer with Word. Filtering for common extensions (e.g., .doc, and .dot) will not detect all Word documents.  **Disable automatic opening of Microsoft Office documents**By default, Microsoft Office 97 and Microsoft Office 2000 will configure Internet Explorer to automatically open Microsoft Office documents. This feature can be disabled by using the [Office Document Open Confirmation Tool](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=8B5762D2-077F-4031-9EE6-C9538E9F2A2F&displaylang=en). Mozilla Firefox users should disable automatic opening of files, as specified in the [Securing Your Web Browser](http://www.us-cert.gov/reading_room/securing_browser/#ffdownloadactions) document. |

### General Information

## Executive Summary

**Executive Summary:**

This update resolves several newly discovered, privately and publicly reported vulnerabilities. Each vulnerability is documented in its own subsection in the "Vulnerability Details" section of this bulletin.

If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

We recommend that customers apply the update immediately.

## Vulnerability Details

#### Word Malformed String Vulnerability - CVE-2006-5994:

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way Microsoft Word handles Word files with a specially crafted string. Such a specially crafted file might be included as an e-mail attachment or hosted on a malicious Web site. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Word file that could allow remote code execution.

#### Mitigating Factors for Word Malformed String Vulnerability - CVE-2006-5994:

* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Word file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site.
* The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message.
* Users who have installed and are using the [Office Document Open Confirmation Tool](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=8b5762d2-077f-4031-9ee6-c9538e9f2a2f) for Office 2000 will be prompted with **Open**, **Save**, or **Cancel** before opening a document. The features of the Office Document Open Confirmation Tool are incorporated in Office XP and Office 2003.
* Microsoft Office Word 2007 is not affected by this vulnerability.
* Microsoft Word Viewer 2003 is not affected by this vulnerability.

#### Workarounds for Word Malformed String Vulnerability - CVE-2006-5994

* Do not open or save Microsoft Word files that you receive from untrusted sources or that you received unexpectedly from trusted sources. This vulnerability could be exploited when a user opens a file.
* Use Microsoft Word Viewer 2003 to open and view files. The Microsoft Word Viewer 2003 is not affected by the issue. Users can download [Microsoft Word Viewer 2003](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=95e24c87-8732-48d5-8689-ab826e7b8fdf) from the Microsoft Download Center.

#### FAQ for Word Malformed String Vulnerability - CVE-2006-5994:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Microsoft Word.

#### FAQ for Word Macro Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0208:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Microsoft Word. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability results because Word incorrectly checks properties in a modified document, causing it to not prompt the user with a macro security warning when macros are present in the document.

**What is a Macro?**

Generally, the term macro refers to a small program that automates frequently-performed tasks in an operating system or in a program. For example, all members of the Office family of products support the use of macros. This allows companies to develop macros that perform as sophisticated productivity tools that run in Word, in Excel, or in other programs. Like any computer program, macros can be misused. Malicious software may be written as macros and then embedded in Office documents. To mitigate this threat, Office has a security model that is designed to make sure that macros can only run when the user wants them to run. By using this vulnerability, an attacker might be able to run a macro without warning the user that a macro is present in the document.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system.

**How could an attacker exploit this vulnerability?**

An attacker could seek to exploit this vulnerability by creating a specially-crafted Word document that contained a malicious macro. The attacker could then send it to a user, typically through an e-mail message, and then persuade the user to open the document. As a result, if the user were attacked by means of this vulnerability, the user's macro security level could be reduced and other macros that would otherwise be stopped by Word could be allowed to run. An attacker could also host the specially-crafted Word document on a network share or on a Web site; however, the attacker would still need to persuade the user to open the document.

In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Word file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site.

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that Microsoft Word performs certain macro security controls when it opens a document.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

On the home page of that site, look under the **Update Strategies** section for the software version you are updating. The [Windows Installer Documentation](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21685) also provides more information about the parameters supported by the Windows Installer.

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. MBSA allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for commonly misconfigured security parameters. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).

* **File Version Verification**

**Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

   **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system, language, or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

   **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.

#### Word 2004 for Mac

**Installation Information:**

1. Quit any applications that are running, including virus-protection applications, all Microsoft Office applications, Microsoft Messenger for Mac, and Office Notifications, because they might interfere with installation.
2. Open the **Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac 11.3.4 Update** volume on your desktop. This step might have been performed for you.
3. To start the update process, in the **Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac 11.3.4 Update** volume window, double-click the **Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac 11.3.4 Update** application, and follow the instructions on the screen.
4. If the installation finishes successfully, you can remove the update installer from your hard disk. To verify that the installation finished successfully, see the âVerifying Update Installationâ section. To remove the update installer, first drag the **Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac 11.3.4 Update** volume to the Trash, and then drag the file that you downloaded to the Trash.

**Restart Requirement**

This update does not require you to restart your computer.

**Removal Information**

This update cannot be uninstalled.

**Verifying Update Installation**

To verify that a security update is installed on an affected system, follow these steps:

1. In the Finder, navigate to the Application Folder (**Microsoft Office 2004: Office**).
2. Select the file, **Microsoft Component Plugin**.
3. On the **File** menu click **Get Info** or **Show Info**.

If the Version number is **11.3.4**, the update has been successfully installed.

**Software Update Services:**

By using Microsoft Software Update Services (SUS), administrators can quickly and reliably deploy the latest critical updates and security updates to Windows 2000 and Windows Server 2003-based servers, and to desktop systems that are running Windows 2000 Professional or Windows XP Professional.

For more information about how to deploy security updates by using Software Update Services, visit the [Software Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21133).

**Windows Server Update Services:**

By using Windows Server Update Services (WSUS), administrators can quickly and reliably deploy the latest critical updates and security updates for Windows 2000 operating systems and later, Office XP and later, Exchange Server 2003, and SQL Server 2000 onto Windows 2000 and later operating systems.

For more information about how to deploy security updates using Windows Server Update Services, visit the [Windows Server Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=50120).

**Systems Management Server:**

Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) delivers a highly configurable enterprise solution for managing updates. By using SMS, administrators can identify Windows-based systems that require security updates and can perform controlled deployment of these updates throughout the enterprise with minimal disruption to end users. For more information about how administrators can use SMS 2003 to deploy security updates, visit the [SMS 2003 Security Patch Management Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=22939). SMS 2.0 users can also use [Software Updates Service Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33340) to help deploy security updates. For information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

**Note** SMS uses the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer, the Microsoft Office Detection Tool, and the Enterprise Update Scan Tool to provide broad support for security bulletin update detection and deployment. Some software updates may not be detected by these tools. Administrators can use the inventory capabilities of the SMS in these cases to target updates to specific systems. For more information about this procedure, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33341). Some security updates require administrative rights following a restart of the system. Administrators can use the Elevated Rights Deployment Tool (available in the [SMS 2003 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33387) and in the [SMS 2.0 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21161)) to install these updates.

## Latest news

![The Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) test goes considerably farther than traditional tests: It evaluates security products in 10 realistic scenarios involving ransomware and info stealers, which utilize or combine state-of-the-art attack techniques. In doing so, the ATP test analyzes whether the defensive measures hold up in each step &ndash; or where they fail. The 12 tested products for consumer users and corporate users, running on Windows 11, are required to hold their own against techniques such as COM hijacking, reflective code loading, decoupling and low entropy encoding. Many products were up to the task, but not all. In some cases, the last firewall failed, and data was encrypted, stolen, or both.](/fileadmin/_processed_/8/8/csm_1224_ATP_Oktober24_6a1a421aac.png "ATP Test under Windows 11 –")![Our test lab subjected 14 protection products for consumers and corporate users to hundreds of extremely dangerous MacOS malware attacks on systems running Sonoma 14.6. The lab put all the security packages through tests in the categories of protection, performance and usability. And it was no easy task, as the various malware samples used in the test are some of the most malicious ones when it comes to current cyber threats. The products evaluated by the lab achieved top scores, with only a few exceptions, which leads to a noticeable increase in the security of MacOS systems.](/fileadmin/_processed_/1/a/csm_1124_aufmacher_mac_test_f855f27b76.jpg "Security solutions for MacOS Sonoma")![Cyber attackers are constantly tweaking new attack techniques, honing existing ones or combining them into an attack wave. In the latest Advanced Threat Protection test (ATP), the experts from AV-TEST examined how well protection products detect and fend off the newly developed attacks. In the test lab, 6 products for consumer users and 8 solutions for corporate users demonstrated how well they can parry attacks. In the test, attackers with ransomware and info stealers harnessed the techniques of dynamic API resolution, DLL sideloading, PowerShell ScriptBlockAst command concealment, cloaking themselves in known Windows tools. The test indicates that some protection products are hard put to deal with the attack techniques and cannot always withstand the attacks. ](/fileadmin/_processed_/3/5/csm_1024_aufmacher_atp_634fe63c38.jpg "Security software in the advanced test –")

![Many consumer users don&#039;t see themselves as being in the crosshairs of cybergangsters. A major fallacy: because attackers are constantly foraging for interesting data, passwords or e-mail log-in details. This also includes entire Windows systems, as attacking botnets are always on the lookout for new PCs to enslave. In the latest endurance test over 6 months, 13 security products show how well they go the distance in protecting systems.](/fileadmin/_processed_/6/f/csm_1024_aufmacher_dauertest_win10_11_privat_0daad402c9.jpg "Endurance test with 13 security packages ")

![Security products for consumer users and corporate users are faced with a formidable task. They have to protect systems around the clock and deal with the latest threats. Sometimes the products detect the attackers immediately &ndash; but sometimes only in a further defensive step. This is precisely the aspect examined by the Advanced Threat Protection test. In this endurance test, 31 products show how well they not only detect attackers but also how effectively they defend Windows 10 systems. The result is exciting and reveals some unforeseen surprises.](/fileadmin/_processed_/2/1/csm_0824_Aufmacher_ATP_Dauertest_1bis6_24_6af97e4f31.jpg "ATP endurance test over 6 months:")

![In addition to phishing attacks, hackers and APT groups mostly use ransomware or info stealers for attacking Windows systems. The comprehensive Advanced Threat Protection test demonstrates the fact that even after initial non-detection of an attacker, all is not lost. In this test series, the experts from AV-TEST evaluate in a step-by-step test in 10 rugged scenarios what the protection solutions are capable of &ndash; or what they are not capable of. In the latest test, the malware samples unleashed attacks with special techniques. They were concealed in scripts and installation packets or they capitalized on harmless-looking Windows shortcut files. Most of the 17 protection products for consumers and corporate users put up a vigorous and successful defense. But individual products were outsmarted in a few cases. ](/fileadmin/_processed_/0/b/csm_0824_Aufmacher_ATP_84e8af3de4.jpg "Windows protection software in the ATP Test –")
