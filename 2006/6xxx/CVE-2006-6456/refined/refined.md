  "CVE-2006-6456": [
    {
      "Root cause": "Microsoft Word fails to properly handle malformed data structures, leading to memory corruption.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Insufficient data validation when processing malformed data structures within Word files."
      ],
      "Impact": "Remote code execution. An attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Word, potentially gaining complete control of a vulnerable system.",
      "Attack vectors": [
        "Opening a specially crafted Word document.",
        "Opening a Microsoft Office document that includes an embedded Word document."
      ],
       "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to create a specially crafted Word document and convince a user to open it."
    },
    {
       "Root cause": "Word does not perform sufficient data validation when processing the contents of a file.",
       "Weaknesses": [
          "Insufficient data validation when processing malformed data structures."
        ],
        "Impact": "When Word opens a specially crafted Word file and parses a malformed data structure, it may corrupt system memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code, potentially leading to complete control of the affected system.",
        "Attack vectors": [
          "E-mail: sending a specially crafted file to the user and convincing the user to open the file.",
          "Web-based attack: hosting a web site that contains a malicious Word file.  The attacker needs to convince the user to visit the website and open the malicious Word document."
        ],
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to create a specially crafted Word file.  The attacker needs to convince a user to open the file (either as an email attachment or through a malicious web site)"
    }
