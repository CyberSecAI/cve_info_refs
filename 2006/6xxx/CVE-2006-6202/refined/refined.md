  "CVE-2006-6202": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "The provided exploit targets a remote file inclusion vulnerability in the 'util.php' file of the NukeAI module for PHP-Nuke. The vulnerability is present in the NukeAI beta3 version. The exploit leverages the insecure handling of the 'AIbasedir' parameter in 'util.php' to include arbitrary remote files. By injecting a PHP shell into the 'moreinfo' parameter, an attacker can achieve remote code execution.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the insecure use of the 'AIbasedir' parameter in the 'util.php' file. This parameter is used in a 'require_once' statement, allowing the inclusion of remote files.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)"
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "HTTP GET/POST request to the vulnerable 'util.php' file.",
        "Manipulation of the 'AIbasedir' parameter to include a remote file.",
         "Injection of PHP code into the 'moreinfo' parameter through a POST request to create the shell and subsequently use the created shell through a GET request using the 'cmd' parameter."
      ],
        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable PHP-Nuke installation."
