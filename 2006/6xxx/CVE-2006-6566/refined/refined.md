Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is due to an insecure `include_once` statement in the `profilcp_constants.php` file. The `$module_root_path` variable, which is used to construct the path for the included file, is directly taken from user input via the URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary weakness is that the script includes a file based on user-supplied input, allowing the inclusion of remote files from attacker-controlled servers. This leads to Remote File Inclusion.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The code does not validate or sanitize the `$module_root_path` variable, making it vulnerable to manipulation by an attacker.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious PHP file from a remote server, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the target server with the privileges of the web server. This can lead to complete system compromise, data theft, or defacement.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable script (`profilcp_constants.php`) with a malicious URL in the `module_root_path` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Connectivity:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable server.
- **Ability to host a malicious PHP file:** The attacker needs to host a malicious PHP file on a server that is accessible to the vulnerable application.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Script:** The attacker needs to know the location of the vulnerable script (`profilcp_constants.php`) and the parameter to manipulate (`module_root_path`).
