<?xml version="1.0"?>
<overlay id="testOverlay" xmlns="<http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul>">
<script type="application/x-javascript">
<![CDATA[
Function.prototype.f=function(){};
Function.prototype.s='string';

</overlay>
After several seconds "typeof Function.prototype.f" becomes "undefined" instead of being "function".
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Apply overlay mentioned above to chrome://browser/content/browser.xul.
2. Set browser.dom.window.dump.enabled=true in about:config.
(You can download and install a test extension which does items 1 and 2:
<http://xsms.nm.ru/temp/gecko/function_prototype/testxpi.xpi>)
3. Run Firefox with "-console" flag.
4. Look into console for results
Actual Results:
without timeout:Function.prototype.f=function
without timeout:Function.prototype.s=string
0ms:Function.prototype.f=function
0ms:Function.prototype.s=string
1000ms:Function.prototype.f=function
1000ms:Function.prototype.s=string
5000ms:Function.prototype.f=undefined
5000ms:Function.prototype.s=undefined
10000ms:Function.prototype.f=undefined
10000ms:Function.prototype.s=undefined
Expected Results:
without timeout:Function.prototype.f=function
without timeout:Function.prototype.s=string
0ms:Function.prototype.f=function
0ms:Function.prototype.s=string
1000ms:Function.prototype.f=function
1000ms:Function.prototype.s=string
5000ms:Function.prototype.f=function
5000ms:Function.prototype.s=string
10000ms:Function.prototype.f=function
10000ms:Function.prototype.s=string
This happens only with Firefox 2.0 nightly builds.
There is no such problem in Firefox 1.5.0.x.

This is a regression from [bug 343417](/show_bug.cgi?id=343417 "RESOLVED FIXED - chatzilla leaks its chrome"), tested via local backout.
<http://bonsai.mozilla.org/cvsblame.cgi?file=mozilla/browser/components/safebrowsing/content/sb-loader.js&rev=1.10&mark=76,77#75>
is what causes Function.prototype.f to be cleared - that component loads <http://bonsai.mozilla.org/cvsblame.cgi?file=mozilla/toolkit/components/url-classifier/content/js/lang.js&rev=1.2#272> , which plays with Function.prototype.
The timeouts are only needed because that component is instantiated on a timeout from the browser window load.Blocks: [343417](/show_bug.cgi?id=343417 "RESOLVED FIXED - chatzilla leaks its chrome")Status: UNCONFIRMED → NEWEver confirmed: true

[Bug 343417](/show_bug.cgi?id=343417 "RESOLVED FIXED - chatzilla leaks its chrome") was landed on branch over 2 months ago, and this testcase is the first report of this bug. That makes me wonder how badly (if at all) it will affect users if we release with it.
Brendan/jst: gavin tells me you're investigating. Please let us know what you think the deleterious effects of this bug might be, and the risk involved in fixing it. Backing out [bug 343417](/show_bug.cgi?id=343417 "RESOLVED FIXED - chatzilla leaks its chrome") seems like the cure might be worse than the disease.

It looks related to overlays, but last night jst and I saw stuff debugging that was moderately alarming. Need to hear from jst today about what he learned.
If only XUL overlays provoke the bug, perhaps we can wait for 1.8.1.1. We need to understand what's going on first to be sure. The alarming stuff has to-do with split window interactions with the JS standard environment initialization.

I tried testing this, but applying the patch and rebuilding in js/src resulted in a browser that would close immediately after being launched (it doesn't seem to crash).

Unfortunately this doesn't do it. For one, we end up getting here for globals with no inner, and even when I changed that to just use the context's global it still doesn't fix the problem. Still digging (had hardly any time for this tonight) :(

I'm going to assume that course of action until we hear differently. We're triaging every day, so just renominate if this turns out to be a showstopper.Flags: blocking1.8.1?Flags: blocking1.8.1.1?Flags: blocking1.8.1-

Not really, the same bug affected the Custom Buttons extensions (<http://adblockplus.org/development-builds/adding-filter-subscriptions-with-two-clicks#c000054>). Unfortunately I didn't have time to investigate this issue propertly when I got this report, and Custom Buttons was easily fixed by avoiding using function prototypes.

Alternate approach.
Testing this is going to be hard for me, but I like the patch.

Alternate approach.
Cool, thanks for reviewing mrbkap. As far as testing goes, I've checked and this does fix the testcase in this bug and also the testcase in [bug 357947](/show_bug.cgi?id=357947 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - Setting Function.prototype does not work in pop-up windows (Firefox 2)"). Wladimir, any chance you could revert your changes to the Custom Buttons extension and see if this patch fixes that as well?
As for what this patch does, the primary fix is to make js\_FindClassObject innerize the object before looking up the class. But for that to work I had to tweak how the innerObject hook works in nsWindowSH. With this change it returns the outer if the outer is frozen, and with this patch an outer window is frozen on creation and remains frozen until the first document is loaded in it. That way we don't forward anything to the inner or create dummy inner objects while we're initializing the outer, and after that we do what we've always done. The bulk of this change is tweaking the freeze/thaw code to make it work as described above, the rest is the fixes in the innerObject hook and js\_FindClassObject().

Sorry, recompiling Firefox is a little of a problem for me right now, you will have to test yourself. I reverted my changes, you can download the extension that still has this problem from <http://adblockplus.org/trash/custombuttons-buggy.xpi>. After you install put this URL into the location bar:

You will get an Options button in your Customize dialog, add it to a toolbar and restart Firefox. The current Firefox version shows the error mentioned above on startup.

Alternate approach.
Cool, I especially like the removal of the ad-hoc Freeze/Thaw around the JS\_NewArrayObject -- any more like that? Prolly not.
As jst and I were discussing in person, the followup bug for this one should ask why a scope chain ends in an outer window object, such that js\_FindClassObject needs to innerize. The premise of the split window work was that no scope chain ends in an outer window.

Wladimir, unless I missed something obvious that works both with and without this patch, so I'm not sure what to make of that. I'm planning to land this change real soon now, so maybe you can test it out once it's in (trunk) and see if you can prove that problem fixed as well.

I didn't find any other ones like that. And in fact on the trunk that one doesn't exist any more either, which lead me and mrbkap to thinking that the bug this fixed has regressed on the trunk. But not so any more now that this is in on the trunk. I'll attach the trunk version of this patch too...

There is no scope chain in this case -- that's why we're using the context's globalObject which is, by definition, the outer window (since the outer window owns the context).

Oh, right. In that case, the OBJ\_INNER\_OBJECT should be moved up into the else clause, and then then clause should assert that the last object is not an outer.

That does fix the testcase in [bug 357947](/show_bug.cgi?id=357947 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - Setting Function.prototype does not work in pop-up windows (Firefox 2)"), but not the testcase in this bug. I have yet to sit down and figure out exactly what's causing us to use an outer as a scope in the testcase in this bug...

Look at the nomination flags, the blocking1.8.1.1? in particular. That should turn into blocking1.8.1.1+ very soon. The Mozilla and Gecko 1.8.1.1 version lines up with Firefox 2.0.0.1, the first patch release.
jst, hope you don't mind my giving you this, since you patched. Can it be marked FIXED now?

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

|  | |

A Function constructor that came from an outer window can be used to create a
function whose global object is the outer window. Such function can be used
for an XSS attack. See also [Bug 311024](/show_bug.cgi?id=311024 "VERIFIED FIXED - eval(code, window) allows XSS attacks").
[Bug 357947](/show_bug.cgi?id=357947 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - Setting Function.prototype does not work in pop-up windows (Firefox 2)") was already fixed on trunk in [Bug 355161](/show_bug.cgi?id=355161 "RESOLVED FIXED - Function.prototype disappears after several seconds of browser's work. (chrome)"). Thus, a testcase works
only on fx2.0.

An attacker can perform the XSS attack without user interaction.
It seems that Function can refer to the outer window's Function only when the
window has been opened by window.open(). Since the popup blocker is turned on
by default, my first testcase requires user interaction.
But, window.toString.constructor refers to the outer window's Function even
when the window is a subframe. Thus, an attacker can exploit without user
interaction.

On 1.5.0.8, I cannot get outer window's Function. (though I don't understand
how window.toString.constructor refers to outer window's Function with the fix
for [bug 343417](/show_bug.cgi?id=343417 "RESOLVED FIXED - chatzilla leaks its chrome").)

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Mozilla Firefox: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200701-02**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in Mozilla Firefox, some of
which may allow the remote execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-client/mozilla-firefox** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.5.0.9** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.5.0.9** |

| Package | **www-client/mozilla-firefox-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.5.0.9** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.5.0.9** |

### Background

Mozilla Firefox is a popular open-source web browser from the Mozilla
Project.

### Description

An anonymous researcher found evidence of memory corruption in the way
Mozilla Firefox handles certain types of SVG comment DOM nodes.
Additionally, Frederik Reiss discovered a heap-based buffer overflow in
the conversion of a CSS cursor. Other issues with memory corruption
were also fixed. Mozilla Firefox also contains less severe
vulnerabilities involving JavaScript and Java.

### Impact

An attacker could entice a user to view a specially crafted web page
that will trigger one of the vulnerabilities, possibly leading to the
execution of arbitrary code. It is also possible for an attacker to
perform cross-site scripting attacks, leading to the exposure of
sensitive information, like user credentials.

### Workaround

There are no known workarounds for all the issues at this time.

### Resolution

All Mozilla Firefox users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-1.5.0.9"
```

All Mozilla Firefox binary release users should upgrade to the latest
version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-bin-1.5.0.9"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
