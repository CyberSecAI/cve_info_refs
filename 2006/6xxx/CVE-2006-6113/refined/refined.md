Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2006-6113:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from program flaws in the `admin_auth.inc.php` and `class.compiler.php` scripts of Monkey Boards version 0.3.5 and earlier. These flaws lead to PHP warning or fatal errors that disclose the full server-side path of the script.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Disclosure:** The scripts generate errors that reveal the full path to the files on the server. Specifically, the `class.compiler.php` attempts to use an undefined class, and `admin_auth.inc.php` calls an undefined function which results in errors that include full path disclosure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Impact (Partial):** An attacker can learn the full path to the web application's files on the server. This information can aid in further attacks by exposing the application's structure and potentially revealing the location of sensitive files or configuration settings.
*   **Integrity Impact (None):** Exploitation does not directly alter or corrupt any data.
*   **Availability Impact (None):** Exploitation does not disrupt the service availability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via HTTP requests to the vulnerable scripts (`class.compiler.php` and `admin_auth.inc.php`).
*   **Direct URL Access:** The attacker can directly access the vulnerable scripts using their URLs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Network Access:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target server.
*   **No Authentication Required:** No authentication is needed to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

*   The provided information includes a detailed description of the vulnerable system (Monkey Boards), the specific vulnerable files, example HTTP request/response demonstrating the path disclosure and mitigation methods.
*   The vulnerability has been fixed in version 0.3.5a of Monkey Boards.
*   The advisory suggests workarounds like disabling error messages in php.ini or using .htaccess to mask the path.
*   The CVSS base score is 2.3 which means the impact of this vulnerability is low.
