{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `mod_ctrls` module of ProFTPD.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker with access to the `mod_ctrls` module can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the ProFTPD daemon, typically root. This can lead to complete system compromise.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access via Unix socket to interact with the mod_ctrls module"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Local user must have permission to connect to the ProFTPD server through the Unix socket.",
        "Must be a server administrator permitted to interact with mod_ctrls."
    ],
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted message to the `mod_ctrls` module. The provided exploit code uses a bind shell payload to gain a root shell on the target system, by setting uid and gid to 0."
