Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2006-6679:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `chetcpasswd` CGI script uses the `HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR` header for authentication, which is easily spoofed. Additionally, there is a lack of rate limiting on password checks, and different error messages expose valid usernames.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Insecure Authentication:**  The script relies on the `HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR` header, which is controlled by the client and can be easily manipulated. It should use the `REMOTE_ADDR` for IP-based authentication, but prioritizes the untrusted  `HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR`.
*   **Lack of Rate Limiting:** The absence of rate limiting on password checks makes it vulnerable to brute-force and dictionary attacks.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The script provides different error messages for invalid usernames versus incorrect passwords, which can be exploited to enumerate valid user accounts.
*   **Bypassing System Checks:** The program does not use PAM and circumvents checks that the administrator may have in place.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Access:** By spoofing the `HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR` header, an attacker can bypass IP-based access restrictions and gain access to the password changing application.
*   **Password Brute-Forcing:** The lack of rate limiting allows attackers to conduct brute-force or dictionary attacks to guess user passwords.
*   **User Enumeration:** Attackers can determine valid user account names by observing the different error messages from failed login attempts.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP Header Spoofing:** An attacker can manipulate the `HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR` header to impersonate a trusted IP address.
*   **HTTP Brute Force/Dictionary Attacks:** Attackers can send numerous login attempts via HTTP to guess passwords.
*   **HTTP User Enumeration:** By analyzing error message response, attackers can identify valid usernames through repeated requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable CGI script.
*   The attacker does not need any prior authentication or authorization.
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft HTTP requests, which can be done using simple tools like `wget`.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability was considered critical.
* The upstream author of `chetcpasswd` was uncooperative in fixing the vulnerabilities, which led to the removal of the package from Debian.
* The issue is also referenced by Secunia advisory [23024](http://secunia.com/advisories/23024).
