```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the `admin_hacks_list.php` file of the phpBB Hacks List Mod. Specifically, the `hack_id` parameter in the URL is not properly sanitized before being used in a SQL query.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL Injection vulnerability.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can use this vulnerability to inject arbitrary SQL queries into the database, which can lead to sensitive information disclosure like user passwords. In the provided exploit example, the attacker retrieves the password of a specific user (user_id=2). This could be extended to potentially gain full control of the database.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the `admin_hacks_list.php` script, by manipulating the `hack_id` parameter. The attacker needs to be able to reach the vulnerable script on the server.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server. No authentication or special privileges are mentioned as necessary for exploiting this vulnerability in the given content. They also need some knowledge of SQL to construct the injection payload."
