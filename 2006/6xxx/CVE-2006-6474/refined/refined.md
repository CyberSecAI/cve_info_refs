{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "McAfee VirusScan for Linux was distributed with an insecure DT_RPATH which included the current working directory, instead of $ORIGIN.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure DT_RPATH configuration"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the VirusScan user by tricking the dynamic loader into loading an untrusted ELF DSO. Automated systems, such as mail scanners, could be subverted to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the process invoking VirusScan.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Enticing a VirusScan user to scan a file in a directory controlled by the attacker"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to create files in a directory that a VirusScan user would scan from."
