Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2006-6020:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization within the `announce.php` script of BlogTorrent-preview version 0.92. Specifically, the script doesn't adequately handle user-supplied input passed through the `left` parameter within the URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary weakness is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This allows an attacker to inject malicious client-side scripts into the web application, which can then be executed by other users who interact with the vulnerable page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this XSS vulnerability could allow an attacker to:
*   Steal cookies or session tokens
*   Redirect users to malicious websites
*   Deface the web page
*   Potentially perform other malicious activities under the context of the victim's browser

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is a crafted URL with a malicious script injected within the `left` parameter. For example:
`Www.Sitename.com/[path]/announce.php?left="><script>alert('Xmors')</script><`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL.
*   The attacker can be remote (no local access required)
*   No authentication is required for this attack.
