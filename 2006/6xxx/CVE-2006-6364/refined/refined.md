Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2006-6364:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization within the "error.php" page of the ISMail webmail system. Specifically, the "error" parameter, which is passed via the URL's query string, is directly displayed on the page without adequate filtering or encoding.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary vulnerability is reflected XSS. This means that malicious script code injected into the "error" parameter is directly rendered by the user's browser when they visit the error page with the crafted URL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Session Hijacking: An attacker can use XSS to steal session cookies of authenticated users. With the stolen cookies, the attacker can then impersonate the user and gain access to their email account.
- Page Defacement: The attacker can inject arbitrary HTML or script to alter the appearance or behavior of the error page, potentially causing further harm such as phishing attempts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious URL: The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the XSS payload in the "error" parameter and sends it to a target user, who might be tricked into clicking it. This is typically done through social engineering, such as in emails or links on malicious sites.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs no prior authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker only needs the ability to create and disseminate a malicious URL.
- The attacker doesn't require local access. The attack can be done remotely through a network connection.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability exists in the error.php page.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Vicente Aguilera Diaz of Internet Security Auditors.
- The issue was identified in ISMail version 2.0 (released 2005-01-20), and potentially affects all versions.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 6.8/10, with an exploitability subscore of 8.6/10.
- The vendor has addressed the issue in the repository.
