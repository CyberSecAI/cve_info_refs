  "CVE-2006-6505": {
    "description": "Georgi Guninski reported that long Content-Type headers in external message bodies could cause a heap buffer overflow when processing mail headers. While working on that code David Bienvenu discovered a similar overflow could occur when processing long rfc2047-encoded headers.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Heap buffer overflow due to insufficient buffer size calculation when processing long Content-Type headers or long rfc2047-encoded headers in external message bodies.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Heap buffer overflow",
        "Insufficient buffer size calculation"
      ],
      "impact": "Arbitrary code execution on the vulnerable system.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Sending a specially crafted email with a long Content-Type header or a long rfc2047-encoded header"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "Remote, unauthenticated attacker. The attacker must be able to send an email to a vulnerable user's email client.",
     "more_info" : "The vulnerability occurs in the `MimeExternalBody_parse_eof` function when allocating space for the headers and their contents using PR_MALLOC, and when parsing the headers with `MimeHeaders_parse_line`. The issue is caused by incorrect size calculations for the buffers that store the header values."
