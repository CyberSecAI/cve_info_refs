Subject Name: OpenSER
Subject Summary: SIP router
Subject Home: http://www.openser.org/
Subject Versions: \* <= 1.1.0
Vulnerability Id: BID:21706
Vulnerability Scope: global (not OpenPKG specific)
Attack Feasibility: run-time
Attack Vector: local system
Attack Impact: arbitrary code execution
Description:
A buffer overflow was discovered [0] in the "parse\_expression"
function of the "permissions" module of the SIP router OpenSER [1],
versions up to and including 1.1.0. The OpenSER "permissions" module
is used to determine if a SIP call has appropriate permission to be
established. The "parse\_expression" function is used during parsing
of the modules local allow/deny configuration files.
The buffer overflow is triggered by parsing a configuration
line expression consisting of more than 500 characters and
potentially could lead to the execution of arbitrary code under
the privileges of the OpenSER process. Successfully exploiting the
vulnerability requires that the local attacker has write access
to the configuration files used with the configuration functions
"allow\_routing", "allow\_register" and "allow\_refer\_to".
