      "content": "The D-Link DWL-2000AP+ with firmware version 2.11 is vulnerable to a remote denial of service due to its failure to properly handle ARP flooding.\n\nTwo vulnerabilities exist:\n\n1.  The first vulnerability causes the wireless link (802.11) to be reset and the ARP table to be rebuilt, disconnecting all clients connected to the AP. This can be triggered by sending a high volume of ARP replies through either the wired or wireless interface.\n\n2.  The second vulnerability affects only the wireless link and is more difficult to trigger. It causes the AP firmware to crash, requiring a manual reboot. This is triggered by broadcasting a very large amount of ARP requests through the wireless interface, when no other D-LINK ethernet products are visible, and WEP encryption is enabled. \n\nThe provided exploit code can trigger both vulnerabilities. The exploit can sometimes fail if the AP bans the attacking client before the flooding process is complete. The product is no longer supported by D-LINK.\n\n**Vulnerability Details**\n\n*   **Root cause:** Improper handling of ARP packets.\n*   **Weakness:** Lack of rate limiting or proper handling of ARP floods.\n*   **Impact:** Denial of service, disconnection of clients, firmware crash requiring manual reboot.\n*   **Attack vectors:** Sending large amounts of ARP requests or replies to the device via the wired or wireless interface.\n*   **Attacker capabilities:** An attacker must be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable device.",
