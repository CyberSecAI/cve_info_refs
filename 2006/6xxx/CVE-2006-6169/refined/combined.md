Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2006%3A0754)

## Topic

Updated GnuPG packages that fix two security issues are now available.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

GnuPG is a utility for encrypting data and creating digital signatures.

Tavis Ormandy discovered a stack overwrite flaw in the way GnuPG decrypts
messages. An attacker could create carefully crafted message that could cause
GnuPG to execute arbitrary code if a victim attempts to decrypt the message.
(CVE-2006-6235)

A heap based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way GnuPG constructs
messages to be written to the terminal during an interactive session. An
attacker could create a carefully crafted message which with user interaction
could cause GnuPG to execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the
user running GnuPG. (CVE-2006-6169)

All users of GnuPG are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which
contains a backported patch to correct these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : gnupg
Vulnerability  : several
Problem-Type   : local(remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2006-6169 CVE-2006-6235
Debian Bug     : 401894 401898 401914

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the GNU privacy,
a free PGP replacement, which may lead to the execution of arbitrary code.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:

CVE-2006-6169

    Werner Koch discovered that a buffer overflow in a sanitising function
    may lead to execution of arbitrary code when running gnupg
    interactively.

CVE-2006-6235

    Tavis Ormandy discovered that parsing a carefully crafted OpenPGP
    packet may lead to the execution of arbitrary code, as a function
    pointer of an internal structure may be controlled through the
    decryption routines.

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.1-1.sarge6.

For the upcoming stable distribution (etch) these problems have been
fixed in version 1.4.6-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.6-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your gnupg packages.

Upgrade Instructions

            GnuPG 1.4 and 2.0 buffer overflow
           ==================================

Summary
=======

While fixing a bug reported by Hugh Warrington, a buffer overflow has
been identified in all released GnuPG versions.  The current versions
1.4.5 and 2.0.0 are affected.  A small patch is provided.

Please do not send private mail in response to this message.  The
mailing list gnupg-devel is the best place to discuss this problem
(please subscribe first so you don't need moderator approval [1]).

Impact
======

When running GnuPG interactively, special crafted messages may be used
to crash gpg or gpg2.  Running gpg in batch mode, as done by all
software using gpg as a backend (e.g. mailers), is not affected by
this bug.

Exploiting this overflow seems to be possible.

gpg-agent, gpgsm, gpgv or other tools from the GnuPG suite are not
affected.

Solution
========

Apply the following patch to GnuPG.  It should apply cleanly to
current versions (1.4.5 as well as 2.0.0) but might also work for
older versions.

        sprintf(prompt, "%s [%s]: ", s, defname );

Background:
===========

The code in question has been introduced on July 1, 1999 and is a
pretty obvious bug.  make_printable_string is supposed to replace
possible dangerous characters from a prompt and returns a malloced
string.  Thus this string may be longer than the orginal one; the
buffer for the prompt has only be allocated at the size of the original
string - oops.  Note, that using snprintf would not have helped in
this case.  How I wish C-90 had introduced asprintf or at least it
would be available on more platforms.

# GnuPG: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200612-03**

GnuPG is vulnerable to a buffer overflow and an erroneous function pointer
dereference that can result in the execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-crypt/gnupg** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.4.6** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.4.6** |

### Background

The GNU Privacy Guard, GnuPG, is a free replacement for the PGP suite
of cryptographic software.

### Description

Hugh Warrington has reported a boundary error in GnuPG, in the
"ask\_outfile\_name()" function from openfile.c: the
make\_printable\_string() function could return a string longer than
expected. Additionally, Tavis Ormandy of the Gentoo Security Team
reported a design error in which a function pointer can be incorrectly
dereferenced.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to interactively use GnuPG on a
crafted file and trigger the boundary error, which will result in a
buffer overflow. They could also entice a user to process a signed or
encrypted file with gpg or gpgv, possibly called through another
application like a mail client, to trigger the dereference error. Both
of these vulnerabilities would result in the execution of arbitrary
code with the permissions of the user running GnuPG. gpg-agent, gpgsm
and other tools are not affected.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All GnuPG users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "=app-crypt/gnupg-1.4*"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

gnupg security update (RHSA-2006-0754)

Original Release Date: February 5, 2007

Last Revised: July 1, 2009

Number: ASA-2007-047

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 4.0

Advisory Status: Interim

---

## 1. Overview:

GnuPG is the GNU project's complete and free implementation of the
OpenPGP standard as defined by RFC2440.

GnuPG was found to contain a stack overwrite vulnerability in its
decryption methods. If a user attempted to decrypt a maliciously encrypted
message, it could be possible for arbitrary code to be executed.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2006-6235](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-6235) to this issue.

The methods GnuPG uses to encrypt content were found to contain a buffer
overflow vulnerability. If a user was encrypting a malicious message so that
the output was written to the terminal they were using in an interactive session,
it might be possible to have arbitrary code executed as the user running GnuPG.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2006-6169](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-6169) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2006-0754.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with gnupg installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya S87XX/S8500/S8300 | CM 2.x and 3.x | Low | Upgrade to CM 4.0 or later. |
| Avaya Intuity LX | IALX 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2 | Low | This advisory will not be addressed by Intuity AUDIX LX. |
| Avaya EMMC | All | Low | This advisory will not be addressed as no further releases are planned. |
| Avaya Messaging Storage Server | MSS 3.0, 3.1 | Low | Upgrade to MSS 4.0 or later. |

| Avaya CCS/SES | 4.0 and earlier | Low | Upgrade to SES 5.0 or later. |

**Recommended Actions:**
For all system products which use
vulnerable versions of GnuPG, Avaya recommends that customers restrict local
and network access to the server. This restriction should be
enforced through the use of physical security, firewalls, ACLs, VPNs, and other
generally-accepted networking practices until such time as an update becomes
available and can be installed.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating
systems. Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying
operating system or applications that come with the operating system. These
vulnerabilities often do not impact the software-only product directly but
may threaten the integrity of the underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not
affected by the vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be.
Customers should determine on which Linux operating system the product was
installed and then follow that vendors guidance.

## 4. Software-Only Products:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CVLAN | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. The CVLAN application does not require the software described in this advisory. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite(IMS) | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. The IMS application does not require the software described in this advisory. |

**Recommended Actions:**
Avaya recommends that customers follow
recommended actions supplied by RedHat Linux or remove the affected package.

## 5. Additional Information:

Additional information may also be available via the Avaya support [website](http://support.avaya.com) and through your Avaya
account representative. Please contact your Avaya product support
representative, or dial 1-800-242-2121, with any questions.

could execute arbitrary code with the user's privileges. This

vulnerability is not exposed when running gpg in batch mode.

([CVE-2006-6169](/security/CVE-2006-6169))

Tavis Ormandy discovered that gnupg was incorrectly using the stack.

If a user were tricked into processing a specially crafted message, an

attacker could execute arbitrary code with the user's privileges.

([CVE-2006-6235](/security/CVE-2006-6235))

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
