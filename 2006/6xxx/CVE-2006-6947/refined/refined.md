  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The NEC printers have an embedded FTP server that can connect to other FTP servers.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The printer's embedded FTP server can connect to other FTP servers, but cannot send files.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker can use the printer as a relay point for FTP bounce attacks to target other hosts.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exploitable through the printer's embedded FTP server. A remote attacker can initiate the FTP connection to another target through the printer.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to reach the printer's FTP server over the network and needs to know how to use the embedded FTP to connect to other servers."
