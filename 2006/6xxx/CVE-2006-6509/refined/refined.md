Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in the content:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2006-6509

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in SiteKiosk's title bar implementation when handling the `ABOUT:` prefix. The application fails to properly sanitize the URL, which is then directly outputted in the title bar.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is an XSS flaw where HTML code within a URL (specifically with the `ABOUT:` prefix) is rendered directly into the title bar, allowing arbitrary script execution.
- **Unrestricted File System Access:** By leveraging the XSS vulnerability and the `ABOUT:` prefix (specifically by creating a link) an attacker can gain file system access through the title bar.
- **ActiveX Control Misuse:**  SiteKiosk installs ActiveX controls marked as safe for scripting, some of which expose methods that can be misused to read and download arbitrary files from the kiosk.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  The XSS vulnerability can lead to arbitrary JavaScript code execution within the security context of the local computer.
- **File System Access:**  The attacker can access the file system and read or download files with the privileges of the user running SiteKiosk
- **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive information on the kiosk can be accessed and stolen.
- **Potential System Compromise:** Depending on the nature of the accessed files and the level of privileges of the user running SiteKiosk, this could lead to a full compromise of the kiosk system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious URL:** An attacker can craft a malicious URL with the `ABOUT:` prefix containing HTML and JavaScript code. This URL can be typed into the address bar of the SiteKiosk browser or embedded in a website the kiosk visits.
- **Title Bar Manipulation:** The vulnerable title bar then renders the unsanitized code, enabling the attack.
- **ActiveX abuse:** Once Javascript code has been executed in the local context, the malicious code can call vulnerable ActiveX methods to download files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local or Remote Access:** While initially described as a local vulnerability, an attacker could exploit this remotely if they can get the kiosk to visit a webpage with the malicious URL.
- **Basic Knowledge:** Requires basic knowledge of HTML, JavaScript and browser workings to craft the malicious URL and understanding of the ActiveX components.
- **User Interaction:** The attack requires a user to either enter the URL in the address bar or click on a link in the title bar for the file system access part of the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was discovered and disclosed by Brett Moore of Security-Assessment.com on November 30, 2006.
- The vendor released a new version (6.5.150) of SiteKiosk that addresses the vulnerability.

This vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass the intended security restrictions of SiteKiosk and potentially gain control of the kiosk system.
