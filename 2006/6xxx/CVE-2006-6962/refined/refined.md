```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `rsgallery.html.php` file in RsGallery2 does not properly sanitize user input, specifically the `mosConfig_absolute_path` parameter, allowing for arbitrary file inclusion.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include arbitrary files from a remote server, potentially leading to the execution of malicious code on the vulnerable server, data compromise, or other malicious activities.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to `rsgallery.html.php` with the `mosConfig_absolute_path` parameter set to a malicious URL.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and have a server with a malicious file to include. No special privileges are required."
