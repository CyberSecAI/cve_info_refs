    "source": "www.exploit-db.com_d0c54588_20250125_043154.html",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `myprofile.asp` page, which allows modification of user details without proper authorization or validation.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insecure direct object reference (IDOR) - User IDs are not properly validated allowing an attacker to modify profiles by changing the MM_recordId.",
         "Lack of authentication - The script does not require prior login or permission to access and modify user profiles.",
         "Lack of input validation - The script does not properly validate the user-supplied password."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can change a user's password and other personal information without requiring prior authentication, potentially leading to account takeover and unauthorized access to the system or classifieds.",
      "attack_vector": "The attacker sends a POST request to `myprofile.asp` with modified values, including `MM_recordId` and `U_PASSWORD`.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to know the URL of the vulnerable `myprofile.asp` script and be able to send a POST request with the correct parameters. The attacker does not need prior access to the web application."
