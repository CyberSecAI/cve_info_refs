Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a SQL injection in the `iNews News Manager` or `iNews Publisher` application.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The application is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `articles.asp` page using the `ex` parameter in the URL.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL queries into the backend database. This could lead to a variety of impacts, including:
   - Data theft/leakage
   - Data modification/corruption
   - Server compromise

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is via a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `articles.asp` page with malicious SQL code within the `ex` URL parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application which is likely publicly accessible or accessible from the same network. No special privileges are mentioned as being necessary to exploit this flaw.

The content suggests that the issue might affect both `iNews News Manager` and `iNews Publisher`, however, the `articles.asp` page was not found on demo sites for News Manager.
