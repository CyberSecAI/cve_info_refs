Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2006-6697

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation in Oracle Portal 10g. Specifically, the `calendar.jsp` file allows user-controlled input via the `enc` parameter to influence the HTTP response headers. By injecting carriage return and line feed characters (%0d%0a) into the `enc` parameter, an attacker can inject arbitrary HTTP headers into the response.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **HTTP Response Splitting:** The primary vulnerability is HTTP response splitting. This occurs when an attacker can inject arbitrary HTTP headers into a response, which can lead to various attacks like cross-site scripting (XSS), cache poisoning, and session hijacking.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The `calendar.jsp` file does not sanitize or validate the `enc` parameter, allowing the injection of special characters that alter the HTTP response structure.
*   **Potential XSS via UTF-7:** The content also suggests a secondary vulnerability by indicating that the ability to control the content encoding via the URL parameter could be exploited using UTF-7 encoding to achieve XSS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Cache Poisoning:** The attacker can inject malicious headers to poison the cache, causing the web cache to store malicious content that can be served to other users.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** By injecting arbitrary HTML and JavaScript into the response, an attacker can execute code within the user's browser. This can be used for session hijacking, data theft, or defacing websites.
*   **Session Hijacking:** By manipulating headers, such as setting a rogue cookie, attackers could potentially hijack user sessions.
*   **Other Attacks:** The ability to inject arbitrary headers allows a wide range of other attacks that exploit the injected headers in a malicious way.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP GET request. The attacker constructs a malicious URL containing the injected characters and script in the `enc` parameter, and the victim accesses the manipulated URL.
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** The vulnerable parameter is the `enc` parameter in the `calendar.jsp` file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Application:** The attacker needs to know that the application is vulnerable to HTTP response splitting, specifically the vulnerable `calendar.jsp` file and its `enc` parameter.
*   **Ability to Craft Malicious URLs:** The attacker must be able to construct a specially crafted URL with the necessary characters and script to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send the malicious URL to the target. The victim, however, would need network access to the vulnerable Oracle Portal server and would need to access the malicious crafted url.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was reported with no official patch available at the time of the report.
*   A workaround was suggested to manually edit the `calendar.jsp` file and fix the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability can be exploited using a standard web browser or any tool capable of crafting HTTP requests.
* The vulnerable URL allows for content-length header injection, which can be exploited to inject content with javascript payload.

In summary, this vulnerability allows an attacker to perform various attacks by injecting malicious HTTP headers by manipulating the encoding parameter in the request url.
