  - Root cause of vulnerability: The ClamAV antivirus software fails to properly handle deeply nested MIME multipart/mixed content.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Improper handling of nested MIME content, leading to a denial-of-service vulnerability. Also, invalid characters in base64 encoded data may lead to bypass of scanning mechanisms.
  - Impact of exploitation: An attacker can cause ClamAV to crash (DoS) by sending a specially crafted email with deeply nested MIME multipart/mixed content. The attacker can potentially bypass the scanner by inserting random characters in base64 encoded content.
  - Attack vectors: Sending a specially crafted email message with deeply nested MIME multipart/mixed content. The crafted email will bypass virus scanner protection.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send emails to a system running ClamAV.
