This content describes a vulnerability related to how some virus scanners handle MIME encoded email attachments, specifically Base64 encoding and multipart/mixed content. Although not explicitly stated, the vulnerability is related to the parsing of email and its content, not just the specific encoding.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the failure of some virus scanners to correctly parse and decode MIME encoded email attachments, specifically when invalid characters are inserted into Base64 encoded data or when deep levels of multipart/mixed content nesting are employed.  This is because they don't strictly adhere to RFC 2045, which states that non-alphabet characters in Base64 should be ignored. Additionally, they struggle with deeply nested multipart emails.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Improper Base64 decoding:** Some virus scanners fail to ignore invalid characters in Base64 encoded data, leading them to not correctly identify malicious content (e.g. EICAR test string)
*   **Improper multipart handling:** Some virus scanners fail to properly process deeply nested multipart/mixed email content, leading to the scanner being bypassed. Some scanners even crash due to a stack overflow when parsing heavily nested emails.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Bypassing virus scanners:** Malicious content disguised through the described encoding methods can bypass virus scanners, allowing malware to reach the intended victim.
*   **Denial of service:** Some scanners can crash (e.g., ClamAV) when encountering deeply nested multipart emails, potentially leading to a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Email attachments:** Attackers can send malicious files disguised as email attachments using the described MIME encoding techniques.
*   **Multipart email:** By creating emails with deeply nested multipart/mixed content, attackers can further obfuscate malicious content and bypass scanners.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to craft emails with specific MIME encodings, including Base64 and multipart/mixed content.
*   The attacker needs to target systems that use a vulnerable virus scanner.
*   No special access or position on the target system is required, only the ability to send a crafted email.

**Additional details:**
*   The article provides a proof of concept perl script for exploiting the vulnerability
*   Specific vulnerable products are listed.
*   The article also mentions a potential for a denial-of-service attack due to a stack overflow in some versions of ClamAV during the processing of deeply nested multipart emails.
*   A workaround is suggested using a separate daemon to handle MIME decoding.
