{
  "CVE-2006-6253": {
    "description": "Cahier de texte V2.0 suffers from an SQL code execution vulnerability due to predictable backup file names and source code disclosure, particularly when register_globals is enabled.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from two primary weaknesses: predictable backup filenames (dump.sql) and source code disclosure in the `administration/telecharger.php` file.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Predictable backup filename (`dump.sql`).",
        "Source code disclosure vulnerability in `administration/telecharger.php` due to insufficient input sanitization.",
        "Lack of proper access controls on backup files.",
	"Use of `register_globals` which makes code vulnerable to variable injection."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can leverage these vulnerabilities to obtain sensitive information, including database credentials (host, database, username, password) and user passwords. This information can be used to gain unauthorized access to the application's data, and potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries against the database.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Direct access to predictable backup file (`/administration/dump.sql`) or through source disclosure.",
        "HTTP GET request to `administration/telecharger.php` with manipulated `chemin` parameter to extract database connection details.",
        "Direct connection to the MySQL server using the extracted credentials."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target server. They do not need any prior credentials or access to the system.",
       "additional_details": "The vulnerability can lead to SQL injection if an attacker gains access to the database."
