{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `readAA()` function in `read_aa.cpp` does not properly validate the length of data read from Audible.com files (.aa). It reads a 32-bit length value (`len2`) and uses it to read data into a fixed-size buffer (`tag`) of 100 bytes, leading to a buffer overflow if `len2` is larger than 100.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow",
      "Lack of input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "A buffer overflow allows an attacker to overwrite memory, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the user's machine.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local exploitation by loading a specially crafted .aa file in Winamp"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious .aa file to the vulnerable application (Winamp with ml_ipod plugin)."
