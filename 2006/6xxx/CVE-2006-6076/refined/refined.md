Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2006-6076:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by the incorrect handling of RPC requests within the Computer Associates BrightStor ARCserve Backup Tape Engine.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Improper handling of malformed RPC requests. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in how the Tape Engine processes incoming RPC requests, allowing for exploitation through malformed requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   A remote, unauthenticated attacker can execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges. This means a successful exploit gives the attacker complete control over the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Sending a malformed RPC request to port 6502/tcp on a vulnerable system. The vulnerability is exposed through the network service listening on this port.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to port 6502/tcp of the targeted system.
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated, meaning the vulnerability can be exploited remotely without any prior knowledge of system credentials.

**Additional details from the content:**

*   The vulnerability affects the BrightStor ARCserve Backup Tape Engine, a component used for managing tape drives in backup operations.
*   The vulnerability was reported by LSsecurity.
*   The vulnerability is addressed in BrightStor ARCserve Backup r11.5 Service Pack 2.
*   Mitigation can be achieved by restricting access to port 6502/tcp at the network perimeter.
