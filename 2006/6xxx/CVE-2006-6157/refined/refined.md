Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2006-6157:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of the `pageid` parameter in the ContentNow CMS version 1.39. This parameter is directly used in SQL queries without adequate input validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. Attackers can inject arbitrary SQL code through the unsanitized `pageid` parameter.
*   **Blind SQL Injection:** The provided exploit uses blind SQL injection techniques, which means the attacker doesn't see the direct output of the SQL query but can infer results based on response times. This is achieved using the `benchmark` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can extract sensitive data from the database, including administrator credentials (username and password).
*   **Full Database Access:** Through SQL injection, an attacker could potentially gain full control over the database, modify data, or even drop tables.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through an HTTP GET request targeting the `index.php` file of ContentNow CMS.
*   **Manipulated `pageid` Parameter:** The attacker modifies the `pageid` parameter in the URL, injecting SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server hosting the ContentNow CMS.
*   **Basic Knowledge:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL injection techniques and HTTP requests.
*   **Vulnerable Application:** The attacker needs to target a system running ContentNow CMS 1.39.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without any authentication.

**Additional Details from Exploit-DB:**

*   The exploit code is written in Perl.
*   It attempts to extract the username and password from the `cn_sessions` table, where `id=1`.
*   The exploit uses `benchmark` to introduce a delay, allowing it to infer if the injected SQL is executed successfully (blind SQL injection).
*   It iterates through characters (ASCII 32-127) to determine the admin username and password.
*   The exploit also takes the target host, target directory and an optional delay value as arguments.

**Summary**

The vulnerability is a classic SQL injection flaw due to insufficient input sanitization in the `pageid` parameter. An attacker can use this to extract sensitive information, including admin credentials, through blind SQL injection techniques. The attacker needs network access to the application but doesn't need authentication. The provided exploit shows how to automate the process of extracting the admin credentials through blind SQL injection.
