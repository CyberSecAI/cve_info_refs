How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: ELOG Web Logbook Remote Denial of Service Vulnerability
Date: Fri, 10 Nov 2006 11:29:28 +0530
```
Package: elog
Version: 2.6.2

We recently came across a Denial of Service vulnerability in ELOG's
elogd server which allows attackers to crash the service, thereby preventing
legitimate access.

We worked with Mr. Stefan Ritt of midas.psi.ch to fix the issue and
the fix has been made available in the website,
<http://savannah.psi.ch/websvn/log.php?repname=elog&path=%2Ftrunk%2F&rev=0&sc=0&isdir=1>

Attached is our security advisory which describes the vulnerability in detail.

We noticed that debian package of elog is also vulnerable. We would
like to go public with the advisory. Please let us know when you can
have the fix incorporated in your package.

A quick and positive response from your side would be highly appreciated.

Thanks,
OS2A

Distribution: unstable
Urgency: low
Maintainer: Recai Oktaş <roktas@debian.org>

Description:
 elog       - Logbook system to manage notes through a Web interface
Closes: [397875](bugreport.cgi?bug=397875)
Changes:
 elog (2.6.2+r1754-1) unstable; urgency=low
 .
   * New upstream release grabbed from Subversion (r1754), includes
     fixes for a bunch of security issues[1]:
     + Fixes from Ulf Harnhammar (Debian Security Audit Project):
       - There are some incorrect handling of *printf() calls and format
         strings. They lead to ELOG crashing completely, with the potential
         of executing arbitrary machine code programs, when a user uploads
         and submits as the first attachment in an entry a file called
         "%n%n%n%n" - or similar - which must not be empty.
       - There is a Cross-site Scripting issue when requesting correctly
         named but non-existant files for downloading.
       - There are also Cross-site Scripting issues when creating new
         entries with New. If a document sends data to ELOG where the fields
         Type and Category contain invalid entries with HTML code, the
         resulting error document will print the Type or Category data as-is
         with no quoting.
     + Fixes from OS2A team (credits go to Jayesh KS and Arun Kethipelly):
       - Remote exploitation of a denial of service vulnerability in ELOG's
         elogd server allows attackers to crash the service, thereby
         preventing legitimate access.  (Closes: #[397875](bugreport.cgi?bug=397875))
     [1] Leaving #392016 open for the reasons stated in that report.

Package        : elog
Vulnerability  : several
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2006-5063 CVE-2006-5790 CVE-2006-5791 CVE-2006-6318

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in elog, a web-based
electronic logbook, which may lead to the execution of arbitrary code.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:

CVE-2006-5063

    Tilman Koschnick discovered that log entry editing in HTML is vulnerable
    to cross-site scripting. This update disables the vulnerable code.

CVE-2006-5790

    Ulf Harnhammar of the Debian Security Audit Project discovered several
    format string vulnerabilities in elog, which may lead to execution of
    arbitrary code.

CVE-2006-5791

    Ulf Harnhammar of the Debian Security Audit Project discovered
    cross-site scripting vulnerabilities in the creation of new logbook
    entries.

CVE-2006-6318

    Jayesh KS and Arun Kethipelly of OS2A discovered that elog performs
    insufficient error handling in config file parsing, which may lead to
    denial of service through a NULL pointer dereference.

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.5.7+r1558-4+sarge3.

The upcoming stable distribution (etch) will no longer include elog.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.6.2+r1754-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your elog package.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

ELOG Web Logbook Remote Denial of Service Vulnerability
OS2A ID: OS2A\_1008 Status:
10/31/2006 Issue Discovered
11/08/2006 Reported to the Vendor
11/08/2006 Fixed by Vendor
11/10/2006 Advisory Released
Class: Denial of Service Severity: Medium
Overview:
---------
The Electronic Logbook (ELOG) is part of a family of applications known as
weblogs. ELOG is a remarkable implementation of a weblog in its simplicity of
use and versatility.
http://midas.psi.ch/elog/index.html
Description:
------------
Remote exploitation of a denial of service vulnerability in ELOG's
elogd server allows attackers to crash the service, thereby preventing
legitimate access.
The [global] section in configuration file elogd.cfg is used for settings
common to all logbooks. The vulnerability is due to improper handling of an
HTTP GET request if logbook name 'global' (or any logbook name prefixed
with global) is used in the request. When such a request is received,
a NULL pointer dereference occurs, leading to a crash of the service.
Only authenticated users can exploit this vulnerability if the application
is configured with password.
Impact:
-------
Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to crash the elogd server.
Affected Software(s):
---------------------
ELOG 2.6.2 (SVN revision 1748) and prior.
Debian package elog 2.6.2+r1719-1 and prior are also vulnerable.
Proof of Concept:
-----------------
The HTTP GET request given below is sufficient to crash affected server:
http://www.example.com/global/
or
Create a logbook [global\_xxx] or [global xxx] in elogd.cfg
and try to access it using a browser.
http://www.example.com/global\_xxx/
http://www.example.com/global%20xxx/
