How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# MPlayer: Buffer overflow — GLSA **200702-11**

A buffer overflow was found in MPlayer's RTSP plugin that could lead to a
Denial of Service or arbitrary code execution.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-video/mplayer** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.0\_rc1-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.0\_rc1-r2** |

### Background

MPlayer is a media player capable of playing multiple media formats.

### Description

When checking for matching asm rules in the asmrp.c code, the results
are stored in a fixed-size array without boundary checks which may
allow a buffer overflow.

### Impact

An attacker can entice a user to connect to a manipulated RTSP server
resulting in a Denial of Service and possibly execution of arbitrary
code.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All MPlayer users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-video/mplayer-1.0_rc1-r2"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## 2019-01-12, Saturday :: MPlayer is not dead yet! posted by compn

There are still a few developers who keep MPlayer compiling with ffmpeg changes.
As long as MPlayer compiles, I will continue to add codecs and maintain the codec lists.

If you have a sample video or audio codec file that is not supported by MPlayer,
[please let us know](http://trac.mplayerhq.hu/) (or email me).
I try to keep the
[video fourcc list](https://wiki.multimedia.cx/index.php/Category_talk%3AVideo_FourCCs)
and [audio twocc list](https://wiki.multimedia.cx/index.php/TwoCC)
up to date. As well as syncing codec support between
[VLC](http://videolan.org), [ffmpeg](http://ffmpeg.org) and MPlayer.

Have a happy 2019 everyone!

## 2016-11-08, Tuesday :: MPlayerx malware posted by compn

MPlayerX (a fork of MPlayer for OSX) was found to have malware bundled with its installer.

More information can be found at
[malware bytes blog](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2016/09/pup-friday-mplayerx/).

If you know of any updated MPlayer builds or GUI forks for Mac OSX, please let me know.
MPlayer OSX and MPlayer OSX Extended both seem to be abandoned. I recommend
Mac OSX users to use command line MPlayer, [VLC](http://www.videolan.org)
or [mpv for osx](https://mpv.io/)

## 2016-02-16, Tuesday :: MPlayer 1.3.0 released posted by the release team

MPlayer 1.3.0 "worksforme" is out.

Less than a month after 1.2.1, we're at it again.

MPlayer 1.3.0 is compatible with the FFmpeg 3.0.x releases and (at the time of
writing) with FFmpeg git.
The tarball already includes a copy of FFmpeg 3.0, so you don't need to fetch
it separately.

This release brings you some new codecs and formats, a lot of fixes, and many
cleanups. It also includes all the enhancements and speed-ups from FFmpeg;
check their changelog if you are curious about the details.

In addition to these, there were a lot of updates to accommodate the API
changes made in FFmpeg. Some were simple renames, but others were quite
invasive. None of them should have a user-visible effect, except maybe for
some corner-cases in the channel order for multichannel files.

If you see any regression from the previous releases, please report it on the
[mplayer-users](mailing_lists.html) mailing list or use our
[bug tracker](https://trac.mplayerhq.hu/).

So, which version should you use? Try this simple test.

* 1 Do you compile your own MPlayer?
  + If no, go to 5.
* 2 Do you want to use a system-wide copy of FFmpeg?

+ If no, go to 4.

* 3 Which version of FFmpeg do you have?
  + If it's 2.8.x, use MPlayer 1.2.x
  + If it's 3.0.x, use MPlayer 1.3.x
  + If you have an older version, you are on your own. Sorry
  + If you have a newer version, can I borrow your time machine?
* 4 Do you want the latest and greatest features?
  + If yes, use MPlayer SVN and FFmpeg git.
  + If no (why?), use 1.3.x unless you have a good reason to stay on 1.2.x.
* 5 You still have some options!
  + Use the version packaged by your distribution.
  + Look for a package on our [download page](dload.html).
  + Look for an updated package in the unofficial repositories for you distribution.

Starting from this release, MPlayer depends also on libswresample (part of
FFmpeg); the library is autodetected, and compilation will fail without it.

MPlayer 1.3.0 can be downloaded by
[HTTP (xz, 13 MB)](http://www.mplayerhq.hu/MPlayer/releases/MPlayer-1.3.0.tar.xz),
FTP (xz, 13 MB),
[HTTP (gzip, 20 MB)](http://www.mplayerhq.hu/MPlayer/releases/MPlayer-1.3.0.tar.gz) or

## 2016-01-24, Sunday :: MPlayer 1.2.1 released posted by the release team

Hey! A new release!

MPlayer 1.2.1 is a bugfix release from the 1.2 branch. If you're using MPlayer
1.2 you are encouraged to upgrade.

MPlayer 1.2.1 fixes many crashes with fuzzed files, squashes many bugs and
includes some compatibility enhancements. A lot of bugs are fixed also in
FFmpeg, you can check their changelog for details.

It's also easier to build this release with a system-wide version of FFmpeg,
since you don't need to copy internal FFmpeg headers anymore.

Mplayer 1.2.1 is compatible with the FFmpeg 2.8.x releases.
The tarball includes a copy of FFmpeg 2.8.5 (the latest at this date), so you
don't need to fetch it separately.

Just like 1.2, this version will not work with current FFmpeg master branch,
nor with the upcoming FFmpeg 2.9 (or 3.0, or whatever name will be chosen).

If you need to work with the latest FFmpeg, please use svn version.

If you're following the development from svn HEAD you can ignore this; all the
bug fixes are also included in the development version.

[HTTP (xz, 13 MB)](http://www.mplayerhq.hu/MPlayer/releases/MPlayer-1.2.1.tar.xz),

## 2015-10-03, Saturday :: MPlayer 1.2 released posted by the release team

FrameCounter

Our latest release was getting stale, so it's time to make a new one.

Mplayer 1.2 is compatible with the recent FFmpeg 2.8 release.
The tarball already includes a copy of FFmpeg, so you don't need to fetch it
separately.

Due to some big API changes coming to FFmpeg, this release will not work with
new FFmpeg master branch, nor with future FFmpeg releases.

If you want to follow the latest improvements in MPlayer and FFmpeg, you are
strongly encouraged to use Subversion HEAD and benefit from the latest
features and bug fixes.

You know how to do it. Because you aren't using a 3 years old release,
hopefully. If you are, read on and find out what you missed!

VDPAU hardware accelerated decoding now works for HEVC (if your card and
driver supports it).
Hardware accelerated decoding is now supported also on Os X via VDA.
VAAPI is still unsupported, but you can use it via VDPAU wrapper at least for
H.264.

A lot of new codecs, thanks to FFmpeg. The list includes HEVC, VP9 and Prores;
Opus, improved AAC and DTS decoders; WebP and JPEG2000; and many, many others.

Also rtsp streaming now uses FFmpeg by default, so you don't need any
additional library to use it.

For the full list of improvements and bugfixes check the FFmpeg Changelog
(note: not all features are available through MPlayer at the moment,
especially filters).

Many GUI improvements, both in functionality (eg. TV and DVB support) and
appearance.
If you use the GUI, be sure to grab also the latest version of your favorite
skin, or try a new one. You can get them
[here](http://www.mplayerhq.hu/design7/dload.html#skins).

The GUI now officially needs version 2 of GTK+ and GLib (compilation with older
version was already broken for quite some time).

Starting from this release, MPlayer no longer ships with an internal copy of
libdvdnav and libdvdcss. You can use the libraries provided with your
distribution, or compile and install them yourself. They will be autodetect
at configuration time.

If your distribution does not include libdvdcss you can usually grab it from
non-official repositories, or you can dowload the latest source code form its
[homepage](http://www.videolan.org/developers/libdvdcss.html).

The tarballs are compressed with xz, for compatibility with odd systems they
are available also with gzip compression.
Please get the xz variant if you can to save bandwidth.

## 2015-01-31, Saturday :: Fixing broken mp4 posted by Compn

Have an incomplete MP4 file that you cannot play? Try using this to fix it.
<http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/~ponchio/untrunc.php>

Maybe we can use this to make a more automated tool, one that automatically tests various standard resolutions to see if decoding passes or fails.

## 2015-01-31, Saturday :: Its a cold day... posted by Compn

Its a strange time in the open source world. Code contributions to the
[ffmpeg](http://www.ffmpeg.org) project include patches from Intel, MIPS Inc, AMD, Nvidia and very recently, MICROSOFT.

Has hell frozen over? Competing cpu, gpu and proprietary operating system companies working together on one open source project!

## 2014-06-01, Tuesday :: Playing Two Subtitles at Once! posted by Compn

A long awaited feature in MPlayer has arrived! Well, its still not possible in MPlayer to play two
subtitles at once. Maybe when -vf lavfi gets fixed up, then it might be possible to chain filters.
However there is now an open source project to merge two subtitle files together.

More information and the srt subtitle merging program for Linux, Windows and Mac can be found at
[DualSub](http://dualsub.sourceforge.net).

## 2014-02-09, Sunday :: trac.ffmpeg.org / trac.mplayerhq.hu Security Breach posted by beastd

The server on which FFmpeg and MPlayer Trac issue trackers were
installed was compromised. The affected server was taken offline
and has been replaced and all software reinstalled.

MPlayer SVN, releases, web and mailinglists are on other servers and
were not affected. We believe that the original compromise happened
to a server, unrelated to FFmpeg and MPlayer, several months ago.
That server was used as a source to clone the VM that we recently moved
Trac to. It is not known if anyone used the backdoor that was found.

We recommend all users to change their passwords.
**Especially users who use a password on Trac that they also use elsewhere,
should change that password at least elsewhere.**

## 2013-12-22, Sunday :: Bug Tracker moved posted by beastd

The MPlayer bug tracker was moved to the project server. The tracker software was migrated from
BugZilla to Trac. Big thanks to Moritz Bunkus for running the tracker for nearly a decade!

User accounts were preserved **but** you may need to

## 2013-05-05, Sunday :: MPlayer 1.1.1 update posted by the release team

For those of you sticking to the release version, we recommend to update to
1.1.1 to avoid security issues.
The tar file in the download section also contains the latest version of the
FFmpeg 0.11 release with many fixes of its own.

If you need a diff of only the fix itself, for example for old versions you still
want or need to maintain please use

svn di -c36242 svn://svn.mplayerhq.hu/mplayer/branches/1.1

## 2012-11-23, Friday :: MPlayer VAAPI posted by Compn

We would like to get MPlayer-VAAPI merged and need some developers to review and fix
up the codebase. Advanced help would be appreciated, please coordinate on mplayer-dev-eng
mailing list for more information.

## 2012-09-18, Tuesday :: SMPlayer adware posted by Compn

An MPlayer user notified me about the SMPlayer link that we had on our
download page. The SMPlayer installer was trying to install adware and
toolbars.

The MPlayer project does not condone adware/spyware at all. If you have
installed SMPlayer via the web installer, we urge you to uninstall all of the
spyware that may have been installed.

When I linked the SMPlayer installer , it was 8mb and contained nothing but
MPlayer and SMPlayer gui. The link had been changed and I failed to notice.
Any users affected have my sincere apologies.

## 2012-06-10, Sunday :: MPlayer 1.1 released posted by the release team

We gave up on 1.0

After a long pause, we decided that it might be a good idea to make
a new release. While we had our fun with the naming scheme with lots
of "pre" and "rc" it seemed time to move on and with everyone incrementing
major versions between weekly and monthly we hope to be forgiven for
jumping ahead to 1.1.

This release is intended to be compatible with the recent FFmpeg 0.11 release.
We hope it will be useful to distros and other users relying on FFmpeg 0.11.
Everyone else is encouraged to follow Subversion HEAD to always get the latest
features and bug fixes. You might still want to read the release announcement to
get a short summary of any bigger changes and improvements.

Among the bigger news is that we found a maintainer for the X11 gmplayer GUI,
so those holding out on it against our earlier recommendations will get a lot
of bug fixes.

There is also support for more subtitle types (Bluray, DVB, DVB closed-caption
for example), many improvements to -vo gl including output of 10 bit video,
very basic but usable OpenGL ES support and much better SDL support which
makes it a usable choice on OSX (particularly on older PowerPC variants much
faster than corevideo or quartz).
MPlayer will now also try much harder to handle intermittent network failures,
for example trying to reconnect.

As part of the code cleanup efforts, the internal libfaad2 copy has been removed
since the FFmpeg decoder is working well. Also the internal mp3lib copy is no
longer used by default since the many alternatives (FFmpeg, libmpg123, libmad)
avoid its recurring issues like incorrect decoding with newer compilers.
However it can still be forced at runtime for easier tracking of regressions.
Please do not rely on this since it will be removed in the future.
If you do not actually need it consider disabling it at compile time with --disable-mp3lib.

As a first for this release, the tarballs are available in two variants:
compressed with xz and compressed with gzip.
Please get the xz variant if you can to save bandwidth, the gzip version
is for everyone that cannot use it.
Should you never have encountered xz compressed files, newer versions of
tar can uncompress it via "tar xJf MPlayer-1.1.tar.xz".

MPlayer 1.1 can be downloaded by
[HTTP (xz, 11 MB)](http://www.mplayerhq.hu/MPlayer/releases/MPlayer-1.1.tar.xz),
FTP (xz, 11 MB),
[HTTP (gzip, 17 MB)](http://www.mplayerhq.hu/MPlayer/releases/MPlayer-1.1.tar.gz) or

## 2012-02-17, Friday :: Playing back BluRay discs posted by Compn

Correction

MPlayer does support encrypted BluRay playback, though not all steps
are handled by MPlayer itself. The two alternative methods use the
URL schemes bd:// (always supports decryption, but you need the key for each
and every disk in ~/.dvdcss/KEYDB.cfg and only works well with very simple
BluRays, similar to dvd:// vs. dvdnav://) and br:// (uses libbluray and
should support the same as VideoLAN in the link below but that is untested).

End correction

MPlayer needs some documentation on how to play encrypted discs. Patches are welcome.
VideoLAN users can
[follow the instructions here](http://vlc-bluray.whoknowsmy.name/)
| [Mirror](http://vlc-aacs.whoknowsmy.name/)

I have not tested, but it looks like it works on Mac OS X, Linux and Windows.
Thanks to whoever created this and hopefully no one will have to rip the discs to a hard drive before playing now.

## 2011-03-26, Saturday :: MPlayer is now Multi Threaded posted by Compn

Thanks to FFmpeg and its project in the Google Summer of Code program, we
now have multi threaded support for playing back H.264 and other codecs.

To enable threading run *mplayer -lavdopts threads=***N** file.mkv
where N is the number of threads you want to use.

You will need to have the latest SVN MPlayer for this. Please report any bugs
you find to our [Bug Trac](http://trac.mplayerhq.hu).

## 2011-01-30, Sunday :: MPlayer 1.0rc4 released posted by the release team

Yes, we can!

MPlayer 1.0rc4 continues the tradition of long overdue, but better late
than never releases. It has been tested thoroughly to work with the FFmpeg
0.6 branch. It will be useful to distros and other users relying on FFmpeg
0.6. To get the latest and greatest in features and bug fixes, Subversion
HEAD should be a better fit.

1.0rc4 once again adds a slew of new binary codecs and leverages all the
stuff added to FFmpeg. Notable additions are VP8 decoding, H.264 bug fixes
and speedups, unencrypted Blu-ray support. Network streams can now be played
through FFmpeg, there has been quite a bit of subtitle work and Ogg and
Matroska demuxer defaults were switched to libavformat. The window position
is now decided by the window manager.

Our constant efforts to clean up the codebase continue as usual. A ton
of compiler warnings disappeared and there have been refactorings all
around. External library copies have been synchronized with upstream.
The internal liba52 copy is gone and it is now possible to build against
external libmpeg2 and libmpg123.

MPlayer 1.0rc4 can be downloaded by
[HTTP](http://www.mplayerhq.hu/MPlayer/releases/MPlayer-1.0rc4.tar.bz2) or
FTP.

## 2010-11-11, Thursday :: Happy Birthday MPlayer! posted by Compn

A message from the creator of MPlayer, Arpi:

Hi,

It was exactly 10 years ago, that I've released first MPlayer version, v0.01:
<http://www1.mplayerhq.hu/MPlayer/old_stuff/releases/MPlayer-0.01.tar.gz>
Yes, f\*cking 10 years!!!! Nov 11, 2000... Time goes on so fast...

I want to thank you all for the contributions, patches, bugs, docs, testing etc.
Especially Michael Niedermayer, Fabrice Bellard and Nick Kurshev,
who made it to be the best & fastest open-source player!

And sorry Nick, I made a big mistake rejecting your multi-threaded patches.
Unfortunatelly your idea came too early, nobody (at least me) thought that
desktop PCs will ever have multiple CPUs... and now that even cheap notebooks
and netbooks have multi-core CPUs, it would be very useful for HD playback...

Also special thanks to Gabucino, Pontscho and LGB, for your support in the
early days, when everybody thought i'm mad, working on video player for linux...

A'rpi

ps: Albeu, i'll never forgive your playtree patches :)

## 2010-07-11, Sunday :: Call for Samples posted by Compn

Some work is being done to the MPEG subtitle code, but we need more samples of
DVB and VBI-coded teletext as well as other MPEG-TS/PS subtitles which currently
do not work in SVN or which work with -demuxer lavf but not with MPlayer's demuxer.

## 2010-06-06, Sunday :: Updates and workarounds posted by Compn

Just some random notes and changes.
In SVN the lavf demuxer is now default for Matroska files. We are trying to
fix the problems in it, so please report some
[bugs](http://trac.mplayerhq.hu) if you run into them.

If you just want to undo this change,
add the following to the end of your config file:

```

[extension.mkv]
demuxer=mkv

```

MPlayer now has the ability to use FFmpeg's network code to access streams.
Use mplayer ffmpeg://rtsp://example.invalid/stream.mov syntax to try it.

In general most users should be using SVN MPlayer, as rc3 is over a year old.

## 2010-05-30, Sunday :: MPlayer 1.0rc3 released posted by the release team

Godot has arrived.

1.0rc3 was intended to be rolled out over a year ago, but got delayed
again and again. Since it is designed to be compatible with the FFmpeg
0.5 branch, it will be useful to distros and other users still
tracking said branch. Thus we are now publishing it even though it is
outdated even before the day of its release. For general usage current
Subversion snapshots should be a better fit, as many bug fixes and new
features are available.

This release adds support for a ton of new binary codecs and leverages all
the stuff added to FFmpeg. Hardware-accelerated video output over VDPAU is
now possible, as is audio output through PulseAudio.
MPlayer now runs natively on 64bit OS X, the Wii and on OS/2.

We have switched to the libavformat MOV/MP4 demuxer to avoid maintaining the
duplicate MOV/MP4 code. This breaks binary audio/video codecs with MOV/MP4
files. Please use '-demuxer mov' if you still require the binary decoders.

Our constant efforts to clean up the codebase continue as usual. A ton of
compiler warnings disappeared and there have been refactorings all around.
External library copies have been synchronized with upstream.

There is no need to download binary codec packages if you already have an
older version. The codec packs have not been updated.

Note that this code is ancient, e.g. it still contains
[this](http://trac.mplayerhq.hu/ticket/1634)
long-fixed bug.
Unless you are at least deadly allergic to it, use latest SVN instead.

MPlayer 1.0rc3 can be downloaded by
[HTTP](http://www.mplayerhq.hu/MPlayer/releases/MPlayer-1.0rc3.tar.bz2) or
FTP.

Happy new year! Just a quick note, if you got some DVD's as a gift,
**mplayer -nocache dvdnav://** should play your new movies better than dvd://.

## 2009-11-01, Sunday :: Updates posted by Compn

MPlayer now supports most of the Blu-ray and HD-DVD codecs.
You can rip Blu-ray movies on Linux using
[this guide](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats/BluRayAndHDDVD).
There is also an untested patch for playing Blu-ray discs in
[this thread](http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?p=1327197)
at doom9.org.

MPlayer is also hosting the rtmpdump project.
[rtmpdump](http://rtmpdump.mplayerhq.hu) is a program to
download rtmp:// streams. It was previously hosted on SourceForge.

## 2009-02-20, Friday :: Video Acceleration and You posted by Compn

There are several ways to speed up the playback of 1080 H.264 files in MPlayer.

First is to use the newly added [VDPAU](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VDPAU)
output. It allows the newer
[Nvidia video cards](http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/VDPAU#Supported_Cards)
to decode the video without using much CPU. It is in SVN MPlayer
(Nvidia binary driver 180.37 or newer required), you can
find known bugs and report bugs
[HERE](http://www.nvnews.net/vbulletin/showthread.php?t=123819).
**(Linux, Solaris and FreeBSD only)**

How to get the SVN version is described on the [download page](dload.html#svn)
and [snapshot tarballs](dload.html#source) are available as well.

Second is to use MPlayer with the **experimental** multithreaded
[FFmpeg-mt](http://gitorious.org/projects/ffmpeg/repos/ffmpeg-mt)
branch, which allows you to use multiple cores/CPU. **(all OS and CPU supported)**

To enable threading run *mplayer -lavdopts threads=***N** file.mkv
where N is the number of threads you want to use.

**NOTE:** FFmpeg-mt has problems with packed b-frames.

A Windows build of MPlayer using FFmpeg-mt can be found at
<http://oss.netfarm.it/mplayer-win32.php>.

Third is to use the multithreaded [CoreAVC](http://www.coreavc.com/)
codec with the [CoreAVC-for-linux](http://code.google.com/p/coreavc-for-linux/)
project. The CoreAVC decoder costs $15 USD. **(Linux ONLY)(Windows users only need
this [PATCH](http://oss.netfarm.it/mplayer/patches/99_coreavc.diff))**

Fourth, [FFmpeg](http://www.ffmpeg.org) has added some optimizations
from the [x264](http://www.videolan.org/developers/x264.html) project.
To fully utilize these you will need to make sure a recent version of YASM
is installed and detected by the latest SVN MPlayer when compiling.

Fifth, using -lavdopts skiploopfilter=all:fast=1 may cause artifacts, but will allow
you to play larger files in realtime. **(all OS and CPU supported)**
(use -lavdopts skipframe=nonref:skiploopfilter=all:fast=1 for even more speedup,
skipframe also works with VDPAU.)

There is also a rejected
[PATCH](http://lists.mplayerhq.hu/pipermail/mplayer-dev-eng/2009-January/059868.html)
which adds support for the new multithreaded binary VC-1/WMV3 codec.

# xine-lib: Buffer overflow — GLSA **200612-02**

xine-lib is vulnerable to a buffer overflow in the Real Media input plugin,
which could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-libs/xine-lib** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.1.2-r3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.1.2-r3** |

### Background

xine is a portable and reusable multimedia playback engine. xine-lib is
xine's core engine.

### Description

A possible buffer overflow has been reported in the Real Media input
plugin.

### Impact

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by enticing a user into
loading a specially crafted stream with xine or an application using
xine-lib. This can lead to a Denial of Service and possibly the
execution of arbitrary code with the rights of the user running the
application.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All xine-lib users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/xine-lib-1.1.2-r3"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
