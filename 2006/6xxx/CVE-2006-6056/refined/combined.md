| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=217021#c0)  Marcel Holtmann    2006-11-23 08:07:45 UTC  ``` From MOKB-12-11-2006:  <http://projects.info-pull.com/mokb/MOKB-12-11-2006.html>  The ext2 filesystem code fails to properly handle corrupted data structures, leading to an exploitable denial of service issue when read operation is being done on a crafted fs stream.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=217021#c2)  Jason Baron    2007-01-10 19:26:40 UTC  ``` committed in stream U5 build 42.40. A test kernel with this patch is available from <http://people.redhat.com/~jbaron/rhel4/>    ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=217021#c4)  Mike Gahagan    2007-01-19 17:03:47 UTC  ``` I can verify that the fix here has at least improved things. With the fix, I get the same error. The ls process is killable after numerous attempts to kill it with sig 11 on the 42.0.7 kernel. I tried killing it for about 10 minutes when running the -42 kernel and never could kill it.     ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=217021#c5)  Eric Sandeen    2007-01-19 17:11:11 UTC  ``` Mike, the original problem cranked out these messages almost ad infinitum:  EXT2-fs error (device loop1): ext2_check_page: bad entry in directory #2: rec_len is smaller than minimal - offset=24576, inode=0, rec_len=0, name_len=0 EXT2-fs error (device loop1): ext2_check_page: bad entry in directory #2: rec_len is smaller than minimal - offset=28672, inode=0, rec_len=0, name_len=0 EXT2-fs error (device loop1): ext2_check_page: bad entry in directory #2: rec_len is smaller than minimal - offset=32768, inode=0, rec_len=0, name_len=0 EXT2-fs error (device loop1): ext2_check_page: bad entry in directory #2: rec_len is smaller than minimal - offset=36864, inode=0, rec_len=0, name_len=0 EXT2-fs error (device loop1): ext2_check_page: bad entry in directory #2: rec_len is smaller than minimal - offset=40960, inode=0, rec_len=0, name_len=0  With the fix, it should exit with an error with probably only one of these messages, at most.  Can you describe exactly how you tested  this  fix, you still say "the same error" - which error is that?  Thanks,  -Eric   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=217021#c6)  Mike Gahagan    2007-01-19 19:18:25 UTC  ``` Eric,  I was seeing the same "ext2_check_page: bad entry in directory #2:" messages pretty much continuously with 42.0.7, the one difference was I could kill the ls process (with some difficulty) . Once the ls process died, the messages stopped. With -42 I couldn't do anything to get the ls process to die.  I'll go ahead and run this one a bit more on a couple of other systems.     ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=217021#c7)  Eric Sandeen    2007-01-19 20:12:03 UTC  ``` Mike, did you see any messages such as... dir %lu size %lld exceeds block count %llu  those should have tripped if it was going through the new code I added to patch this up.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=217021#c8)  Mike Gahagan    2007-01-19 21:39:40 UTC  ``` with 2.6.9-43.EL I am getting:  ls: reading directory /mnt/testarea/: Input/output error [root@dhcp59-116 ~]# uname -a Linux dhcp59-116.rdu.redhat.com 2.6.9-43.EL #1 Wed Jan 10 19:47:46 EST 2007 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux dmesg is showing me: attempt to access beyond end of device loop0: rw=0, want=14696842024, limit=24576 EXT2-fs error (device loop0): ext2_readdir: bad page in #2  (above 3 lines per invocation of the ls command)  rebooting to re-try 42.0.7 once again.    ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=217021#c9)  Mike Gahagan    2007-01-19 21:50:20 UTC  ``` I'm getting a continuous stream of the following with the 42.0.7 when trying to get a directory listing from the corrupted filesystem. I wonder if the fix for this ever got into the 42.0.x patch pool. I'm going to look through the source in a bit.  EXT2-fs error (device loop0): ext2_readdir: bad page in #2 EXT2-fs error (device loop0): ext2_check_page: bad entry in directory #2: rec_len is smaller than minimal - offset=3237974016, inode=0, rec_len=0, name_len=0 EXT2-fs error (device loop0): ext2_readdir: bad page in #2 EXT2-fs error (device loop0): ext2_check_page: bad entry in directory #2: rec_len is smaller than minimal - offset=3237978112, inode=0, rec_len=0, name_len=0 EXT2-fs error (device loop0): ext2_readdir: bad page in #2 EXT2-fs error (device loop0): ext2_check_page: bad entry in directory #2: rec_len is smaller than minimal - offset=3237982208, inode=0, rec_len=0, name_len=0 EXT2-fs error (device loop0): ext2_readdir: bad page in #2 EXT2-fs error (device loop0): ext2_check_page: bad entry in directory #2: rec_len is smaller than minimal - offset=3237986304, inode=0, rec_len=0, name_len=0 EXT2-fs error (device loop0): ext2_readdir: bad page in #2 EXT2-fs error (device loop0): ext2_check_page: bad entry in directory #2: rec_len is smaller than minimal - offset=3237990400, inode=0, rec_len=0, name_len=0   sorry for jumping the gun on this one a bit too soon.   In summary, 4.5beta (2.6.9-43.EL) looks ok, 42.0.7 is still exposed.    ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=217021#c10)  Eric Sandeen    2007-01-19 23:29:02 UTC  ``` Ok, I diffed fs/ext2/ between the two kernels, and the difference here is that      linux-2.6.9-ext2-readdir-fpos.patch  is in 43 and not in 42.0.7  fuzzer tested kernels after that patch went in, so this is probably the first time we've seen the effects of fuzzed ext2 without -that- fix.  Short answer, we probably need linux-2.6.9-ext2-readdir-fpos.patch in the errata as well.  Thanks,  -Eric   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=217021#c16)  Red Hat Bugzilla    2007-01-30 14:44:03 UTC  ```  An advisory has been issued which should help the problem described in this bug report. This report is therefore being closed with a resolution of ERRATA. For more information on the solution and/or where to find the updated files, please follow the link below.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## SUSE Security

# A Process That Never Ends

### SUSE is committed to delivering best effort security to its customers and to the Open Source community. We believe that trust in Open Source Software security in general, and the user's privacy in particular, are both indispensable and indefeasible.

We treat software security as a process that never ends. This means we:

* Promptly react to security incidents and deliver premium quality security updates
* Continuously improve the security-related functionality in SUSE products
* Continuously contribute to the rapidly growing maturity of Open Source Software
* Respect the Open Source Software security principles of openness, transparency and traceability

Software security is a complex challenge. Software can provide many of its own security features, such as authentication methods, encryption, intrusion prevention and detection, and backup.

At the same time, it can also contain errors (both deliberate and accidental) that can affect the system's security, including design flaws, programming errors, and backdoors.

The SUSE Security Team addresses all of these aspects of software security, on an ongoing basis. Software security cannot be thought of as a state you can achieve at a specific point in time. Instead, it is a process that must be executed with professional expertise and continuous development. This persistent focus is what has given Open Source Software, Linux and SUSE such an excellent reputation for security.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=217011#c0)  Marcel Holtmann    2006-11-23 06:06:18 UTC  ``` From MOKB-14-11-2006:  <http://projects.info-pull.com/mokb/MOKB-14-11-2006.html>  Failure to handle mounting of corrupt filesystem streams may lead to a local denial of service condition when SELinux hooks are enabled. This particular vulnerability is caused by a null pointer dereference in the superblock_doinit function.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=217011#c1)  Eric Paris    2006-11-30 15:34:12 UTC  ``` Not an SELinux problem.  It's a problem in HFS return codes from failure.  Already fixed upstream by Eric Sandeen.  Will discuss which of us should own the local bug (we both know the fix just fine)   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=217011#c3)  Jason Baron    2006-12-13 19:19:12 UTC  ``` committed in stream U5 build 42.31. A test kernel with this patch is available from <http://people.redhat.com/~jbaron/rhel4/>    ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=217011#c4)  Jason Baron    2006-12-18 21:54:44 UTC  ``` committed in stream E5 build 42.0.4   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=217011#c6)  Mike Gahagan    2007-01-19 19:08:47 UTC  ``` verified using the MOKB hfs image.     ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=217011#c8)  Red Hat Bugzilla    2007-01-30 14:43:38 UTC  ```  An advisory has been issued which should help the problem described in this bug report. This report is therefore being closed with a resolution of ERRATA. For more information on the solution and/or where to find the updated files, please follow the link below.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=216958#c0)  Marcel Holtmann    2006-11-22 21:40:47 UTC  ``` From MOKB-07-11-2006:  <http://projects.info-pull.com/mokb/MOKB-07-11-2006.html>  Linux 2.6.x zlib_inflate function can be abused by filesystems that depend on zlib compression, such as cramfs. A failure to handle crafted data, result of a read operation in a corrupted filesystem stream, may lead to memory corruption. This particular vulnerability requires a filesystem (proof of concept for cramfs provided) to fail validation (ex. no integrity checking) of the binary stream in order to reach execution of zlib_inflate().   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=216958#c2)  Jason Baron    2006-12-13 19:05:07 UTC  ``` committed in stream U5 build 42.31. A test kernel with this patch is available from <http://people.redhat.com/~jbaron/rhel4/>    ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=216958#c3)  Jason Baron    2006-12-18 21:49:46 UTC  ``` committed in stream E5 build 42.0.4   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=216958#c5)  Mike Gahagan    2007-01-17 22:49:35 UTC  ``` verified with 42.0.6 using fsfuzzer   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=216958#c7)  Red Hat Bugzilla    2007-01-30 14:42:54 UTC  ```  An advisory has been issued which should help the problem described in this bug report.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

kernel security update (RHSA-2007-0014)

Original Release Date: February 16, 2007

Last Revised: February 13, 2009

Number: ASA-2007-063

Risk Level: Medium

Advisory Version: 6.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

The Linux kernel manages the communication between software and
hardware as
well as the hardware resources of a computer running the Linux operating
system.

Red Hat has issued an updated version of the kernel packages for
Enterprise
Linux 4. Below is a list of the security issues fixed in the update as
reported
by Red Hat:

* a flaw in the get\_fdb\_entries function of the network bridging
  support
  that allowed a local user to cause a denial of service (crash) or allow
  a
  potential privilege escalation.
* an information leak in the \_block\_prepare\_write function that
  allowed
  a local user to read kernel memory.
* an information leak in the copy\_from\_user() implementation on s390
  and
  s390x platforms that allowed a local user to read kernel memory.
* a flaw in the handling of /proc/net/ip6\_flowlabel that allowed a
  local
  user to cause a denial of service (infinite loop).
* a flaw in the AIO handling that allowed a local user to cause a
  denial
  of service (panic).
* a race condition in the mincore system core that allowed a local
  user to
  cause a denial of service (system hang).
* a flaw in the ELF handling on ia64 and sparc architectures which
  triggered a cross-region memory mapping and allowed a local user to
  cause a
  denial of service.
* a flaw in the dev\_queue\_xmit function of the network subsystem that
  allowed a local user to cause a denial of service (data
  corruption).
* a flaw in the handling of CAPI messages over Bluetooth that allowed
  a
  remote system to cause a denial of service or potential code execution.
  This flaw is only exploitable if a privileged user establishes a
  connection
  to a malicious remote device.
* a flaw in the listxattr system call that allowed a local user to
  cause a
  denial of service (data corruption) or potential privilege escalation.
  To
  successfully exploit this flaw the existence of a bad inode is required
  first.
* a flaw in the \_\_find\_get\_block\_slow function that allowed a local
  privileged user to cause a denial of service.
* various flaws in the supported filesystems that allowed a local
  privileged user to cause a denial of service.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned
the names
[CVE-2006-5751](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-5751),

[CVE-2006-5757](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-5757),
[CVE-2006-5823](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-5823),
[CVE-2006-6053](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-6053),
[CVE-2006-6054](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-6054), and
[CVE-2006-6056](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-6056) to these issues.

While this advisory deals with the kernel package from RedHat
Enterprise
Linux 4, the vulnerabilities in this advisory have been assessed against
currently supported versions of Avaya Communications Manager (CM). As
such,
some of the responses may include versions of Avaya Communications
Manager that
do not run on RedHat Enterprise Linux 4 or on a 2.6 series kernel.

CM 2.x and CM 3.0, which use a 2.4 series Linux kernel, are only
vulnerable
to the mincore race condition
([CVE-2006-4814](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4814))
listed above. As there is no known exploit for this issue and it would
require
someone with access to a user account on CM, Avaya has chosen to rate
the impact
of this ASA to CM 2.x and CM 3.0 as a Low Risk Level.

CM 3.1.x, which uses a 2.6 series Linux kernel, is vulnerable to all
of the
issues in this advisory including the potential privilege escalations in
the
get\_fdb\_entries issue
([CVE-2006-5751](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-5751))
and the listxattr-system-call issue
([CVE-2006-5753](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-5753))
listed above.

Avaya Messaging Storage Server has been marked as having a Low Risk
Level
as shell access is not available in an Avaya recommended default
configuration.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the
security
advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2007-0014.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with kernel installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya S87XX/S8500/S8300 | CM 2.x, CM 3.0,CM 3.1.3 and earlier, CM 4.0 | LowMedium | For CM versions 2.x and 3.0, upgrade to CM 3.1.4 or a later version in the 3.1.x series. For CM 3.1.3 and earlier releases in the CM 3.1.x series, upgrade to CM 3.1.4 or a later version in the 3.1.x series. For CM 4.0, upgrade to CM 4.0.1 or later. |
| Avaya Messaging Storage Server | MSS 3.x | Low | Upgrade to MSS 4.0 or later. |
| Avaya CCS/SES | SES 2.0 - 3.x | Medium | Upgrade to SES 4.0 or later. |
| Avaya AES | AES 4.0 | Medium | Upgrade to AES 4.0.1 or later. |

**Recommended Actions:**
For all system products which use
vulnerable
versions of the kernel, Avaya recommends that customers restrict local
and
network access to the server. This restriction should be enforced
through the
use of physical security, firewalls, ACLs, VPNs, and other
generally-accepted
networking practices until such time as an update becomes available and
can
be installed.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating
systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying
operating
system or applications that come with the operating system. These
vulnerabilities often do not impact the software-only product directly
but
may threaten the integrity of the underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not
affected by
the vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be.
Customers should determine on which Linux operating system the product
was
installed and then follow that vendors guidance.

## 4. Software-Only Products:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CVLAN | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. The CVLAN application does not require the software described in this advisory. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite(IMS) | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. The IMS application does not require the software described in this advisory. |

**Recommended Actions:**
Avaya recommends that customers follow
recommended actions supplied by RedHat Linux.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)
* [Ubuntu 5.10](/security/notices?release=breezy)

## Details

Mark Dowd discovered that the netfilter iptables module did not

correcly handle fragmented IPv6 packets. By sending specially crafted

packets, a remote attacker could exploit this to bypass firewall

rules. This has has already been fixed for Ubuntu 6.10 in USN-395-1;

this is the corresponding fix for Ubuntu 6.06.([CVE-2006-4572](/security/CVE-2006-4572))

Doug Chapman discovered an improper lock handling in the mincore()

function. A local attacker could exploit this to cause an eternal hang

in the kernel, rendering the machine unusable. ([CVE-2006-4814](/security/CVE-2006-4814))

Al Viro reported that the ISDN PPP module did not initialize the reset

state timer. By sending specially crafted ISDN packets, a remote

attacker could exploit this to crash the kernel. ([CVE-2006-5749](/security/CVE-2006-5749))

Various syscalls (like listxattr()) misinterpreted the return value of

return\_EIO() when encountering bad inodes. By issuing particular

system calls on a malformed file system, a local attacker could

exploit this to crash the kernel. ([CVE-2006-5753](/security/CVE-2006-5753))

The task switching code did not save and restore EFLAGS of processes.

By starting a specially crafted executable, a local attacker could

exploit this to eventually crash many other running processes. This

only affects the amd64 platform. ([CVE-2006-5755](/security/CVE-2006-5755))

A race condition was found in the grow\_buffers() function. By mounting

a specially crafted ISO9660 or NTFS file system, a local attacker

could exploit this to trigger an infinite loop in the kernel,

rendering the machine unusable. ([CVE-2006-5757](/security/CVE-2006-5757))

A buffer overread was found in the zlib\_inflate() function. By

tricking an user into mounting a specially crafted file system which

uses zlib compression (such as cramfs), this could be exploited to

crash the kernel. ([CVE-2006-5823](/security/CVE-2006-5823))

The ext3 file system driver did not properly handle corrupted data

structures. By mounting a specially crafted ext3 file system, a local

attacker could exploit this to crash the kernel. ([CVE-2006-6053](/security/CVE-2006-6053))

The ext2 file system driver did not properly handle corrupted data

structures. By mounting a specially crafted ext2 file system, a local

attacker could exploit this to crash the kernel. ([CVE-2006-6054](/security/CVE-2006-6054))

The hfs file system driver did not properly handle corrupted data

structures. By mounting a specially crafted hfs file system, a local

attacker could exploit this to crash the kernel. This only affects

systems which enable SELinux (Ubuntu disables SELinux by default).

([CVE-2006-6056](/security/CVE-2006-6056))

Several vulnerabilities have been found in the GFS2 file system

driver. Since this driver has never actually worked in Ubuntu 6.10, it

has been disabled. This only affects Ubuntu 6.10. ([CVE-2006-6057](/security/CVE-2006-6057))

Marcel Holtman discovered several buffer overflows in the Bluetooth

driver. By sending Bluetooth packets with specially crafted CAPI

messages, a remote attacker could exploit these to crash the kernel.

([CVE-2006-6106](/security/CVE-2006-6106))

After a standard system upgrade you need to reboot your computer to

effect the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the Ubuntu 6.06 and Ubuntu

6.10 kernel updates have been given a new version number, which

requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules

you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you

have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the

new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard

kernel metapackages (linux-386, linux-powerpc, linux-amd64-generic), a

standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.

# RHSA-2007:0014 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Important: kernel security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2007%3A0014)

## Topic

Updated kernel packages that fix several security issues in the Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 4 kernel are now available.

This security advisory has been rated as having important security impact
by the Red Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

The Linux kernel handles the basic functions of the operating system.

These new kernel packages contain fixes for the security issues described
below:

* a flaw in the get\_fdb\_entries function of the network bridging support

that allowed a local user to cause a denial of service (crash) or allow a
potential privilege escalation (CVE-2006-5751, Important)

* an information leak in the \_block\_prepare\_write function that allowed a

local user to read kernel memory (CVE-2006-4813, Important)

* an information leak in the copy\_from\_user() implementation on s390 and

s390x platforms that allowed a local user to read kernel memory
(CVE-2006-5174, Important)

* a flaw in the handling of /proc/net/ip6\_flowlabel that allowed a local

user to cause a denial of service (infinite loop) (CVE-2006-5619, Important)

* a flaw in the AIO handling that allowed a local user to cause a denial of

service (panic) (CVE-2006-5754, Important)

* a race condition in the mincore system core that allowed a local user to

cause a denial of service (system hang) (CVE-2006-4814, Moderate)

* a flaw in the ELF handling on ia64 and sparc architectures which

triggered a cross-region memory mapping and allowed a local user to cause a
denial of service (CVE-2006-4538, Moderate)

* a flaw in the dev\_queue\_xmit function of the network subsystem that

allowed a local user to cause a denial of service (data corruption)
(CVE-2006-6535, Moderate)

* a flaw in the handling of CAPI messages over Bluetooth that allowed a

remote system to cause a denial of service or potential code execution.
This flaw is only exploitable if a privileged user establishes a connection
to a malicious remote device (CVE-2006-6106, Moderate)

* a flaw in the listxattr system call that allowed a local user to cause a

denial of service (data corruption) or potential privilege escalation. To
successfully exploit this flaw the existence of a bad inode is required
first (CVE-2006-5753, Moderate)

* a flaw in the \_\_find\_get\_block\_slow function that allowed a local

privileged user to cause a denial of service (CVE-2006-5757, Low)

* various flaws in the supported filesystems that allowed a local

privileged user to cause a denial of service (CVE-2006-5823, CVE-2006-6053,
CVE-2006-6054, CVE-2006-6056, Low)

In addition to the security issues described above, fixes for the following
bugs were included:

* initialization error of the tg3 driver with some BCM5703x network card
* a memory leak in the audit subsystem
* x86\_64 nmi watchdog timeout is too short
* ext2/3 directory reads fail intermittently

Red Hat would like to thank Dmitriy Monakhov and Kostantin Khorenko for
reporting issues fixed in this erratum.

All Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 users are advised to upgrade their kernels
to the packages associated with their machine architecture and
configurations as listed in this erratum.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.
