  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `statistic.php` script in cwmCounter 5.1.1 is vulnerable to remote file inclusion due to the insecure handling of the `path` parameter.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include a malicious remote file into the vulnerable script. This allows for the execution of arbitrary code on the server.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `statistic.php` script, specifying a malicious URL in the `path` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have the ability to send HTTP requests to the target server, and needs access to a malicious file hosted on a reachable server."
