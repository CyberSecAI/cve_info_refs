{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to Remote File Inclusion (RFI) due to insecure handling of user-supplied input in the `index.php`, `print.php` and `download.php` files.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Remote File Inclusion (RFI) in `index.php` via the `exec` parameter.",
    "Remote File Inclusion (RFI) in `print.php` via the `print` parameter.",
    "Local File Inclusion (LFI) in `download.php` via the `dir` parameter."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include and execute arbitrary code from a remote server on the vulnerable system, leading to complete compromise. Also, local files can be accessed if LFI is exploited.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "By sending a crafted HTTP request to `index.php` with the `exec` parameter pointing to a malicious script on a remote server.",
     "By sending a crafted HTTP request to `print.php` with the `print` parameter pointing to a malicious script on a remote server.",
    "By sending a crafted HTTP request to `download.php` with the `dir` parameter pointing to a sensitive local file."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and host a malicious script on a server they control."
