Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities found in MyStats <= 1.0.8:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, leading to several vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **SQL Injection:** The `details` parameter in `mystats/mystats.php` is vulnerable to SQL injection.
2.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Multiple parameters, including `connexion` and `details` and `by`, are vulnerable to XSS attacks.
3.  **Full Path Disclosure:** The vulnerability in the `details` parameter allows for full path disclosure through an error.
4.  **Array Parameter Handling:** The application mishandles array parameters sent via GET requests to parameters `details` and `by` .

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:** An attacker could potentially manipulate database queries, gaining access to sensitive data, modifying data, or even taking control of the database server.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the application. This could lead to session hijacking, redirection to malicious websites, or other attacks against users of the application.
*   **Full Path Disclosure:** An attacker can learn the server's file paths, which can be used to aid further attacks.
*   **Array Parameter Handling:**  The mishandling of array parameters can potentially lead to unexpected behavior and can potentially be used to bypass security checks or trigger vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerabilities are exploited via HTTP GET requests by manipulating the values of the `connexion`, `details`, and `by` parameters in the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application, meaning they could be remote.
*   No special privileges are mentioned as being required for exploitation.
