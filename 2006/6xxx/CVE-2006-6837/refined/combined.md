| [vuln.sg](/)      | vuln.sg Vulnerability Research Advisory | | --- | | iso\_wincmd Plugin for Total Commander Buffer Overflow Vulnerability by Tan Chew Keong Release Date: 2006-12-30 Updated: 2007-01-02  [[en](isowincmd173-en.html)] [[jp](isowincmd173-jp.html)]  **Summary** A vulnerability has been found in [iso\_wincmd](http://www.totalcmd.net/plugring/iso.html) plugin for Total Commander. When exploited, the vulnerability allows execution of arbitrary code when the user opens a malicious ISO file.   **Tested Versions** iso\_wincmd version 1.7.3.3 (1.7.3 Beta 3) and version 1.6.10.  **Note:** Other products that uses the code of iso\_wincmd are potentially also affected. The vendors of these products have been notified and will be releasing fixes shortly.  This is **NOT** a Total Commander vulnerability. The vulnerability exists in the iso\_wincmd plugin, which is written by a third-party.   **Details** This advisory discloses a buffer overflow vulnerability in iso\_wincmd. The stack-based buffer overflow occurs when the plugin is constructing the full pathname of a file within an ISO image. This can be exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow and allows execution of arbitrary code.  In order to exploit this vulnerability successfully, the user must be convinced to open a malicious ISO image file using this plugin in Total Commander.  The buffer overflow occurs within the LoadTree() and ReadHeader() functions. The LoadTree() and ReadHeader() functions contruct the full pathname of each file in the ISO image by reading the directory entries within the ISO file. The directory name that is read from each directory entry is concatenated together using lstrcatA(), and finally with the filename. Subsequently, the constructed full pathname is copied into a fixed-length stack buffer using the unsafe lstrcpyA() function.  The length of each directory name is limited by the ISO format. However, it is possible create an ISO image that contains a file nested within several level of directories. This will create a full pathname that overflows the stack buffer, thus allowing the saved EIP and SEH handler to be overwritten.     **POC / Test Code** The following POC ISO file will exploit the vulnerability to run calc.exe or crash Total Commander when the **iso\_wincmd Plugin** is installed. The code execution POC has been successfully tested on English versions of WinXP SP2 and Win2K SP4 with Total Commander 6.55a.  * [isowincmdEXP.iso](removed.html) (exploits the overflow to run calc.exe on English WinXP SP2/Win2K SP4 with Total Commander 6.55a)* [isowincmdCRASH.iso](removed.html) (crashes Total Commander with iso\_wincmd Plugin via ReadHeader() overflow)   * [isowincmdCRASH2.iso](removed.html) (crashes Total Commander with iso\_wincmd Plugin via LoadTree() overflow)   **Instructions:**   1. Run Total Commander with iso\_wincmd Plugin installed. 2. Double click on the POC ISO file from within Total Commander to open it. 3. Successful exploit will crash Total Commander due to the EIP being redirected to the overwritten SEH handler.       **Suggested Fixes** Below are the suggested fixes for the vulnerability. You should thoroughly test the fixes to ensure that they do not break any functionality before using it. The suggested fixes should be used only as a temporary measure until the vendor releases a complete fix.  **NOTE: These suggested fixes are based on source code version 1.7.3.3 (1.7.3 beta 3).**  **1) Fix for ReadHeader() function**  Locate the following line (in **red**) within the **ReadHeader(HANDLE hArcData, tHeaderData\* HeaderData)** function in **iso\_wincmd.cpp** for version 1.7.3.3 (1.7.3 beta 3).  ```   Directory* directory = image->DirectoryList + image->Index; lstrcpy( HeaderData->FileName, directory->FilePath );   ```  Replace the line in **red** (above) with the 4 lines of code in **red** shown below. ```   Directory* directory = image->DirectoryList + image->Index; if(lstrlen(directory->FilePath)+1 > sizeof(HeaderData->FileName)) 	return E_BAD_ARCHIVE; else 	lstrcpy( HeaderData->FileName, directory->FilePath );   ```  **2) First Fix for LoadTree() function**  Locate the following line (in **red**) within the **LoadTree()** function in **iso\_wincmd.cpp** for version 1.7.3.3 (1.7.3 beta 3).  ```   if( codepage == CP_UTF8 ) 	lstrcpyn( directory.FileName, (char*)record->FileIdentifier, record->LengthOfFileIdentifier + 1 );              if( lstrrchr( directory.FileName, ';' ) ) 	*lstrrchr( directory.FileName, ';' ) = 0;  lstrcat( lstrcat( lstrcpy( directory.FilePath, path ), (path[0]) ?

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
