```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability is triggered by passing a large string to the `AllowScriptAccess` property of the `Flash8b` ActiveX object.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The Flash8b.ocx ActiveX control in Macromedia Flash 8 does not properly handle a very long string passed to the `AllowScriptAccess` property, leading to a denial-of-service condition.
- Impact of exploitation: A successful exploit results in a denial of service (DoS), likely crashing the application using the vulnerable ActiveX control (e.g., Internet Explorer).
- Attack vectors: The attack vector is through a malicious HTML page containing the vulnerable Flash ActiveX control, and a VBScript to exploit it. An attacker would need to lure a user to visit the malicious HTML page.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious HTML page and entice a user to open the page using Internet Explorer with the vulnerable Flash 8 ActiveX control installed.
