Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2006-6279:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Product:** @lex Guestbook 4.0.1
*   **Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Full Path Disclosure (FPD):** The application reveals the full server path.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to XSS attacks.

*   **Root Cause:**
    *   **FPD:** The application's error handling mechanism reveals the server's file path when an invalid skin parameter is provided. Specifically, when the `skin` parameter in the `index.php` URL is set to a non-existent value, the application exposes the full path.
    *   **XSS:** The application does not properly sanitize the input provided through the `skin` parameter in the `index.php` URL, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.
*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **FPD:** Sending a crafted HTTP GET request with an invalid `skin` parameter via URL to `index.php`
        Example: `http://[victim]/[guestbook_path]/index.php?skin=[non-existent_skin]`
    *   **XSS:** Sending a crafted HTTP GET request with a malicious script as the `skin` parameter via URL to `index.php`
        Example: `http://[victim]/[guestbook_path]/index.php?skin=[XSS]`

*   **Impact:**
    *   **FPD:** The disclosure of the full path can aid attackers in further reconnaissance of the server environment, potentially leading to other vulnerabilities. It can reveal directory structures and system information that should remain private.
    *   **XSS:** An attacker could potentially inject malicious client-side scripts that can execute in the context of other users' browsers when they visit the affected page. This can lead to session hijacking, defacement of the website, or redirection to malicious websites.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target web server, which typically means the attacker must be able to access the application on the webserver.
