{
  "CVE-2006-6698": {
    "Description": "GConf uses the directory /tmp/gconfd-$LOGNAME for storing a lock file even if GCONF_GLOBAL_LOCKS environment is not set. As the /tmp directory is sticky, it is possible for any user to create the directory with this name prior to first login of a new user, effectively preventing it from using GConf clients.",
    "Root cause": "GConf uses a non-unique directory name in /tmp based on the user's login name, which is predictable.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Predictable directory name in a shared location (/tmp)",
      "Lack of proper cleanup of temporary files/directories",
      "Inadequate error handling leading to user-unfriendly error messages"
    ],
    "Impact": "Local denial of service (DoS). Users are unable to use GConf clients, leading to problems with Gnome, Evolution, and other applications relying on it.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local attacker can create a directory in /tmp with the name gconfd-$USERNAME before the user logs in. This will prevent the user's gconfd process from starting up correctly leading to a denial of service.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Local user access with ability to create directories in /tmp."
  }
