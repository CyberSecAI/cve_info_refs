#### FAQ for Crystal Reports RPT Processing Vulnerability - CVE-2006-6133

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability**
The vulnerability exists in the way that Crystal Reports handles specially crafted RPT files, potentially allowing arbitrary code to be executed.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run code on the affected system.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted RPT file as an attachment in e-mail and then persuading the user to open the attachment. If the user opened the attachment in an affected edition of Visual Studio, the attacker could cause arbitrary code to run in the security context of the locally logged-on user.

**What is Crystal Reports?**

Crystal Reports is a software offering from [Business Objects](https://www.businessobjects.com/). Microsoft redistributes a custom version of Crystal Reports in certain editions Visual Studio .NET 2002, Visual Studio .NET 2003, and Visual Studio 2005.

**Why is this update for Visual Studio?**

The vulnerability addressed in this security update is for a version of Crystal Reports that is distributed with Visual Studio. Customers who install the affected editions of Visual Studio are potentially at risk and should update their systems.

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

  **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.

  1. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

  **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.
