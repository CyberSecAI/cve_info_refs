{
  "CVE-2006-6133": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability exists in the way that Crystal Reports handles specially crafted RPT files.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of malformed RPT files"
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to remote code execution, allowing an attacker to gain the same user rights as the local user. This could potentially allow the attacker to install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Sending a malformed RPT file as an e-mail attachment.",
      "Hosting the malicious RPT file on a compromised Web site."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker would need to craft a malicious RPT file and then persuade a user to open it with an affected version of Visual Studio."
  }
