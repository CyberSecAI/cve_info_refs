# Netkit FTP Server: Privilege escalation — GLSA **200611-05**

An incorrect seteuid() call could allow an FTP user to access some files or
directories that would normally be inaccessible.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-ftp/netkit-ftpd** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.17-r4** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.17-r4** |

### Background

net-ftp/netkit-ftpd is the Linux Netkit FTP server with optional SSL support.

### Description

Paul Szabo reported that an incorrect seteuid() call after the chdir()
function can allow an attacker to access a normally forbidden
directory, in some very particular circumstances, for example when the
NFS-hosted targetted directory is not reachable by the client-side root
user. Additionally, some potentially exploitable unchecked setuid()
calls were also fixed.

### Impact

A local attacker might craft his home directory to gain access through
ftpd to normally forbidden directories like /root, possibly with
writing permissions if seteuid() fails and if the ftpd configuration
allows that. The unchecked setuid() calls could also lead to a root FTP
login, depending on the FTP server configuration.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Netkit FTP Server users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-ftp/netkit-ftpd-0.17-r4"
```

Subject: Re: ftpd: Does not handle symlink? NFS? home directory
Date: Fri, 25 Aug 2006 08:52:03 +1000
```
A bit of testing indicates that the problem is not with the symlink
within the home directory path, but purely with it being hosted on
another machine via NFS: related to root_squash. The ftpd process,
while running as root before it sets UID/GID to the user logging in,
cannot access the home directory though should be able to stat() it:

root@asti:~# ls -l /users/amstaff/psz
ls: /users/amstaff/psz: Permission denied
root@asti:~# ls -ld /users/amstaff/psz
drwx------  46 psz amstaff 4096 Aug 25 07:50 /users/amstaff/psz

This guess verified with:

psz@asti:~$ chmod 755 ~     ### Now 'ftp asti' finds home directory OK
psz@asti:~$ chmod 700 ~     ### Back as it was, 'ftp asti' has problem

Seems that ftpd tries chdir() while still root, before setting UID:
surely it should set UID first, then chdir().

This seems a security risk. In the above scenario, I could arrange the
machine holding the home directory to return something that would
resolve to some normally inaccessible place like /root; and in fact
ftpd would then have that as my "current directory". (Annoying that
the final leaf cannot be a symlink; but if my home dir on asti was
/users/amstaff/psz/root then on pisa I could set /user/amstaff/psz to
by a symlink to /, so asti would resolve that as /root.) I do not know
what misdeeds I can do by having an otherwise inaccessible cwd.

Too little coffee?

Yes, the final leaf can be a symlink. This is exploitable when a user
can control the resolution of his home directory: when he also owns
the directory above (or for NFS mounts owns the machine serving it).

Can access objects that were protected with permissions of directories
above. Many users are in the habit of having world-accessible
subdirectories and files, because their home dir has safe mode 700.
I see many /root/bin directories with mode 755, protected by /root
being mode 700. Much more fun if /root/bin was mode 777...

Please fix. Please issue DSA.

Dear Maintainer,

Yes, the bug in the patch was mine: meant to check the return status of
setgid(getegid()) but somehow managed to mis-type that into
setgid(geteuid()). Stupid mistake. Shame on me.

Now, linux-ftpd_0.17-20sarge2.diff.gz was dated September 2006 as per
your latest "closure" message
<http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=384454;msg=44>
(or maybe 20 Nov 2006 as per
<http://www.debian.org/security/2006/dsa-1217>
or 13 Nov 2006 as the date on current
<http://security.debian.org/pool/updates/main/l/linux-ftpd/linux-ftpd_0.17-20sarge2.diff.gz>
) and contains the "wrong" patch.

So this seems fixed in etch 0.17-23 since 25 Nov 2006, but not yet in
sarge (==stable) 0.17-20sarge2. Please fix for sarge also.

Thanks,

I sent the fix to the security team, but they decided to ignore it.
I wasn't in the mood to fight with them... Feel free to contact them at
team@security.debian.org. You can Cc me if you want.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](#c0)  Carsten Lohrke (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-10-06 08:21:19 UTC  ``` From Paul Szabo <psz@maths.usyd.edu.au> via full disclosure:   Seems to me that ftpd does chdir(homedir) while root, before setting UID/GID to the user logging in. This creates difficulties if the home directory is on another machine via NFS with root_squash, and I guess is a security issue as in some cases you may get a current directory that would otherwise be inaccessible.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
