    "CVE-2006-6008": {
      "status": "RELATED",
      "details": {
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by an incorrect `seteuid()` call after the `chdir()` function in the Netkit FTP server (`net-ftp/netkit-ftpd`). This allows an attacker to potentially access normally forbidden directories due to a race condition of the chdir call happening before the user's UID is set.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Incorrect order of operations: The server performs a `chdir()` to the user's home directory while still running as root, before setting the user's effective UID using `seteuid()`.",
          "Unchecked `setuid()` calls: There were also potentially exploitable unchecked setuid() calls present in the code, which could lead to privilege escalation."
        ],
        "impact": "A local attacker could craft their home directory to gain access through the FTP server to normally forbidden directories like `/root`, potentially with write permissions. Additionally, the unchecked `setuid()` calls could lead to a root FTP login.",
        "attack_vectors": "A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating their home directory, especially when the home directory is hosted on an NFS share with root squashing.",
        "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have a local account with FTP access on the vulnerable system. They also need to be able to influence how their home directory is resolved, which might involve having control over the NFS server if the home directory is NFS-mounted."
