# [VIM] Helix Server LoadTestPassword Overflow

```
Has anyone had a chance to look at the buffer overflow in Helix Server
covered by Evgeny Legerov (<http://gleg.net/helix.txt>)? SecurityFocus
assigned it a new BID (23068) but it looks suspciously like the same
flaw covered by BID 21141 / CVE-2006-6026 from last November. The
earlier entries both are for the open-source Helix DNA Server while the
newer one is for RealNetwork's Helix Server. While Legerov's advisory
talks only of "Helix Server", it references a CVS commit message for the
open-source variant, which in turn cross-references BID 21141.

Oddly, though, the description SecurityFocus has for the earlier BID
says "The vendor refutes this issue, stating that the report is
unsubstantiated". Does this mean the vendor (whichever) simply didn't
have details for an exploit? Legerov claims to have notified the vendor
in December...

Btw, I've tested Legerov's PoC against both Helix DNA Server 11.1 and
Helix Server 11.1.2 on Windows; it crashes both so I suspect the answer
to my question is "yes".

# Helix Server 11.0.1 (Windows 2000 SP4) - Remote Heap Overflow

#### EDB-ID:

###### 3531

#### CVE:

###### [2006-6026](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2006-6026)

---

**EDB Verified:**

#### Author:

###### [Winny Thomas](/?author=469)

#### Type:

###### [remote](/?type=remote)

---

#### Platform:

###### [Windows](/?platform=windows)

#### Date:

###### 2007-03-21

**Vulnerable App:**

```
#/usr/bin/python
# Remote exploit for the vulnerability in Helix server v11.0.1 as described
# at http://gleg.net/helix.txt
#
# The exploit spawns a shell on TCP port 4444 and connects to it. At the time of
# overflow we control EAX which is used in a call as follows
# 00420C64: call dword ptr [eax + 4]
# ECX points into our buffer at the time of overflow. So if we can craft a DWORD
# that points to an address that translates to call dword ptr [ecx + xx] and
# have a pointer into our shellcode at that location then our shellcode executes
# Yes, a lot of indirection here :-). This exploit uses hardcoded address which
# worked fine on Windows 2000 server SP4 machines I have in my test lab. You may
# have to tweak it for your environment.
# Credits for discovery and POC goes to Evgeny Legerov
# Author shall bear no reponsibility for any screw ups caused by using this code
# Winny Thomas :-)

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

Evgeny confirmed in a private email that the issues (ie, BIDs 21141 and
23068) are the same.
