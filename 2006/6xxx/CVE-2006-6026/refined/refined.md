        "technical_details": "The exploit leverages a heap overflow in the server's handling of the 'LoadTestPassword' parameter in a DESCRIBE request. The exploit carefully crafts a payload to overwrite a return address, redirecting execution to shellcode that binds a shell to TCP port 4444. It uses hardcoded addresses specific to Windows 2000 SP4.",

    "summary": "CVE-2006-6026 is related to a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in RealNetworks Helix Server. This vulnerability, triggered via the 'LoadTestPassword' field in a DESCRIBE RTSP request, can lead to denial of service or remote code execution. Public exploits exist that demonstrate how to overwrite a return address and redirect execution to attacker-controlled shellcode. The vulnerability impacts various versions of the Helix Server, including the open-source variants. The root cause is an insufficiently validated size of data passed into the LoadTestPassword field resulting in a heap buffer overflow."
