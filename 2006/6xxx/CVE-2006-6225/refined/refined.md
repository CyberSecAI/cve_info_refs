```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The `$_CONF[path]` variable is not sanitized in GeekLog versions 1.4.0 and earlier. When `register_globals` is enabled in PHP, this lack of sanitization allows attackers to inject malicious PHP code by manipulating the `$_CONF[path]` variable in the URL.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability due to unsanitized user input and reliance on `register_globals` being enabled.
- Impact of exploitation: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to include and execute arbitrary PHP code from a remote server on the vulnerable system, potentially leading to complete compromise of the web application and server.
- Attack vectors: By crafting a malicious URL that includes the `_CONF[path]` parameter pointing to a remote malicious script. This can be done through various plugin files that include this vulnerable variable.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application, with the `register_globals` setting enabled on the server. They must also have access to a server hosting the malicious PHP script.
