Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2006-6777:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the Future Internet application. Specifically, it is vulnerable to both SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The application is susceptible to SQL injection attacks through the `categoryid`, `newsId` and `langId` parameters within the URL.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to XSS attacks through the `categoryId` parameter in the URL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **SQL Injection:** An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to the database, modify data, or extract sensitive information.
*   **XSS:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the web pages, which can lead to various impacts, including session hijacking, cookie theft, redirecting users to malicious sites, defacement, or stealing user credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **SQL Injection:** By crafting malicious SQL queries within the `categoryid`, `newsId` and `langId` parameters of the URL.
*   **XSS:** By injecting malicious JavaScript code within the `categoryId` parameter of the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to access the vulnerable web application.
*   No specific privileges are required, and the attacks can be carried out remotely through a web browser.

**Additional Details:**
* The vulnerable application is identified as "Future Internet," and the vulnerable paths are within the `index.cfm` script.
*  The reported examples show the usage of `Portal.Showpage` with parameters `categoryid`, `newsId` and `langId` to trigger SQL injection and `categoryId` to trigger XSS.
* The example URLs demonstrate the injection points for both vulnerabilities:
    *   SQL Injection: `http://www.example.com/path_of_script/index.cfm?fuseaction=Portal.Showpage&categoryid=[SQL]`
    *   XSS: `http://www.example.com/path_of_script/index.cfm?fuseaction=Portal.ShowPage&categoryId=<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>`
