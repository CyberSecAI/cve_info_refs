Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `downloaddetails.php` script in TorrentFlux 2.2 fails to properly sanitize the `alias` variable. This allows an attacker to specify an arbitrary file path.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The primary vulnerability is an LFI. By manipulating the `alias` parameter, an attacker can include and display the content of any file accessible to the web server user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can read sensitive files, including the `config.php` file which contains database credentials. This exposes sensitive information about the application and the database.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is performed by crafting a malicious GET request to the vulnerable `downloaddetails.php` script.
*   The `alias` parameter is used to specify the path of the file to be included.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server.
*   **Valid TorrentFlux User Account:** A valid user account is required to exploit this vulnerability, it is not available to non-users.

**Additional Details:**

* The provided exploit code demonstrates how to login to the application and then send a request to `downloaddetails.php` with `alias=../../config.php` to expose the database credentials
* The exploit also notes that an earlier version of the application was vulnerable via the `viewnfo.php` script with a similar path traversal issue, however that is a different vulnerability.
* The exploit notes that the `SecurityCleanPath()` function was modified to prevent null byte injection.
