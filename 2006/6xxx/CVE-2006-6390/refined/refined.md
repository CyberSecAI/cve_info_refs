  "CVE-2006-6390": {
    "related_content": true,
    "summary": "QuickCart 2.0 is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion through the 'config[db_type]' parameter in multiple PHP files.",
    "details": [
      {
        "vulnerability": "Local File Inclusion (LFI)",
        "root_cause": "The application includes files based on the user-supplied 'config[db_type]' parameter without sufficient sanitization, allowing an attacker to specify arbitrary local file paths.",
         "weaknesses": [
            "Improper input validation",
            "Unsanitized user-controlled parameter",
            "Direct inclusion of files based on user input"
          ],
        "impact": "An attacker can include arbitrary local files on the server, potentially leading to information disclosure or arbitrary code execution if they can include a file containing malicious PHP code, such as through a log file",
        "attack_vector": "HTTP GET request to vulnerable PHP files with a crafted 'config[db_type]' parameter.",
        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable application. No authentication or special privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability.",
        "vulnerable_code": "require_once DIR_CORE.'couriers-'.$config['db_type'].'.php';"
      }
    ],
   "additional_notes": [
        "The exploit code attempts to locate a readable HTTP log file, insert PHP code into it, and then include the log file to execute the inserted code.",
        "The exploit checks for disabled PHP functions (system(), exec(), shell_exec(), passthru()) and attempts to use enabled ones.",
        "The vulnerability exists in multiple PHP files: actions_admin/categories.php, actions_admin/couriers.php, actions_admin/orders.php, actions_admin/products.php, actions_client/products.php, actions_client/orders.php"
    ],
   "suggested_patch": "The suggested patch is to add a check at the beginning of every vulnerable file `if(basename(__FILE__) == basename($_SERVER['PHP_SELF'])) die();`",
    "exploited_parameter": "config[db_type]"
