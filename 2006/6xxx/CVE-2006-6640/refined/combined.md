Desc: SiteCatalyst Web Login Cross Site Vulrnabilities
Risk: Medium
Omniture, Inc aims its aperture at your Web site. The company provides Internet analytic software and services to corporate customers such as AOL, eBay, General Motors, and Microsoft. Omniture's primary product, SiteCatalyst, helps clients electronically measure Web site traffic, visitor activity, advertising effectiveness, and e-commerce transactions. Other products include the Omniture Discover, Data, and SearchCenter line of products, designed to provide customers access to all of their data in real time.
Login & Search Engines scripts affected
Vendor: www.omniture.com
Company Email: ir (at) omniture (dot) com [email concealed]
Proof of concept:
/search.asp?ss=[XSS]
Many sites running Omniture Web tools are almost certainly vulnerable to cross site scripting holes. We made a research and many big companies are using Omniture products (Microsoft included).
