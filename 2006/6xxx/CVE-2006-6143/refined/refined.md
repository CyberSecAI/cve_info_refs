```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Kerberos administration daemon (kadmind), and possibly other applications using the GSS-API or RPC libraries, could call a function pointer in a freed heap buffer or attempt to free an uninitialized pointer. This is due to bugs in the server-side portion of the RPC library. Specifically, the `SVCAUTH` structure might reside in uninitialized or freed memory, leading to a function pointer within it pointing to malicious or invalid code.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Use-after-free vulnerability: A function pointer within the `SVCAUTH` structure, after the memory it resides in is freed, can be called.",
    "Uninitialized pointer: The `xprt->xp_auth` pointer can be left uninitialized, causing issues when used later."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker can crash the affected application or execute arbitrary code with root privileges. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability in kadmind could compromise the Kerberos key database and host security.",
  "Attack vectors": "A remote attacker can send specially crafted RPC calls to the vulnerable service or kadmind.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable service. They do not need to be authenticated."
