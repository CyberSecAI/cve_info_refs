**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Malformed Pointer:** A specially crafted Word document can contain a malicious value that leads to an attacker-controlled destination address for a memory copy operation. This allows the attacker to overwrite arbitrary memory locations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system.
- **Denial of Service:** Exploitation could also lead to a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Word Document:** The primary attack vector is a specially crafted Word document.
- **Social Engineering:** An attacker needs to convince a user to open the malicious document. This is often achieved through phishing emails or compromised websites.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Create Malicious Documents:** The attacker must be able to create a Word document with the specially crafted data to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Social Engineering Skills:** The attacker needs to entice the victim to open the malicious document.

**Additional Information:**
- **Publicly Available Exploit Code:** Exploit code for this vulnerability is publicly available, which increases the risk of exploitation.
- **Affected Software:**  Microsoft Word and also OpenOffice.org were vulnerable.
- **Mitigation:** Microsoft released a security bulletin (MS07-014) with patches to address the issue, users were also advised to avoid opening untrusted documents and to take steps to disable automatic opening of office documents.
