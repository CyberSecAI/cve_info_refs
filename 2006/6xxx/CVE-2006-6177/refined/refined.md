CVE-2006-6177: Seditio <= 1.10 Remote SQL Injection Vulnerability
  - Root cause of vulnerability: Improper sanitization of the 'id' parameter in the users.profile.inc.php file. The parameter is used in a SQL query after being processed with urldecode(), which allows attackers to bypass input validation mechanisms.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities: SQL Injection vulnerability.
  - Impact of exploitation: An attacker can manipulate SQL queries and change data in Seditio's user database, potentially leading to account compromise and privilege escalation.
  - Attack vectors: The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted GET request to the users.php page with the 'm=profile', 'a=avatarselect', and a malicious 'id' parameter.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker must be logged in to Seditio to exploit the vulnerability.
