```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability lies in the insecure inclusion of a file within the 'displayCategory.php' script of the myPHPNuke My_eGallery module. The 'basepath' variable is directly included in the 'include()' function without proper sanitization.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The primary vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability. The script takes an external input through the 'basepath' GET parameter and uses it to include an arbitrary PHP file.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by injecting a malicious PHP script through the 'basepath' parameter, which will be executed by the server. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to complete compromise of the system.
- Attack vectors: The attack vector is the 'displayCategory.php' script which is reachable via HTTP GET requests, specifically targeting the 'basepath' parameter.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. They do not need any authenticated access, and can perform the attack from a remote location.
