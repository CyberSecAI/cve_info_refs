{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the `language.php` script. It allows an attacker to include arbitrary files from the local system or from a remote FTP server under certain conditions.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Local File Inclusion (LFI)",
      "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)",
	  "Lack of input sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary code by including a malicious file, leading to complete compromise of the server. Additionally, they can disclose sensitive information by reading local files.",
    "attack_vectors": "By sending a crafted GET request to `language.php` with the `pa_lang[include_file]` parameter, an attacker can specify a file to include.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. For local file inclusion, no specific authentication is required. For remote file inclusion, the server must have `register_globals` set to `On` and `allow_url_fopen` set to `On` or be exploitable through an alternative method, such as log poisoning."
  },
  "additional_information": {
      "exploit_details": "The provided exploit code demonstrates how to inject PHP code into web server logs using a crafted user agent, then use the LFI vulnerability to execute the injected code by including the log file. This also shows how to perform remote file inclusion by including a translation file from an ftp server.",
      "affected_versions": "phpAlbum version 0.4.1 Beta 6 and possibly earlier versions are affected."
