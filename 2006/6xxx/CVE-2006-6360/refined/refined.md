  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "source": "www.exploit-db.com_1328868e_20250125_121605.html",
      "root_cause": "The application is vulnerable to local and remote file inclusion due to insecure handling of user-supplied parameters.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Local File Inclusion (LFI): The `activate.php` script includes a file based on the `$language` parameter without proper sanitization.",
        "Remote File Inclusion (RFI): The `activate.php` script also includes a file based on the `$footerpage` parameter without proper sanitization.",
        "Lack of Input Validation: User-supplied parameters such as `language` and `footerpage` are not validated before being used in `require` or `include` statements."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server. This can lead to complete compromise of the server, data theft, or further attacks on other systems.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "By manipulating the `language` parameter in the URL, an attacker can include local files present on the server.",
        "By manipulating the `footerpage` parameter in the URL, an attacker can include remote files hosted on a malicious server."
      ],
        "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target web server."
