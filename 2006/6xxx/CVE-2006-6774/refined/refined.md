{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application includes files based on a user-supplied path without proper sanitization.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include arbitrary files from a remote server, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the server running the vulnerable application.",
  "Attack vectors": "By manipulating the 'path' parameter in the URL, an attacker can include a malicious file from a remote server.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. They also need access to a web server where they can host malicious PHP code."
