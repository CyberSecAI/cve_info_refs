How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2006-75

## RSS Feed-preview referrer leak

Announced
December 19, 2006
Reporter
Jared Breland
Impact
Low
Products
Firefox
Fixed in

* Firefox 2.0.0.1

### Description

Jared Breland reported on LEGROOM.net that when the new "Feed Preview" feature
in Firefox 2.0 retrieves the icons of the installed web-based feed viewers it
is potentially informing those services of your feed-browsing habits by
sending the URL of the feed in a referrer header with each icon request.

This was an oversight and has been fixed in Firefox 2.0.0.1

### Workaround

# Mozilla Firefox: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200701-02**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in Mozilla Firefox, some of
which may allow the remote execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-client/mozilla-firefox** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.5.0.9** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.5.0.9** |

| Package | **www-client/mozilla-firefox-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.5.0.9** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.5.0.9** |

### Background

Mozilla Firefox is a popular open-source web browser from the Mozilla
Project.

### Description

An anonymous researcher found evidence of memory corruption in the way
Mozilla Firefox handles certain types of SVG comment DOM nodes.
Additionally, Frederik Reiss discovered a heap-based buffer overflow in
the conversion of a CSS cursor. Other issues with memory corruption
were also fixed. Mozilla Firefox also contains less severe
vulnerabilities involving JavaScript and Java.

### Impact

An attacker could entice a user to view a specially crafted web page
that will trigger one of the vulnerabilities, possibly leading to the
execution of arbitrary code. It is also possible for an attacker to
perform cross-site scripting attacks, leading to the exposure of
sensitive information, like user credentials.

### Workaround

There are no known workarounds for all the issues at this time.

### Resolution

All Mozilla Firefox users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-1.5.0.9"
```

All Mozilla Firefox binary release users should upgrade to the latest
version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-bin-1.5.0.9"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Just setting the image of a menuitem is apparently sending a referer when getting that image, which may be ok in the general context of a xul menu.
In the context of feed preview though, it sends the URL of the users feed to the service, at least when that service manages to not get his favicon cached.
We should fix that, maybe by hooking a loader object in the middle explicitly and use data urls, or just a x-no-referer protocol or so.

Does this patch also fix the cookie issue, so cookies aren't shared for this request, and so if you have the "ask me every time a site tries to set a cookie" option set you won't see the dialog?
Is it ok to treat all favicon.ico files as image/x-icon, ignoring the mime type sent by the server? I'm guessing imagelib sniffs anyway.

<http://www.legroom.net/modules.php?op=modload&name=News&file=article&sid=215> says:
"I find it very odd that Firefox 2.0 loads the Google favicon, and only the Google favicon, remotely for the Feed Preview page, when the favicons for three other services displayed in the same page are loaded locally."
Do we know why he saw that behavior? To me it looks like the code loads favicon.ico remotely from all the services.

Jesse, I'm the one that posted the information on legroom. No, I don't know why Google was the only site I saw that exhibited this behavior. It was confirmed to happen for Yahoo as well according to the Heise article and another Firefox user that had e-mailed me privately over the weekend, but I haven't had the time to look into it any further myself. It may very well load the icon from all other servers, though for whatever reason in the few test cases I tried on my system I only saw traffic going to Google.
If you'd like I'd be happy to test further and see what I can find. I see a lot of big names already included on the comments in this bug, though, so I'm not sure how much information I could add at this point, but I'm certainly willing to help. Just let me know.

ios is now unused (and the one in \_getContainer too).
Note that <http://bonsai.mozilla.org/cvsblame.cgi?file=mozilla/netwerk/protocol/http/src/nsHttpChannel.cpp&rev=1.296&mark=3820#3810> asks your notificationCallbacks object for nsIPrompt, which it currently doesn't implement, so an exception is thrown (from QI). Since that code doesn't seem to actually do anything with the prompt (why does SetCookieStringFromHttp have an aPrompt argument that it doesn't use?) you can probably just get away with adding nsIPrompt to your QI to silence the warning.
Copying this code over really sucks, but I can't think of a better solution :(

Also note that this patch doesn't fix the fact that the cookie is sent with the response - we could fix that using the technique described at <http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Creating_Sandboxed_HTTP_Connections#Handling_cookies> to avoid receiving or sending cookies for these requests.
Perhaps Darin or biesi could answer the question in [comment 11](/show_bug.cgi?id=358878#c11 "RESOLVED FIXED - Feed preview's request for favicon.ico should not send Referer"), or provide any suggestions for fixing this another way.

No, I meant the question about SetCookieStringFromHttp having an aPrompt argument that it doesn't use (though if you have other suggestions for a better solution I'm all ears :). I hadn't realized that it was a public interface, I guess that explains it.

Jared B. or anyone else that is able: Could you please help us verify this fix? Please retest with the latest "-mozilla1.8/" nightly build from <http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/> and let us know if things work better for you. Please replace "fixed1.8.1.1" with the "verified1.8.1.1" keyword if everything look good. Thanks!

There's no reason to call splice in the base64 encoder -- it mutates the array gratuitously, and at linear cost, which compounds quadratically. Walking an index through the array is much, much cheaper. If this.\_bytes needs to be truncated at the end of the b64 function, then that can be done once by setting length to 0.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
