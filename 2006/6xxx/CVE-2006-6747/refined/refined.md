**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper input sanitization in the `show_news.php` and `add_comment.php` files of Xt-News 0.1.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The `show_news.php` file is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `id_news` parameter.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The `add_comment.php` and `show_news.php` files are vulnerable to XSS via the `id_news` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*  **XSS:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the web pages viewed by other users, which could be used to steal session cookies or perform other malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The attack vector is the `id_news` parameter in `show_news.php`.
*   **XSS:** The attack vectors are the `id_news` parameters in `add_comment.php` and `show_news.php`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application and manipulate the `id_news` parameter in the URLs.
*   No special privileges are required, as this is a web based vulnerability that is exploitable remotely.
