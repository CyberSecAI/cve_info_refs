{
  "CVE-2006-6535": {
    "description": "A flaw exists in the dev_queue_xmit function of the network subsystem. Specifically, the function has an unbalanced local_bh_enable() call, which can lead to data corruption or system lockups.",
    "root_cause": "The `dev_queue_xmit` function in the Linux kernel has an error path where the `local_bh_enable()` function is called without a corresponding `local_bh_disable()` call, leading to an unbalanced state.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unbalanced `local_bh_enable()` call",
      "Incorrect error handling in network subsystem"
    ],
    "impact": "Data corruption, system lockups, or denial of service can occur due to the unbalanced `local_bh_enable()` call.",
     "attack_vector": "Local exploitation through the network subsystem.",
    "required_capabilities": "Local user with the ability to trigger network operations.",
    "additional_notes": "The vulnerability is present in the Linux kernel and was addressed in the RHSA-2007:0014 security update."
