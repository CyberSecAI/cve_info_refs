{
  "CVE-2006-6277": {
    "Description": "Directory traversal vulnerability in admin/FileServer.php in ContentServ 4.x allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files via a .. (dot dot) in the src parameter, a different vector than CVE-2005-3086.",
    "Root cause": "The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the 'src' parameter of the 'FileServer.php' script, allowing directory traversal.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Directory traversal",
      "Insufficient input validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server. Confidentiality is impacted, but integrity and availability are not.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "HTTP GET request to vulnerable script",
      "manipulation of the 'src' parameter"
     ],
    "Required capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No authentication is required for exploitation."
  }
