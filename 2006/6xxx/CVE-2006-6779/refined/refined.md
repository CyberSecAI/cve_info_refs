{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vBulletin forum software allows users to upload files, including SWF files. The software does not sanitize SWF files containing ActionScript, leading to execution of malicious code when the SWF is viewed.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
      "Unsanitized file uploads",
      "Lack of input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the context of the victim's browser by exploiting the uploaded SWF file. This can lead to session hijacking (cookie theft), arbitrary actions on the forum on behalf of the victim, and other malicious activities.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Upload a crafted SWF file with embedded malicious JavaScript through the forum's attachment feature."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to upload a malicious SWF file to the forum. This may require a valid account on the forum but does not require administrative privileges."
  },
  "additional_details": {
      "exploit_description": "The exploit involves creating an SWF file with a specific ActionScript payload that, when executed, retrieves the user's cookie and sends it to an attacker-controlled server. The attacker can then use the stolen cookie to impersonate the user.",
      "attack_steps": [
        "Create a malicious SWF file with ActionScript that sends the user's cookies to the attacker's server.",
        "Upload the SWF file to the vBulletin forum as an attachment.",
         "Victim views the malicious SWF file attached to a post. The ActionScript executes in the victim's browser, stealing cookies.",
         "Attacker receives the user's cookie and can use it to impersonate the user."
