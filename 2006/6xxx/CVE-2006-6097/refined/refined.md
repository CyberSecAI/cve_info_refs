{
  "CVE-2006-6097": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper handling of symlinks within the GNUTYPE_NAMES record type in tar archives.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Directory traversal vulnerability via specially crafted tar archives.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary file overwrite with the permissions of the user running tar, potentially leading to privilege escalation if run as root or the modification of user configuration files.",
      "Attack vectors": "Maliciously crafted tar archive. An attacker would need to trick the user into extracting this archive.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Ability to create a tar archive with a crafted GNUTYPE_NAMES record and convince a user to extract it."
    },
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The tar program does not properly check the target of symlinks when extracting archives using the GNUTYPE_NAMES record name, which allows for directory traversal.",
       "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present":"Directory traversal vulnerability due to improper handling of symlinks.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can overwrite arbitrary files by enticing a user to extract a specially crafted tar archive. When a symlink is encountered and extracted it points to an arbitrary location, which will be used to extract subsequent files in the tar archive.",
      "Attack vectors": "A specially crafted tar archive with malicious symlinks.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker must be able to create a malicious tar archive and trick a user into extracting it."
    },
  {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "Lack of proper sanity checks when creating symlinks using the GNUTYPE_NAMES tar extension, leading to absolute symlinks.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Directory traversal, ability to overwrite arbitrary files.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can overwrite arbitrary files with the permissions of the user running gtar by tricking a user into extracting a specially crafted tar archive.",
      "Attack vectors": "Specially crafted tar archive with absolute symlinks created using the 'GNUTYPE_NAMES' extension.",
       "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to create and deliver malicious tar archive and trick a user into extracting it."
