# AMD64 x86 emulation Sun's J2SE Development Kit: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200702-08**

Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities have been identified in Sun Java
Development Kit (JDK) and Sun Java Runtime Environment (JRE).

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-emulation/emul-linux-x86-java** on the amd64 architecture |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.5.0.10** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.5.0.10**revision >= **1.4.2.19** |

### Background

The Sun Java Development Kit (JDK) and the Sun Java Runtime Environment
(JRE) provide the Sun Java platform. The x86 emulation Sun's J2SE
Development Kit for AMD64 contains a vulnerable version of Sun's JDK.

### Description

Chris Evans has discovered multiple buffer overflows in Sun JDK and Sun
JRE possibly related to various AWT or font layout functions. Tom
Hawtin has discovered an unspecified vulnerability in Sun JDK and Sun
JRE relating to unintended applet data access. He has also discovered
multiple other unspecified vulnerabilities in Sun JDK and Sun JRE
allowing unintended Java applet or application resource acquisition.
Additionally, a memory corruption error has been found in the handling
of GIF images with zero width field blocks.

### Impact

An attacker could entice a user to run a specially crafted Java applet
or application that could read, write, or execute local files with the
privileges of the user running the JVM, access data maintained in other
Java applets, or escalate the privileges of the currently running Java
applet or application allowing for unauthorized access to system
resources.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All AMD64 x86 emulation Sun's J2SE Development Kit users should upgrade
to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-emulation/emul-linux-x86-java-1.5.0.10"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Blackdown Java: Applet privilege escalation — GLSA **200705-20**

The Blackdown JDK and the Blackdown JRE suffer from the multiple
unspecified vulnerabilities that already affected the Sun JDK and JRE.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-java/blackdown-jdk** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.4.2.03-r14** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.4.2.03-r14** |

| Package | **dev-java/blackdown-jre** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.4.2.03-r14** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.4.2.03-r14** |

### Background

Blackdown provides implementations of the Java Development Kit (JDK)
and the Java Runtime Environment (JRE).

### Description

Chris Evans has discovered multiple buffer overflows in the Sun JDK and
the Sun JRE possibly related to various AWT and font layout functions.
Tom Hawtin has discovered an unspecified vulnerability in the Sun JDK
and the Sun JRE relating to unintended applet data access. He has also
discovered multiple other unspecified vulnerabilities in the Sun JDK
and the Sun JRE allowing unintended Java applet or application resource
acquisition. Additionally, a memory corruption error has been found in
the handling of GIF images with zero width field blocks.

### Impact

An attacker could entice a user to run a specially crafted Java applet
or application that could read, write, or execute local files with the
privileges of the user running the JVM, access data maintained in other
Java applets, or escalate the privileges of the currently running Java
applet or application allowing for unauthorized access to system
resources.

### Workaround

Disable the "nsplugin" USE flag in order to prevent web applets from
being run.

### Resolution

Since there is no fixed update from Blackdown and since the flaw only
occurs in the applets, the "nsplugin" USE flag has been masked in the
portage tree. Emerge the ebuild again in order to fix the
vulnerability. Another solution is to switch to another Java
implementation such as the Sun implementation (dev-java/sun-jdk and
dev-java/sun-jre-bin).

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "dev-java/blackdown-jdk"
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "dev-java/blackdown-jre"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Sun Java JRE vulnerable to arbitrary code execution via an unspecified error

#### Vulnerability Note VU#939609

Original Release Date: 2007-01-09 | Last Revised: 2007-02-20

---

### Overview

A vulnerability in the Sun Java Runtime Environment may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.

### Description

| The Sun Java Runtime Environment ([JRE](http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/download.html)) allows users to run [Java](http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/) applications in a browser or as standalone programs. Sun has made the JRE available for multiple operating systems.  Per Sunsolve Document ID [102729](http://sunsolve.sun.com/search/document.do?assetkey=1-26-102729-1):*Two buffer overflow vulnerabilities in the Java Runtime Environment may independently allow an untrusted applet to elevate its privileges. For example, an applet may grant itself permissions to read and write local files or execute local applications that are accessible to the user running the untrusted applet.* |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade**  Sun has released an upgrade to address this issue. See Sunsolve Document ID [102729](http://sunsolve.sun.com/search/document.do?assetkey=1-26-102729-1) for more details. To adjust the JRE update settings, see the [update](http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/deployment/deployment-guide/jcp.html#update) section of the Java deployment guide. |
| --- |

| **Disable Java**Disabling the Java browser plugin may prevent a malicious webpage from exploiting this vulnerability. See the [Securing Your Web Browser](http://www.us-cert.gov/reading_room/securing_browser/) for instructions on how to disable Java in your browser. |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

CESA-2005-008 - rev 2
My other vulnerabilities may be seen at http://scary.beasts.org/security
Sun JDK sandbox escape via native code vulnerabilities
======================================================
Programs affected: Sun's JDK, (v1.5.0\_02-b09)
Severity: Arbitrary code execution despite sandbox rules.
Vendor response / fix: http://sunsolve.sun.com/search/document.do?assetkey=1-26-102729-1
Background
----------
The Java environment offers powerful sandboxing which restricts what executing
Java code is permitted to do, for example when running as an applet inside a
browser.
An achilles heel exists in the security of this sandboxing: vulnerabilities in
native code shipped with the JVM. By suppling malicious data to classes backed
by native code, we can trigger buffer and integer overflows, NULL pointer
crashes, etc. - in short, all of the types of vulnerabilities usually
associated with C code.
There are enough methods backed by native code that it is likely to take some
time before they are all audited. Until this is done, untrusted applets and
applications may not be run with any confidence.
Examples
--------
Please bear in mind that these examples are only representative of a wider
problem. Also be aware that these examples have been selected randomly so may
not be the best examples for exploitability.
1) Integer overflow with large image dimensions.
For the first example, we turn to a persistent area of vulnerabilities - images
and image primatives with excessive dimensions. The intent here is to trigger
a width \* height integer overflow, with subsequent buffer overflow when the
image canvas is populated. This code crashes under appletviewer:
import java.applet.Applet;
import java.awt.image.BufferedImage;
import java.awt.image.ConvolveOp;
import java.awt.image.Kernel;
public class BadApplet1 extends Applet {
public static void main(String[] args) {
new BadApplet1().init();
}
public void init() {
Kernel kernel = new Kernel(65536, 65536, new float[0]);
ConvolveOp op = new ConvolveOp(kernel);
BufferedImage src = new BufferedImage(1, 1, BufferedImage.TYPE\_INT\_RGB);
BufferedImage dst = new BufferedImage(1, 1, BufferedImage.TYPE\_INT\_RGB);
op.filter(src, dst);
}
}
The faulty code is likely in the native function
Java\_sun\_awt\_image\_ImagingLib\_convolveBI, possibly:
if ((dkern = (mlib\_d64 \*) calloc(1, w\*h\*sizeof(mlib\_d64))) == NULL) {
Although, the surrounding area has a lot of malloc / calloc calls where integer
overflow checking in clearly missing. For example, in the same function:
if ((kdata = (mlib\_s32 \*) malloc(w\*h\*sizeof(mlib\_s32))) == NULL) {
Or in awt\_parseRaster:
if ((rasterP->chanOffsets =
(jint \*) malloc(rasterP->numDataElements\*
sizeof(jint))) == NULL) {
Or in awt\_parseColorModel:
if ((cmP->nBits =
(jint \*) malloc(cmP->numComponents\*sizeof(jint))) == NULL){
2) Stack overflow / corruption with unexpectedly large input array.
In this example, it appears that incoming array data simply isn't checked
against a sensible maximum size before populating a stack-based array:
import java.applet.Applet;
import java.awt.Point;
import java.awt.image.ByteLookupTable;
import java.awt.image.DataBuffer;
import java.awt.image.LookupOp;
import java.awt.image.LookupTable;
import java.awt.image.Raster;
import java.awt.image.SampleModel;
import java.awt.image.SinglePixelPackedSampleModel;
import java.awt.image.WritableRaster;
public class BadApplet2 extends Applet {
static public void main(String[] args) {
new BadApplet2().init();
}
public void init() {
SampleModel model = new SinglePixelPackedSampleModel(DataBuffer.TYPE\_BYTE,
1, 1, new int[100]);
WritableRaster raster =
Raster.createWritableRaster(model, new Point(0, 0));
LookupTable lt = new ByteLookupTable(0, new byte[100][1]);
LookupOp op = new LookupOp(lt, null);
op.filter(raster, raster);
}
}
Likely code fault is in Java\_sun\_awt\_image\_ImagingLib\_lookupByteRaster, where
arrays of size 4 on the stack are copied into based on the length of the
incoming java array. Note that the overflow data seems to be pointers rather
than arbitrary user supplied data, so this example may not be exploitable.
Interestingly, if new byte[100][1] is replaced with new byte[1][100] in the
above example, I get different symptoms - glibc detects heap corruption.
There are possible additional instances of the same sort of problem in
expandPackedBCR (loff, roff integer arrays on the stack) and the corresponding
functions for different packing models.
3) Unchecked negative values.
No examples of a crashing JVM are available (it can be quite difficult to
determine how to get a piece of vulnerable code executing using only the
java pacakges permitted to applets). However, failure to check an integer for
negative values seems to be common, as in
Java\_sun\_font\_SunLayoutEngine\_nativeLayout:
jint len = max - min;
jchar buffer[256];
jchar\* chars = buffer;
if (len > 256) {
So the above code is potentially vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow.
Another example in the medialib area:
/\* MediaLib can't do more than 4 bands \*/
if (src\_nbands > 4 || dst\_nbands > 4) {
return 0;
}
etc.
Future directions
-----------------
There is an excellent opportunity for a Java class library fuzzer. Java
introspection allows you to determine whether a given method is native or not,
so all of these could be singled out and bombarded with inputs likely to
trigger bugs.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Sun Java JRE vulnerable to arbitrary code execution via an undetermined error

#### Vulnerability Note VU#149457

Original Release Date: 2007-01-09 | Last Revised: 2007-05-16

---

### Overview

A vulnerability in the Sun Java Runtime Environment may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.

### Description

| The Sun Java Runtime Environment ([JRE](http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/download.html)) allows users to run [Java](http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/) applications in a browser or as standalone programs. Sun has made the JRE available for multiple operating systems.  The following statement is from Sunsolve Document ID [102729](http://sunsolve.sun.com/search/document.do?assetkey=1-26-102729-1):*Two buffer overflow vulnerabilities in the Java Runtime Environment may independently allow an untrusted applet to elevate its privileges. For example, an applet may grant itself permissions to read and write local files or execute local applications that are accessible to the user running the untrusted applet.Sun acknowledges, with thanks, Chris Evans, for bringing these issues to our attention.* |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code. |
