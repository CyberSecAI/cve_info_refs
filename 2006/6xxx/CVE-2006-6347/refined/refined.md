Root cause of vulnerability:
- The application stores the administrator's password in a file named "passwd" located within the admin directory, which is accessible via a web request.
- The application does not properly check file extensions during upload, allowing an authenticated administrator to upload any file type.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Insecure storage of credentials: The administrator's password is stored in a file accessible through the web server, allowing an attacker to directly retrieve it if they know the location.
- Lack of file extension validation during upload: Allowing upload of any file type such as PHP, results in arbitrary code execution.
- Predictable password hashing algorithm: DES algorithm is used for hashing, which is easily breakable

Impact of exploitation:
- Information Disclosure: An attacker can directly retrieve the administrator's password from the exposed passwd file.
- Arbitrary code execution: An authenticated attacker can upload a malicious php file and execute arbitrary code on the server.

Attack vectors:
- Direct file access: Attacker accesses the admin/passwd file through a web request to retrieve the administrator's password.
- File upload: An authenticated attacker uploads a malicious file to execute arbitrary code.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- For information disclosure, no authentication is required. The attacker needs to know the location of the passwd file.
- For arbitrary code execution, the attacker needs to authenticate as an administrator to upload files.
