Script Name: TFT-Gallery
Authors: Mike Scalora, Eric Thelin, Sascha Lorenz & Jan Berndt
Website: http://tftgallery.sourceforge.net
Bug Report: NetJackal (nj[AT]hackerz[DOT]ir & nima\_501[AT]yahoo[DOT]com)
Status: Patch not released
First i should apologize for my bad english.
Intro:
TFT-Gallery is a PHP-based Web image gallery & does n't require databse.
Bugs Description:
First bug)
Look at admin`s index page(/admin/index.php)
if(file\_exists("passwd")) {
$fd = fopen("passwd", "r");
$givenpw = fgets($fd,15);
fclose($fd);
if(isset($\_REQUEST['password']) and
isset($\_REQUEST['username']) and
$\_REQUEST['username']=='admin' and
crypt($\_REQUEST['password'], "tftgallery") == $givenpw) {
$\_SESSION['admin']=true;
} else {
include\_once "login\_form.inc";
exit;
}
}
TFT-Gallery stores admin's password in "passwd" file at admin folder, so everyone has access
to it by going to:
http://victim/admin/passwd
TIP: Password hashed by DES algorithm.
TIP: Username is "admin".
Second Bug)
TFT-Gallery doesn't check file extension so if somebody who has gain access by First bug can
upload any file extension (ex. evil.php).
Solution:
Edit code and store passwd some where else (out of wwwroot).
