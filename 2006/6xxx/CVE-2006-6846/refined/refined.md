Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2006-6846

**Vulnerable Software:** wywo inout board 1.0

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The application suffers from multiple vulnerabilities, specifically SQL injection flaws in `phonemessage.asp` and `faqDsp.asp`, as well as a login bypass via the `login.asp` page

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** Vulnerable parameters in `phonemessage.asp?num=` and `faqDsp.asp?catcode=`  allow for SQL injection attacks.
*   **Authentication Bypass:**  A simple login bypass using `'or'` for both username and password is possible on the `login.asp` page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **SQL Injection:** An attacker could potentially read sensitive database information, modify data, or even gain control of the database server.
    *   Specifically the provided exploit aims to extract user credentials from the `employee` table.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** An attacker can bypass the login process and gain unauthorized access to the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET requests:** The vulnerabilities are exploited by crafting malicious GET requests to the specified ASP pages.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application server.
*   No prior authentication is needed for the SQL Injection vulnerabilities.
*   A network connection to the server hosting wywo inout board 1.0.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit details are provided in the "exploit-db.com" content, specifically showing the URL structure to use for the SQL injection and login bypass.
* The content provides example SQL injection payloads for the two vulnerable pages.
* The exploit also provides credentials for bypassing the login.
