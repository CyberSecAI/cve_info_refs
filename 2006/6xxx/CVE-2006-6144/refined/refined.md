  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve": "CVE-2006-6144",
      "description": "The Kerberos administration daemon, \"kadmind\", can free uninitialized pointers, possibly leading to arbitrary code execution. This vulnerability results from memory management bugs in the \"mechglue\" abstraction interface of the GSS-API implementation. Third-party applications written using the GSS-API may also be vulnerable. Exploitation of this vulnerability is believed to be difficult.",
      "root_cause": "Memory management bugs in the \"mechglue\" abstraction interface of the GSS-API implementation. Specifically, error-handling paths within mechglue do not properly initialize output parameters, which can lead to uninitialized pointers being passed to destructor functions like gss_release_buffer.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Use of uninitialized pointers",
         "Improper error handling in GSS-API mechglue implementation"
      ],
      "impact": "An unauthenticated user may be able to execute arbitrary code in kadmind, potentially compromising the Kerberos key database and host security. It can also cause kadmind to crash or cause arbitrary code execution in third-party applications using the vulnerable GSS-API library.",
      "attack_vector": "Remote, unauthenticated attacker",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to send a malformed request to kadmind that triggers the vulnerable code path in gss_display_name.",
      "affected_software": [
        "kadmind from MIT releases krb5-1.5 through krb5-1.5.1",
        "third-party applications calling the GSS-API library included in MIT releases krb5-1.5 through krb5-1.5.1",
        "Applications using RPCSEC_GSS with NULL server names",
          "OpenPKG",
          "Fedora Project",
          "Gentoo Linux",
          "SUSE Linux",
          "Sun Microsystems, Inc.",
          "rPath"
      ],
      "additional_information": "The log_badverf() function in kadmind calls gss_display_name() without proper error checking and initialization of gss_buffer_desc structures. In cases when gss_display_name() encounters errors it may not initialize the output arguments and kadmind could call gss_release_buffer on uninitialized memory locations.  When RPCSEC_GSS is used with a NULL server name, at least one call to gss_display_name() will always fail, triggering the vulnerability."
