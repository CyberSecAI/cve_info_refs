How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Hash: SHA1
MIT krb5 Security Advisory 2006-003
Original release: 2007-01-09
Last update: 2007-01-09
Topic: kadmind (via GSS-API mechglue) frees uninitialized pointers
Severity: CRITICAL
CVE: CVE-2006-6144
CERT: VU#831452
SUMMARY
=======
The Kerberos administration daemon, "kadmind", can free uninitialized
pointers, possibly leading to arbitrary code execution. This
vulnerability results from memory management bugs in the "mechglue"
abstraction interface of the GSS-API implementation. Third-party
applications written using the GSS-API may also be vulnerable.
Exploitation of this vulnerability is believed to be difficult. No
exploit code is known to exist at this time.
IMPACT
======
An unauthenticated user may cause execution of arbitrary code in
kadmind, which can compromise the Kerberos key database and host
security. (kadmind usually runs as root.) Unsuccessful exploitation,
or even accidental replication of the required conditions by
non-malicious users, can result in kadmind crashing.
An unauthenticated user may cause execution of arbitrary code in
third-party applications which use the GSS-API library.
AFFECTED SOFTWARE
=================
\* kadmind from MIT releases krb5-1.5 through krb5-1.5.1
\* third-party applications calling the GSS-API library included in MIT
releases krb5-1.5 through krb5-1.5.1
\* Earlier releases may not be affected because the relevant code was
not compiled.
FIXES
=====
\* The upcoming krb5-1.6 release will contain a fix for this problem.
Additionally, the upcoming krb5-1.5.2 patch release will contain
this fix.
\* Apply the patch at:
http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/advisories/2006-003-patch.txt
A PGP-signed version of the patch is at:

CVE: CVE-2006-6144

CERT: VU#831452
http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/831452
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
===============
This vulnerability was found while investigating a related
vulnerability reported by Andrew Korty of Indiana University.
DETAILS
=======
The specifications for the GSS-API C bindings, including RFC 2744,
require that all GSS-API calls which may return pointers to allocated
memory to initialize the pointers, even in error conditions. The
implementation of the "mechglue" abstraction interface can execute
error-handling paths which do not complete initialization of output
parameters. As a result, callers which do not initialize return
structures such as gss\_buffer\_desc may call destructor functions such
as gss\_release\_buffer on values containing uninitialized pointers.
In kadmind, the log\_badverf() function calls gss\_display\_name()
without checking its return value and without initializing the
gss\_buffer\_desc structures passed to gss\_display\_name(). If
gss\_display\_name() encounters certain error conditions, it does not
initialize the gss\_buffer\_t output argument passed to it. The
log\_badverf() function then logs the returned strings, and calls
gss\_release\_buffer() on these gss\_buffer\_desc structures. When
RPCSEC\_GSS is used, kadmind uses a NULL server name, so at least one
of the calls to gss\_display\_name() will always fail in that case.
The act of logging these strings will typically cause a memory access
fault if the uninitialized pointers have values pointing into invalid
address space, which may prevent harmful effects in
gss\_release\_buffer() because the program will have crashed. It is
inadvisable to depend on this possibility, because an attacker may be
able to manipulate the uninitialized pointers to take on values
pointing into valid address space.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# MIT Kerberos 5: Arbitrary Remote Code Execution — GLSA **200701-21**

Multiple vulnerabilities in MIT Kerberos 5 could potentially result in the
execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-crypt/mit-krb5** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.5.2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.5.2** |

### Background

MIT Kerberos 5 is a suite of applications that implement the Kerberos
network protocol.

### Description

The Kerberos administration daemon, and possibly other applications
using the GSS-API or RPC libraries, could potentially call a function
pointer in a freed heap buffer, or attempt to free an uninitialized
pointer.

### Impact

A remote attacker may be able to crash an affected application, or
potentially execute arbitrary code with root privileges.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All MIT Kerberos 5 users should upgrade to the latest version:

## Kerberos administration daemon may free uninitialized pointers

#### Vulnerability Note VU#831452

Original Release Date: 2007-01-09 | Last Revised: 2007-05-10

---

### Overview

A vulnerability exists in the Kerberos administration daemon that may allow a remote, unauthenticated user to free uninitialized pointers. Freeing uninitialized pointers corrupts memory in a way that could allow an attacker to execute code.

### Description

| The MIT krb 5 administration daemon contains a vulnerability that may allow an attacker to execute arbitary code. According to MIT krb5 Security Advisory [2006-003](http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/www/advisories/MITKRB5-SA-2006-003-mechglue.txt):  *This vulnerability results from memory management bugs in the "mechglue" abstraction interface of the GSS-API implementation.* Note that versions krb5-1.5 through krb5-1.5.1 are affected by this vulnerability. Other server applications that utilize the GSS-API library provided with MIT krb5 may also be affected. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code resulting in the compromise of the Kerberos key database or cause a denial of service. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply Patch**A [patch](http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/advisories/2006-003-patch.txt) as described in MIT krb5 Security Advisory [2006-003](http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/www/advisories/MITKRB5-SA-2006-003-mechglue.txt) can be obtained from MIT. MIT also states that this will be addressed in the upcoming krb5-1.6 release and krb5-1.5.2 patch release. |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
