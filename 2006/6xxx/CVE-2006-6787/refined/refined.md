Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2006-6787

**Vulnerable Software:** Newsletter MX version 1.0.2 and prior.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**  The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of the `ID` parameter in the `admin_mail_adressee.asp` script, leading to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `ID` parameter, before using it in a SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Breach:** An attacker can potentially bypass authentication, gain access to sensitive information stored in the database, including user credentials (usernames and passwords).
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker could gain access to administrative credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:**  The exploit utilizes a crafted HTTP GET request that appends a malicious SQL injection payload to the vulnerable `ID` parameter within `admin_mail_adressee.asp`.
*   **Targeted Parameter:** The `ID` parameter is the specific attack vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable server.
*  **Basic understanding of SQL injection:**  The attacker should be familiar with SQL injection techniques to craft the payload.

**Technical Details**
*   The provided exploit code uses a union-based SQL injection technique to retrieve the `fld_ID` (username) and `fld_password` from the `tbl_members` table. The injected SQL query is:
    ```sql
    -1 union select 0,0,fld_ID,fld_password,0,0,0,0,0,0,0 from tbl_members where id like <user_id>
    ```
   The `<user_id>` variable is provided by the attacker.
* The exploit script attempts to connect to the target server, sends the crafted HTTP GET request, and parses the response for the retrieved username and password.

**Additional Notes:**
* The exploit targets `admin_mail_adressee.asp` which suggests the vulnerable script is located within the administration panel of the application.
* The exploit code is written in Perl.
*   The vulnerability exists in `Newsletter MX` version 1.0.2 and possibly earlier versions.
