Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `downloaddetails.php` file of TorrentFlux 2.2. The script fails to properly sanitize the "alias" variable, allowing an attacker to include arbitrary files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):**  The lack of sanitization on the `alias` parameter enables an attacker to include and display the contents of any file accessible to the web server. This is a classic LFI vulnerability.
*  **Insecure Path Handling:** The vulnerability description also mentions that `viewnfo.php` in TorrentFlux 2.1 was vulnerable to similar issues due to unsanitized `path` parameter, which has been fixed in 2.2. The fix implemented, SecurityClean(), could be bypassed with null byte injection if the code is not carefully implemented.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can read sensitive files on the server, such as configuration files (e.g., `config.php`), which contain database credentials. This can lead to further compromise of the application and its associated data.
*   **Potential for further attacks:** Access to the database credentials could enable an attacker to perform database-related attacks.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited through a crafted HTTP GET request to `downloaddetails.php` with a manipulated `alias` parameter, e.g., `downloaddetails.php?alias=../../config.php`.
*   **Requires User Session:** The exploit requires a valid logged-in user's session. The attacker has to be logged-in user to exploit this issue.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Web Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable TorrentFlux server.
*   **Valid User Account:** The attacker has to be a valid user of the application

**Additional Details:**

*   The exploit description also discusses a similar vulnerability in `viewnfo.php` of TorrentFlux 2.1 which allowed remote file inclusion using a `path` parameter and the suggested fix to `SecurityClean()` method to properly sanitize the path.
* The exploit code shows how a valid user can use a HTTP request to exploit the issue, demonstrating the steps to log in first and then send a crafted request to `downloaddetails.php`
* Null byte injection can bypass the SecurityClean() check in some cases, allowing attackers to read the current directory or files above the current directory.
