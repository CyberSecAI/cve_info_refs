The provided content describes a vulnerability in multiple virus scanners related to MIME encoding, specifically Base64 and multipart/mixed content. This vulnerability allows malicious content, such as the EICAR test file, to bypass detection.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the improper handling of non-alphabet characters within Base64 encoded data and the depth of multipart/mixed nesting by some virus scanners. According to RFC 2045, these characters should be ignored. However, some scanners fail to do so, leading to a bypass. Additionally, some scanners are unable to handle deeply nested multipart messages correctly.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Base64 decoding:** Ignoring non-alphabet characters in Base64 encoding can lead to bypass of virus scanners.
*   **Insufficient multipart/mixed content processing:** Some virus scanners fail when encountering deep levels of nested multipart/mixed content, allowing the malicious payload to pass.
*   **Stack overflow:** Some versions of ClamAV crash due to a stack overflow when presented with deeply nested multipart/mixed content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Malware infection:** Attackers can send malicious files via email disguised using MIME encoding and bypass vulnerable virus scanners, leading to malware infections on the recipient's system.
*   **Denial of Service:** Specifically for older ClamAV versions, a crafted email can cause the scanner to crash due to a stack overflow.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Email:** The primary attack vector is via email, where the malicious payload is disguised using Base64 encoding with extraneous characters, combined with deeply nested multipart/mixed content structures.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to send emails to a target protected by vulnerable virus scanners.
*   The attacker needs to be able to generate malicious content and encode it using the techniques described (Base64 encoding with invalid characters and nested multipart/mixed structures).
*  The attacker can use a simple perl script provided in the content as proof of concept.

**Vulnerable Products (from content):**

*   BitDefender Mail Protection for SMB 2.0
*   ClamAV 0.88.7 (and prior versions for DoS)
*   F-Prot Antivirus for Linux x86 Mail Servers 4.6.61
*   Kaspersky Anti-Virus for Linux Mail Server 5.5.10
*   F-Secure Anti-Virus for Linux Gateways 4.65 (Less vulnerable)
