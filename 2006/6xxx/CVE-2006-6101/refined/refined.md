    "summary": "The vulnerability is due to integer overflows in the X server's DBE and Render extensions. Specifically, the functions `ProcDbeGetVisualInfo()`, `ProcDbeSwapBuffer()`, and `ProcRenderAddGlyphs()` calculate memory allocation sizes using client-provided values, which can lead to integer overflows. This can result in memory corruption on the stack via the `alloca()` function, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the X server, typically root. The attack vector involves an already authenticated X server client sending specially crafted requests.",
