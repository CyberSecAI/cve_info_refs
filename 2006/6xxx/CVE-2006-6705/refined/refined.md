Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2006-6705:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause lies in authentication bypass vulnerabilities within the template files of Hitachi's Soumu Workflow Series Products. Specifically, the authentication mechanism is not functioning correctly on certain web pages due to flaws in these template files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** The primary vulnerability is the ability for attackers to bypass the authentication process, gaining unauthorized access to web pages.
- Additionally, after login authentication, the products were vulnerable to:
  - **SQL Injection:**  This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code into database queries, potentially leading to data breaches or manipulation.
  - **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** This enables attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, which could be used for various malicious purposes, like stealing session cookies, hijacking user accounts, or modifying webpage content.
  - **Read and overwrite other user's information:** This allows attackers to read and modify data belonging to other users

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can access restricted web pages without proper authentication.
- **Data breaches/manipulation**: Through SQL injection, attackers can compromise the database, read sensitive information, modify it, or even delete records.
- **Account Hijacking**: Via XSS, attackers can steal user session cookies, hijack user accounts, or otherwise abuse logged-in user permissions.
- **Data tampering:** Through read and overwrite vulnerabilities, attackers can read and modify sensitive information belonging to other users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by malicious users over a network, without requiring physical access to the affected systems.
- **Web-based attacks:** The specific attack vectors are related to the web-based nature of the application, likely through HTTP requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** Attackers must be able to connect to the network where the affected application is running.
- **Technical Knowledge:** The attacker needs to have some understanding of web-based applications and how to exploit authentication bypasses, and, for later vulnerabilities, of SQL injection, XSS, and techniques to read/modify user's data.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided information is more detailed than what a typical CVE description provides. It specifically names the affected products, versions, and provides context within the Hitachi software ecosystem.
- The vulnerability was discovered in the template files and fixed versions are available
- Later on, further vulnerabilities were discovered after login authentication (SQL injection, XSS, and information disclosure).
