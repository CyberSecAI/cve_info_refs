```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability is caused by the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `adminprint.php` script. The script includes files based on the `admin_folder` and `path` parameters directly, leading to a remote file inclusion vulnerability.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Remote File Inclusion (RFI).
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can include and execute arbitrary remote files on the server. This can lead to complete compromise of the web application and potentially the server, allowing for data theft, defacement, or further malicious activities.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability is triggered by sending HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable `adminprint.php` script with malicious URLs in either the `admin_folder` or `path` parameters.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application and needs to have access to a malicious script hosted on a remote server.
