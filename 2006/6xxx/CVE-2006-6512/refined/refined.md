    {
      "source": "aluigi.altervista.org_7d81553a_20250126_001014.html",
      "vulnerability": "buffer-overflow in FindBasicAuth",
      "description": "The FindBasicAuth() function in security.cpp parses the Authorization HTTP field. It places the auth mode and base64 strings (username:password) into a 100-byte temp buffer and then decodes this into another 100-byte buffer. The GetAString() function limits strings to 255 chars. While present, it doesn't appear exploitable for remote code execution.",
      "impact": "Potential denial of service or other unspecified issues due to buffer overflow. Remote code execution seems unlikely.",
      "attack_vector": "Sending an HTTP request with an overly long username in the Authorization header.",
      "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs to send an HTTP request with a crafted Authorization header."
    },
    {
      "source": "aluigi.altervista.org_7d81553a_20250126_001014.html",
      "vulnerability": "browsing directory traversal",
      "description": "The Browse() function in browse.cpp shows files in a specific folder within the root directory. While the GoodPath() function checks for risks caused by '..' and backslashes, it does not account for hex-encoded slashes (%2f). This allows browsing any folder on the disk where the root directory is located.",
        "impact": "An attacker can browse any folder on the disk where the root directory is located, potentially exposing sensitive information, but downloading files is not possible.",
      "attack_vector": "Crafting a URL with hex-encoded slashes (%2f) in the path parameter, such as http://localhost/browse?path=%2f..%2f..%2f.",
      "required_capabilities": "Attacker requires the 'Browse' privilege."
    },
    {
     "source": "aluigi.altervista.org_7d81553a_20250126_001014.html",
      "vulnerability": "buffer-overflow in the browse, download, and load functions",
      "description": "The Browse(), CControl::Download(), and CControl::Load() functions are vulnerable to buffer overflows. This occurs when creating a string with the root directory plus the path string from the client in a buffer of only MAX_PATH bytes (260), which is the same size as the client string.",
     "impact": "Potential for denial of service or remote code execution through buffer overflows.",
      "attack_vector": "Crafting a URL with a long path exceeding MAX_PATH for the browse, download, or load functions.",
      "required_capabilities": "Attacker requires the privileges related to the function they want to exploit (e.g., Browse, Download, or Load)."
    },
    {
      "source": "aluigi.altervista.org_7d81553a_20250126_001014.html",
      "vulnerability": "file extension check bypassing in file downloading",
      "description": "The CControl::Download() function checks file extensions against a list of allowed types, specifically for Winamp files. Adding a dot after the requested filename bypasses this check and allows downloading of any file within the root directory.",
      "impact": "An attacker with the 'Download' permission can download arbitrary files from the server's root directory.",
      "attack_vector": "Crafting a download URL with a dot at the end of the filename, such as http://localhost/dl?file=\\file.txt..",
       "required_capabilities": "Attacker requires the 'Download' privilege."
    },
    {
      "source": "aluigi.altervista.org_7d81553a_20250126_001014.html",
      "vulnerability": "lucky path name",
      "description": "File handling functions require a backslash before the path. If another folder or file begins with the same name as the root directory, it can be accessed instead. For example, if the root is c:\\folder, accessing c:\\folder2 can be done with http://localhost/browse?path=2.",
      "impact": "An attacker can access and potentially download files from directories other than the configured root, if such directories exist with names beginning the same as the intended root.",
      "attack_vector": "Crafting a URL that uses a path parameter matching a different directory name that shares a prefix with the configured root directory.",
      "required_capabilities":"Attacker requires the privileges to use the functions they are exploiting, and the existance of directories/files with matching prefixes"
    }
