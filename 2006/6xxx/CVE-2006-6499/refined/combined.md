## Mozilla denial of service vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#427972

Original Release Date: 2007-01-09 | Last Revised: 2007-06-04

---

### Overview

Certain Mozilla products contain a denial-of-service vulnerability.

### Description

| Certain Mozilla products contain a denial-of-service vulnerability that occurs because of an infinite loop in the js\_dtoa function. Mozilla Firefox versions prior to 2.0.0.1, Thunderbird prior to 1.5.0.9, and other Mozilla products may be affected.  According to Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory [2006-68](http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2006/mfsa2006-68.html):*Keith Victor reported that if the floating point precision of the CPU was reduced (which can happen on windows by loading a plugin which creates a Direct3D device) then it is possible that js\_dtoa() will not exit and instead overwrite memory. None of the most common plugins in use do this which lowers the overall impact of this vulnerability to moderate.* |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote unauthenticated attacker may be able to cause a denial-of-service condition. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade**  The Mozilla Foundation has released upgrades that address this issue. See Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory [2006-68](http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2006/mfsa2006-68.html) for more information. |

# Mozilla Firefox: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200701-02**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in Mozilla Firefox, some of
which may allow the remote execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-client/mozilla-firefox** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.5.0.9** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.5.0.9** |

| Package | **www-client/mozilla-firefox-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.5.0.9** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.5.0.9** |

### Background

Mozilla Firefox is a popular open-source web browser from the Mozilla
Project.

### Description

An anonymous researcher found evidence of memory corruption in the way
Mozilla Firefox handles certain types of SVG comment DOM nodes.
Additionally, Frederik Reiss discovered a heap-based buffer overflow in
the conversion of a CSS cursor. Other issues with memory corruption
were also fixed. Mozilla Firefox also contains less severe
vulnerabilities involving JavaScript and Java.

### Impact

An attacker could entice a user to view a specially crafted web page
that will trigger one of the vulnerabilities, possibly leading to the
execution of arbitrary code. It is also possible for an attacker to
perform cross-site scripting attacks, leading to the exposure of
sensitive information, like user credentials.

### Workaround

There are no known workarounds for all the issues at this time.

### Resolution

All Mozilla Firefox users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-1.5.0.9"
```

All Mozilla Firefox binary release users should upgrade to the latest
version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-bin-1.5.0.9"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

    A bug in the js_dtoa function allows remote attackers to cause a
    denial of service. [MFSA 2006-68]

CVE-2006-6501

    "shutdown" discovered a vulnerability that allows remote attackers
    to gain privileges and install malicious code via the watch
    JavaScript function. [MFSA 2006-70]

production-quality releases of code derived from the application
formerly known as the 'Mozilla Application Suite'.

### Description

An anonymous researcher found evidence of memory corruption in the way
SeaMonkey handles certain types of SVG comment DOM nodes. Georgi
Guninski and David Bienvenu discovered buffer overflows in the
processing of long "Content-Type:" and long non-ASCII MIME email
headers. Additionally, Frederik Reiss discovered a heap-based buffer
overflow in the conversion of a CSS cursor. Several other issues with
memory corruption were also fixed. SeaMonkey also contains less severe
vulnerabilities involving JavaScript and Java.

### Impact

An attacker could entice a user to load malicious JavaScript or a
malicious web page with a SeaMonkey application, possibly leading to
the execution of arbitrary code with the rights of the user running
those products. An attacker could also perform cross-site scripting
attacks, leading to the exposure of sensitive information, like user
credentials. Note that the execution of JavaScript or Java applets is
disabled by default in the SeaMonkey email client, and enabling it is
strongly discouraged.

### Workaround

There are no known workarounds for all the issues at this time.

### Resolution

All SeaMonkey users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/seamonkey-1.0.7"
```

Attachment:
I'll attach 2 plugins, based on the example plugin. Plugin "basic-crash" sets up Direct3D and creates a Direct3D device. The other plugin "basic" is identical, just that it does not call CreateDevice (see #ifdef FIREFOX\_CRASH at bottom of dx8test.cpp) (and of course has a different mimetype to differentiate them).
Reproduction:
1. Make sure you have DirectX 8 and 3D drivers installed and working.
2. Copy the attached plugins (plugings/np\*.dll) into your plugins dir
3. Load test.html
4. Click on first link for "good plugin" (calls the "basic" plugin)
5. Click on last link for a new window/tab with a normal HTML page
6. Click on first link for "crash plugin" (calls the "basic\_crash" plugin)
7. Click on last link for a new window/tab with a normal HTML page
8. Crash.
Builds:
I tested this with Firefox 2.0 all the way back to Firebird 0.6, they all consistently crash.
HOWEVER, no Mozilla or Seamonkey does. I tested Mozilla 1.4 up to Seamonkey 1.5 trunk nightlies.
So, this is clearly caused or at least triggered by Firefox or toolkit changes.
Stacktrace:
If you do that with a debug build and debugger, you'll see an infinite recursion in NTDLL. I didn't see anything else in the stack dropdown the Visual Studio debugger, only 100 or so times NTDLL, or is there a way to see the full stack?
I have no idea how to further localize this problem, other than it being a bug introduced by Firefox changes.

Too bad bugzilla doesn't let me attach them. I put them on my webserver, but I can't garantee that the URL is stable.

FWIW, the crash reporter of Firefox (Quality Feedback Agent) doesn't come up either, so there's no incident ID.
The results with my debug build (mentioned above) are not 100% consistent either, the debugger somestimes doesn't catch the crash. When it does, it reports "Access violation" and the mentioned infinite NTDLL stacktrace. On related cases, I sometimes (rarely) instead saw "WS2HELP" as the only stacktrace entry.

|  | |

so, let's start with basics.
when an exception happens, if there's space for an exception handler, one is added to the stack and it handles the exception.
if you crash because of infinite recursion, there's no stack space for the exception handler, and thus you can't catch it with talkback.
good, now that we've settled the basics. use windbg.

don't skip steps, but feel free to substitute your own symboled firefox for the one available there.

What's the stack backtrace? That's mandatory for bugs like this, please include it in the future.

Hey:
I found and fixed the bug!
THanks for all your help, Timeless and Ben!
There is some bad looping logic in jsdtoa.
It uses logic based on the floating point math to exit the loop.
There is enough floating point error introduced, and we never exit the loop, while we continue to append the output buffer.

Keith Victor writes:
Proposed fix for a Firefox bug:
Crash in jsdtoa after opening a new window.
There is some very bad logic in jsdtoa, for the case where the double has no fractional component.
File: jsdtoa.c
See line 2376
/\* Do we have a "small" integer? \*/
In that case there is a loop that converts the double to a string, one digit at a time.
In the loop, it looks at the most significant digit, adds that digit to the string, and then removes the digit from the double value.
Then, it multiples the value by 10 so shift the digits over to the left.
The problem is that the looping logic is dependent on no floating point error being introduced.
But, floating point error is introduced when two doubles of different magnitudes are subtracted, which is done here:
2388: d -= L\*ds;
The check to exit the loop looks like this:
2410:
if (!(d \*= 10.))
break;
It compares the double value to zero.
Unfortunately, there is floating point error introduced, and the value of "d" never gets down to zero.
Therefore, the loop becomes infinite, and we keep appending characters to the output string, ignoring the specified size of the buffer. ( The buffer size test was done previously, based on the number of digits that it planned to place in the buffer. ).
My proposed fix is rather simple.
Since we know up front how many digits we have to write out, we can use that number to specify the number of times that we loop, rather than depending on errorless floating point math.
See the diff between the original and modified files attached.
I changed the "for" line:
From:
for(i = 1; ; i++) {
To:
for(i = 1; i<=k+1; i++) {
And, I removed the check on the bottom of the for loop.
From:
if (!(d \*= 10.))
break;
To:
d \*= 10.;
Furthermore, the logic that is there is very bad. [Description about other problem cut, will file another bug where necessary.]
Thanks for your consideration.

I'll have to study the code to review effectively. A question for Keith or whomever can answer it: why i<=k+1 for the for loop's condition, instead of a comparison against ilim or ilim1?
Cc'ing wtc, as the prdtoa.c fork of David M. Gay's code looks newer and yet again different (but it may have the same bug -- again I'll have to make time to study it harder).

Hi:
In the cases I am seeing, both iLim and iLim1 are both -1 everytime it gets into that code.
I'm very new to this code, and I am not familiar with the parameters used here.
If there are beter parameters to use, that's fine with me. But, iLim and iLim1 do not seem to be valid.
But,
Looking at the code for that case, and how it uses "k" to loop through the digits, and generate a string, one can conclude that "k+1" is the correct number of times to loop.
In each loop, it lops off most significant digit using the following algorithm:
for(i = 1; i<=k+1; i++) {
L = (Long) (d / ds); // get the char in the "kth" position
d -= L\*ds; // subtract off the most significant digit ( and introduce error )
\*s++ = '0' + (char)L; // append the char to the string
d \*= 10.; // SHift all the digits to the Left
where:
ds = tens[k];
Since it is using this "ds" to determine which digit to lop off, it must write out "k+1" digits so that they are in the correct location.
For example, if k = 3, then ds = 1000.
So, the first time through the loop, we lop off the digit that is four places to the left of the decimal. Since that first, and most significan digit, and the first digit that we place on the string, then we MUST write a total of four digits ( k+1 ) to the string. Otherwise, that first digit will not be in the correct place.
Well, thats my logic anyway.
Thanks for all your help on this!

Hey:
The crux of the change is in the for line, near 2386.
- for(i = 1;; i++) {
+ for(i = 1; i<=k+1; i++) {
So, the relevent code is in that for loop.
The other change just removes the now redundant ( and still faulty ) test to Break out of the loop, when "d" gets down to zero.
I hope that helps.

Hi:
Here is some more information about this bug.
Previously, I did not understand the relationship between the plugins, and the crash.
All I could see was that if I loaded the plugin, it would then later crash in that jsdtoa code.
I did not understand why the same code could be called with the same arguments, and work fine before the simple plugin is loaded, but would crash after the plugin is loaded.
The only thing that the plugin does beyond the basic, "hello world" boiler plate code is it creates a Direct3D device.
As it turns out, when you create a Direct3D device, the precision of double precision math is reduced ( be default ).
( Isn't that nice! )
See:
<http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/archive/en-us/directx9_c_Aug_2005/directx/graphics/reference/d3d/constants/D3DCREATE.asp>
Look for : D3DCREATE\_FPU\_PRESERVE
That reduction of precision caues the unexpected roundoff error, and a resulting crash in jsdtoa.
So, we are able to fix our plugin, by creating our Direct3D device with that flag.
WIth that, it does not crash in the jsdtao code.
This some what explains why a codebase that is as mature as Mozilla could have such a huge bug. It seems that it does not crash if your math is done in full double precision.
But, I still think this code is very dangerous, and the fix should be put in.
Other 3D plugin developers might fall into this trap in the future, when they create a default Direct3D device.
Furthermore, there is another related bug in the same code that is also fixed by my change.
If you attempt to convert a 12 digit number, that has zeros directly to the left of the decimal, those zeros will be omitted from the string.
ie: jsdtoa( 1000000000000.0 ) will result in this string: "1".
js( 123456789000.0 ) will result in "123456789"
This bug is independent of the precision issues discussed above.
I can not figure out how to create a test case to prove this. But, I tested this in the debugger, and it is true.
In the loop, it lops off the most significant digit. As soon as the number goes to Zero, it breaks, and forgets to write out the trailing zeros.
The logic in that loop is BOTH flawed and reckless, independently!
Keith

As to why this is Firefox only, I can only guess that Firefox uses \*some\* double (incl. conversion to string) in its JavaScript that's run during new window openings, and SeaMonkey doesn't.

switching precisions is a no no, it's very bad behavior and dangerous. oh, and switching is expensive.
changing this won't actually make the world happy since spidermonkey will now be violating JS specs for math operations.
it will temporarily result in no crash/deadlock, but it really isn't satisfactory.
we could theoretically add wasted calls to set precision before each jump in/out of plugins, but unfortunately they end up in the system event loop, so we'd also need calls each time we have a heartbeat.
that really sucks.

timeless, I think you're misunderstanding it. It's \*Microsoft\* doing the precision switch, and preventing them from doing so is a workaround for this bug. Nothing in this patch switches precision, please read it. It fixes a logic flaw which is just exposed by the precision switch (and, as Keith mentioned, can happen in other cases, we just haven't found testcases yet).

I think the code fix here is worth adding; this loop seems to be made much more safe by the slight restructuring of the loop. It would be interesting to see if applying this fix causes regressions in the lin-testsuite. If it doesn't, we should land it, and it might be worth nominating for 1.8.1.1

the last digit that we write to the string could be off by one.

Brian:
Did you follow the directions to reproduce the "bug".
Were you able to reproduce the crash? The Crash is caused by the reduction in precision. It is 100% reproducible.
You need to first load the plugin by playing the attached content.
After the plugin is loaded, then the precision is reduced

Firstly, it's not just the last digit that gets messed up. The problem is the loop is controlled by the floating point arithmetic. Since that is flawed ( or rather becomes flawed after the precision is reduced ), the loop becomes infinite, and it keeps adding characters to the string until it crashes.
But, to answer your questions: Yes.
There is a #define in that code:
#define Int\_max 14
Which is the number of digits that it figures are kept by a double.
Then, in order to get into the loop that we have been discussing, it needs to pass this test:
if (be >= 0 && k <= Int\_max) {
If we bump "Int\_max" down to the number of digits of precision for a float, that would avoid the problem.
But, that would not be a good solution, IMHO. Users should be able to get 14 digits of precision into their string, and we should not modify the way the string is generated because of odd ball cases where the precision is reduced.
It is my contention that Firefox should not Crash in those odd ball cases, as it does now. And, we can do that without changing the number of digits ( which would break all kinds of test cases ) by simply modifying the logic in the loop.

Keith: I'm not trying to be convinced of the veracity of the bug (I believe there is a bug), I'm trying to understand if there is a new rounding error introduced by the patch, which seems to be what wtchang@redhat is suggesting. If the rounding-error is the same either way, that's fine. If it is not, then I think in some important cases, it will be better for us to crash than to yield incorrect results, and we should wait for a patch which does not introduce this rounding-error. wtchang: Do you have a suggestion for an alternative fix that prevents the infinite-loop without introducing a rounding-error?

crowder, no rounding error is introduced by the patch. The line that wtc blamed is not touched by the patch. This rounding error makes the unpatched version crash/loop infinitely, the patch makes us cope with the situation.

Thanks you for the clarification of wtchang's comment. I obviously missed his point.
YES. There is indeed rounding error introduced by the patch. Or, rather, the patch prevents a crash, which allows the string with the rounding error to be returned. The Patch does not cause the rounding error. The plugin does that.
For example:
Before Loading the Plugin:
jsdtoa( 123456789012.0 ) will result in the correct string of ( "123456789012" )
After the plugin is loaded, but withOUT the Patch:
jsdtoa( 123456789012.0 ) will crash, because it keeps adding characters to the string till it does crash.
After the plugin is loaded, but WITH the Patch:
jsdtoa( 123456789012.0 ) will result in the an incorrect string. Something like this: ( "123456747474" ) Its not just the last digit. The last 5 or so digits are wrong.
I dont know how to fix that bug when the double precision has mystericaly been reduced. You would have to implement some kind of double precision processor in software, built on single precision math functions. Not a good idea!
It is my belief that in the odd ball case where the precision has been reduced, we are better off returning a string that is incorrect, rather than crash.
I think I am hearing you say the opposite. You would rather crash than provide the wrong string. If that is the case, then let it crash.
Although there is still the independent issue where the function returns an incorrect value for numbers like 123456789000.0.

I guess my concern is that, if a user is doing (for example) banking -- yes, it's a very very wealthy user -- in one window, and happens to load an unfriendly D3D plugin in another; his precision changes and he accidentally submits a form containing 123456747474, when he had meant to submit 123456789012.0. In this situation, it seems to me we are better off crashing. Perhaps an alternative solution would be to enforce floating-point precision at the start of JS execution?

OH:
I think I also misunderstood this question. I thought you were saying that you could not reproduce the rounding error. ( you were telling me that it does not exsit, not asking )
I'll directly answer your question:
Correct, The rounding error I mention does not exist in the unpatched version.
Because. it crashes before it returns the string.
Or, perhaps one might say, the rounding error does exist in the unpatched version, and causes a crash, which then hides the fact that it can not correctly convert the double to a string.

The idea of the patch is that we already know the number of digits the loop should produce. So the patch just limits the loop to exactly the given number of iterations avoiding overwriting memory with 0 which can theoretically result in an exploitable bug. Any attempts to prevent printing of the wrong result due to rounding errors should go to another bug IMO.

Is there already another bug reported for this? I cannot reproduce it in the shell:

123456789000
js> String( 123456789000000.0 )

js> String( 123456789000000000000.0 )
123456789000000000000
js> String( 123456789000000000000000.0 )
1.23456789e+23
js> String( 123456789000000000000000000.0 )
1.23456789e+26
Can you open another bug and provide a testcase?

Exactly! Effectively the patch is a good conservative fix for theoretical security problem, so lets take take just on the base of that. The fact that it does not change jsdtoa to generate the right answer is for another bug.

I did the same thing, and it seems to work correctly, from the user's POV.
But, put a breakpoint in the jsdtoa, and look at what it returns.
It does indeed return an incorrect value, with the zeros stripped off the end.
But, then, it prints the correct result to the console. So, it appears that is is calling jsdtoa, but not using the string produced by that function.
Therefore, I dont know how to produce a testcase. But, I assure you that bug is real, and that loop contains two indepedent bugs!

Keith: Ah. js\_dtoa() is not the full story. JS\_dtostr() does more work in padding the result from jsdtoa() using the result returned in js\_dtoa()'s "rve" parameter. If you're using js\_dtoa() directly you need to perform the same padding. That isn't a bug.

Thanks Brian.
Attaching patch with comment changed, ready for checkin. I assume I can't do it myself, because js/src/ is "restricted". Can a member of the "JavaScript" module please check it in? I propose the following checking comment:
When running with reduced FPU precision, the rounding error introduced by |d -= L\*ds;| will cause |if (!(d \*= 10.)) break;| to never be true, causing an infinite loop and consequent crash. Given |k| is already known, we know how often the loop should run, so use that as stop condition, also avoiding overwriting memory with 0.

Keith, sorry I didn't explain why I asked that question.
I just wanted to confirm my understanding that even though
the crash is fixed, the result is incorrect. I hope we can
make the function fail in that case.
I confirmed that the version of this function in NSPR
(mozilla/nsprpub/pr/src/misc/prdtoa.c) has the same problem.

As timeless pointed out, this loss-of-precision problem should affect all double calculations in SpiderMonkey and other components of the browser. Thus the only speciality of jsdtoa is that it is possible to detect the problem due to the knowledge extracted about the number. Now, with the formating code fixed not to crash, why should jsdtoa worry about the precision loss while the rest of the code doesn't?
For this reason I suggest to file a bug to implement a generic workaround for that DirectX problem and probably another one to alter jsdtoa not to depend on floating point at all for its formatting code.

Plugins must save and restore their host's FPU settings, or they are bad guests. We are not going to FIX\_FPU() before every FPU opcode that might be issued after returning from plugin code.
While it might be nice if {pr,js}dtoa.c didn't depend on FPU DP settings, that change forks even further from David M. Gay's long-lived dtoa.c code. Who will own that fork? Not I! I'd rather we unfork existing non-essential changes and feed the essential ones upstream.

With wrong precision mode in the FPU, you might not get to 0 before overrunning the buffer.

Brendan, I meant that the i<=k+1 change alone is sufficient
to fix the crash. It's possible that the "if (!d) break" code
was intended to terminate the loop as soon as possible.

I found this comment at the beginning of js\_dtoa:
/\* Arguments ndigits, decpt, sign are similar to those
of ecvt and fcvt; trailing zeros are suppressed from
the returned string. ...
This comment suggests that the original "if (!d) break" code
was intended not only to terminate the loop but also to
suppress trailing zeros from the returned string.

If you feel that it is problematic, then leave that check in there "if (!d) break". ( in addition to the i<k+1 check). I suppose it will be a few nano-seconds faster that way.
I don't think its a problem.

Keith, I don't know if not suppressing trailing zeros is a problem.
The only problem I see is that the code and comment got out of sync.
I don't understand the dtoa.c code but have to maintain it (the copy
in NSPR), so I'm taking extra time to understand the bug and your fix.
Sometimes I was just thinking out loud. Please bear with me. Your
clear explanation has been very helpful.

keep in mind that the behavior for math and stringification is almost certainly specified in ecma (and defacto before that), so we really can't just randomly change behavior. the only acceptable behavior in my book (other than working correctly) was crashing.
(and everyone knows that i don't like crashing.)

The result is a buffer overrun which is potentially a security issue -- broken math is much better than \*that\* type of crash. Rating "moderate" rather than "critical" because a random malicious page isn't likely to be able to force the use of a plugin that sets up the potential for this (in fact the actual risk is pretty minimal, but technically exists).Group: securityFlags: blocking1.8.1.1?Flags: blocking1.8.1.1+Flags: blocking1.8.0.9?Flags: blocking1.8.0.9+Whiteboard: [sg:moderate]

WTC: The "fix v2" patch only fixes the JS dtoa. Would you prefer a separate NSPR bug, or would you like to fix that under this bug at the same time?
If you're going to fix NSPR at a later time (lower risk, web content can't directly call into it the way they can JS Math) then a separate bug is better. Please mention it in this bug's dependencies.Whiteboard: [sg:moderate] → [sg:moderate] do we need a separate NSPR bug?

I opened a separate NSPR [bug 362134](/show_bug.cgi?id=362134 "RESOLVED FIXED - Crash @ dtoa/prdtoa.c when running with reduced CPU float precision"). I'm going to fix NSPR at
a later time.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2006-68

## Crashes with evidence of memory corruption (rv:1.8.0.9/1.8.1.1)

Announced
December 19, 2006
Reporter
Mozilla Developers
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox 1.5.0.9
* Firefox 2.0.0.1
* SeaMonkey 1.0.7
* Thunderbird 1.5.0.9

### Description

As part of the Firefox 2.0.0.1 and 1.5.0.9 update releases we fixed
several bugs to improve the stability of the product. Some of these were
crashes that showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code
with enough effort.

Thunderbird shares the browser engine with Firefox
and could be vulnerable if JavaScript were to be enabled in
mail. This is not the default setting and we strongly discourage users from
running JavaScript in mail. Without further investigation we cannot rule out
the possibility that for some of these an attacker might be able to prepare
memory for exploitation through some means other than JavaScript, such as
large images.

### Workaround

Upgrade to the fixed versions. Do not enable JavaScript in Thunderbird
or the mail portions of SeaMonkey.

Keith Victor reported that if the floating point precision of the CPU was
reduced (which can happen on windows by loading a plugin which creates
a Direct3D device) then it is possible that js\_dtoa() will not exit
and instead overwrite memory. None of the most common plugins
in use do this which lowers the overall impact of this vulnerability
to moderate.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
