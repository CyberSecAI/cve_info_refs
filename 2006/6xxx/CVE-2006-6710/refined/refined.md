{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not sanitize user-supplied input before using it in include statements. Specifically, it uses values from the GET parameters to construct file paths, making it possible to include arbitrary files.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Multiple Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerabilities exist in the application.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary code by including a malicious file from a remote server. This allows for complete compromise of the affected system.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerabilities are triggered by manipulating GET parameters in HTTP requests to include remote files.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application and host a malicious PHP file on a remote server. No authentication or local access is required."
