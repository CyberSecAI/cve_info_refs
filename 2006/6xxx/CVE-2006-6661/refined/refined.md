    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2006-6661",
      "source": "www.exploit-db.com_23d22976_20250124_231224.html",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to the use of the `extract()` function on `$_POST`, `$_GET`, and `$_COOKIE` variables in the `blog.php` script. This allows an attacker to overwrite existing variables, including administrative credentials, and inject malicious code.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Use of `extract()` function on user-supplied data leading to variable overwrite.",
	      "Lack of proper input validation and sanitization."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can bypass authentication and inject arbitrary PHP code, leading to full control of the server and data.",
      "attack_vector": "The attacker sends a POST request to the vulnerable `blog.php` script with specially crafted form data. This data includes a malicious PHP script injected into the `newmessage` variable and overwrites variables like `adminuser` and `permission` to gain administrative privileges.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target server. No special privileges are required."
