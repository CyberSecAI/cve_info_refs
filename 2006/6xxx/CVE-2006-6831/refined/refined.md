- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `faqDsp.asp` script is vulnerable to SQL injection through the `catcode` parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL injection vulnerability. Specifically, a lack of proper sanitization of the `catcode` parameter before using it in a SQL query.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database, potentially leading to data theft, modification, or complete compromise of the application and database server. In this specific example, the attacker could extract usernames and passwords from the `users` table.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is performed remotely, by crafting a malicious URL that injects SQL code into the `catcode` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target web server, and needs to know the location of the vulnerable `faqDsp.asp` script and the parameter name.
