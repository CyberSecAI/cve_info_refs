**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution. Successful exploitation allows an attacker to run malicious code on the system where the MythControl Server is running.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote exploitation is possible via Bluetooth connection. The attacker would need to connect to the vulnerable MythControl Server using a Bluetooth client.
- Local exploitation might also be possible.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to establish a Bluetooth connection to the vulnerable MythControl Server.
- The attacker needs to craft an overly long command that will overflow the buffer in the `sendToMythTV` function when sent to the server.
- No authentication is required.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in MythControl versions <= 1.0.
