```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability lies in the `GetRecord.php` file of Osprey 1.0 where the `$lib_dir` variable is not sanitized. When `register_globals` is enabled, an attacker can exploit this by injecting a malicious script through this variable.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability due to lack of sanitization of the `$lib_dir` variable.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can include and execute arbitrary PHP code on the server, potentially leading to complete compromise of the system.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability is exploited through a crafted URL by including a malicious script through the `$lib_dir` parameter in the `GetRecord.php` file.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server, and the server needs to have `register_globals` enabled.
