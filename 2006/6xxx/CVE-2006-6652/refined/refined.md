```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Incorrect limit computation of an internal buffer in glob(3). The buffer's size in bytes was used as the element count, while the buffer's elements are 2 bytes long. This caused long expanded path names to overflow the buffer.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Buffer overflow in glob(3)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Potential remote root for systems providing the ftpd service with a custom configuration. The vulnerability could also affect other applications/network services using glob(3).",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by providing long expanded path names to the glob(3) function. For ftpd, this involves allowing remote users to create directories.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to create directories via the ftpd server, which requires a custom configuration. For other applications, the attacker needs to control input that will be processed by glob(3)."
