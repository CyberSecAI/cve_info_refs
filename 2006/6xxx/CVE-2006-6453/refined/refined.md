{
  "CVE-2006-6453": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a failure to sanitize user-supplied input in the `link` parameter of the `JOWAMP_ShowPage.php` script.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)",
      "Lack of Input Sanitization"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can inject arbitrary code into the server by providing a URL to a malicious PHP file through the vulnerable `link` parameter. This allows for remote command execution on the server.",
    "Attack vectors": "By crafting a malicious URL containing a path to an attacker-controlled PHP script through the 'link' parameter of the JOWAMP_ShowPage.php file",
     "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs a network connection to the vulnerable server and a publicly accessible web server hosting the malicious PHP script, along with the ability to make HTTP requests to the target application."
