How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-Summary&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-
Software: CPG Coppermine Photo Gallery
Sowtware&#8217;s Web Site: http://coppermine.sourceforge.net/
Versions: 1.4.8.stable
Class: Remote
Status: Unpatched
Exploit: Available
Discovered by: imei addmimistrator
Risk Level: High
&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;Description&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;
Coppermine Photo Gallery has a logical design fault that will result to bypassing anti-XSS-Injection&#8211;RegGlobal-System.
It is because that process of cleaning user suplied data checks that if we have any varable
that exists in querystrings(or same)? If so it deletes that varable.Cause of this approach we can delete predefined varables(e.g \_GET&\_POST) that has defined arbitary varables before that it delete, and cleanup system will bypass with this trick.
Imagine that Register globals is on. you request a url with this parameters in Mixed Get and Post Request:
<form method=post action=&#8221;cpg/?MyVar=value&#8221;>
<input name=\_GET type=hidden>
<input name=\_REQUEST type=hidden>
<input type=submit></form>
It will append MyVar as a varable with arbitarry value before php scripts handles process{cause of register globals} and after that it give handle, predefined \_GET&\_REQUEST varables will delete. So our varable is unaccessable for checking and deleting but it exists in global area.
Don&#8217;t forget that if you like to post some other standard parameters to program, you sould not use get after here.But e.g. use post. I mean that you inject your parameter with get array and pass standard parameters (e.g. pic number or page number) with post or so&#8230; BTW you sould just one of this arrays in one time.
Cause of this bug you can create your own parameters that will attend after on source code.
