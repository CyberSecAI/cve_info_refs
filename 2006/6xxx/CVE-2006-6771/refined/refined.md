RELATED:
  - Root cause of vulnerability: The Irokez CMS application does not properly initialize variables before using them in include/require statements. This is primarily due to the use of  `$GLOBALS` array and assuming `register_globals=on`.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Multiple Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerabilities.
  - Impact of exploitation: Arbitrary remote code execution on the server. An attacker can include and execute arbitrary PHP code from a remote server by manipulating the vulnerable variables.
  - Attack vectors: By crafting a malicious URL that modifies the `$GLOBALS` array to include a malicious file hosted on an attacker controlled server.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: Attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target server and must know the path to vulnerable scripts. The vulnerable server must have `register_globals` enabled.
