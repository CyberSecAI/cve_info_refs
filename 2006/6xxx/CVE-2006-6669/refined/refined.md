Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2006-6669:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The root cause of the vulnerability is a lack of sufficient input sanitization in the exports handler of the WebCalendar application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability is specifically an XSS issue, caused by insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input before it is outputted. This allows an attacker to inject malicious web scripts into the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript or other client-side scripts into the WebCalendar application.
*   This could lead to a range of attacks, including session hijacking, data theft, or defacement of the application, potentially affecting other users.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through the WebCalendar exports handler, which is vulnerable to web script injection.
*   An attacker could potentially craft malicious input to trigger the XSS vulnerability when a user views or interacts with the exported data/content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs the ability to provide input to the vulnerable exports handler, meaning they might need to interact with WebCalendar or craft specific URL to exploit this vulnerability
*   No special privileges needed once the attacker is able to inject malicious code.

**Additional Details from the Content:**
*   The vulnerability affects versions of WebCalendar prior to 0.9.45-4sarge7 for the old stable Debian distribution (sarge) and versions prior to 1.0.5-2 for the unstable distribution (sid).
*   The stable distribution (etch) no longer contains WebCalendar packages.
*   The provided content includes information on how to upgrade the vulnerable package via apt-get or dpkg.
