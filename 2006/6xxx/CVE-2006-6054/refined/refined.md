{
  "CVE-2006-6054": {
    "Description": "The ext2 filesystem code fails to properly handle corrupted data structures, leading to an exploitable denial of service issue when read operation is being done on a crafted fs stream.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper handling of corrupted data structures in the ext2 filesystem.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "The ext2 filesystem driver does not validate data structures properly.",
       "Improper bounds checking when reading corrupted filesystem stream."
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service (system hang or crash) and potential filesystem corruption. Can be triggered by mounting and reading corrupted ext2 filesystems.",
    "Attack vectors": [
        "Mounting and reading a specially crafted, corrupted ext2 filesystem image."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Local user with mount privileges. For some cases it is stated that a privileged user is required.",
    "Additional Information": "This vulnerability is similar to CVE-2006-6053 but for the ext2 filesystem and not ext3. The fix may require an additional patch to resolve the error condition."
