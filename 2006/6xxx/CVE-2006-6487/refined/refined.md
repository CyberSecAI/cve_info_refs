Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The dt_guestbook application has a program flaw that allows for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The vulnerability is triggered due to insecure handling of user input when the PHP `register_globals` setting is enabled.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application does not properly sanitize user inputs, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
- Reliance on `register_globals`: The vulnerability is directly linked to the deprecated PHP feature `register_globals`, which is a known security risk.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Execution of arbitrary code in the victim's browser: An attacker can execute malicious JavaScript code within the victim's browser session when they interact with a specially crafted link. This can be used to steal cookies, redirect users to malicious websites, deface websites, and perform other malicious actions.
- Partial impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability: The CVSS metrics indicate that the impact is partial in terms of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Website as a tool: The vulnerable website becomes a tool for the attacker to target victims.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote attack: The attack can be performed remotely.
- Specially crafted links: The attacker creates a malicious URL which, when opened by a user, executes the malicious script. The provided example demonstrates the URL with injected Javascript code.
- Social engineering: The attacker needs to convince a victim to open the specially crafted link.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to create a malicious URL: The attacker needs to construct a URL that contains malicious JavaScript code.
- Knowledge of target site: The attacker needs to know the location of the vulnerable dt_guestbook installation.
- No authentication required: The attacker does not need to be authenticated on the application to exploit the vulnerability.
- Knowledge of PHP `register_globals` being enabled: The vulnerability is only exploitable if the PHP configuration `register_globals` is enabled.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Jesper Jurcenoks, co-founder of netVigilance, Inc.
*   The vendor, Alexander Fedorov, was notified on December 8, 2006, but was unresponsive after agreeing to correct the issue.
*   The vulnerability affects dt_guestbook version 1.0f.
*   The provided example demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability by injecting JavaScript within the `error[]` parameter.
*   The advisory provides a workaround of disabling the PHP `register_globals` setting
*   The content provides more detailed exploit information than the standard CVE description.
