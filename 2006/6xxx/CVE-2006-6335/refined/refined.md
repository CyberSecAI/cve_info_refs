{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to a buffer overflow in the parsing of CPIO archives within Sophos Anti-Virus.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "A stack-based buffer overflow occurs when veex.dll processes a long, non-null terminated filename in a CPIO archive.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges on the vulnerable system.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through a specially crafted CPIO archive containing a long, non-null terminated filename.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to send or have the target system process a malicious CPIO archive file."
