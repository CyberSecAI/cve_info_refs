{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application includes a file using a variable taken directly from user input without sanitization.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability exists due to the lack of sanitization of the `mod_root` parameter in `include.php`. This allows an attacker to include remote files.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include and execute arbitrary code from a remote server on the vulnerable server.",
  "Attack vectors": "By crafting a malicious URL with the `mod_root` parameter pointing to an attacker-controlled server, the attacker can inject and execute arbitrary code through the vulnerable script.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and must have a web server to host the malicious code. No authentication or special privileges are needed. The attacker needs to know the location of the vulnerable script."
