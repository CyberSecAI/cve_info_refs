Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2006-6482:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation and sanitization within Adobe ColdFusion MX7 (and possibly MX6). It encompasses three distinct issues:

1.  **Server Path Disclosure:**  The server reveals its local file path when an invalid request for an existing file with an unhandled extension is made and terminated with a specific string (e.g., /.jws, /.cfm).
2.  **Internal IP Address Disclosure:** The server discloses its internal network IP address when a request is made to the `/CFIDE/administrator/login.cfm` page without supplying a host.
3.  **Cross Site Scripting (XSS) Protection Bypass:** The built-in XSS protection can be bypassed by injecting a null byte (%00) within the `<script>` tag.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The server path and internal IP address disclosure vulnerabilities expose sensitive information about the server's environment.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The XSS bypass allows malicious scripts to be executed within a user's browser.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Information Gathering:** Disclosure of the server's internal path and IP address can be used to aid in more targeted attacks.
*   **Client-Side Attacks:** XSS attacks can lead to various impacts such as:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Defacement
    *   Malware distribution
    *   Phishing attacks by redirecting users

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** All three vulnerabilities are exploitable through crafting specific HTTP requests.
    *   The Path disclosure requires a request to an existing file with an invalid extension terminated with a specific string.
    *   The IP disclosure requires a GET request to the login.cfm without specifying the host
    *   The XSS bypass is triggered by injecting a null byte into script tags within a request parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network Access:**  Attackers need to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. This means they would need network access to the server.
*   **No Authentication Required:** These vulnerabilities can be triggered without prior authentication.

**Additional Notes:**
* The advisory also mentions that there was no plan to release security bulletins for these issues and they were being considered for the next major version of ColdFusion
* The advisory mentions that XSS vulnerability affects Internet Explorer.
