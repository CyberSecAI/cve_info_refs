How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Just clearing stuff out before Christmas.
========================================================================
= ColdFusion MX7 - Multiple Vulnerabilities
=
= Vendor Website:
= http://www.Adobe.com
=
= Affected Software:
= ColdFusion MX7 (and possibly MX6)
=
= Public disclosure on Monday December 11, 2006
========================================================================
== Overview ==
This advisory discloses three separate security issues in ColdFusion
MX7.
\* Server Path Disclosure \*
It is possible to cause the server to disclose the local path by making
an invalid request. This information could be used to aide in other file
or path based attacks.
The request must be for an existing file, that has an extension not
handled by the web server. (ie: not asp,aspx).
The request must be terminated with either of the following;
/.jws
/.cfm
/.cfml
/.cfc
Some example requests are;
http://serverip/page1.htm/a.cfm
http://serverip/CFIDE/administrator/analyzer/img/minus.gif/a.cfm
http://serverip/jrunscripts/jrun.ini/a.cfm
http://serverip/jrunscripts/jrunserver.store/a.cfm
http://serverip/jrunscripts/readme.txt/a.cfm
This has been confirmed against installs that do NOT have debugging or
robust exception information turned on.
Sending a request in this format returns a message similar to;
Error parsing the Tag Library Descriptor
file:/d:/sekretpath/hidden/page1.htm/..
\* Internal IP Address Disclosure \*
It is possible to cause the server to disclose the internal network IP
address of the host. This information could be used to aide in other
network based attacks.
Making a request to the /CFIDE/administrator/login.cfm page WITHOUT
supplying a host, will result in the internal IP address of the
server to be disclosed as part of an href tag.
------------------------------------------------------------------
GET /CFIDE/administrator/login.cfm HTTP/1.0
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: Microsoft-IIS/5.1
Date: Thu, 09 Nov 2006 05:44:02 GMT

------------------------------------------------------------------
\* Cross Site Scripting Protection Bypass \*
ColdFusion MX7 appears to have built in protection against cross
site scripting attacks, and will replace <script> tags with
<invalid tag>.
Example URL that is converted to a 'safe' format;
http://server/CFIDE/componentutils/cfcexplorer.cfc?
method=getcfcinhtmtestl&name=CFIDE.adminapi.administrator&
path=/cfide/adminapi/administrator.cfctest">
<script>alert()</script>
By inserting a %00 within the <script> tag, it is possible to still
conduct cross site scripting attacks against users of
Internet Explorer.
Example URL that will have script executed;
http://server/CFIDE/componentutils/cfcexplorer.cfc?
method=getcfcinhtmtestl&name=CFIDE.adminapi.administrator&
path=/cfide/adminapi/administrator.cfctest">
<%00script>alert(document.domain)</script>
== Solutions ==
Currently, the issues outlined in the report are being considered for
the next major version of ColdFusion - the release date is currently not
finalized. There is currently no plan to release security bulletins for
any of the issues from the report
