```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The phpProfiles application uses variables defined in config.php for include paths. These variables are not initialized before being used in include statements, and due to the open-source nature of the script, attackers can discover these variables (e.g., $incpath, $usrinc).

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability: Due to the lack of sanitization of the include variables, attackers can inject malicious URLs to include remote files.
- Uninitialized variables: The scripts do not initialize variables before using them in include statements, assuming `register_globals` is enabled.

Impact of exploitation:
- Remote code execution: By including a remote file containing malicious PHP code, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.
- Full compromise of the vulnerable application.

Attack vectors:
- HTTP GET requests: Exploitation is achieved by crafting a malicious URL containing the vulnerable script file and the attacker's malicious URL. The attacker can inject their URL by manipulating the vulnerable include variables via the query string.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerable script's file structure and vulnerable variable names.
- The attacker requires a server to host the malicious file to be included.
- The application needs to have `register_globals` turned on, or have other similar behavior that allows the attacker to set arbitrary variables.
