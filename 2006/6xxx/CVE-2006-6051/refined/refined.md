{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper input sanitization in the `reporter.logic.php` file of the MosReporter Joomla component. This allows an attacker to inject a remote file URL into the `mosConfig_absolute_path` parameter.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can include and execute arbitrary code from a remote server, leading to complete compromise of the vulnerable Joomla installation. This could allow the attacker to gain full control of the server, steal sensitive data, modify the website, or use it as a platform for further attacks.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "HTTP GET request"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable server, specifying the URL to the malicious file and the variable used in the php shell."
