# user\_edit.php vulnerable: User can spy out metadata of other users

### Description

Every logged in user can spy out the metadata of all other users by typing in the URL /wp-admin/user-edit.php?user\_id=XXX irrespective if he has the right to do this or not. If not in fact there will be shown the error message "You do not have permission to edit this user." but after that message the complete form with all data will also be shown.

* **Milestone**
  set to *2.1*

I can't reproduce this.

You can edit/see your own profile this way but otherwise the edit\_users cap check blocks you from editing someone else.

### [#2](#comment:2) [@adapter](https://profiles.wordpress.org/adapter) [18 years](/timeline?from=2006-09-18T18%3A30%3A38Z&precision=second "See timeline at 09/18/2006 06:30:38 PM") ago

That could be another bug.

The whole story: user-edit didn't work on my wordpress-blog www.poplog.de. Tried to edit users other than mine, but always I got the edit-form for my user though I'm the admin. Checked the code of user-edit.php and saw that there are two variables in use:

$user\_id (ID of the user to edit)

and

$user\_ID (ID of the user looged in = in this case: admin-ID = 1)

The values of both were 1 irrespective the value of user\_id in the query string.

Maybe configuration of PHP is the reason for this. PHP on this server doesn't work case sensitive. Therefore I found the bug described above.

### [#3](#comment:3) [@foolswisdom](https://profiles.wordpress.org/foolswisdom) [18 years](/timeline?from=2006-09-22T00%3A43%3A31Z&precision=second "See timeline at 09/22/2006 12:43:31 AM") ago

Hi adapter, I have not heard of PHP that is not case sensitive for variables. What PHP are you running?

* **Status**
  changed from *new* to *closed*

Thanks foolswisdom. You're right. This bug was caused by my-hacks.php. In one of my blogs I've implemented a user-tracking-functions and there I'm using $user\_id for the ID of the user logged in. Sorry!

But I'm running several installations of wordpress, some of them without any changes and in all of them you can spy out user-data.

But it's easy to patch: Add this line of code in line 71 of user-edit.php:

```
<?php if (!current_user_can('edit_users')) { include('admin-footer.php'); die(); } ?>

```

Hi Adapter,

Thank you for participating in WordPress!

Please do not mark bugs as FIXED. That is done when a fix is checked into the official source tree.

Please try to be as concise as possible. For example when you say "this bug" I do not know if you are referring to the originally reported problem or, my guess, what you thought was causing the "case insensitivity".

Please do not attach files, but attach a diff.

ENV: WP 2.0.4

Using 2 "subscribers", I have not been able to reproduce the problem you describe.

Below "You do not have permission to edit this user." the users \*own\* data is displayed. I think this experience is a bit awkward (and a new bug could be created), but this is not the bug you describe.

Closing as WORKSFORME. adapter please update with detailed steps if have reproducible scenario on clean install.

That's strange.

Yesterday I downloaded the current release WP 2.0.4 and installed it here: [​http://test.poplog.de](http://test.poplog.de). There you can register, log in and call [​http://test.poplog.de/wp-admin/user-edit.php?user\_id=1](http://test.poplog.de/wp-admin/user-edit.php?user_id=1). You will see admin's data.

Hmm - I can now reproduce this both on your test blog and my test 2.0.4 install.

I believe this affects 2.0.4 and 2.1 so is a candidate for a fictional 2.0.5 as a security release.

I'm attaching patches for 2.0.x and trunk.

Thanks Adapter. I can also now confirm the bug -- also not sure what I was doing before. Thank you for your patience and sticking with it.

I have also verified the fix.

# WordPress: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200611-10**

Flaws in WordPress allow a Denial of Service, the disclosure of user
metadata and the overwriting of restricted files.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-apps/wordpress** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.0.5** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.0.5** |

### Background

WordPress is a PHP and MySQL based multiuser blogging system.

### Description

"random" discovered that users can enter serialized objects as strings
in their profiles that will be harmful when unserialized. "adapter"
found out that user-edit.php fails to effectively deny non-permitted
users access to other user's metadata. Additionally, a directory
traversal vulnerability in the wp-db-backup module was discovered.

### Impact

By entering specially crafted strings in his profile, an attacker can
crash PHP or even the web server running WordPress. Additionally, by
crafting a simple URL, an attacker can read metadata of any other user,
regardless of their own permissions. A user with the permission to use
the database backup plugin can possibly overwrite files he otherwise
has no access to.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All WordPress users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apps/wordpress-2.0.5"
```
