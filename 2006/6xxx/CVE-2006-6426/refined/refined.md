{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `render.php` script in ThinkEdit 1.9.2 is vulnerable to Remote File Inclusion (RFI) due to the insecure use of the `template_file` parameter.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability in `render.php`"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can include a malicious file from a remote location, allowing arbitrary code execution on the server.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "By manipulating the `template_file` parameter in a GET request, an attacker can force the server to include and execute code from a remote URL."
     ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable server and have access to a web server hosting the malicious payload.",
    "additional_details": "The provided exploit code checks if the target is vulnerable by including a long string. If vulnerable, the attacker can then inject a shell by specifying the remote shell's location and command variable through the vulnerable `template_file` parameter."
