# TIN: Multiple buffer overflows — GLSA **200611-18**

Multiple buffer overflows have been reported in TIN, possibly leading to
the execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-nntp/tin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.8.2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.8.2** |

### Background

TIN is a threaded NNTP and spool based UseNet newsreader for a variety
of platforms.

### Description

Urs Janssen and Aleksey Salow have reported multiple buffer overflows
in TIN. Additionally, the OpenPKG project has reported an allocation
off-by-one flaw which can lead to a buffer overflow.

### Impact

An attacker could entice a TIN user to read a specially crafted news
article, and execute arbitrary code with the rights of the user running
TIN.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All TIN users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-nntp/tin-1.8.2"
```
