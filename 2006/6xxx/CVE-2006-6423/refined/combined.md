How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

======================================================================
1) Affected Software
MailEnable Professional Edition Version 2.35.
NOTE: Other versions may also be affected.
======================================================================
2) Severity
Rating: Highly Critical
Impact: System Access
Where: From Remote
======================================================================
3) Vendor's Description of Software
"MailEnable's mail server software provides a powerful, scalable
hosted messaging platform for Microsoft Windows. MailEnable offers
stability, unsurpassed flexibility and an extensive feature set which
allows you to provide cost-effective mail services."
Product Link:
http://www.mailenable.com/default.asp
======================================================================
4) Description of Vulnerability
Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in MailEnable, which
can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a vulnerable
system.
The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error when processing
data sent to the IMAP server. This can be exploited to cause a
stack-based buffer overflow by first sending a command in the "Not
Authenticated" state (e.g. "login" command) with a specially crafted
parameter to make the IMAP service wait for more incoming data and
then sending an overly long string (greater than 512 bytes).
Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code.
======================================================================
5) Solution
Apply hotfix ME-10025:
http://www.mailenable.com/hotfix/ME-10025.EXE
======================================================================
6) Time Table
08/12/2006 - Vendor notified.
08/12/2006 - Vendor response with hotfix information.
11/12/2006 - Public disclosure.
======================================================================
7) Credits
Discovered by JJ Reyes, Secunia Research.
======================================================================
8) References
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned
CVE-2006-6423 for the vulnerability.
