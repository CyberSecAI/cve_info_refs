Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2006-6799

**Root Cause:** Insufficient validation of user-supplied input passed to the "cmd.php" script in Cacti. This allows for SQL injection, which, in turn, is used to inject shell commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The "cmd.php" script does not properly sanitize data, allowing an attacker to inject SQL queries.
*   **Command Injection:** The results of the injected SQL queries are not properly sanitized before being passed to a command shell via `popen()`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Shell Command Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary shell commands on the server.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to sensitive information by crafting SQL queries.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable.
*   **HTTP Requests:** Attackers can inject malicious SQL and command injection payloads through crafted HTTP GET requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Cacti instance.
*   **Unauthenticated:** The exploit can be performed by an unauthenticated user.
*   **`register_argc_argv` Enabled:** The vulnerability requires that the "register_argc_argv" option is enabled in PHP, which is the default setting in Gentoo.

**Additional details:**
* The vulnerability lies in the `cmd.php` and `copy_cacti_user.php` scripts.
* The injected SQL query is used to poison the `$polling_items` array, specifically the `arg1` element, which then gets passed to `popen()` in `/include/poller.php`.
* An exploit is available that leverages this vulnerability to execute arbitrary commands by writing to a log file in the `/rra/` directory.
