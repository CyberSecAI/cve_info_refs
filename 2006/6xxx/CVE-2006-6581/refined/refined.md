- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `debug_test.php` script in Phpdebug 1.1.0 includes a file based on the value of the `debugClassLocation` parameter passed via HTTP GET. This parameter is not sanitized, allowing for a remote file inclusion vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Remote File Inclusion (RFI). The `include_once()` function uses a user-controlled variable (`debugClassLocation`) without validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can include and execute arbitrary PHP code from a remote server, leading to potential full compromise of the affected web server and the application.
- **Attack vectors**: HTTP GET request to the `debug_test.php` script with a malicious URL passed to the `debugClassLocation` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server where Phpdebug is hosted and have access to a server hosting malicious PHP code.
