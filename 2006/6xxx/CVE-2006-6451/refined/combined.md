Original Advisory:
============
<http://www.majorsecurity.de/index_2.php?major_rls=major_rls34>

Introduction
============
Developed for Professional Hosting Service Providers (HSP) and Corporate IT \
Professionals,  Plesk 8.0 provides the most complete and stable set of features in \
the industry. Plesk 8.0 provides the perfect solution for IT service providers to \
increase clientele and  customize their systems to meet their corporate customers \
growing needs for self administration.

More Details
============
Cross Site Scripting(in URL):
Input passed directly to the "get_password.php" and "login_up.php3" file is not \
properly sanitised before being returned to the user. This can be exploited to \
execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an \
affected site.

Fix
===
None known

Solution
=============
Edit the source code to ensure that input is properly sanitised.
You should work with "htmlspecialchars()" or "htmlentities()" php-function to ensure \
that html tags are not going to be executed. Further it is recommend to set off the \
"register globals" option in the "php.ini" on your webserver.

Example:
$pass = htmlentities($_POST['pass']);
$test = htmlspecialchars($_GET('test'));
?>

History/Timeline
================
