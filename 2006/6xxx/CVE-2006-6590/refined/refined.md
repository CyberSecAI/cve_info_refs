{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `usercp_menu.php` script includes a file based on the value of the `script_folder` parameter without proper sanitization.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Remote File Inclusion (RFI). The script directly uses the value provided in the `script_folder` parameter in an `include` statement, allowing an attacker to include a remote file.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include and execute arbitrary code from a remote server, potentially leading to full server compromise.",
  "Attack vectors": "By sending a crafted HTTP request to `usercp_menu.php` with a malicious URL in the `script_folder` parameter.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. They also need a server with a malicious PHP file to include. No authentication is needed to exploit the vulnerability."
