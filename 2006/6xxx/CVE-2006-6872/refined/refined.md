  "CVE-2006-6872": {
    "RELATED": true,
    "summary": "Multiple vulnerabilities including SQL injection, local file inclusion, and cross-site scripting are present in eNdonesia 8.4.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      {
        "WEAKNESS": "SQL Injection",
         "DESCRIPTION": "SQL injection vulnerabilities exist in the `diskusi` and `katalog` modules, which can be exploited through the `did` and `cid` parameters.",
        "IMPACT": "An attacker can retrieve usernames and password hashes (MD5) from the database or potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries and insert a PHP shell to gain remote code execution.",
        "ATTACK_VECTOR": "By manipulating the `did` and `cid` parameters in the URL, the attacker can inject SQL code.",
         "REQUIRED_CAPABILITIES": "The attacker needs a web browser and the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application."
      },
      {
         "WEAKNESS": "Local File Inclusion",
        "DESCRIPTION": "A local file inclusion vulnerability exists in the `mod.php` module through the `mod` parameter.",
        "IMPACT": "An attacker can access and potentially view sensitive files from the server, such as `/etc/passwd`.",
        "ATTACK_VECTOR": "By crafting a URL with the `mod` parameter, the attacker can include local files",
        "REQUIRED_CAPABILITIES": "The attacker needs a web browser and the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application."
      },
      {
         "WEAKNESS": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
        "DESCRIPTION":"Multiple XSS vulnerabilities are present in the `mod.php`, `friend.php`, and `admin.php` modules.",
        "IMPACT": "An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript or HTML code into the web application. This can be used to steal cookies, redirect users, or perform other malicious actions within the context of the user's browser.",
        "ATTACK_VECTOR": "Crafting malicious JavaScript code in the vulnerable inputs (`mod`, `friend`, `Main Text`) and passing them in the URL.",
        "REQUIRED_CAPABILITIES":"The attacker needs a web browser and the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application."
