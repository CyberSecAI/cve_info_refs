CVE-2006-6719:
Root cause of vulnerability: An unchecked boundary condition in the `ftp_syst` function of `wget` leads to a segmentation fault due to an out-of-bounds read when processing a crafted FTP server response.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
  - Unchecked boundary condition in `ftp_syst` function.
  - Vulnerability present in `wget` version 1.10.2 and earlier.
  -  Specifically, it seems to be triggered by the response of an FTP server to the `SYST` command.
  
Impact of exploitation:
  - Denial of Service (DoS) - The vulnerability causes a segmentation fault, crashing the `wget` application.

Attack vectors:
  - An attacker sets up a malicious FTP server that sends a specific crafted response to the `SYST` command when `wget` connects.
  - The `wget` client attempts to connect to the malicious FTP server and process the crafted response which leads to the crash.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
  - Ability to host a malicious FTP server and make the victim's `wget` client connect to it.
