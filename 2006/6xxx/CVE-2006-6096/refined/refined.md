Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The ActiveNews Manager software suffers from multiple vulnerabilities due to insufficient input sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** Multiple .asp pages (`activeNews_categories.asp`, `activeNews_comments.asp`, `activenews_view.asp`, `default.asp`) are vulnerable to SQL injection. This is due to unsanitized user-supplied parameters (e.g. `catID`, `articleID`, `page`) being directly incorporated into SQL queries.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The `activenews_search.asp` page is vulnerable to XSS, likely due to unsanitized user input in the `query` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **SQL Injection:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to:
    - Read, modify, or delete arbitrary data within the database.
    - Potentially gain unauthorized access to the server, depending on database configuration and permissions.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** An attacker could inject malicious scripts that are executed in the browsers of other users who visit the vulnerable page. This could allow them to:
    - Steal cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information.
    - Redirect users to malicious websites.
    - Deface or manipulate content displayed on the page.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **SQL Injection:** Malicious SQL code is injected into the vulnerable parameters of the listed .asp pages via HTTP GET requests.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Malicious script code is injected into the `query` parameter of the `activenews_search.asp` page via HTTP GET requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected web application.
- No special privileges or access is explicitly required; the vulnerabilities are present in publicly accessible pages.

**Additional Notes:**
The provided advisory lists specific URLs and vulnerable parameters, providing concrete examples of how to exploit the vulnerabilities.
