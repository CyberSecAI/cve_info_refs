  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2006-6813",
      "description": "File Upload Manager 1.0.6 is vulnerable to SQL injection via the 'detail.asp' page. The ID parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL queries.",
      "root_cause": "The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the 'ID' parameter of the 'detail.asp' page.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "SQL Injection"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to sensitive data disclosure, modification, or deletion. In this specific exploit, the attacker aims to extract usernames and passwords from the 'tbl_members' table.",
      "attack_vector": "A remote attacker can send a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the 'detail.asp' page with a malicious SQL query in the 'ID' parameter.",
       "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and have knowledge of the application's URL structure and the existence of the vulnerable 'detail.asp' page. Some basic knowledge of SQL injection is required. They need to guess the path to the application directory and guess the user id."
