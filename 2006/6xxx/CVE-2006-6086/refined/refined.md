Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2006-6086:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**

The content from `exploit-db.com` explicitly mentions "CVE-2006-6086" and describes a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability in e-Ark 1.0. The other documents corroborate this information by pointing to the same vulnerable code snippets. Therefore, the content is related to CVE-2006-6086.

**2. Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the use of `require_once` with a user-controlled variable in multiple files. Specifically, the `$cfg_pear_path`, `$cfg_phpmailer_path` and `$cfg_vcard_path` variables are used in `ark_inc.php`, `email_inc.php`, and `vcard_inc.php` respectively, to include external files. These variables are not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject a URL to include a malicious file.

**3. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
   - **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application includes external files based on user-provided input without proper validation or sanitization.
   - **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize the `$cfg_pear_path`, `$cfg_phpmailer_path` and `$cfg_vcard_path` variables, allowing attackers to inject malicious URLs.
   - **Use of `require_once` with user input**: The usage of `require_once` with a variable that can be manipulated by the user allows the attacker to execute code on the server by including a malicious file hosted on a remote server.

**4. Impact of exploitation:**

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to:
   - Execute arbitrary code on the server by including a malicious file.
   - Potentially gain complete control of the affected web server and the application.
   - Access sensitive data stored on the server.
   - Compromise the integrity and availability of the application.

**5. Attack vectors:**
   - **HTTP GET parameter:** The attacker can manipulate the `cfg_pear_path`, `cfg_phpmailer_path` and `cfg_vcard_path` parameters in the URL to inject the path of a malicious file for inclusion.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**
   - **Network access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable web server.
   - **Basic understanding of web requests:** The attacker needs to be able to manipulate HTTP GET requests to inject malicious file paths.
   - **Ability to host a malicious file:** The attacker needs to host a file containing malicious PHP code that will be included and executed by the vulnerable application.

**Additional Details (From Exploit-DB Content):**
-  The exploit code provided at exploit-db.com is a Perl script that automates the exploitation process, it takes as parameters the target, the URL of the malicious code, and the name of the command execution variable.
- The script takes input to run commands on the remote server through the malicious code.

In summary, CVE-2006-6086 is a Remote File Inclusion vulnerability in e-Ark 1.0 due to insecure use of `require_once` with user-controlled variables. This allows attackers to inject and execute arbitrary code by including files from remote servers.
