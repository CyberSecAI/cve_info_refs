- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient bounds checking of a userspace parameter supplied to the `ptrace(2)` system call, specifically when handling the `PT_DUMPCORE` request.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Lack of proper validation of user-provided input to `ptrace(2)` when dumping core, leading to an out-of-bounds access.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The content does not specify the exact impact but implies it's a security issue that requires patching the kernel to fix, possibly leading to arbitrary memory access, denial of service, or code execution depending on the specific nature of out-of-bounds access.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by making a crafted `ptrace(2)` call with the `PT_DUMPCORE` request using a malicious parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to make `ptrace(2)` system calls.
