{
  "CVE-2006-6424": [
    {
      "Root cause": "Insufficient validation of user-input length values when literals are appended to IMAP verbs.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Heap-based buffer overflow"
      ],
      "Impact": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code on affected versions of Novell NetMail. It may also cause a denial-of-service condition.",
      "Attack vectors": [
        "Network"
      ],
      "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to send crafted IMAP verb literals to the server. Authentication is not required."
    },
    {
        "Root cause": "The NMAP server lacks bounds checking on parameters supplied to the STOR command.",
        "Weaknesses": [
          "Buffer overflow"
        ],
        "Impact": "Remote, authenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial-of-service condition.",
        "Attack vectors": [
          "Network"
        ],
        "Required attacker capabilities": "Successful exploitation requires the attacker to successfully authenticate to the affected service. The vulnerable daemon, nmapd.exe, binds to TCP port 689."
