Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2006-6755 (Note that the exploit also mentions CVE-2006-6756, but the code and description primarily focus on the vulnerability related to CVE-2006-6755)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper sanitization of the `story_id` parameter in the `ixm_ixpnews.php` script before being used in an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Blind SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to blind SQL injection, allowing an attacker to infer information from the database by observing the application's response to different SQL queries. Specifically, the attacker can use boolean-based blind SQL injection by observing whether a comment is displayed or not, depending on the true/false result of the crafted SQL query.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The `story_id` parameter isn't sanitized before being used in SQL queries, which makes the injection possible.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, such as:
    - Administrator's User ID (UID)
    - Administrator's Username
    - Administrator's Password Hash
    - Full Path Disclosure (FPD) of the application's `mainfile.php`
    - The secret `IXP_CODE` used for protecting the administration panel (through `load_file` SQL injection)

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is performed by crafting malicious HTTP GET requests to `ixm_ixpnews.php`, injecting SQL code through the `story_id` parameter.
- **Blind SQL Injection Technique:** The exploit utilizes boolean-based blind SQL injection to extract data by sending crafted SQL queries and observing the page response based on whether the condition is true or false.
- **`load_file` SQL Injection:** This technique can be used to read local files from the server and to extract the `IXP_CODE`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web application.
- **Basic Understanding of SQL Injection:** The attacker must understand SQL syntax and how to exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities.
- **No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability**

**Additional Details:**
- The exploit script attempts to bypass any anti-flood mechanism by inserting `sleep(2)` calls between requests.
- The script identifies and extracts the following information:
    - Story ID
    - Administrator UID
    - Administrator Username Length
    - Administrator Username
    - Administrator password hash
    - Full Path Disclosure
    - Confidential `ixp code`.
- The `IXP_CODE` is protected by the mainfile.php file. The code tries to retrieve it using load_file and regexp.
- The exploit script uses a character set to extract the data using the blind sql injection. The character set varies based on the data the script is trying to retrieve
- The exploit works even if magic_quotes_gpc is on.
