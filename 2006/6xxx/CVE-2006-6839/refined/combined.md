Hi,

Thank you. I'm aware of the new release, but need to backport the
changes given that we're in a freeze.

> [CVE-2006-6841](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-6841):
> Certain forms in phpBB before 2.0.22 lack session checks

This is Cross Site Request Forgery.

> [CVE-2006-6840](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-6840):
> Unspecified vulnerability in phpBB before 2.0.22 has unknown impact

This does not seem to warrant an update in its own: everything about it
is unkown.

> [CVE-2006-6839](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-6839):

This is very vague again. Summarizing all three I do not see a 'grave'
issue between them, but will see what the patches look like and whether
they're acceptable for etch at this point.

thanks,
Thijs

Hi,

Here's the relevant patches, isolated from the upstream release.

Indeed counter-CSRF, attached as sid.diff.

Still unknown how it can be exploited, but diff is attached and seems
quite harmless. Fix just in case? start.diff

Attached as redir.diff, also seems quite harmless to include.

I'm quite sure that this is a duplicate of the CSRF above.

Attached as privmsg.diff.

I think this is it. Jeroen: opinions on what to upload?

I'd include all, although I'm not convinced all are really exploitable
the fixes are harmless and with webapps like this it's hard to tell for
sure something is *not* exploitable -- so many potential entry points to
code.

Hi,

This bug was closed in the recent 2.0.21-6 upload of phpbb2, but the

Hi everyone,

phpBB Group announces the release of phpBB 2.0.22. This release addresses several bugfixes and some security issues.

Language pack authors may note that one additional language variable had been added.

As with all new releases we urge you to update as soon as possible. You can of course find this download available on our [downloads page](http://www.phpbb.com/downloads.php). As per usual four packages are available to simplify your update.

* **Full Package**

  Contains entire phpBB2 source and English language package
* **Changed Files Only**

  Contains only those files changed from previous versions of phpBB. Please note this archive contains changed files for each previous release
* **Patch Files**

  Contains patch compatible patches from the previous versions of phpBB.
* **Code Changes**

  Contains step-by-step instructions in MOD format for updating heavily MODified installs

Select whichever package is most suitable for you.

**Please ensure you read the INSTALL and README documents in docs/ before proceeding with installation or updates!**.

It is important that you carry out **both** parts of the update - updating the files and running the database update script - for updates to be complete.

**What has changed in this release?**

* [Fix] Check for user's existence prior to showing email form

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Debian Bug     : 388120 405980 463589

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in phpBB, a web
based bulletin board.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:

CVE-2008-0471

	Private messaging allowed cross site request forgery, making
	it possible to delete all private messages of a user by sending
	them to a crafted web page.

CVE-2006-6841 / CVE-2006-6508

	Cross site request forgery enabled an attacker to perform various
	actions on behalf of a logged in user. (Applies to sarge only)

CVE-2006-6840

	A negative start parameter could allow an attacker to create
	invalid output. (Applies to sarge only)

CVE-2006-6839

	Redirection targets were not fully checked, leaving room for
	unauthorised external redirections via a phpBB forum.
	(Applies to sarge only)

CVE-2006-4758

	An authenticated forum administrator may upload files of any
	type by using specially crafted filenames. (Applies to sarge only)

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed
in version 2.0.21-7.

For the old stable distribution (sarge), these problems have been
fixed in version 2.0.13+1-6sarge4.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed
in version 2.0.22-3.

We recommend that you upgrade your phpbb2 package.
