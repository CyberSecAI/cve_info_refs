      "more_details": "The provided Metasploit module targets various Windows versions, indicating the vulnerability allows for arbitrary code execution by overwriting the return address on the stack. The exploit crafted a payload and a return address to jump to the beginning of the payload.  A specific stack adjustment is required in the payload to execute correctly."

There is also a read access violation possible but marked as non-exploitable. The exploit sends padding bytes, followed by an overwritten SEH handler and some data."
