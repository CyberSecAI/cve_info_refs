    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2006-6513",
      "source": "aluigi.altervista.org_7d81553a_20250124_191145.html",
      "root_cause": "Multiple vulnerabilities exist in the Winamp Web Interface (Wawi) plugin due to insufficient input validation and buffer handling.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        {
          "weakness": "Buffer overflow in `FindBasicAuth` function.",
          "description": "The `FindBasicAuth` function, which parses the Authorization HTTP field, copies the auth mode and base64 encoded username:password into a fixed-size buffer of 100 bytes. This operation uses `GetAString()` which limits strings to 255 characters. However, the buffer is limited to 100 bytes, leading to a potential buffer overflow if the username:password field exceeds the buffer's capacity.",
          "impact": "While the report doesn't indicate remote code execution is possible, it suggests a potential denial-of-service or other unexpected behavior due to memory corruption.",
          "attack_vector": "Remote, via a specially crafted HTTP request with a long Authorization header.",
          "required_capabilities": "No privileges are required."
        },
       {
          "weakness": "Directory Traversal in `Browse` function.",
          "description": "The `Browse` function, which shows files in a folder, converts slashes to backslashes before path validation using the `GoodPath()` function. However, it doesn't convert hex-encoded slashes (%2f) allowing an attacker to bypass `GoodPath()` and browse any folder within the root directory. This function only allows for browsing and not downloading.",
          "impact": "Unauthorized browsing of directories within the root directory.",
          "attack_vector": "Remote, via a specially crafted HTTP request with hex-encoded slashes in the path parameter.",
          "required_capabilities": "Requires 'Browse' privileges."
        },
        {
          "weakness": "Buffer overflows in `Browse`, `Download`, and `Load` functions.",
          "description": "The `Browse`, `CControl::Download`, and `CControl::Load` functions use a fixed-size buffer of `MAX_PATH` (260 bytes) when constructing a path string by concatenating the root directory and the client-provided path. If the client provided path, which is also limited to 260 bytes, is too long, it can cause a buffer overflow when the root path is concatenated.",
           "impact": "Potential for denial-of-service or potentially arbitrary code execution due to memory corruption.",
          "attack_vector": "Remote, via a specially crafted HTTP request with a long file path or name.",
          "required_capabilities": "Requires privileges associated with the specific function exploited (Browse, Download, or Load)."
        },
        {
          "weakness": "File extension check bypass in `Download` function.",
           "description": "The `CControl::Download` function checks if a requested file is of a permitted type by using the `IsWinampFile()` function and if allowed by configuration. However, adding a dot after the filename allows bypassing the extension check and allows downloading any file within the root directory.",
           "impact": "Unauthorized downloading of any file in the root directory.",
           "attack_vector": "Remote, via a specially crafted HTTP request with a dot appended to the requested filename.",
           "required_capabilities": "Requires 'Download' privileges."
        },
        {
          "weakness": "Root directory path bypass through name collision.",
           "description": "The plugin requires a backslash before the path. If a folder or file with the same beginning name as the root directory exists in the same location as the root directory, that folder or file can be accessed by using its path instead of the configured root directory path.",
           "impact": "Potentially allows browsing or downloading files from a location other than the configured root directory.",
           "attack_vector": "Remote, via a specially crafted HTTP request with a path that matches the beginning of the configured root path.",
           "required_capabilities": "Requires privileges of the function being called, and luck in naming collisions."
