    {
      "cve": "CVE-2006-4592",
      "source": "www.exploit-db.com_df047062_20250126_000426.html",
      "root_cause": "The application failed to properly sanitize user-supplied input when constructing SQL queries.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "SQL Injection"
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries against the application's database. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification or deletion of data, and potentially the ability to execute arbitrary code on the database server.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "The vulnerability can be triggered by crafting a malicious HTTP request to the 'default.asp' page, specifically by manipulating the 'id' parameter within the query string."
      ],
       "attacker_capabilities": [
        "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.",
        "The database must support the UNION operator."
      ],
      "description": "SimpleBlog 2.3 is vulnerable to remote SQL injection. The vendor attempted to sanitize input by removing characters like '=' and ' but failed to remove '>'. An attacker can leverage this oversight to inject SQL queries. For example, using a crafted URL like `http://[target]/[path]/default.asp?view=plink&id=-1%20UNION%20SELECT%20ID,uFULLNAME,uUSERNAME,uPASSWORD,uEMAIL,uDATECREATED,null,null,null%20FROM%20T_USERS%20WHERE%20id>1`"
