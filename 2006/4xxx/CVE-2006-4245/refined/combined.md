Package: archivemail
Version: 0.6.2-1
Severity: grave
Tags: security

tempfile.mktemp in python has this comment:

    User-callable function to return a unique temporary file name.  The
    file is not created.

    Arguments are as for mkstemp, except that the 'text' argument is
    not accepted.

    This function is unsafe and should not be used.  The file name
    refers to a file that did not exist at some point, but by the time
    you get around to creating it, someone else may have beaten you to
    the punch.

While I was looking over archivemail's source due to bug #385249, I
noticed that it creates temporary files insecurely.

        temp_name = tempfile.mktemp("retain")
        self.mbox_file = open(temp_name, "w")

So this seems raceable. Here's another one:

        temp_name = tempfile.mktemp("archive")
        if os.path.isfile(final_name):
            vprint("file already exists that is named: %s" % final_name)
            shutil.copy2(final_name, temp_name)
        _stale.archive = temp_name
        self.mbox_file = open(temp_name, "a")

There are a few more like that.

There are also a lot of other uses of mktemp in the test suite, which
could lead to security problems at build time.

I've attached the patch that I came up with after this little audit. I'll be
releasing to unstable, but thought I should file the bug so this can be hadled
for stable and in case someone wants to get a CVE and such. Upstream
maintainers are CC'd.

Oh, one other funny thing, the TODO has this in it:
"Check for symlink attacks for tempfiles (although we don't use /var/tmp)"

This is [CVE-2006-4245](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-4245).  Please mention that in a future changelog entry
for unstable.  (I see that you already uploaded 0.6.2-2 to fix this in
unstable.)

Upon investigating this for stable, I wonder if the problem is as bad as
reported.  It seems that archivemail sets up its own temp directory and
creates its files in it:

    # create a temporary directory for us to work in securely
    old_temp_dir = tempfile.tempdir
    tempfile.tempdir = None
    new_temp_dir = tempfile.mktemp('archivemail')
    assert(new_temp_dir)
    os.mkdir(new_temp_dir)
    _stale.temp_dir = new_temp_dir
    tempfile.tempdir = new_temp_dir
    vprint("set tempfile directory to '%s'" % new_temp_dir)

I don't really know python at all, but it seems like it might be OK.  Do
you agree?

yes, next release will have all the info in that changelog entry. Thanks

Not being a python programmer, I missed the tempfile.tempdir setting,
which, if it makes tempfile.mktemp use that temp dir, should make the
program safe for all calls to mktemp from then on. Whether it's
exploitable would thus depend on whether there are any calls to the
other functions first. It seems like those calls all happen afterwards,
I'm not 100% sure.

The test suite still seems raceable for sure, though that's lower
exploitability.

I've examined this, and I think there is no security issue in
archivemail.py.

    There are four calls to tempfile.mktemp(): two in the constructor of
the ArchiveMbox class, one in the RetainMbox class constructor, and
finally, one in the archive() function.  The latter is the code section
Noah has cited above, and since the umask is set to 077 before and
tempfile.tempdir is set, it should all be safe.  Though I'd say it's
still reasonable to patch the code to use mkstemp() instead.

Agreed.  Does this whole thing warrant a CVE?
