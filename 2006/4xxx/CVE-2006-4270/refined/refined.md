```
Root cause of vulnerability: The mambelfish component for Mambo includes a file from a path specified in the mosConfig_absolute_path parameter without proper sanitization.
Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Remote File Inclusion (RFI)
Impact of exploitation: An attacker can include a malicious file from a remote server, leading to arbitrary code execution on the vulnerable server.
Attack vectors: HTTP GET request with a manipulated `mosConfig_absolute_path` parameter in the URL.
Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server, and host the malicious script on a server they control.
