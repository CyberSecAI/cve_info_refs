{
  "CVE-2006-4447": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The X.Org software fails to properly check the return value of the `setuid()` system call when dropping privileges, allowing it to continue running with root privileges even if the call fails due to resource limits.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Insufficient validation of `setuid()` return values in X.Org programs.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Local privilege escalation: an attacker can run arbitrary code with elevated privileges (root). Attackers can potentially overwrite any files on the vulnerable system using the 'save as' dialog box, leading to a Denial of Service.",
      "Attack vectors": "Local exploitation.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An authenticated local user needs to exceed their resource limits, causing the setuid call to fail and letting the affected program continue running as root. The attacker needs the ability to execute setuid programs."
    },
        {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability arises because X.Org programs do not check if the `setuid()` system call was successful when dropping root privileges. This is because `setuid()`, `seteuid()`, and `setgid()` may fail if the 'maximum processes' ulimit is reached.",
     "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Failure to validate return values of setuid-related system calls.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "A successful attack allows an authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.",
      "Attack vectors": "Local exploitation, through programs supplied with the X.Org distribution that typically run with elevated privileges.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be a local user with the ability to execute X.Org programs that are setuid to root and needs to trigger the failure of the setuid() call by exceeding resource limits."
