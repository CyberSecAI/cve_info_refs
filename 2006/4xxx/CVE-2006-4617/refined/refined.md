- **Root cause of vulnerability:**
    - Unrestricted file upload due to lack of privilege checks in `fileupload.html`.
    - Insufficient sanitization of user-controlled input in the `description` variable across modules and the `solution` variable in the `HelpDesk` module.
    - Missing privilege checks for accessing administrative modules.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Arbitrary file upload leading to potential code execution.
    - Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
    - Privilege bypass allowing unauthorized access to administrative functionalities.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Remote command execution by uploading and executing malicious files.
    - Execution of arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session.
    - Unauthorized modification of application settings and access to sensitive data through administrative modules.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Accessing the `fileupload.html` page directly to upload files.
    - Injecting malicious script into the `description` or `solution` variables.
    - Directly accessing administrative module URLs.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to access the vulnerable web application. For the privilege bypass they need to have a user account, for other vulnerabilities no login is needed.
