## Microsoft Word 2000 malformed record vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#806548

Original Release Date: 2006-09-07 | Last Revised: 2006-10-10

---

### Overview

Microsoft Word 2000 contains a memory corruption vulnerability. This vulnerability could allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Word 2000.

### Description

| Microsoft Word 2000 fails to properly handle malformed records leading to memory corruption. For more information refer to Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS06-060](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms06-060.mspx).  Note that we have received reports that this vulnerability is actively being exploited. |
| --- |

### Impact

| By convincing a user to open a specially crafted Word document, an attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Word 2000. If the user is logged in with administrative privileges, the attacker could take complete control of a vulnerable system. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update** This vulnerability is addressed in Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS06-060](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms06-060.mspx). |
| --- |

| **Do not open untrusted Word documents**  Do not open unfamiliar or unexpected Word or other Office documents, particularly those hosted on web sites or delivered as email attachments. Please see Cyber Security Tip [ST04-010](http://www.us-cert.gov/cas/tips/ST04-010.html) for more information.**Do not rely on file name extension filtering**In most cases, Windows will call Word to open a document even if the document has an unknown file extension. For example, if document.qwer contains the correct file header information, Windows will open document.qwer with Word. Filtering for common extensions (e.g., .doc, .dot, .rtf) may not detect all Word documents. |

### General Information

## Executive Summary

**Executive Summary:**

This update addresses several newly discovered, privately reported and public vulnerabilities. Each vulnerability is documented in this bulletin in its own "Vulnerability Details" section.

When using vulnerable versions of Office, if a user were logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could take complete control of the client workstation. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

We recommend that customers apply the update immediately.

## Vulnerability Details

#### Microsoft Word Vulnerability - CVE-2006-3647:

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Word. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability when Word parsed a file that contains a malformed string. Such a specially crafted file might be included as an e-mail attachment or hosted on a malicious web site. Viewing or previewing a malformed e-mail message in Outlook could not lead to exploitation of this vulnerability.

If a user were logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less affected than users who operate with administrative user rights.

#### Mitigating Factors for Microsoft Word Vulnerability - CVE-2006-3647:

* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Word file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site.
* The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message.
* Users who have installed and are using the [Office Document Open Confirmation Tool](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=8b5762d2-077f-4031-9ee6-c9538e9f2a2f) for Office 2000 will be prompted with **Open**, **Save**, or **Cancel** before opening a document. The features of the Office Document Open Confirmation Tool are incorporated in Office XP and Office 2003.

#### Workarounds for Microsoft Word Vulnerability - CVE-2006-3647:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

Do not open or save Microsoft Word files that you receive from untrusted sources or that you received unexpectedly from trusted sources. This vulnerability could be exploited when a user opens a file.

#### FAQ for Microsoft Word Mail Merge Vulnerability - CVE-2006-3651:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Microsoft Word, and could be exploited when Word opens a specially crafted mail merge file. Such a specially crafted file might be included as an e-mail attachment or hosted on a malicious web site. Viewing or previewing a malformed e-mail message in an affected version of Outlook could not lead to exploitation of this vulnerability. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Word file that could allow remote code execution.

If a user were logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less affected than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

When Microsoft Word opens a specially crafted Word mail merge file, it may corrupt system memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause arbitrary code to run with the privileges of the user who opened the file.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

In an e-mail attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially-crafted file to the user and by persuading the user to open the file.

In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Word file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability.

For more information about how to deploy security updates using Windows Server Update Services, visit the [Windows Server Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=50120).

**Systems Management Server:**

Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) delivers a highly configurable enterprise solution for managing updates. By using SMS, administrators can identify Windows-based systems that require security updates and can perform controlled deployment of these updates throughout the enterprise with minimal disruption to end users. For more information about how administrators can use SMS 2003 to deploy security updates, visit the [SMS 2003 Security Patch Management Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=22939). SMS 2.0 users can also use [Software Updates Service Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33340) to help deploy security updates. For information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

**Note** SMS uses the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer, the Microsoft Office Detection Tool, and the Enterprise Update Scan Tool to provide broad support for security bulletin update detection and deployment. Some software updates may not be detected by these tools. Administrators can use the inventory capabilities of the SMS in these cases to target updates to specific systems. For more information about this procedure, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33341). Some security updates require administrative rights following a restart of the system. Administrators can use the Elevated Rights Deployment Tool (available in the [SMS 2003 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33387) and in the [SMS 2.0 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21161)) to install these updates.
