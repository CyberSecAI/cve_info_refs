  "CVE-2006-4704": {
    "description": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the WMI Object Broker control that the WMI Wizard uses in Visual Studio 2005. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Web page that could potentially allow remote code execution if a user viewed the Web page. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system.",
    "root_cause": "Improper validation of controls instantiated by WMI Object Broker.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "The WMI Object Broker ActiveX control, marked as 'safe for scripting', allows a web page to control it and create instances of other ActiveX controls. This bypasses the ActiveX security model, ignoring kill bits and 'safe for scripting' options of the instantiated controls."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can achieve remote code execution with the privileges of the user, potentially gaining complete control of the affected system. This includes the ability to install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new accounts.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A specially crafted web page.",
      "HTML documents such as HTML emails or attachments."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to host a webpage containing the malicious code or send a specially crafted HTML document. They would need to persuade the user to visit the website or open the HTML document.",
      "additional_info": "The vulnerability resides in the wmiscriptutils.dll file. The vulnerability is actively being exploited. Internet Explorer 7 and Windows Server 2003 with Enhanced Security Configuration enabled by default, mitigate the vulnerability to some extent, but are not completely protected."
