Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of sanitization of the `$spaw_root` variable in the SL_Site application. When `register_globals` is enabled in PHP, this allows an attacker to inject malicious PHP code by manipulating the `$spaw_root` variable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to include remote files, achieved by controlling the `$spaw_root` variable.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize user-provided input, specifically the `$spaw_root` variable, before using it in a file inclusion context.
*   **`register_globals` Dependency:** The exploitability is dependent on the PHP setting `register_globals` being enabled, which is a deprecated feature and generally considered insecure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Code Execution:** By injecting a malicious script through the `$spaw_root` variable, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Full System Compromise:** Successful code execution can lead to complete compromise of the server and any sensitive data it hosts.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Parameter:** The attack vector is the manipulation of the `spaw_root` GET parameter in the URL.
*   **Remote:** The attack can be launched remotely over a network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
*   **PHP Knowledge:** The attacker needs some basic knowledge of PHP to craft the malicious script.
*  **Vulnerable Application:** Attacker need to find instance of vulnerable application SL_Site <= 1.0

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable file is located at `admin/editeur/spaw_control.class.php`.
*   The exploit involves crafting a URL like `http://site.com/[path]/admin/editeur/spaw_control.class.php?spaw_root=[Evil_Script]`.
*   The solution recommended is to declare the `$spaw_root` variable to prevent injection.
