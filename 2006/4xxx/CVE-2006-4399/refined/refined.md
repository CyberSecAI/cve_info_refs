Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2006-4399:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a flaw in Apple Workgroup Manager, where it incorrectly handles the enabling of ShadowHash passwords in a NetInfo parent. Specifically, it appears to allow switching authentication types from "crypt" to "ShadowHash," but this change is not actually applied.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Authentication Type Handling:** Workgroup Manager falsely indicates a switch to ShadowHash passwords while actually still using the weaker "crypt" method.
*   **User Interface Misrepresentation:** The user interface misleads administrators by making it appear as though ShadowHash passwords are enabled when they are not.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Password Security:**  The primary impact is that user passwords remain stored using the less secure "crypt" method instead of the intended ShadowHash method. This makes them more vulnerable to cracking attempts.
*  **Misleading System Configuration:** System administrators may believe they have properly secured passwords, leading to a false sense of security.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   An attacker who gains access to the password hashes stored using the weaker "crypt" method could attempt to crack the passwords offline.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker would need access to the system's NetInfo database where user passwords are stored.
*   The attacker would need to exploit the weakness by knowing that the passwords have not actually been migrated to ShadowHash.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability can be detected by simply refreshing the view of an account in the affected NetInfo parent.
*   Apple addressed this issue in Security Update 2006-006.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Chris Pepper of The Rockefeller University.
