    "CVE-2006-4226": {
      "status": "RELEVANT",
      "details": {
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from MySQL's inconsistent handling of database names, specifically the case-sensitivity of database names when creating them.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "MySQL's permission system does not properly normalize database names, leading to case-sensitive discrepancies.",
           "The filesystem on the operating system being used allows for the creation of directories with different casing.",
          "The MySQL server allows users with privileges to a database to create a new database with the same name but differing only in case."
        ],
        "impact": "An attacker can bypass access control restrictions and create a new database by exploiting the case-sensitivity issue in database naming. This new database, although seemingly related to the original database due to the name, can be used to store unauthorized data.",
        "attack_vectors": "A user with 'CREATE' privileges on a specific database can exploit this flaw.",
        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must have a valid MySQL account with 'CREATE' privileges to a specific database.",
        "additional_info": "The vulnerability is also applicable to the use of wildcards like underscores in database names. Additionally, this vulnerability was fixed in MySQL versions 4.1.21, 5.0.25 and 5.1.12"
