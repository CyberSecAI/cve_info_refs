# Hardened PHP

PHP is far and away the most popular backend programming
language today, with more than 80 websites worldwide taking advantage of PHP
solutions.

All of the most popular CMS platforms – including WordPress,
Joomla!, and Drupal (just to name a few) leverage this technology. It’s
flexibility and versatility make it a powerhouse programming language, but that
doesn’t necessarily mean that it is as secure as it could or should be “right
out of the box”, so to speak.

It’s popularity, it’s widespread adaptation, and its
relatively easy to learn structure has made PHP a major target for cyber
criminals and hackers to exploit. This is why it’s mission-critical that you
harden your PHP files server-side as much as possible, protecting your server,
your content, and your visitors from these kinds of dangerous exploits.

PHP can be hardened manually as well as with patching
protocols. Below we highlight the steps you’ll want to take to make sure that
your PHP installation is as locked down as possible.

**Locate the PHP Config File You’re Hardening on Your Server**

The very first step in hardening your PHP installation is
first finding the PHP configuration file on your server to begin with.

Depending on the hosting that you are taking advantage of
(the actual provider as well as the type of hosting you have selected) it can
be in a variety of different locations. The best way to quickly locate this
critical file is to simply do a server-side search for “PHP.ini” as this is the
actual file that you’ll want to modify, edit, and harden moving forward.

**Editing the File on Shared Hosting**

Individuals looking to harden their PHP on a shared hosting platform (see [The Blog Starter](https://www.theblogstarter.com/) for hosting options) will have a bit of a tougher hill to climb, if only because most providers do not offer root access to the server with this level of hosting.

You’ll have to contact your hosting provider directly to see
if you can edit the main PHP.ini file itself. In the event that you aren’t
allowed this kind of access, you can still request to have access to the
“.HTaccess” file on your server to make the changes you need to.

You won’t be able to make changes quite as quickly this way
as you would have been able to with a patch (like we highlight below), but you
can manually make individual line edits to your PHP settings this way to enjoy
a higher level of security.

Shared hosting may still have limitations on the PHP elements you can edit no matter how much access you are granted. If you want total control over hardening your PHP (and total control over the security of your web platform), it’s not a bad idea to move to Dedicated or VPS servers if you can afford it.

**Editing the File on Dedicated/VPS servers**

If you are moving forward with a Virtual Private Server
(VPS) or Dedicated server set up the process for hardening your PHP is a lot
easier, though it’s still not as quick as applying a server wide patch like we
highlight below.

In the backend administration toolset of your server
solution you’ll find a tool called the Web Host Manager. This is usually
located under the “Service Configuration” settings option in your backend
dashboard.

This tool is going to allow you to select the PHP
Configuration Editor, and editor that allows you to make changes to your
PHP.ini file through a more user-friendly interface than actually downloading
the file, opening it up in Notepad or a similar application, and then making
the edits individually with the actual source code itself.

There are a handful of individual settings that you’re going
to want to reconfigure manually when taking this approach to hardening your PHP
installation, including (but not limited to):

•           Remote
Connections

•           Run Time
Settings

•           Input Data
Restrictions

•           Error
Handling

•           Restrict
File Access

•           File
Uploads

•           Session
Security

•           Soap Cache

… And that’s just the tip of the iceberg.

**Use a Patch like Suhosin to Harden PHP Almost Instantly**

The big attraction behind PHP is that it is so easy to learn,
so easy to develop with, and about as flexible as a programming language gets –
and that’s why a lot of people feel comfortable hardening their PHP manually,
running line by line through their PHP.ini file and doing the heavy lifting of
securing their system on their own.

And while you may be a top-tier programmer and feel
completely confident in your coding prowess, the truth of the matter is that if
you allow ANY coding from ANY outside developers to run on your server you’ll
still have vulnerabilities that you may not be able to address independently –
vulnerabilities that can compromise your entire platform.

This is why patching your PHP systemwide is such a savvy
move, and why so many developers, programmers, and website/web application
owners utilizing PHP decide to move forward with a solution like Suhosin.

Engineered specifically to provide an advanced layer of
protection to PHP installations, the Suhosin patch is a dual action component
that provides a level of hardening that may not be possible through any other
manual approach.

On the one hand, Suhosin works to patch the PHP core on your
server. This allows this patch to protect against issues like format string
vulnerabilities, buffer overflows, and other issues that may plague your as of
yet unsecured PHP installation.

On the other hand, Suhosin also acts as an extension to the
PHP that has already been installed on your server. This extension runs 24/7,
around-the-clock, to protect against all kinds of vulnerabilities (including
runtime vulnerabilities) as well as individual session issues while adding a
whole host of logging, filtering, and administrative tools at the same time.

Best of all, the installation of this PHP hardening patch is
about as simple and as straightforward as it gets.

All of the features it has to offer exist within its
extension module and “flipping the switch” to allow that extension to run is as
easy as activating the individual extension inside of the PHP.ini file.
Sometimes you’ll have to manually add a couple of extra Configuration
Directives to trigger the full suite of extension capabilities, but most of the
time the Suhosin patch works just as soon as the edits to the PHP.ini file go
live.

     Advisory: Zend Platform Multiple Remote Vulnerabilities
 Release Date: 2006/08/24
Last Modified: 2006/08/24
       Author: Stefan Esser [sesser@hardened-php.net]

  Application: Zend Platform <= 2.2.1
     Severity: Malformed session ids may lead to multiple security problems
         Risk: Critical
Vendor Status: Vendor has a released an updated version
   References: <http://www.hardened-php.net/advisory_052006.128.html>

Overview:

   Quote from <http://www.zend.com/downloads>
   "Zend Platform is the all-in-one production environment that ensures
   your PHP applications are available, fast, reliable and scalable. It
   uniquely guarantees application uptime and reliability through
   enhanced PHP monitoring and immediate problem resolution."

   During the development of suhosin, which is our new PHP protection
   module, several compatibility tests with binary 3rd party PHP
   extensions like the Zend Platform and the Zend Optimizer have been
   made. When testing the session protection features of suhosin, we
   discovered that the session clustering system, which is shipping
   with the Zend Platform is vulnerable to several different attacks.

   By exploiting these vulnerabilities, an attacker can crash the
   session clustering daemon, which leads to a malfunction of the
   session function and renders the attacked node useless. By
   carefully crafting the attack session IDs, an attacker might
   be able to either execute code within the context of the
   session clustering daemon or within the mod_cluster module,
   which is the communication link between PHP and the daemon.

   Additionally a directory traversal vulnerability in the disk
   storage module allows creating and reading the session file
   anywhere on the hard disk. If for example a directory or file
   within the document root of the webserver is writeable by the
   session clustering daemon (which by default runs with the same
   privileges as the webserver), this can lead to arbitrary PHP
   code injection. On the other hand it might be possible to upload
   a user defined file to the webserver and craft a session identifier
   so that the data inside the file is used as session data.
   This obviously leads to total control over the content of the
   session and therefore to control over the application.

Details:

   The Zend Platform comes with a session handler module that plugs
   itself into the session management of PHP to support session
   clustering. This module communicates with the ZendSessionManager
   daemon. This daemon is responsible for transffering session data
   between nodes and does most of the work.

   Our analysis revealed that both components, the clustering
   module mod_cluster and the daemon, itself have problems with
   malicious session identifiers. By default the session identifier
   is retrieved from the PHPSESSID request variable. Our first
   observation was that sending the identifier as a string with
   length 0 immediately crashed the mod_cluster module. The next
   observation was that an overlong session identifier also leads
   to a crash.

   Analysing the responsible code within a debugger revealed that
   a statement like:

         strncpy(dst, src, strlen(src+1))

   was used to copy the session identifier around. This is obvisouly
   broken and leads to an overflow in the BSS segment, which makes
   exploitation tricky, because the data behind the buffer is not
   directly used again. However a later debugging session has shown
   that when some conditions are triggered mod_cluster crashed
   because the instruction pointer address was changed.

   The other observation was that the long PHPSESSID never reached
   the daemon. This changed when we took into account the special
   layout of Zend Platform session identifiers. They look something
   like this:

         xxxxxxxx:yyyyyyyy:00000000:0000...00:l8uqsu49p....

   This special format encodes extra data into the first part of
   the session identifier that determines the IP of the node
   creating it. With this information it is possible for the daemon
   to contact the node that is responsible for storing the session.

   When the session data is stored on the hard disk, the last
   component of the session identifier is used directly to create
   the filename. Unfortunately this is again performed without any
   size check. Therefore the filename might overflow its buffer. In
   our tests overflowing with a long string resulted in a crash
   inside glibc free(). Depending on the system's implementation of
   malloc(), this can lead to code execution.

   The final observation was that the last component of the session
   identifier also allows directory traversal attacks on the place
   where the session file is stored. This obviously allows creating
   the session files anywhere on the hard disk, where the daemon has
   write privileges. And to use any file on the hard disk as origin
   for the session data. The later is very dangerous if the
   application allows uploading files and the user is able to
   predict its storage location. By uploading a file that contains
   session data in a daemon compatible format, it is possible to get
   total control over the session data, the application uses.

   The ability to write session files for example into writeable
   directories within the document root path can lead to PHP code
   execution if the attacker is either able to put PHP code into a
   programm variable that is stored within the session (some session
   management systems store for example the User-Agent in the session
   to make session hijacking/fixation a little bit harder).

   Additionally in PHP < 4.4.3 and < 5.1.4, session identifiers are
   not limited in their charset for 3rd party session handlers.
   Therefore on these systems it is possible to have PHP code directly
   in the session identifier. Because the last component of the
   session identifier is also directly copied into the session file
   this ensures that PHP code is within the file.

Proof of Concept:

   The Hardened-PHP Project is not going to release exploits for
   this vulnerability to the public.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
