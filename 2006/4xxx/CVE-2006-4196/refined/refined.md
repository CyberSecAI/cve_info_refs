  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `templates_dir` parameter in WEBInsta CMS 0.3.1 is vulnerable to Remote File Inclusion.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can include and execute arbitrary remote PHP files on the server, leading to potential remote code execution. This can result in complete compromise of the affected system.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted GET request to the `index.php` script of WEBInsta CMS, manipulating the `templates_dir` parameter to point to a malicious PHP file hosted on a remote server.",
       "The attacker needs to supply a URL to the malicious PHP file which is then included and executed by the vulnerable application."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to host a malicious PHP file on a web server accessible to the target system. They also need to know or guess the location of the vulnerable `index.php` script and the name of the command execution variable."
