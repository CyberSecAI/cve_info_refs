kernel security update (RHSA-2007-0014)

Original Release Date: February 16, 2007

Last Revised: February 13, 2009

Number: ASA-2007-063

Risk Level: Medium

Advisory Version: 6.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

The Linux kernel manages the communication between software and
hardware as
well as the hardware resources of a computer running the Linux operating
system.

Red Hat has issued an updated version of the kernel packages for
Enterprise
Linux 4. Below is a list of the security issues fixed in the update as
reported
by Red Hat:

* a flaw in the get\_fdb\_entries function of the network bridging
  support
  that allowed a local user to cause a denial of service (crash) or allow
  a
  potential privilege escalation.
* an information leak in the \_block\_prepare\_write function that
  allowed
  a local user to read kernel memory.
* an information leak in the copy\_from\_user() implementation on s390
  and
  s390x platforms that allowed a local user to read kernel memory.
* a flaw in the handling of /proc/net/ip6\_flowlabel that allowed a
  local
  user to cause a denial of service (infinite loop).
* a flaw in the AIO handling that allowed a local user to cause a
  denial
  of service (panic).
* a race condition in the mincore system core that allowed a local
  user to
  cause a denial of service (system hang).
* a flaw in the ELF handling on ia64 and sparc architectures which
  triggered a cross-region memory mapping and allowed a local user to
  cause a
  denial of service.
* a flaw in the dev\_queue\_xmit function of the network subsystem that
  allowed a local user to cause a denial of service (data
  corruption).
* a flaw in the handling of CAPI messages over Bluetooth that allowed
  a
  remote system to cause a denial of service or potential code execution.
  This flaw is only exploitable if a privileged user establishes a
  connection
  to a malicious remote device.
* a flaw in the listxattr system call that allowed a local user to
  cause a
  denial of service (data corruption) or potential privilege escalation.
  To
  successfully exploit this flaw the existence of a bad inode is required
  first.
* a flaw in the \_\_find\_get\_block\_slow function that allowed a local
  privileged user to cause a denial of service.
* various flaws in the supported filesystems that allowed a local
  privileged user to cause a denial of service.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned
the names
[CVE-2006-5751](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-5751),

[CVE-2006-5757](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-5757),
[CVE-2006-5823](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-5823),
[CVE-2006-6053](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-6053),
[CVE-2006-6054](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-6054), and
[CVE-2006-6056](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-6056) to these issues.

While this advisory deals with the kernel package from RedHat
Enterprise
Linux 4, the vulnerabilities in this advisory have been assessed against
currently supported versions of Avaya Communications Manager (CM). As
such,
some of the responses may include versions of Avaya Communications
Manager that
do not run on RedHat Enterprise Linux 4 or on a 2.6 series kernel.

CM 2.x and CM 3.0, which use a 2.4 series Linux kernel, are only
vulnerable
to the mincore race condition
([CVE-2006-4814](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4814))
listed above. As there is no known exploit for this issue and it would
require
someone with access to a user account on CM, Avaya has chosen to rate
the impact
of this ASA to CM 2.x and CM 3.0 as a Low Risk Level.

CM 3.1.x, which uses a 2.6 series Linux kernel, is vulnerable to all
of the
issues in this advisory including the potential privilege escalations in
the
get\_fdb\_entries issue
([CVE-2006-5751](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-5751))
and the listxattr-system-call issue
([CVE-2006-5753](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-5753))
listed above.

Avaya Messaging Storage Server has been marked as having a Low Risk
Level
as shell access is not available in an Avaya recommended default
configuration.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the
security
advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2007-0014.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with kernel installed:

**Recommended Actions:**
For all system products which use
vulnerable
versions of the kernel, Avaya recommends that customers restrict local
and
network access to the server. This restriction should be enforced
through the
use of physical security, firewalls, ACLs, VPNs, and other
generally-accepted
networking practices until such time as an update becomes available and
can
be installed.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating
systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying
operating
system or applications that come with the operating system. These
vulnerabilities often do not impact the software-only product directly
but
may threaten the integrity of the underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not
affected by
the vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be.
Customers should determine on which Linux operating system the product
was
installed and then follow that vendors guidance.

## 4. Software-Only Products:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CVLAN | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. The CVLAN application does not require the software described in this advisory. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite(IMS) | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. The IMS application does not require the software described in this advisory. |

**Recommended Actions:**
Avaya recommends that customers follow
recommended actions supplied by RedHat Linux.

## Topic

Updated kernel packages that fix several security issues in the Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 4 kernel are now available.

This security advisory has been rated as having important security impact
by the Red Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

The Linux kernel handles the basic functions of the operating system.

These new kernel packages contain fixes for the security issues described
below:

* a flaw in the get\_fdb\_entries function of the network bridging support

that allowed a local user to cause a denial of service (crash) or allow a
potential privilege escalation (CVE-2006-5751, Important)

* an information leak in the \_block\_prepare\_write function that allowed a

local user to read kernel memory (CVE-2006-4813, Important)

* an information leak in the copy\_from\_user() implementation on s390 and

s390x platforms that allowed a local user to read kernel memory
(CVE-2006-5174, Important)

* a flaw in the handling of /proc/net/ip6\_flowlabel that allowed a local

user to cause a denial of service (infinite loop) (CVE-2006-5619, Important)

* a flaw in the AIO handling that allowed a local user to cause a denial of

service (panic) (CVE-2006-5754, Important)

* a race condition in the mincore system core that allowed a local user to

cause a denial of service (system hang) (CVE-2006-4814, Moderate)

* a flaw in the ELF handling on ia64 and sparc architectures which

triggered a cross-region memory mapping and allowed a local user to cause a
denial of service (CVE-2006-4538, Moderate)

* a flaw in the dev\_queue\_xmit function of the network subsystem that

allowed a local user to cause a denial of service (data corruption)
(CVE-2006-6535, Moderate)

* a flaw in the handling of CAPI messages over Bluetooth that allowed a

remote system to cause a denial of service or potential code execution.
This flaw is only exploitable if a privileged user establishes a connection
to a malicious remote device (CVE-2006-6106, Moderate)

* a flaw in the listxattr system call that allowed a local user to cause a

denial of service (data corruption) or potential privilege escalation. To
successfully exploit this flaw the existence of a bad inode is required
first (CVE-2006-5753, Moderate)

* a flaw in the \_\_find\_get\_block\_slow function that allowed a local

privileged user to cause a denial of service (CVE-2006-5757, Low)

* various flaws in the supported filesystems that allowed a local

privileged user to cause a denial of service (CVE-2006-5823, CVE-2006-6053,
CVE-2006-6054, CVE-2006-6056, Low)

In addition to the security issues described above, fixes for the following
bugs were included:

* initialization error of the tg3 driver with some BCM5703x network card
* a memory leak in the audit subsystem
* x86\_64 nmi watchdog timeout is too short
* ext2/3 directory reads fail intermittently

Red Hat would like to thank Dmitriy Monakhov and Kostantin Khorenko for
reporting issues fixed in this erratum.

All Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 users are advised to upgrade their kernels
to the packages associated with their machine architecture and
configurations as listed in this erratum.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Several local and remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux
kernel that may lead to a denial of service or the execution of arbitrary
code. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:

CVE-2004-2731

    infamous41md reported multiple integer overflows in the Sbus PROM
    driver that would allow for a DoS (Denial of Service) attack by a
    local user, and possibly the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2006-4814

    Doug Chapman discovered a potential local DoS (deadlock) in the mincore
    function caused by improper lock handling.

CVE-2006-5753

    Eric Sandeen provided a fix for a local memory corruption vulnerability
    resulting from a misinterpretation of return values when operating on
    inodes which have been marked bad.

CVE-2006-5823

    LMH reported a potential local DoS which could be exploited by a malicious
    user with the privileges to mount and read a corrupted cramfs filesystem.

CVE-2006-6053

    LMH reported a potential local DoS which could be exploited by a malicious
    user with the privileges to mount and read a corrupted ext3 filesystem.

CVE-2006-6054

    LMH reported a potential local DoS which could be exploited by a malicious
    user with the privileges to mount and read a corrupted ext2 filesystem.

CVE-2006-6106

    Marcel Holtman discovered multiple buffer overflows in the Bluetooth
    subsystem which can be used to trigger a remote DoS (crash) and potentially
    execute arbitray code.

CVE-2007-1353

    Ilja van Sprundel discovered that kernel memory could be leaked via the
    Bluetooth setsockopt call due to an uninitialized stack buffer. This
    could be used by local attackers to read the contents of sensitive kernel
    memory.

CVE-2007-1592

    Masayuki Nakagawa discovered that flow labels were inadvertently
    being shared between listening sockets and child sockets. This defect
    can be exploited by local users to cause a DoS (Oops).

CVE-2007-2172

    Thomas Graf reported a typo in the DECnet protocol handler that could
    be used by a local attacker to overrun an array via crafted packets,
    potentially resulting in a Denial of Service (system crash).
    A similar issue exists in the IPV4 protocol handler and will be fixed
    in a subsequent update.

CVE-2007-2525

    Florian Zumbiehl discovered a memory leak in the PPPOE subsystem caused
    by releasing a socket before PPPIOCGCHAN is called upon it. This could
    be used by a local user to DoS a system by consuming all available memory.

CVE-2007-3848

    Wojciech Purczynski discovered that pdeath_signal was not being reset
    properly under certain conditions which may allow local users to gain
    privileges by sending arbitrary signals to suid binaries.

CVE-2007-4308

    Alan Cox reported an issue in the aacraid driver that allows unprivileged
    local users to make ioctl calls which should be restricted to admin
    privileges.

CVE-2007-4311

    PaX team discovered an issue in the random driver where a defect in the
    reseeding code leads to a reduction in entropy.

CVE-2007-5093

    Alex Smith discovered an issue with the pwc driver for certain webcam
    devices. If the device is removed while a userspace application has it
    open, the driver will wait for userspace to close the device, resulting
    in a blocked USB subsystem. This issue is of low security impact as
    it requires the attacker to either have physical access to the system
    or to convince a user with local access to remove the device on their
    behalf.

CVE-2007-6063

    Venustech AD-LAB discovered a a buffer overflow in the isdn ioctl
    handling, exploitable by a local user.

CVE-2007-6151

    ADLAB discovered a possible memory overrun in the ISDN subsystem that
    may permit a local user to overwrite kernel memory leading by issuing
    ioctls with unterminated data.

CVE-2007-6206

    Blake Frantz discovered that when a core file owned by a non-root user
    exists, and a root-owned process dumps core over it, the core file
    retains its original ownership. This could be used by a local user to
    gain access to sensitive information.

CVE-2007-6694

    Cyrill Gorcunov reported a NULL pointer dereference in code specific
    to the CHRP PowerPC platforms. Local users could exploit this issue
    to achieve a Denial of Service (DoS).

CVE-2008-0007

    Nick Piggin of SuSE discovered a number of issues in subsystems which
    register a fault handler for memory mapped areas. This issue can be
    exploited by local users to achieve a Denial of Service (DoS) and possibly
    execute arbitrary code.

The following matrix lists additional packages that were rebuilt for
compatibility with or to take advantage of this update:

                                 Debian 3.1 (sarge)
     alsa-modules-i386           1.0.8+2sarge2

     kernel-latest-2.4-sparc     42sarge3
     i2c                         1:2.9.1-1sarge2
     lm-sensors                  1:2.9.1-1sarge4
     mindi-kernel                2.4.27-2sarge5
     pcmcia-modules-2.4.27-i386  3.2.5+2sarge2

     systemimager                3.2.3-6sarge5

We recommend that you upgrade your kernel package immediately and reboot
the machine. If you have built a custom kernel from the kernel source
package, you will need to rebuild to take advantage of these fixes.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

Note that this update changes various package names due to ABI changes.
You must therefore have the corresponding upgrade-assist metapackage(s)
installed for your upgrades to automatically take place. These packages
have names with the prefix 'kernel-image-2.4-'.

For a full list of the metapackages available for your architecture, run
the following command on the target Debian 3.1 system:
        apt-cache search kernel-image-2.4-

Any 3rd party modules that have been built and installed for your system
will need to be rebuilt and installed for compatability with the new ABI.

Debian 3.1 (oldstable)
- ----------------------

Oldstable updates are available for alpha, amd64, arm, hppa, i386, ia64, m68k, mips, mipsel, powerpc, s390 and sparc.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)
* [Ubuntu 5.10](/security/notices?release=breezy)

## Details

Mark Dowd discovered that the netfilter iptables module did not

correcly handle fragmented IPv6 packets. By sending specially crafted

packets, a remote attacker could exploit this to bypass firewall

rules. This has has already been fixed for Ubuntu 6.10 in USN-395-1;

this is the corresponding fix for Ubuntu 6.06.([CVE-2006-4572](/security/CVE-2006-4572))

Doug Chapman discovered an improper lock handling in the mincore()

function. A local attacker could exploit this to cause an eternal hang

in the kernel, rendering the machine unusable. ([CVE-2006-4814](/security/CVE-2006-4814))

Al Viro reported that the ISDN PPP module did not initialize the reset

state timer. By sending specially crafted ISDN packets, a remote

attacker could exploit this to crash the kernel. ([CVE-2006-5749](/security/CVE-2006-5749))

Various syscalls (like listxattr()) misinterpreted the return value of

return\_EIO() when encountering bad inodes. By issuing particular

system calls on a malformed file system, a local attacker could

exploit this to crash the kernel. ([CVE-2006-5753](/security/CVE-2006-5753))

The task switching code did not save and restore EFLAGS of processes.

By starting a specially crafted executable, a local attacker could

exploit this to eventually crash many other running processes. This

only affects the amd64 platform. ([CVE-2006-5755](/security/CVE-2006-5755))

A race condition was found in the grow\_buffers() function. By mounting

a specially crafted ISO9660 or NTFS file system, a local attacker

could exploit this to trigger an infinite loop in the kernel,

rendering the machine unusable. ([CVE-2006-5757](/security/CVE-2006-5757))

A buffer overread was found in the zlib\_inflate() function. By

tricking an user into mounting a specially crafted file system which

uses zlib compression (such as cramfs), this could be exploited to

crash the kernel. ([CVE-2006-5823](/security/CVE-2006-5823))

The ext3 file system driver did not properly handle corrupted data

structures. By mounting a specially crafted ext3 file system, a local

attacker could exploit this to crash the kernel. ([CVE-2006-6053](/security/CVE-2006-6053))

The ext2 file system driver did not properly handle corrupted data

structures. By mounting a specially crafted ext2 file system, a local

attacker could exploit this to crash the kernel. ([CVE-2006-6054](/security/CVE-2006-6054))

The hfs file system driver did not properly handle corrupted data

structures. By mounting a specially crafted hfs file system, a local

attacker could exploit this to crash the kernel. This only affects

systems which enable SELinux (Ubuntu disables SELinux by default).

([CVE-2006-6056](/security/CVE-2006-6056))

Several vulnerabilities have been found in the GFS2 file system

driver. Since this driver has never actually worked in Ubuntu 6.10, it

has been disabled. This only affects Ubuntu 6.10. ([CVE-2006-6057](/security/CVE-2006-6057))

Marcel Holtman discovered several buffer overflows in the Bluetooth

driver. By sending Bluetooth packets with specially crafted CAPI

messages, a remote attacker could exploit these to crash the kernel.

([CVE-2006-6106](/security/CVE-2006-6106))

After a standard system upgrade you need to reboot your computer to

effect the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the Ubuntu 6.06 and Ubuntu

6.10 kernel updates have been given a new version number, which

requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules

you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you

have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the

new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard

kernel metapackages (linux-386, linux-powerpc, linux-amd64-generic), a

standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=180663#c0)  Doug Chapman    2006-02-09 19:56:44 UTC  ``` Description of problem: There is a race condition that can be easily triggered by the mincore system call that will cause "ps -ef" (and likley other things that need to lock mmap_sem) to hang.  Since this can be used as a DOS attack I am considering this a security issue.  I can easily reproduce this on my ia64 hardware.  I do not expect it to be hardware specific however (but I will verify when I get access to other hardware).  The situation that causes this is:  1. thread A calls mincore with the *vec argument pointing to a page that is not in core (i.e. a freshly mmapped page).  In the mincore system call it calls down_read on mmap_sem.  2. a second thread in the same process calls mmap to map a new page, this calls down_write on mmap_sem but blocks due to the reader in the first thread.  3. the first thread then calls copy_to_user to copy the info regarding which pages are in core to the address specified by *vec.  Since this page is not yet in core a page fault is triggered.  The page fault handler calls down_read on mmap_sem even though this task already has a read lock on it.  Since there is a waiting writer this call to down_read blocks.  Since this is the thread with the original read_lock on mmap_sem we have deadlock.  4. the DOS issue then comes from any user doing a "ps -ef" which needs to do down_read on mmap_sem for each process.  This blocks.   Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): Seen on the latest RHEL4 kernel (2.6.9-30) but is also broken up stream.  I will check RHEL3 soon.  How reproducible: All the time (on ia64 SMP however I expect this is not arch dependent)   Steps to Reproduce: 1. compile the attached reproducer with "cc mincore_hang.c -lpthread" 2. ./a.out 3. ps -ef    Actual results: The a.out and ps -ef hang and are uninterruptable  Expected results:   Additional info:   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=180663#c1)  Doug Chapman    2006-02-09 19:56:44 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 124452](attachment.cgi?id=124452 "reproducer for mincore race condition") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=124452&action=edit "reproducer for mincore race condition") reproducer for mincore race condition   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=180663#c2)  Dave Anderson    2006-02-09 21:06:43 UTC  ```  You got a kernel patch to fix it?  Or a suggestion how to fix it?   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=180663#c3)  Doug Chapman    2006-02-09 21:14:55 UTC  ``` I have done some thinking on how to fix this.  Since we need to be holding the read lock on mmap_sem while walking the vma list perhaps instead of copying the info into user space while holding the lock we could copy into some kmalloc'ed memory temporarily and the copy_to_user after we drop the read lock.  I don't really like this solution since it means allocating potentially large chunks via kmalloc (i.e. some really big app on a 1TB system wants to check all of its memory to see what is in core).  Perhaps a better solution would be to ensure the memory pointed to by *vec is in core before we take the lock and mlock it temporarily.     ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=180663#c4)  Dave Anderson    2006-02-09 21:59:30 UTC  ```  As you surmise, it reproduces on a RHEL4 x86_64, and on a UP ia64 RHEL3 box.    Amazing nobody's ever run into this.  > Perhaps a better solution would be to ensure the memory pointed to by *vec > is in core before we take the lock and mlock it temporarily.  It would seem to make sense to pre-read the memory pointed to by vec, as opposed to only doing access_ok() on it. Pinning the pages from inside the kernel of scares me though, because nothing prevents the user from passing a ridiculously large block of address space, even if it's a byte array.  Adding Larry to the cc: list in case he has any suggestions.    ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=180663#c5)  Dave Anderson    2006-02-10 14:19:51 UTC  ```  Doug,  Carrying your suggestion a bit further, perhaps a fault-and-pin-page operation could be done a page a time, by enclosing the "while (vma)" loop in sys_mincore() inside another while loop that does the operation on a page-by-page basis (i.e., per page full of byte markers).  Even though *vec at a minimum points to a single page, on a large user virtual address space, a user could still seemingly cause some damage if all of its *vec memory were locked down at once.  Doing it a page at time will make sys_mincore() obfuscated, but wouldn't introduce a new problem to fix the old one.     ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=180663#c6)  Doug Chapman    2006-02-10 15:57:53 UTC  ``` Dave,  I had to think this through and stare at the code a bit but it sounds like this is probably the best solution.  The first pass through the loop would be special since *vec likley isn't page aligned so we need to see how many bytes we have before we hit the page boundary and only look at that many pages on the first pass.  Most of the time it would likely only be 1 pass so I don't think performance is impacted (not that mincore is probably a major performance concern anyway but I bet oracle uses it).      ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=180663#c7)  Dave Anderson    2006-02-10 16:27:18 UTC  ```  Yep, I forgot about *vec not being on page boundary...  But you're right -- it still means taking the user's passed-in start, length, and its base pointer to *vec, and keeping local, progressive, versions of those values for each time through the loop.  Re: performance, my only concern was memory page locking, i.e., that it shouldn't do more than one at a time.      ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=180663#c10)  Jay Turner    2006-08-16 02:32:59 UTC  ``` QE ack for 4.5.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=180663#c11)  Dave Anderson    2006-08-16 13:39:38 UTC  ```  Ok -- I took a quick look at what data is available in IT #98736.  Aside from the fact that there are a number of processes blocked in ps in IT #98736, can you explain what that has to do with the mincore() issue that this bugzilla was filed against?  In this bugzilla, Doug forced the the hang with a multi-threaded process whose threads are doing mincore() and mmap() operations on their address space simultaneously, leading to a block on their common mmap_sem semaphore if somebody else then did a ps on that task.  In IT #98736, the straces show a bunch of processes that mostly are blocked doing read()'s of various /proc/<pid>/cmdline files.  Are there simultaneous threads doing mincore() calls on the same pids, presuming that they are multi-threaded processes?  Anyway, at a minimum, we need a forced crash-dump to figure out what's going on in the IT's case.  A bunch of user-space "strace" outputs are pretty much useless, especially those of the "ps" commands (as opposed to the pids who cmdline's are being read.    And if it has nothing to do with simultaneous mincore()/mmap() operations going on in the same threads whose /proc/pid/cmdline files are being read, then this should be opened as a seperate bugzilla, since it makes no sense to continue in the context of this one.          ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=180663#c12)  Dave Anderson    2006-08-17 19:39:54 UTC  ```  Looking at the files in IT #98736, there is zero evidence of the multi-threaded/mincore/mmap interaction issue that is the subject of this bugzilla.  The only relationship between the two situations is that something is causing a task's mmap_sem to be deadlocked, and subsequent ps commands hang when trying to take the semaphore.  In this bugzilla, it's Doug's program that forces simultaneous mincore()/mmap() interaction between two threads of a process, and both threads end up blocking on their own mmap_sem.  In #IT 98736, it's something completely different, and that problem is what needs to be determined.  It makes no sense to tie that IT to this bugzilla; it needs its own bugzilla.          ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=180663#c14)  Dave Anderson    2006-09-05 13:31:18 UTC  ```  > The first comment in this bug don't talk about an IT item. What about fixing > that problem report and leaving any IT by side?  Doug Chapman (the reporter) was well on his way to fixing this with his first patch.  Perhaps he can resurrect his work and post an updated version?    ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=180663#c20)  Dave Anderson    2006-12-04 15:14:23 UTC  ```  Doug's final patch:  <http://post-office.corp.redhat.com/archives/rhkernel-list/2006-September/msg00540.html>   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=180663#c21)  Marcel Holtmann    2006-12-04 16:08:16 UTC  ``` Has this patch been proposed for upstream inclusion?    ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=180663#c22)  Doug Chapman    2006-12-04 16:22:30 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #21](show_bug.cgi?id=180663#c21)) > Has this patch been proposed for upstream inclusion? >   I have not proposed it upstream as I wasn't sure what the procedure was for sensitive patches.
