{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by a failure to properly exit or die after a check for direct access to the vulnerable file. This allows the injection of parameters into the mail() function.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "mail() Injection",
    "Improper input validation",
        "Failure to exit/die after a security check"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject arbitrary parameters into the mail() function, potentially allowing them to send emails with arbitrary 'to', 'from', 'subject', and 'body', and also inject extra headers (e.g. to send HTML emails), leading to spam, phishing or other malicious activities. ",
  "Attack vectors": "HTTP GET request to the vulnerable script `nu_mail.inc.php` with crafted parameters.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have access to the web server hosting the vulnerable application and be able to send HTTP requests. The server must have `register_globals` enabled. "
