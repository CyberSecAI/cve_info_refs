{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The GnuTLS library did not properly validate the padding of PKCS #1 v1.5 signatures when the exponent of the public key was 3. It failed to check for extra data in the digestAlgorithm.parameters field, which could be used to store garbage data.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper validation of PKCS #1 v1.5 signature padding",
      "Ignoring extra data in the digestAlgorithm.parameters field of X.509 certificates"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could forge PKCS #1 v1.5 signatures that would be accepted as valid by GnuTLS, potentially allowing them to bypass authentication or impersonate a valid entity. This could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, or other security compromises.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote attack by crafting malicious certificates with forged signatures"
    ],
     "required_capabilities": [
      "Ability to create malicious certificates"
    ]
  },
  "additional_notes": "The vulnerability is similar to Bleichenbacher's crypto 06 rump session attack, but uses the digestAlgorithm.parameters field instead of after the ASN.1 blob to store 'garbage' data. The fix in GnuTLS 1.4.3 was too restrictive, not allowing empty parameters field, which led to valid certificates being rejected. A later fix in GnuTLS 1.4.4 corrected this by allowing the parameters field to be either absent or contain 0x05 0x00. RSA keys with exponent 3 are commonplace."
