  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve": "CVE-2006-4757",
      "root_cause": "The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries, resulting in SQL injection vulnerabilities.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "SQL Injection"
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data modification, data exfiltration, or complete database compromise.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Manipulating HTTP POST parameters like 'linkopentype', 'linkrender', 'link_class', 'link_id', 'searchquery', and 'download_category_class' through the web interface"
      ],
        "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have access to the administrative panel of the application. For some injection points, like the search query, a less privileged user with access to user administration may be sufficient"
    }
