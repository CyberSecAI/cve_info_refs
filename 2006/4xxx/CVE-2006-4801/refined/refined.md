        "content": "The advisory discusses a local root compromise vulnerability in Roxio Toast 7 Titanium on OSX due to a race condition in the bundled Deja Vu software from Propaganda Productions. Deja Vu creates ruby scripts in the /tmp directory which are executed with elevated privileges. This makes it possible to execute arbitrary commands or gain root access. The vulnerability is triggered during a manual backup initiated through System Preferences. A proof of concept shows how to exploit the race condition to execute commands with root privileges. The vendor, Propaganda Productions, was notified but no response was received.",
