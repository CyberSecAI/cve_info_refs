{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to the insecure inclusion of external files via the 'image' parameter in the image.php script. The script directly includes the content of the URL passed via the 'image' parameter, without proper sanitization or validation.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server by including a malicious script from a remote server.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exploited by crafting a malicious URL that includes a remote file containing PHP code through the `image` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and control a remote server where the malicious PHP code is hosted."
