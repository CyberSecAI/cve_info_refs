{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `HTML_Category_Menu()` function within the `HTML_function.php` file. This function includes a file using a path specified by the `classified_path` variable. When `register_globals` is enabled, the `classified_path` variable can be influenced via the GET parameter, leading to arbitrary file inclusion.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uncontrolled file inclusion",
       "register_globals enabled"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can include arbitrary files, potentially leading to remote code execution if they include a malicious script.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request, where the `classified_path` parameter is set to a URL pointing to a malicious file.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application and host a malicious script on a server accessible by the vulnerable application. The attacker also needs to know that the target application has the vulnerable code, and that `register_globals` is enabled."
