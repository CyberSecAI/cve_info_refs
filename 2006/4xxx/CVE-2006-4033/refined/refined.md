{
  "CVE-2006-4033": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "Lhaplus is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow when reading extended headers from an LZH file. The software does not validate the 'extended header size' read from the LZH file, which can lead to arbitrary code execution.",
    "details": "The vulnerability occurs because Lhaplus does not validate the 'extended header size' before using it to read extended header data into a 256-byte heap buffer. If the size is larger than 256, a heap-based buffer overflow occurs. This can lead to arbitrary code execution. An integer underflow could also occur if the extended header size is less than 3.",
    "affected_versions": [
      "Lhaplus version 1.52 (Japanese)"
    ],
    "vulnerability": "Heap-based buffer overflow due to insufficient validation of extended header size.",
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vector": "By convincing a user to extract a malicious LZH file.",
     "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs to create a malicious LZH file with an extended header size larger than 256 bytes, and convince the user to open it using vulnerable version of Lhaplus"
