Symantec Security Advisory

Symantec NetBackup PureDisk: Non-Privileged User Authentication Bypass
Elevation of Privilege
Revision History
None
Severity
Medium (highly dependent on network configuration)
Remote Access
Yes
Local Access
No
Authentication Required
Yes (to network)
Exploit publicly available
No
Overview
Symantec discovered a security issue in Symantec's Veritas NetBackup 6.0
PureDisk Remote Office Edition. An unauthorized user with access to the
network and the
server hosting the management interface can potentially bypass the
management interface
authentication to gain access and elevate their privileges on the
system.
Supported Product(s) Affected
Product: Symantec Veritas NetBackup PureDisk Remote
Office Edition (all platforms)
Version: 6.0
Builds: GA, MP1
Solution: NB\_PDE\_60\_MP1\_P01
NOTE: For systems running NetBackup 6.0 GA PureDisk Remote Office
Edition
it will be necessary to install Maintenance Pack 1 prior to applying
this
Security
Pack.
This issue ONLY affects the product and versions listed above.
Details
An internal review revealed a potential elevation of privilege issue in
the
Symantec Veritas NetBackup PureDisk management interface. The
management
interface is
accessible only through an SSL web connection by default. However it is
possible for a
non-privileged user with access to the network and the server hosting
the
Symantec Veritas NetBackup
PureDisk management interface, to bypass the management interface
authentication and
further leverage their access to elevate privileged access on the
server.
Symantec Response
Symantec engineers have addressed the issues identified above and made
Security updates available.
Symantec strongly recommends all customers apply the latest security
update
to protect against threats of this nature.
Symantec knows of no exploitation of or adverse customer impact from
these
issues.
The patches listed above for affected products are available through the
following location:
http://support.veritas.com/docs/284734 for Symantec Veritas NetBackup
PureDisk Remote Office Edition.
Best Practices
As part of normal best practices, Symantec recommends:
- - - Restrict access to administration or management systems to
authorized
privileged users only
- - - Block remote access to all ports not essential for efficient
operation
- - - Restrict remote access, if required, to trusted/authorized systems
only
- - - Remove/disable unnecessary accounts or restrict access according
to
security policy as required
- - - Run under the principle of least privilege where possible
- - - Keep all operating systems and applications updated with the
latest
vendor patches
- - - Follow a multi-layered approach to security. Run both firewall and
antivirus applications, at a minimum, to provide multiple points of
detection and protection to
both inbound and outbound threats
- - - Deploy network intrusion detection systems to monitor network
traffic
for
signs of anomalous or suspicious activity. This may aid in detection of
attacks or
Malicious activity related to exploitation of latest vulnerabilities
CVE
A CVE Candidate name is being requested from the Common Vulnerabilities
and
Exposures(CVE) initiative for this issue. This advisory will be revised
accordingly
upon receipt of the CVE Candidate name.
This issue is a candidate for inclusion in the CVE list
(http://cve.mitre.org), which standardizesnames for security problems.
