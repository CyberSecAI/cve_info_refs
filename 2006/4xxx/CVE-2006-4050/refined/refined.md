  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2006-4050",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper sanitization of the `$installed_config_file` variable before it is included in the `auto_check_renewals.php` script using an include statement.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Remote File Inclusion"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can include and execute arbitrary remote files, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the server. This can result in full compromise of the server, including accessing sensitive information, modifying data, or taking down the server.",
       "attack_vectors": [
         "The attacker can manipulate the `installed_config_file` GET parameter to point to a malicious file on a remote server."
       ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server and control the content of the `installed_config_file` parameter. No authentication is required."
