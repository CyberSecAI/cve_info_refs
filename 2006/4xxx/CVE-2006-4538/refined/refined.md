{
  "CVE-2006-4538": {
    "Description": "A flaw in the ELF handling on ia64 and sparc architectures which triggered a cross-region memory mapping and allowed a local user to cause a denial of service.",
    "Root cause": "The ELF loader on ia64 and sparc platforms did not sufficiently verify the memory layout.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient verification of memory layout by ELF loader"
    ],
    "Impact": "Local users can cause a denial of service (crash) by attempting to execute a specially crafted executable.",
     "Attack vectors": [
        "Local execution of a malformed ELF file"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker must be a local user on the vulnerable system"
    }
}
