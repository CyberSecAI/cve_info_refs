Benjamin C. Wiley Sittler discovered that Python's repr() function did
not properly handle UTF-32/UCS-4 strings. If an application uses
repr() on arbitrary untrusted data, this could be exploited to execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the python application.)

I did some research into this, and discovered that most of the affected
packages have already been fixed. The sarge packages have not been
fixed, but I enquired with debian-security and was told there is a fix
in the pipeline. I also noticed that fixed versions of python2.3 and
python2.4 have not propogated to testing yet. python2.3 should propogate
into testing in a couple of days, and I will contact the -release team
to ensure a fixed version of python2.4 (currently frozen) makes its way
into etch.

# RHSA-2006:0713 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

python security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2006%3A0713)

## Topic

Updated Python packages are now available to correct a security issue in
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and 4.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language.

A flaw was discovered in the way that the Python repr() function handled
UTF-32/UCS-4 strings. If an application written in Python used the repr()
function on untrusted data, this could lead to a denial of service or
possibly allow the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the
Python application. (CVE-2006-4980)

In addition, this errata fixes a regression in the SimpleXMLRPCServer
backport for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 that was introduced with RHSA-2005:109.

Users of Python should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a
backported patch to correct this issue.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

### Bug Description

hi,

i discovered a bug yesterday in repr() for unicode strings. this

causes an unpatched non-debug wide (UTF-32/UCS-4) build of python to

abort:

python2.4 -c 'assert(repr(u"\U00010000" \* 39 + u"\uffff" \* 4096)) ==

(repr(u"\U00010000" \* 39 + u"\uffff" \* 4096))'

the problem is fixed by a change to unicodeobject.c. in the process of

fixing it i also found and fixed another bug in repr() on UCS-4 python

builds -- previously paired unicode surrogates were being repr()'ed as a

single "character" even though they are not treated as such by a UCS-4

python build -- i.e. eval(repr(u'\ud800\udc00')) != u'\ud800\udc00' in

an unpatched UCS-4 build.

Package: python2.4

Version: 2.4.3-7ubuntu2

Severity: important

when i run this command:

python -c "repr(u'\u24ea\u059c\u200a\U0001d77e\uff07\u202f\u0747\u202f

\U0001d56b\U0001d5b9\U0001d4e9\u20052\u14bf\U0001d7f8\u200a\U0001d795

\U0001d6e7Z\u2006\u2002\U0001d50a\uff27\u13c0\u2000\uff16\u0411\uff16

\U0001d7e7\uff4c\u2006\u2001\ufe39\u2008\u0313]\u2008\u3014\u3015')"

python aborts with the following backtrace and memory dump:

Hi Benjamin,

Have you sent this upstream to the Python bug tracker on SourceForge?

If not, I'd suggest doing this so that they can merge it in. If you'd like

I can also send this up as well, but it seems like you'd like to be the one

to get credit for your patch.

Thanks.

Upstream 2.4 patch:

<http://svn.python.org/view/python/branches/release24-maint/Objects/unicodeobject.c?p2=%2Fpython%2Fbranches%2Frelease24-maint%2FObjects%2Funicodeobject.c&p1=python%2Fbranches%2Frelease24-maint%2FObjects%2Funicodeobject.c&r1=51466&r2=51465&rev=51466&view=diff&makepatch=1&diff_format=u>

I can confirm edgy is fixed.

From testing, it looks like python2.3 is vulnerable as well.

btw, i can confirm that this fix has been applied in edgy on the

following python interpreters:

python2.4 2.4.3-8ubuntu2

python2.5 2.5-0ubuntu1

however it's still broken in the following edgy python:

python2.3 2.3.5-15ubuntu1

and in dapper it's broken too, at least in the version i have installed:

python2.4 2.4.2-0ubuntu3

python security update (RHSA-2006-0713)

Original Release Date: October 12, 2006

Last Revised: October 12, 2006

Number: ASA-2006-229

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 1.0

Advisory Status: Interim

---

## 1. Overview:

Python is a popular object-oriented scripting language.

The repr() Python routine was found to contain a flaw when handling
strings
encoded in UTF-32/UCS-4. A malicious user could possibly cause a
Denial of
Service (DoS) or arbitrary code execution condition when passing data
to an
application that makes use of this routine. The Common
Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2006-4980](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4980) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the
security
advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2006-0713.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with Python installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Intuity LX | All | Low | See recommended actions below.  This issue will be addressed in accordance with [Avaya's Product Security Vulnerability Response Policy](http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/security_vulnerability_response.pdf) |
| Avaya Messaging Storage Server | All | Low | See recommended actions below.  This issue will be addressed in accordance with [Avaya's Product Security Vulnerability Response Policy](http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/security_vulnerability_response.pdf) |
| Avaya Message Networking | All | Low | See recommended actions below.  This issue will be addressed in accordance with [Avaya's Product Security Vulnerability Response Policy](http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/security_vulnerability_response.pdf) |
| Avaya CCS/SES | 3.1.1 | Low | See recommended actions below.  This issue will be addressed in accordance with [Avaya's Product Security Vulnerability Response Policy](http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/security_vulnerability_response.pdf) |

**Recommended Actions:**
For all system products which use
vulnerable
versions of Python, Avaya recommends that customers restrict local
and
network access to the server. This restriction should be enforced
through the
use of physical security, firewalls, ACLs, VPNs, and other
generally-accepted
networking practices until such time as an update becomes available
and can
be installed.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating
systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying
operating
system or applications that come with the operating system. These
vulnerabilities often do not impact the software-only product
directly but
may threaten the integrity of the underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not
affected by
the vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be.
Customers should determine on which Linux operating system the
product was
installed and then follow that vendors guidance:

## 4. Software-Only Products:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CVLAN | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. The CVLAN application does not require the software described in this advisory. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite(IMS) | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. The IMS application does not require the software described in this advisory. |

**Recommended Actions:**
Avaya recommends that customers follow
recommended actions supplied by the Operating System vendor (e.g.
RedHat
Linux) or remove the affected package.

## 5. Additional Information:

Additional information may also be available via the Avaya support
[website](http://support.avaya.com) and through your Avaya
account
representative. Please contact your Avaya product support
representative, or
dial 1-800-242-2121, with any questions.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : python2.3
Vulnerability  : buffer overflow
Problem-Type   : local(remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2006-4980
Debian Bug     : 391589

Benjamin C. Wiley Sittler discovered that the repr() of the Python
interpreter allocates insufficient memory when parsing UCS-4 Unicode
strings, which might lead to execution of arbitrary code through
a buffer overflow.

For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.5-3sarge2. Due to build problems this update lacks fixed
packages for the Alpha and Sparc architectures. Once they are sorted
out, fixed binaries will be released.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.5-16.

We recommend that you upgrade your Python 2.3 packages.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

## SUSE Security

# A Process That Never Ends

### SUSE is committed to delivering best effort security to its customers and to the Open Source community. We believe that trust in Open Source Software security in general, and the user's privacy in particular, are both indispensable and indefeasible.

We treat software security as a process that never ends. This means we:

* Promptly react to security incidents and deliver premium quality security updates
* Continuously improve the security-related functionality in SUSE products
* Continuously contribute to the rapidly growing maturity of Open Source Software
* Respect the Open Source Software security principles of openness, transparency and traceability

Software security is a complex challenge. Software can provide many of its own security features, such as authentication methods, encryption, intrusion prevention and detection, and backup.

At the same time, it can also contain errors (both deliberate and accidental) that can affect the system's security, including design flaws, programming errors, and backdoors.

The SUSE Security Team addresses all of these aspects of software security, on an ongoing basis. Software security cannot be thought of as a state you can achieve at a specific point in time. Instead, it is a process that must be executed with professional expertise and continuous development. This persistent focus is what has given Open Source Software, Linux and SUSE such an excellent reputation for security.

# Python: Buffer Overflow — GLSA **200610-07**

A buffer overflow in Python's "repr()" function can be exploited to cause a
Denial of Service and potentially allows the execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-lang/python** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.4.3-r4** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.4.3-r4**revision >= **2.3.5-r3**revision >= **2.3.6** |

### Background

Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, cross-platform
programming language.

### Description

Benjamin C. Wiley Sittler discovered a buffer overflow in Python's
"repr()" function when handling UTF-32/UCS-4 encoded strings.

### Impact

If a Python application processes attacker-supplied data with the
"repr()" function, this could potentially lead to the execution of
arbitrary code with the privileges of the affected application or a
Denial of Service.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Python users should update to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-lang/python-2.4.3-r4"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : python2.4
Vulnerability  : buffer overflow
Problem-Type   : local(remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2006-4980
Debian Bug     : 391589

Benjamin C. Wiley Sittler discovered that the repr() of the Python
interpreter allocates insufficient memory when parsing UCS-4 Unicode
strings, which might lead to execution of arbitrary code through
a buffer overflow.

For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.1-2sarge1. Due to build problems this update lacks fixed
packages for the m68k architecture. Once they are sorted out, binaries
for m68k will be released.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.4-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your Python 2.4 packages.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.
