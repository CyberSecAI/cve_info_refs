Root cause of vulnerability:
The ftpd service in Apple Mac OS X may crash when attempting to authenticate a valid user with a failed login attempt, but not when authenticating an unknown user.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- The vulnerability lies in how the ftpd service handles failed login attempts for valid users.
- The vulnerability can be used to identify valid usernames.
- There is a crash on failed login attempts.

Impact of exploitation:
- An unauthenticated attacker can determine valid user account names by observing whether a crash occurs during failed login attempts.
- A remote, unauthenticated attacker can cause a denial-of-service condition by repeatedly attempting to log in with valid usernames.

Attack vectors:
- The attack vector is network-based via the FTP service.
- The vulnerability can be exploited by remote, unauthenticated attackers.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker needs to be able to connect to the FTP service.
- No special privileges or user authentication is needed initially to identify valid users.
- The attacker can be located remotely.
