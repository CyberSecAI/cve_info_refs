**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `query` and `page` parameters within the `index.php` file of eMU CMS v0.2.1.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability is present due to the failure to sanitize user-controlled input.

**Impact of exploitation:**

    - Stealing cookies/session tokens.
    - Redirecting to phishing sites.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the victim.
    - Defacing the web page.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is remote and involves injecting malicious code through the `query` and `page` parameters of the `index.php` file, potentially by crafting a malicious URL that the victim clicks on.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious URL containing the malicious code within the vulnerable parameters (`query` and `page`).
- No special user privileges are required, this can be achieved by tricking a user to click on the malicious link.
