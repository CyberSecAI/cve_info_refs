    "ID": "CVE-2006-4503",
    "content": "Multiple vulnerabilities exist in NX5Linkx version 1.0, including:\n\n1.  **Arbitrary file disclosure:** The `logo` parameter in `link.php` is not sanitized, allowing an attacker to specify a local file path which will be copied to the publicly accessible `logos` directory. This allows an attacker to read arbitrary files on the server.\n\n2.  **Multiple SQL Injections:** The `c` parameter (in the script displaying links) and `l` parameter (in the \"out\" script which redirects) are not properly sanitized before being used in SQL queries. This can lead to arbitrary SQL queries or HTTP response splitting by injecting arbitrary SQL code. This is only exploitable if `magic_quotes_gpc` is off.\n\n3.  **HTTP Response Splitting:** The `url` parameter in `link.php` is not sanitized, allowing for HTTP response splitting attacks.\n\n**Vulnerable Software:** NX5Linkx (http://nx5ware.nx5.org/links.php) version 1.0\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:** Lack of input sanitization for the `logo`, `c`, `l`, and `url` parameters.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n* Arbitrary file disclosure\n* SQL Injection\n* HTTP Response Splitting\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n* Arbitrary file disclosure: An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server.\n* SQL Injection: An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or even denial of service. Also, HTTP response splitting may be achieved using SQL injection.\n* HTTP Response Splitting: An attacker can manipulate HTTP responses, potentially leading to cross-site scripting (XSS) or cache poisoning attacks.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n* Arbitrary file disclosure: By providing a crafted file path via the `logo` parameter in `link.php`.\n* SQL Injection: By injecting malicious SQL code via the `c` parameter in the links list script or the `l` parameter in the `out` script.\n* HTTP Response Splitting: By injecting malicious HTTP headers via the `url` parameter in `link.php`.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\nThe attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.\n\n**PoC/Exploit examples:**\n* Arbitrary file disclosure: http://host/link.php?logo=/etc/passwd. The file can then be downloaded from http://host/logos/N (where N is the link ID)\n* SQL Injection: \n  * http://host/links.php?c=999'%20union%20select%201,222/*\n  * http://host/out.php?l=999' union select 1,1,'http://google.com',1,1,1,1/*\n* HTTP Response Splitting: http://host/link.php (with a form submission of url=http://host.com%0D%0A%0D%0AHTTP/1.0 200 OK%0D%0A%0D%0A.......)"
