# Hardened PHP

PHP is far and away the most popular backend programming
language today, with more than 80 websites worldwide taking advantage of PHP
solutions.

All of the most popular CMS platforms – including WordPress,
Joomla!, and Drupal (just to name a few) leverage this technology. It’s
flexibility and versatility make it a powerhouse programming language, but that
doesn’t necessarily mean that it is as secure as it could or should be “right
out of the box”, so to speak.

It’s popularity, it’s widespread adaptation, and its
relatively easy to learn structure has made PHP a major target for cyber
criminals and hackers to exploit. This is why it’s mission-critical that you
harden your PHP files server-side as much as possible, protecting your server,
your content, and your visitors from these kinds of dangerous exploits.

PHP can be hardened manually as well as with patching
protocols. Below we highlight the steps you’ll want to take to make sure that
your PHP installation is as locked down as possible.

**Locate the PHP Config File You’re Hardening on Your Server**

The very first step in hardening your PHP installation is
first finding the PHP configuration file on your server to begin with.

Depending on the hosting that you are taking advantage of
(the actual provider as well as the type of hosting you have selected) it can
be in a variety of different locations. The best way to quickly locate this
critical file is to simply do a server-side search for “PHP.ini” as this is the
actual file that you’ll want to modify, edit, and harden moving forward.

**Editing the File on Shared Hosting**

Individuals looking to harden their PHP on a shared hosting platform (see [The Blog Starter](https://www.theblogstarter.com/) for hosting options) will have a bit of a tougher hill to climb, if only because most providers do not offer root access to the server with this level of hosting.

You’ll have to contact your hosting provider directly to see
if you can edit the main PHP.ini file itself. In the event that you aren’t
allowed this kind of access, you can still request to have access to the
“.HTaccess” file on your server to make the changes you need to.

You won’t be able to make changes quite as quickly this way
as you would have been able to with a patch (like we highlight below), but you
can manually make individual line edits to your PHP settings this way to enjoy
a higher level of security.

Shared hosting may still have limitations on the PHP elements you can edit no matter how much access you are granted. If you want total control over hardening your PHP (and total control over the security of your web platform), it’s not a bad idea to move to Dedicated or VPS servers if you can afford it.

**Editing the File on Dedicated/VPS servers**

If you are moving forward with a Virtual Private Server
(VPS) or Dedicated server set up the process for hardening your PHP is a lot
easier, though it’s still not as quick as applying a server wide patch like we
highlight below.

In the backend administration toolset of your server
solution you’ll find a tool called the Web Host Manager. This is usually
located under the “Service Configuration” settings option in your backend
dashboard.

This tool is going to allow you to select the PHP
Configuration Editor, and editor that allows you to make changes to your
PHP.ini file through a more user-friendly interface than actually downloading
the file, opening it up in Notepad or a similar application, and then making
the edits individually with the actual source code itself.

There are a handful of individual settings that you’re going
to want to reconfigure manually when taking this approach to hardening your PHP
installation, including (but not limited to):

•           Remote
Connections

•           Run Time
Settings

•           Input Data
Restrictions

•           Error
Handling

•           Restrict
File Access

•           File
Uploads

•           Session
Security

•           Soap Cache

… And that’s just the tip of the iceberg.

**Use a Patch like Suhosin to Harden PHP Almost Instantly**

The big attraction behind PHP is that it is so easy to learn,
so easy to develop with, and about as flexible as a programming language gets –
and that’s why a lot of people feel comfortable hardening their PHP manually,
running line by line through their PHP.ini file and doing the heavy lifting of
securing their system on their own.

And while you may be a top-tier programmer and feel
completely confident in your coding prowess, the truth of the matter is that if
you allow ANY coding from ANY outside developers to run on your server you’ll
still have vulnerabilities that you may not be able to address independently –
vulnerabilities that can compromise your entire platform.

This is why patching your PHP systemwide is such a savvy
move, and why so many developers, programmers, and website/web application
owners utilizing PHP decide to move forward with a solution like Suhosin.

Engineered specifically to provide an advanced layer of
protection to PHP installations, the Suhosin patch is a dual action component
that provides a level of hardening that may not be possible through any other
manual approach.

On the one hand, Suhosin works to patch the PHP core on your
server. This allows this patch to protect against issues like format string
vulnerabilities, buffer overflows, and other issues that may plague your as of
yet unsecured PHP installation.

On the other hand, Suhosin also acts as an extension to the
PHP that has already been installed on your server. This extension runs 24/7,
around-the-clock, to protect against all kinds of vulnerabilities (including
runtime vulnerabilities) as well as individual session issues while adding a
whole host of logging, filtering, and administrative tools at the same time.

Best of all, the installation of this PHP hardening patch is
about as simple and as straightforward as it gets.

All of the features it has to offer exist within its
extension module and “flipping the switch” to allow that extension to run is as
easy as activating the individual extension inside of the PHP.ini file.
Sometimes you’ll have to manually add a couple of extra Configuration
Directives to trigger the full suite of extension capabilities, but most of the
time the Suhosin patch works just as soon as the edits to the PHP.ini file go
live.

php security update (RHSA-2006-0688)

Original Release Date: October 20, 2006

Last Revised: October 10, 2008

Number: ASA-2006-223

Risk Level: Medium

Advisory Version: 3.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

PHP is a general purpose scripting language widely used in World Wide Web
(WWW) pages and applications.

Vulnerable versions of PHP were found to have an integer overflow condition
in the PHP memory handling routines. A remote malicious user could possibly
execute arbitrary code as the apache user on a host running PHP if a script
can allocate memory in relation to untrusted user data. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2006-4812](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4812) to this issue.

PHP's sscanf() function was found to contain a buffer overflow condition.
Using sscanf() with positional arguments in the format string, a malicious
remote user could possibly execute arbitrary code as the apache user using
carefully constructed requests. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2006-4020](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4020) to this issue.

Two integer overflow issues were found in vulnerable versions of PHP running
on 64-bit systems. These issues could lead to either a heap overflow or
possible Denial of Service (DoS) conditions. Avaya system products are not
affected by these issues as they are 32-bit systems. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names
[CVE-2006-4482](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4482) and
[CVE-2006-4486](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4486) to these issues.

The gd extension for vulnerable versions of PHP was found to contain a buffer
overflow flaw. Using a specially crafted GIF image file, a remote malicious
user could possibly cause a heap overflow if a script processed GIF images
via the gd extension from untrusted sources. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2006-4484](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4484) to this issue.

The stripos() function was found to contain a buffer overread issue in
vulnerable versions of PHP. Scripts utilizing stripos() and allowing
untrusted remote user data could possibly cause a Denial of Service (DoS)
condition as PHP might read beyond the end of the buffer. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2006-4485](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4485) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security
advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2006-0688.html>

# PHP: Integer overflow — GLSA **200610-14**

PHP is vulnerable to an integer overflow potentially allowing the remote
execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-lang/php** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **5.1.6-r6** |
| Unaffected versions | revision >= **4.4.4-r6**revision >= **4.4.6**revision >= **4.4.7**revision >= **4.4.8\_pre20070816**>= **5.1.6-r6** |

### Background

PHP is a widely-used general-purpose scripting language that is
especially suited for Web development and can be embedded into HTML.

### Description

A flaw in the PHP memory handling routines allows an unserialize() call
to be executed on non-allocated memory due to a previous integer
overflow.

### Impact

## 1. Overview:

PHP is a general purpose scripting language widely used in World Wide Web
(WWW) pages and applications.

PHP's memory handling functions were found to contain an integer overflow
vulnerability. Using a specially constructed request message, an attacker
could possibly execute arbitrary code as the user apache on the server
running PHP. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project

For all system products which use vulnerable
versions of PHP, Avaya recommends that customers restrict local and network
access to the server. This restriction should be enforced through the use of
physical security, firewalls, ACLs, VPNs, and other generally-accepted
networking practices until such time as an update becomes available and can
be installed.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating
system or applications that come with the operating system. These
vulnerabilities often do not impact the software-only product directly but
may threaten the integrity of the underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by
the vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be.
Customers should determine on which Linux operating system the product was
installed and then follow that vendors guidance:

RHSA-2006:0708 - Security Advisory

Issued:
2006-10-05
Updated:
2006-10-05
# RHSA-2006:0708 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

php security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

Updated PHP packages that fix an integer overflow flaw are now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language commonly used with the Apache
HTTP Web server.

An integer overflow was discovered in the PHP memory handling routines. If
a script can cause memory allocation based on untrusted user data, a remote
attacker sending a carefully crafted request could execute arbitrary code
as the 'apache' user. (CVE-2006-4812)

This issue did not affect the PHP packages distributed with Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 3 or 4.

Users of PHP should upgrade to these updated packages which contain a
backported patch that corrects this issue.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

## Affected Products

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server 2 ia64
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server 2 i386
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux Workstation 2 ia64
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux Workstation 2 i386

## Fixes

* [BZ - 209409](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=209409)
  - CVE-2006-4812 PHP ecalloc integer overflow

## CVEs

* [CVE-2006-4812](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2006-4812.html)

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# USN-362-1: PHP vulnerabilities

11 October 2006

PHP vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)
* [Ubuntu 5.10](/security/notices?release=breezy)
* [Ubuntu 5.04](/security/notices?release=hoary)

## Details

The stripos() function did not check for invalidly long or empty

haystack strings. In an application that uses this function on

arbitrary untrusted data this could be exploited to crash the PHP

interpreter. ([CVE-2006-4485](/security/CVE-2006-4485))

An integer overflow was discovered in the PHP memory allocation

handling. On 64-bit platforms, the "memory\_limit" setting was not

enforced correctly. A remote attacker could exploit this to cause a

Denial of Service attack through memory exhaustion. ([CVE-2006-4486](/security/CVE-2006-4486))

Maksymilian Arciemowicz discovered that security relevant

configuration options like open\_basedir and safe\_mode (which can be

configured in Apache's httpd.conf) could be bypassed and reset to

their default value in php.ini by using the ini\_restore() function.

([CVE-2006-4625](/security/CVE-2006-4625))

Stefan Esser discovered that the ecalloc() function in the Zend engine

did not check for integer overflows. This particularly affected the

unserialize() function. In applications which unserialize untrusted

user-defined data, this could be exploited to execute arbitrary code

with the application's privileges. ([CVE-2006-4812](/security/CVE-2006-4812))

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

RHSA-2006:0688 - Security Advisory

Issued:
2006-10-05
Updated:

# RHSA-2006:0688 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

php security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

Updated PHP packages that fix multiple security issues are now available
for the Red Hat Application Stack.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language commonly used with the Apache
HTTP Web server.

An integer overflow was discovered in the PHP memory handling routines. If
a script can cause memory allocation based on untrusted user data, a remote
attacker sending a carefully crafted request could execute arbitrary code
as the 'apache' user. (CVE-2006-4812)

A buffer overflow was discovered in the PHP sscanf() function. If a script
used the sscanf() function with positional arguments in the format string,
a remote attacker sending a carefully crafted request could execute
arbitrary code as the 'apache' user. (CVE-2006-4020)

An integer overflow was discovered in the PHP wordwrap() and str\_repeat()
functions. If a script running on a 64-bit server used either of these
functions on untrusted user data, a remote attacker sending a carefully
crafted request might be able to cause a heap overflow. (CVE-2006-4482)

A buffer overflow was discovered in the PHP gd extension. If a script was
set up to process GIF images from untrusted sources using the gd extension,
a remote attacker could cause a heap overflow. (CVE-2006-4484)

A buffer overread was discovered in the PHP stripos() function. If a
script used the stripos() function with untrusted user data, PHP may read
past the end of a buffer, which could allow a denial of service attack by a
remote user. (CVE-2006-4485)

An integer overflow was discovered in the PHP memory allocation handling.
On 64-bit platforms, the "memory\_limit" setting was not enforced correctly,
which could allow a denial of service attack by a remote user. (CVE-2006-4486)

These packages also contain a fix for a bug where certain input strings to
the metaphone() function could cause memory corruption.

Users of PHP should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
backported patches to correct these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

# Hardened PHP

PHP is far and away the most popular backend programming
language today, with more than 80 websites worldwide taking advantage of PHP
solutions.

All of the most popular CMS platforms – including WordPress,
Joomla!, and Drupal (just to name a few) leverage this technology. It’s
flexibility and versatility make it a powerhouse programming language, but that
doesn’t necessarily mean that it is as secure as it could or should be “right
out of the box”, so to speak.

It’s popularity, it’s widespread adaptation, and its
relatively easy to learn structure has made PHP a major target for cyber
criminals and hackers to exploit. This is why it’s mission-critical that you
harden your PHP files server-side as much as possible, protecting your server,
your content, and your visitors from these kinds of dangerous exploits.

PHP can be hardened manually as well as with patching
protocols. Below we highlight the steps you’ll want to take to make sure that
your PHP installation is as locked down as possible.

**Locate the PHP Config File You’re Hardening on Your Server**

The very first step in hardening your PHP installation is
first finding the PHP configuration file on your server to begin with.

Depending on the hosting that you are taking advantage of
(the actual provider as well as the type of hosting you have selected) it can
be in a variety of different locations. The best way to quickly locate this
critical file is to simply do a server-side search for “PHP.ini” as this is the
actual file that you’ll want to modify, edit, and harden moving forward.

**Editing the File on Shared Hosting**

Individuals looking to harden their PHP on a shared hosting platform (see [The Blog Starter](https://www.theblogstarter.com/) for hosting options) will have a bit of a tougher hill to climb, if only because most providers do not offer root access to the server with this level of hosting.

You’ll have to contact your hosting provider directly to see
if you can edit the main PHP.ini file itself. In the event that you aren’t
allowed this kind of access, you can still request to have access to the
“.HTaccess” file on your server to make the changes you need to.

You won’t be able to make changes quite as quickly this way
as you would have been able to with a patch (like we highlight below), but you
can manually make individual line edits to your PHP settings this way to enjoy
a higher level of security.

Shared hosting may still have limitations on the PHP elements you can edit no matter how much access you are granted. If you want total control over hardening your PHP (and total control over the security of your web platform), it’s not a bad idea to move to Dedicated or VPS servers if you can afford it.

**Editing the File on Dedicated/VPS servers**

If you are moving forward with a Virtual Private Server
(VPS) or Dedicated server set up the process for hardening your PHP is a lot
easier, though it’s still not as quick as applying a server wide patch like we
highlight below.

In the backend administration toolset of your server
solution you’ll find a tool called the Web Host Manager. This is usually
located under the “Service Configuration” settings option in your backend
dashboard.

This tool is going to allow you to select the PHP
Configuration Editor, and editor that allows you to make changes to your
PHP.ini file through a more user-friendly interface than actually downloading
the file, opening it up in Notepad or a similar application, and then making
the edits individually with the actual source code itself.

There are a handful of individual settings that you’re going
to want to reconfigure manually when taking this approach to hardening your PHP
installation, including (but not limited to):

•           Remote
Connections

•           Run Time
Settings

•           Input Data
Restrictions

•           Error
Handling

•           Restrict
File Access

•           File
Uploads

•           Session
Security

•           Soap Cache

… And that’s just the tip of the iceberg.

**Use a Patch like Suhosin to Harden PHP Almost Instantly**

The big attraction behind PHP is that it is so easy to learn,
so easy to develop with, and about as flexible as a programming language gets –
and that’s why a lot of people feel comfortable hardening their PHP manually,
running line by line through their PHP.ini file and doing the heavy lifting of
securing their system on their own.

And while you may be a top-tier programmer and feel
completely confident in your coding prowess, the truth of the matter is that if
you allow ANY coding from ANY outside developers to run on your server you’ll
still have vulnerabilities that you may not be able to address independently –
vulnerabilities that can compromise your entire platform.

This is why patching your PHP systemwide is such a savvy
move, and why so many developers, programmers, and website/web application
owners utilizing PHP decide to move forward with a solution like Suhosin.

Engineered specifically to provide an advanced layer of
protection to PHP installations, the Suhosin patch is a dual action component
that provides a level of hardening that may not be possible through any other
manual approach.

On the one hand, Suhosin works to patch the PHP core on your
server. This allows this patch to protect against issues like format string
vulnerabilities, buffer overflows, and other issues that may plague your as of
yet unsecured PHP installation.

On the other hand, Suhosin also acts as an extension to the
PHP that has already been installed on your server. This extension runs 24/7,
around-the-clock, to protect against all kinds of vulnerabilities (including
runtime vulnerabilities) as well as individual session issues while adding a
whole host of logging, filtering, and administrative tools at the same time.

Best of all, the installation of this PHP hardening patch is
about as simple and as straightforward as it gets.

All of the features it has to offer exist within its
extension module and “flipping the switch” to allow that extension to run is as
easy as activating the individual extension inside of the PHP.ini file.
Sometimes you’ll have to manually add a couple of extra Configuration
Directives to trigger the full suite of extension capabilities, but most of the
time the Suhosin patch works just as soon as the edits to the PHP.ini file go
live.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

* You think there might be a security vulnerability in a Red Hat product or service.
* You want to provide feedback about our standards of service and performance. If you feel your security concern is not dealt with in a satisfactory manner, please contact secalert@redhat.com.

In all other cases, you should contact [Red Hat Customer Experience & Engagement](/site/support/).

You should contact Red Hat Customer Experience & Engagement if:

* You are unsure about how a known vulnerability affects a Red Hat product or service.
* You wish to report an issue in a language other than English.
* You require technical assistance for a security function (for example, "How do I configure my firewall?").
* You need help upgrading packages due to security alerts. (Refer to "How do I apply package updates from the Red Hat Network?" for information on upgrading packages.)
* Your issue is not security related.

In any of these cases, please contact [Red Hat Customer Experience & Engagement](/site/support/) instead.

## Who reads email sent to secalert@redhat.com?

Only members of Red Hat Product Security, a restricted
and carefully chosen group of Red Hat employees, will have access to
material sent to the secalert@redhat.com address. No outside users can subscribe to this list.

## Reporting security vulnerabilities in Red Hat Offerings

Red Hat Product Security welcomes and encourages all potential vulnerability submissions. For us to provide the best customer service and address issues in a timely manner, please provide the following information, if known:

* The version number of the affected component, such as the rpm package, container image, and java component.
* The environment and corresponding version(s) where the issue was discovered, for example, the operating system's name, version, architecture, or container platform.
* The steps to reproduce, if available.
* The ways an attacker could exploit this vulnerability on a system.
* Is the vulnerability already known to the public? If not, when is the planned date for disclosure?
* The immediate impact if an attacker exploits the vulnerability, such as a denial of service, privilege escalation, or remote code execution.

## How to contact us securely

Red Hat Product Security uses an OpenPGP key to secure our email communications. Mail sent to secalert@redhat.com can be encrypted with this public key. We expect to change the key we use from time to time. Should we change the key, the previous keys will be revoked, and the [rhsa-announce](http://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/rhsa-announce) mailing list will be notified of the change.

advisories are available from [Red Hat Product Security](/site/security/updates/) and via the [Red Hat Customer Portal](/site/security/updates/active/).

## Common Criteria Timely Updates

Refer to the [Life Cycle Security Update Policy](https://access.redhat.com/security/lifecycle-security-update-policy) for information on Red Hat's security update policy as well as information on embargoed (undisclosed) vulnerability handling.

### Resources include the following:

[Red Hat Security Updates (Advisories)](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/security-advisories)

[Red Hat CVE Database](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/cve)

[Red Hat Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure (CVE) Program](https://access.redhat.com/articles/red_hat_cve_program)

## Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD)

Red Hat engages with partners, vendors, researchers, and community coordinators to disclose newly discovered vulnerabilities in hardware, software, and services. Multi-party coordination is a complex process, and understanding the parties' vulnerability disclosure policies, vulnerability handling policies, and contractual agreements opens the way to trusted communication and collaboration. Increasing transparency between parties assures that vendors can understand and manage the risk imposed by the vulnerability and facilitate engagements with other parties. The aim of CVD is to provide timely and consistent guidance to parties and customers to help them protect themselves.

Please see the [Red Hat CNA Vulnerability Disclosure Policy](https://access.redhat.com/articles/red_hat_cna_vulnerability_disclosure_policy) for details on how Red Hat discloses security vulnerabilities under the Red Hat/Fedora scope.

For more information on CVD, please review the information provided in the following links:
