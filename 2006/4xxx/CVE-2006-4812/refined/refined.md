{
  "CVE-2006-4812": {
    "Description": "An integer overflow was discovered in the PHP memory handling routines. If a script can cause memory allocation based on untrusted user data, a remote attacker sending a carefully crafted request could execute arbitrary code as the 'apache' user.",
    "Root cause": "Integer overflow in the ecalloc() function of the Zend Engine within PHP's memory handling routines.",
    "Vulnerabilities": [
      "Integer overflow"
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote attackers can potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the web server user (e.g., 'apache' user), leading to a complete system compromise.",
    "Attack vector": "A remote attacker sends a specially crafted request that causes memory allocation within PHP, leveraging the integer overflow to trigger arbitrary code execution.",
    "Attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send crafted requests to a PHP script that allocates memory based on untrusted user data."
