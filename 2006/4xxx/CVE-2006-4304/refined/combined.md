Patches for the OpenBSD base system are distributed as unified diffs.
Each patch contains usage instructions.
All the following patches are also available in one
[tar.gz file](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.8.tar.gz)
for convenience.

Patches for supported releases are also incorporated into the
[-stable branch](stable.html).

* **001: SECURITY FIX: January 5, 2006**
    *All architectures*

  A buffer overflow has been found in the Perl interpreter with the sprintf function which
  may be exploitable under certain conditions.

  [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.8/common/001_perl.patch)

  * **002: SECURITY FIX: January 5, 2006**
      *All architectures*

    Do not allow users to trick suid programs into re-opening files via /dev/fd.

    [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.8/common/002_fd.patch)

    * **003: RELIABILITY FIX: January 13, 2006**
        *i386 architecture*

      Change the implementation of i386 W^X so that the "execute line" can move around.
      Before it was limited to being either at 512MB (below which all code normally
      lands) or at the top of the stack. Now the line can float as
      [mprotect(2)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.8/mprotect.2)
      and
      [mmap(2)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.8/mmap.2)
      requests need it to. This is now implemented using only GDT selectors
      instead of the LDT so that it is more robust as well.

      [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.8/i386/003_i386pmap.patch)

      * **004: RELIABILITY FIX: January 13, 2006**
          *i386 architecture*

        Constrain
        [i386\_set\_ioperm(2)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.8/i386/i386_set_ioperm.2)
        so even root is blocked from accessing the ioports
        unless the machine is running at lower securelevels or with an open X11 aperture.

        [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.8/i386/004_i386machdep.patch)

        * **005: SECURITY FIX: February 12, 2006**
            *All architectures*

          Josh Bressers has reported a weakness in OpenSSH caused due to the insecure use of the
          [system(3)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.8/system.3)
          function in
          [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.8/scp.1)
          when performing copy operations using filenames that are supplied by the user from the command line.
          This can be exploited to execute shell commands with privileges of the user running
          [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.8/scp.1).

          [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.8/common/005_ssh.patch)

          * **006: SECURITY FIX: March 25, 2006**
              *All architectures*

            A race condition has been reported to exist in the handling by sendmail of
            asynchronous signals. A remote attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the
            privileges of the user running sendmail, typically root.

            [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.8/common/006_sendmail.patch)

            * **007: SECURITY FIX: May 2, 2006**
                *All architectures*

              A security vulnerability has been found in the X.Org server --
              [CVE-2006-1526](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-1526).
              Clients authorized to connect to the X server are able to crash it and to execute
              malicious code within the X server.

              [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.8/common/007_xorg.patch)

              * **008: SECURITY FIX: June 15, 2006**
                  *All architectures*

                A potential denial of service problem has been found in sendmail. A malformed MIME
                message could trigger excessive recursion which will lead to stack exhaustion.
                This denial of service attack only affects delivery of mail from the queue and
                delivery of a malformed message. Other incoming mail is still accepted and
                delivered. However, mail messages in the queue may not be reattempted if a
                malformed MIME message exists.

                [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.8/common/008_sendmail2.patch)

                * **009: SECURITY FIX: July 30, 2006**
                    *All architectures*

                  [httpd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.8/httpd.8)'s
                  mod\_rewrite has a potentially exploitable off-by-one buffer overflow.
                  The buffer overflow may result in a vulnerability which, in combination
                  with certain types of Rewrite rules in the web server configuration files,
                  could be triggered remotely. The default install is not affected by the
                  buffer overflow. CVE-2006-3747

                  [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.8/common/009_httpd.patch)

                  * **010: SECURITY FIX: August 25, 2006**
                      *All architectures*

                    A potential denial of service problem has been found in sendmail. A message
                    with really long header lines could trigger a use-after-free bug causing
                    sendmail to crash.

                    [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.8/common/010_sendmail3.patch)

                    * **011: SECURITY FIX: August 25, 2006**
                        *All architectures*

                      Due to an off-by-one error in
                      [dhcpd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.8/dhcpd.8),
                      it is possible to cause
                      [dhcpd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.8/dhcpd.8)
                      to exit by sending a DHCPDISCOVER packet with a 32-byte client identifier option.
                      [CVE-2006-3122](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-3122)

                      [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.8/common/011_dhcpd.patch)

                      * **012: SECURITY FIX: August 25, 2006**
                          *All architectures*

                        It is possible to cause the kernel to panic when more than the default number of
                        semaphores have been allocated.

                        [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.8/common/012_sem.patch)

                        * **013: SECURITY FIX: August 25, 2006**
                            *All architectures*

                          A problem in
                          [isakmpd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.8/isakmpd.8)
                          caused IPsec to run partly without replay protection. If
                          [isakmpd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.8/isakmpd.8)
                          was acting as responder during SA negotiation, SA's with a replay window of size 0 were created.
                          An attacker could reinject sniffed IPsec packets, which will be accepted without checking the
                          replay counter.

                          [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.8/common/013_isakmpd.patch)

                          * **014: SECURITY FIX: September 2, 2006**
                              *All architectures*

                            Due to the failure to correctly validate LCP configuration option lengths,
                            it is possible for an attacker to send LCP packets via an
                            [sppp(4)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.8/sppp.4)
                            connection causing the kernel to panic.
                            [CVE-2006-4304](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4304)

                                *All architectures*

                              Two Denial of Service issues have been found with BIND.
                              An attacker who can perform recursive lookups on a DNS server and is able
                              to send a sufficiently large number of recursive queries, or is able to
                              get the DNS server to return more than one SIG(covered) RRsets can stop
                              the functionality of the DNS service.
                              An attacker querying an authoritative DNS server serving a RFC 2535
                              DNSSEC zone may be able to crash the DNS server.

                                Due to incorrect PKCS#1 v1.5 padding validation in OpenSSL, it is possible for
                                an attacker to construct an invalid signature which OpenSSL would accept as a

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

SPPP(4)                   OpenBSD Programmer's Manual                  SPPP(4)

NAME
     sppp - point to point protocol network layer for synchronous lines

SYNOPSIS
     pseudo-device sppp [count]

DESCRIPTION
     The sppp network layer implements the state machine and the Link Control
     Protocol (LCP) of the point to point protocol (PPP) as described in RFC
     1661.  Note that this layer does not provide network interfaces of its
     own, it is rather intended to be layered on top of drivers providing a
     synchronous point-to-point connection that wish to run a PPP stack over
     it.  The corresponding network interfaces have to be provided by these
     hardware drivers.

     The sppp layer provides three basic modes of operation.  The default
     mode, with no special flags to be set, is to create the PPP connection
     (administrative Open event to the LCP layer) as soon as the interface is
     taken up with the ifconfig(8) command.  Taking the interface down again
     will terminate the LCP layer and thus all other layers on top.  The link
     will also terminate itself as soon as no Network Control Protocol (NCP)
     is open anymore, indicating that the lower layers are no longer needed.

     Setting the link-level flag link0 with ifconfig(8) will cause the respec-
     tive network interface to go into passive mode.  This means the adminis-
     trative Open event to the LCP layer will be delayed until after the lower
     layers signals an Up event (rise of ``carrier'').  This can be used by
     lower layers to support a dial-in connection where the physical layer
     isn't available immediately at startup, but only after some external
     event arrives.  Receipt of a Down event from the lower layer will not
     take the interface completely down in this case.

     Finally, setting the flag link1 will cause the interface to operate in
     dial-on-demand mode.  This is also only useful if the lower layer sup-
     ports the notion of a carrier (like with an ISDN line).  Upon configuring
     the respective interface, it will delay the administrative Open event to
     the LCP layer until either an outbound network packet arrives, or until
     the lower layer signals an Up event, indicating an inbound connection.
     As with passive mode, receipt of a Down event (loss of carrier) will not
     automatically take the interface down, thus it remains available for fur-
     ther connections.

     The sppp layer supports the debug interface flag that can be set with
     ifconfig(8).  If this flag is set, the various control protocol packets
     being exchanged as well as the option negotiation between both ends of
     the link will be logged at level LOG_DEBUG.  This can be helpful to exam-
     ine configuration problems during the first attempts to set up a new con-
     figuration.  Without this flag being set, only the major phase transi-
     tions will be logged at level LOG_INFO.

     It is possible to leave the local interface IP address open for negotia-
     tion by setting it to 0.0.0.0.  This requires that the remote peer can
     correctly supply a value for it based on the identity of the caller, or
     on the remote address supplied by this side.  Due to the way the IPCP op-
     tion negotiation works, this address is being supplied late during the
     negotiation, which might cause the remote peer to make wrong assumptions.

     In a similar spirit the remote address can be set to the magical value
     0.0.0.1 which means that we don't care what address the remote side will
     use, as long as it is not 0.0.0.0.  This is useful if your ISP has sever-
     al dial-in servers.  You can of course route add something or other
     0.0.0.1 and it will do exactly what you would want it to.

     The PAP and CHAP authentication protocols as described in RFC 1334, and
     RFC 1994 resp., are also implemented.  Their parameters are being con-
     trolled by the spppcontrol(8) utility.

DIAGNOSTICS
     <ifname><ifnum>: <proto> illegal <event> in state <statename>  An event
     happened that should not happen for the current state the respective con-
     trol protocol is in.  See RFC 1661 for a description of the state automa-
     ton.

     <ifname><ifnum>: loopback  The state automaton detected a line loopback
     (that is, it was talking with itself).  The interface will be temporarily
     disabled.

     <ifname><ifnum>: up  The LCP layer is running again, after a line loop-
     back had previously been detected.

     <ifname><ifnum>: down  The keepalive facility detected the line being un-
     responsive.  Keepalive must be explicitly requested by the lower layers
     in order to take place.

AUTHORS
     The original implementation of sppp was written in 1994 at Cronyx Ltd.,
     Moscow by Serge Vakulenko <vak@cronyx.ru>.  Joerg Wunsch
     <joerg_wunsch@uriah.heep.sax.de> rewrote a large part in 1997 in order to
     fully implement the state machine as described in RFC 1661, so it could
     also be used for dialup lines.  He also wrote this man page.  Serge later
     on wrote a basic implementation for PAP and CHAP, which served as the
     base for the current implementation, done again by Joerg Wunsch.

BUGS
     Many.

     Currently, only the IPCP control protocol and ip(4) network protocol are
     supported.

     Negotiation loop avoidance is not fully implemented.  If the negotiation
     doesn't converge, this can cause an endless loop.

     The various parameters that should be adjustable per RFC 1661 are cur-
     rently hard-coded into the kernel, and should be made accessible through
     spppcontrol(8).

     Passive mode has not been tested extensively.

     More NCPs should be implemented, as well as other control protocols for
     authentication and link quality reporting.

     IPCP should support VJ header compression.

     Link-level compression protocols should be supported.

CVE Name: CVE-2006-4304
For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit
.
0. Revision History
v1.0 2006-08-23 Initial release.
v1.1 2006-08-25 Corrected name of affected driver.
NOTE WELL: The original version of this advisory identified the affected
driver as ppp(4). This is incorrect; the problem occurs in the sppp(4)
driver instead.
I. Background
The sppp(4) driver implements the state machine and the Link Control
Protocol (LCP) of the Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) and is used in
combination with underlying drivers which provide synchronous
point-to-point connections. In particular, sppp(4) is commonly used
with i4bisppp(4) and ng\_sppp(4).
II. Problem Description
While processing Link Control Protocol (LCP) configuration options received
from the remote host, sppp(4) fails to correctly validate option lengths.
This may result in data being read or written beyond the allocated kernel
memory buffer.
III. Impact
An attacker able to send LCP packets, including the remote end of a sppp(4)
connection, can cause the FreeBSD kernel to panic. Such an attacker may
also be able to obtain sensitive information or gain elevated privileges.
IV. Workaround
No workaround is available, but systems which do not use sppp(4) are not
vulnerable.
V. Solution
Perform one of the following:
1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to 4-STABLE, 5-STABLE, or 6-STABLE,
or to the RELENG\_6\_1, RELENG\_6\_0, RELENG\_5\_5, RELENG\_5\_4, RELENG\_5\_3,
or RELENG\_4\_11 security branch dated after the correction date.
2) To patch your present system:
The following patches have been verified to apply to FreeBSD 4.11, 5.3,
5.4, 5.5, 6.0, and 6.1 systems.
a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
