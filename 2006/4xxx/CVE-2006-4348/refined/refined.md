```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The `config.kochsuite.php` file in the Kochsuite component for Joomla/Mambo CMS includes an external file using a variable that is controllable by the user via the `mosConfig_absolute_path` parameter. This allows for remote file inclusion.

- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability. The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to include an arbitrary remote file.

- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server by including a malicious file from a remote server. This can lead to complete compromise of the affected web application and server.

- Attack vectors: The vulnerability can be exploited via an HTTP GET request by setting the `mosConfig_absolute_path` parameter to a URL pointing to a malicious file.

- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Joomla/Mambo CMS instance. No authentication is required.
