{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to improper validation of the 'id' parameter in the '/scripts/cbag/ag.exe' and '/scripts/s360v2/s360.exe' scripts, which are used to retrieve files. Specifically, directory traversal characters are not sanitized allowing access to the file system.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Directory Traversal vulnerability"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker can read arbitrary files accessible to the web server process. This could include sensitive files such as password hashes of the application.",
  "Attack vectors": "By sending a crafted HTTP request with the 'id' parameter containing directory traversal sequences.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the affected Cybozu products."
