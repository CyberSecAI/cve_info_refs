How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Cisco IOS
Tested on: C3550 IOS 12.1(19)

took over
28.07.05 Paul successfully reproduces the issue
04.08.05 Paul notifies FX about availabe fixes

by Cisco
06.09.06 Final advisory going public as coordinated release
\*Note-Initial notification by phenoelit

[ Overview ]
Cisco Systems IOS contains a bug when parsing GRE packets
with GRE source routing information. A specially crafter GRE packet
can cause the router to reuse packet packet data from unrelated
ring buffer memory. The resulting packet is reinjected in the routing
queues.
[ Description ]
The GRE protocol according to RFC1701 supports source routing
different from the one known in IPv4. An optional header is added to
the GRE header containing Source Route Entries for further routing.
GRE header:
0 1 2 3
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|C|R|K|S|s|Recur| Flags | Ver | Protocol Type |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
| Checksum (optional) | Offset (optional) |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
| Key (optional) |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
| Sequence Number (optional) |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
| Routing (optional) |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
When a specially crafted GRE packet with routing information is
received by a Cisco IOS device, the offset field is not verified
to point inside the packet but is subtracted from what appears
to be a short integer holding the overall length of the IP packet,
causing an overflow of the same.
This causes other memory contents of the packet ring buffers to
be interpreted as the payload IP packet and reinjected into the
routing queue with fairly large length information:
GRE decapsulated IP 0.3.74.0->0.0.1.30 (len=65407, ttl=39)
GRE decapsulated IP 176.94.8.0->0.0.0.0 (len=64904, ttl=0)
GRE decapsulated IP 0.15.31.193->176.94.8.0 (len=64894, ttl=237)
GRE decapsulated IP 128.42.131.220->128.0.3.74 (len=64884, ttl=128)
The outer IP packet must come from the configured tunnel source
and be sent to the configured tunnel destination IP address.
By carefully filling the ring buffers with legitimate traffic like
ICMP, containing an IP header at the right offset, an attacker can
create IP packets with large length values inside IOS. PSIRT
believes this cannot be done, Phenoelit differs on that.
[ Example ]
Internet Protocol,
Src Addr: 85.158.1.110 (85.158.1.110),
Dst Addr: 198.133.219.25 (198.133.219.25)
Version: 4
Header length: 20 bytes
Differentiated Services Field: 0x00
Total Length: 28
Identification: 0xaffe (45054)
Flags: 0x00
Fragment offset: 0
Time to live: 30
Protocol: GRE (0x2f)
Header checksum: 0xf409 (correct)
Source: 85.158.1.110 (85.158.1.110)
Destination: 198.133.219.25 (198.133.219.25)
Generic Routing Encapsulation (IP)
Flags and version: 0x4000
0... .... .... .... = No checksum
.1.. .... .... .... = Routing
..0. .... .... .... = No key
...0 .... .... .... = No sequence number
.... 0... .... .... = No strict source route
.... .000 .... .... = Recursion control: 0
.... .... 0000 0... = Flags: 0
.... .... .... .000 = Version: 0
Protocol Type: IP (0x0800)
Checksum: 0x0000
Offset: 99
[ Notes ]
IOS implements GRE source routing as forwarding of the inner IP
packet. Thus, a Source Route Entry of 255.255.255.255 will cause
IOS to resend the GRE packet to the specified address according
to the routing table (all in this case) on the appropriate
interface (all in this case).
The source address of the new packet will be the router's IP
address, the destination address according to the received packet.
This can be used to circumvent Access Control Lists with GRE.
[ Solution ]
Stop using GRE. There is no way in IOS to turn off source routing
for GRE tunnels.
To correct the parsing issue, try to install an IOS version
containing the fixes CSCuk27655 or CSCea22552 or CSCei62762.
