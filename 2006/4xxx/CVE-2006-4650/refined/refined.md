  "CVE-2006-4650": {
    "Metadata": {
      "ID": "CVE-2006-4650",
      "Date": "2006-09-12"
    },
    "Vulnerability Details": {
      "Root cause": "Improper handling of GRE source routing information in Cisco IOS. Specifically, the offset field in a GRE packet with routing information is not properly validated. An attacker-controlled offset value could lead to an out-of-bounds read.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Improper input validation",
        "Integer overflow",
        "Out-of-bounds read",
         "Memory corruption"
      ],
      "Impact": "A crafted GRE packet can cause the router to reuse data from unrelated ring buffer memory and reinject it into the routing queues. This can lead to denial of service or potentially enable arbitrary code execution.",
      "Attack vectors": [
        "Sending a specially crafted GRE packet to a Cisco IOS device. The outer IP packet must originate from the configured tunnel source and be sent to the configured tunnel destination IP address."
      ],
     "Required capabilities": "Attacker must be able to send GRE packets to a vulnerable Cisco IOS device. This requires knowledge of the configured tunnel source and destination IPs.",
      "Additional details": "The vulnerability stems from a flaw in parsing GRE packets, where the offset field is not verified, potentially causing an overflow and reading unrelated memory. The re-injected packet can have a large length value, which could lead to further issues. The GRE source routing is implemented as forwarding the inner IP packet, allowing an attacker to use this to potentially bypass ACLs."
