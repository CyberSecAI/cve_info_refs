```
- Root cause of vulnerability:
    - Arbitrary file disclosure: Improper sanitization of the `logo` parameter in `link.php`, allowing it to be used as a full local path to a logo filename.
    - Multiple SQL Injections: Improper sanitization of the `c` and `l` parameters in scripts responsible for displaying links and handling redirections, respectively, leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities.
    - HTTP Response Splitting: Improper sanitization of the `url` parameter in `link.php`, allowing for HTTP response splitting attacks.

- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
    - Arbitrary file disclosure: Lack of input sanitization, allowing access to arbitrary files on the server.
    - Multiple SQL Injections: Lack of sanitization of user-supplied parameters before use in SQL queries.
    - HTTP Response Splitting: Lack of sanitization of URL parameters, allowing injection of carriage return and line feed characters.

- Impact of exploitation:
    - Arbitrary file disclosure: Attackers can read arbitrary files from the server, potentially gaining access to sensitive information like configuration files, user data, or source code.
    - Multiple SQL Injections: Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially allowing them to read, modify, or delete data in the database, or even execute arbitrary code. In addition, it allows for HTTP response-splitting attacks.
    - HTTP Response Splitting: Attackers can manipulate HTTP headers to inject malicious content, potentially leading to cross-site scripting (XSS) or other attacks.

- Attack vectors:
    - Arbitrary file disclosure: Sending a crafted request to `link.php` with a malicious `logo` parameter pointing to a local file.
    - Multiple SQL Injections: Sending crafted requests to the scripts with malicious `c` or `l` parameters containing SQL injection code.
    - HTTP Response Splitting: Sending a crafted request to `link.php` with a malicious `url` parameter containing carriage return and line feed characters.

- Required attacker capabilities/position:
    - Arbitrary file disclosure: Attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
    - Multiple SQL Injections: Attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and have knowledge of the database structure.
    - HTTP Response Splitting: Attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
