  "CVE-2006-4098": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the way the CSRadius service of Cisco Secure ACS handles certain RADIUS Accounting-Request packets. This can allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause the service to crash.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a stack-based buffer overflow in the CSRadius service when processing specific RADIUS Accounting-Request packets.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Stack-based buffer overflow"
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the CSRadius service (typically Local System), or cause the service to crash, leading to a denial of service.",
      "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is a specially crafted RADIUS Accounting-Request packet.",
       "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must have prior knowledge of the shared RADIUS secret key between the Network Access Server (NAS) and the Cisco Secure ACS server."
