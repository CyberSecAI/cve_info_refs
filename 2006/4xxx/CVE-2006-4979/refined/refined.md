The provided content relates to CVE-2006-4979.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The phpQuiz application has multiple vulnerabilities stemming from insufficient input validation and insecure file handling practices.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
1.  **SQL Injection:**
    *   The `univers` variable in `score.php` and the `quiz_id` variable in `home.php` are not properly sanitized, allowing SQL injection.
2.  **Arbitrary File Upload:**
    *   The `upload_img.php` script in both the `back/` and `admin/` directories does not properly sanitize the `$upload`, `$ok_update`, `$image`, and `$path` variables, leading to arbitrary file upload. The default permissions on the `phpquiz/img_quiz/` directory makes it writable, and allows uploaded php files to be executed.
3.  **PHP Code Injection:**
    *   The `install.php` script within the `cfgphpquiz/` directory is accessible without authentication. This script can be used to inject arbitrary PHP code into the `config.inc.php` configuration file.

**Impact of exploitation:**
1.  **SQL Injection:**
    *   Allows attackers to extract sensitive information from the database, including user credentials (email, login, password).
2.  **Arbitrary File Upload:**
    *   Enables attackers to upload and execute arbitrary PHP code, leading to remote command execution on the server.
3.  **PHP Code Injection:**
    *   Allows attackers to inject arbitrary PHP code into the configuration file. This can lead to remote code execution, access to sensitive information (e.g., admin password), and manipulation of application behavior.

**Attack vectors:**
1.  **SQL Injection:**
    *   By manipulating the `univers` parameter in the `score.php` URL and the `quiz_id` parameter in the `home.php` URL.
2.  **Arbitrary File Upload:**
    *   By crafting a POST request to `upload_img.php` with manipulated parameters, including the path and file content.
3.  **PHP Code Injection:**
    *   By accessing the `install.php` script directly and supplying malicious input to the `config_alert_email_name` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
1.  **SQL Injection:**
    *   The attacker needs to have the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application. No authentication is required.
2.  **Arbitrary File Upload:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable web application. No authentication is required.
3.  **PHP Code Injection:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable web application. No authentication is required.

The exploit code provided in the content demonstrates how to chain these vulnerabilities for full compromise of the application and the server.
