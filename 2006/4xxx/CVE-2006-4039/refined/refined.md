```
1.  **Root cause of vulnerability:**
    *   The `eintragen.php` script in GaesteChaos <= 0.2 does not properly sanitize user inputs.

2.  **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Input fields `gastname` and `gastwohnort` are not checked, allowing the injection of malicious client-side code.
    *   **SQL Injection:** The SQL query in `eintragen.php` is vulnerable to SQL injection due to lack of proper sanitization of input fields like `$gastname`, `$gastemail`, `$gastwohnort`, etc.

3.  **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   **XSS:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the browsers of users viewing the guestbook, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.
    *  **SQL Injection:** An attacker can manipulate the SQL query to gain unauthorized access to the database, potentially reading sensitive data, modifying data, or even taking control of the database server.

4.  **Attack vectors:**
    *   **XSS:** Through the vulnerable input fields `gastname` and `gastwohnort` in the `eintragen.php` form.
    *   **SQL Injection:** Through the vulnerable input fields in `eintragen.php` that are used in the SQL query (e.g., `$gastname`, `$gastemail`, `$gastwohnort`).

5.  **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to access and submit data to the `eintragen.php` form on the affected server. No special privileges are needed, only access to the guestbook application.
