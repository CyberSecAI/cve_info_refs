    "description": "The provided content relates to CVE-2006-4424, specifically mentioning it in the context of a remote file inclusion vulnerability in phpCOIN.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from an insecure implementation where the `_CCFG[_PKG_PATH_INCL]` parameter is used in a `require_once` include statement, allowing a remote attacker to inject a URL pointing to a malicious script.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)"
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server, leading to potential complete system compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "HTTP GET request"
      ],
      "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to make a web request to the vulnerable server with a manipulated `_CCFG[_PKG_PATH_INCL]` parameter.",
      "additional_details": "The vulnerability exists because the application uses a user-controllable parameter to specify the path of a file that is included, therefore allowing the inclusion of arbitrary remote files by modifying the parameter."
