alwil avast! Anti-virus Engine
Remote/Local Heap Overflow
04-July-2006

Summary
alwil software produces an anti-virus engine.  The engine is capable of scanning
diverse archive formats, is purported to detect 100% of in-the-wild viruses, and is
ICSA certified.  This engine is provided to OEM partners in order to enable their
products to scan for viruses.

While processing LHA archives, the software has insufficient checks on the data
taken as input from the file.  Specifically, the flaw occurs when combining the
filename and directory-name extended-header fields of LHA files.  This flaw
allows a specially crafted LHA file to cause a heap-overflow in the affected
software.

Impact
This vulnerability is present by default in alwil’s avast! anti-virus engine.
Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities results in local and remote code
execution with the full privileges of the process.  By default, the privileges are
equivalent to System.  Exploits that leverage this vulnerability must be
lowercase-conversion resistant and not contain NULL bytes; two tractable
constraints.  Thus, exploitation can be made to work reliably.

Affected software
All products that contain versions of alwil’s anti-virus engine less than Version
4.7.869 for desktops or less than version 4.7.660 for servers including:
alwil software: avast!  Anti-Virus
alwil software: avast!  Server Edition
TN North Software: Interner Anywhere eMailServer
IceWarp Software - Merak Email Server
SmartMax Software, Inc. - MailMax Server
Paul Smith Computer Services - VPOP3 Email Server
NetWin Software - SurgeMail Email Server
Bains Digital - Defender MX

Details
The code uses a C++ class in order to decompress an LHA archive.  The
following code segment shows the allocation for the class memory.

Subsequently, the program decodes the LHA header.  A pointer is passed to the
function that is 0x6F48 bytes into the previously depicted class memory.  This
pointer is the first argument on the stack.

The program then uses EBP as a non-volatile reference to the second argument
(arg_4) as shown in the following picture.

Next, the program begins to process an LHA extended-header.   Where
appropriate, the program reads in extra data from the file.  Then, depending on
the type of extended-header the program is processing, a switch statement is
executed.

Page 2 of 6

Switch case 1, responsible for processing filename extended headers, is shown
in the picture below.  The program correctly guards against any size that is
greater-than 0xFF before copying the data to the field_14 buffer.

The following is switch case 2, responsible for processing extended-header
directory names.  This code ensures that no more than 0x3FF bytes are copied
to the var_DNAME buffer; a correct course of action.

Page 3 of 6

The following code is executed after the program has processed a full LHA
header including the extended headers.  This code concatenates two user-
supplied buffers, the field_14 buffer, and the var_DNAME buffer.  The previous
code shows that the resulting concatenation may be up to 0x4FE
(0x3FF+0xFF+1) bytes in length.

The heap buffer’s is 0x7080 bytes in size.  Since we’re writing into this buffer at
an offset of 0x6F48, with a size of 0x4FE bytes, we can write 0x3C6 bytes past
the end of the allocated memory.  This vulnerability allows a standard windows
heap attack or a vtable-overwrite attack to be carried out.

Remediation
The code should be modified to either truncate the file and pathname
combination, or to enlarge the buffer that holds the result.

Avast anti-virus Version 4.7.869 resolves this issue for the Desktop

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
