  "CVE-2006-4144": {
    "Description": "A heap overflow vulnerability exists in the ReadSGIImage() function of ImageMagick, which is used to decode SGI image files. By manipulating the iris_info.rows, iris_info.columns, and bytes_per_pixel values, an attacker can cause an integer overflow when calculating the memory allocation size. This leads to insufficient memory being allocated for 'iris_pixels', potentially leading to a heap overflow when subsequent operations are performed on the undersized buffer.",
    "Root cause": "Integer overflow when calculating memory allocation size leading to a heap overflow.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Heap Overflow",
      "Integer Overflow"
    ],
    "Impact": "Arbitrary code execution or denial of service.",
    "Attack vectors": "Processing a specially crafted SGI image file.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to craft a malicious SGI image file. Requires a user or automated system to process the malicious image file.",
    "Additional Information": "The vulnerability is located in the coders/sgi.c file in the ReadSGIImage() function, and the allocation of memory to 'iris_pixels' is based on the manipulated values. Integer overflow occurs when calculating (4*bytes_per_pixel*iris_info.columns*iris_info.rows). An example of a crafted SGI file is provided by the original researcher."
