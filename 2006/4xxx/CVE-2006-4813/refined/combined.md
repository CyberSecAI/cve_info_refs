kernel security update (RHSA-2007-0014)

Original Release Date: February 16, 2007

Last Revised: February 13, 2009

Number: ASA-2007-063

Risk Level: Medium

Advisory Version: 6.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

The Linux kernel manages the communication between software and
hardware as
well as the hardware resources of a computer running the Linux operating
system.

Red Hat has issued an updated version of the kernel packages for
Enterprise
Linux 4. Below is a list of the security issues fixed in the update as
reported
by Red Hat:

* a flaw in the get\_fdb\_entries function of the network bridging
  support
  that allowed a local user to cause a denial of service (crash) or allow
  a
  potential privilege escalation.
* an information leak in the \_block\_prepare\_write function that
  allowed
  a local user to read kernel memory.
* an information leak in the copy\_from\_user() implementation on s390
  and
  s390x platforms that allowed a local user to read kernel memory.
* a flaw in the handling of /proc/net/ip6\_flowlabel that allowed a
  local
  user to cause a denial of service (infinite loop).
* a flaw in the AIO handling that allowed a local user to cause a
  denial
  of service (panic).
* a race condition in the mincore system core that allowed a local
  user to
  cause a denial of service (system hang).
* a flaw in the ELF handling on ia64 and sparc architectures which
  triggered a cross-region memory mapping and allowed a local user to
  cause a
  denial of service.
* a flaw in the dev\_queue\_xmit function of the network subsystem that
  allowed a local user to cause a denial of service (data
  corruption).
* a flaw in the handling of CAPI messages over Bluetooth that allowed
  a
  remote system to cause a denial of service or potential code execution.
  This flaw is only exploitable if a privileged user establishes a
  connection
  to a malicious remote device.
* a flaw in the listxattr system call that allowed a local user to
  cause a
  denial of service (data corruption) or potential privilege escalation.
  To
  successfully exploit this flaw the existence of a bad inode is required
  first.
* a flaw in the \_\_find\_get\_block\_slow function that allowed a local
  privileged user to cause a denial of service.
* various flaws in the supported filesystems that allowed a local
  privileged user to cause a denial of service.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned
the names

[CVE-2006-5823](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-5823),
[CVE-2006-6053](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-6053),
[CVE-2006-6054](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-6054), and
[CVE-2006-6056](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-6056) to these issues.

While this advisory deals with the kernel package from RedHat
Enterprise
Linux 4, the vulnerabilities in this advisory have been assessed against
currently supported versions of Avaya Communications Manager (CM). As
such,
some of the responses may include versions of Avaya Communications
Manager that
do not run on RedHat Enterprise Linux 4 or on a 2.6 series kernel.

CM 2.x and CM 3.0, which use a 2.4 series Linux kernel, are only
vulnerable
to the mincore race condition
([CVE-2006-4814](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4814))
listed above. As there is no known exploit for this issue and it would
require
someone with access to a user account on CM, Avaya has chosen to rate
the impact
of this ASA to CM 2.x and CM 3.0 as a Low Risk Level.

CM 3.1.x, which uses a 2.6 series Linux kernel, is vulnerable to all
of the
issues in this advisory including the potential privilege escalations in
the
get\_fdb\_entries issue
([CVE-2006-5751](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-5751))
and the listxattr-system-call issue
([CVE-2006-5753](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-5753))
listed above.

Avaya Messaging Storage Server has been marked as having a Low Risk
Level
as shell access is not available in an Avaya recommended default
configuration.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the
security
advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2007-0014.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with kernel installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya S87XX/S8500/S8300 | CM 2.x, CM 3.0,CM 3.1.3 and earlier, CM 4.0 | LowMedium | For CM versions 2.x and 3.0, upgrade to CM 3.1.4 or a later version in the 3.1.x series. For CM 3.1.3 and earlier releases in the CM 3.1.x series, upgrade to CM 3.1.4 or a later version in the 3.1.x series. For CM 4.0, upgrade to CM 4.0.1 or later. |
| Avaya Messaging Storage Server | MSS 3.x | Low | Upgrade to MSS 4.0 or later. |
| Avaya CCS/SES | SES 2.0 - 3.x | Medium | Upgrade to SES 4.0 or later. |

**Recommended Actions:**
For all system products which use
vulnerable
versions of the kernel, Avaya recommends that customers restrict local
and
network access to the server. This restriction should be enforced
through the
use of physical security, firewalls, ACLs, VPNs, and other
generally-accepted
networking practices until such time as an update becomes available and
can
be installed.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating
systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying
operating
system or applications that come with the operating system. These
vulnerabilities often do not impact the software-only product directly
but
may threaten the integrity of the underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not
affected by
the vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be.
Customers should determine on which Linux operating system the product
was
installed and then follow that vendors guidance.

## 4. Software-Only Products:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CVLAN | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. The CVLAN application does not require the software described in this advisory. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite(IMS) | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. The IMS application does not require the software described in this advisory. |

**Recommended Actions:**
Avaya recommends that customers follow
recommended actions supplied by RedHat Linux.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=209435#c0)  Marcel Holtmann    2006-10-05 12:23:57 UTC  ``` Report from Martin Schwidefsky:  There is/has been a bug with copy_from_user on s390. The problem is that it does not pad the kernel buffer with zeroes in case of a fault on the user address. That allows a malicious user to read uninitialized kernel memory. The bug is already fixed upstream:  <http://www.kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=52149ba6b0ddf3e9d965257cc0513193650b3ea8>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=209435#c3)  Jason Baron    2006-10-23 19:22:23 UTC  ``` committed in stream U5 build 42.20. A test kernel with this patch is available from <http://people.redhat.com/~jbaron/rhel4/>    ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=209435#c4)  Jason Baron    2006-12-18 21:42:11 UTC  ``` committed in stream E5 build 42.0.4   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=209435#c6)  Mike Gahagan    2007-01-17 19:53:05 UTC  ``` The correct fix is in 42.0.6.    ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=209435#c8)  Red Hat Bugzilla    2007-01-30 14:28:42 UTC  ```  An advisory has been issued which should help the problem described in this bug report.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Topic

Updated kernel packages that fix several security issues in the Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 4 kernel are now available.

This security advisory has been rated as having important security impact
by the Red Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

The Linux kernel handles the basic functions of the operating system.

These new kernel packages contain fixes for the security issues described
below:

* a flaw in the get\_fdb\_entries function of the network bridging support

that allowed a local user to cause a denial of service (crash) or allow a
potential privilege escalation (CVE-2006-5751, Important)

* an information leak in the \_block\_prepare\_write function that allowed a

local user to read kernel memory (CVE-2006-4813, Important)

* an information leak in the copy\_from\_user() implementation on s390 and

s390x platforms that allowed a local user to read kernel memory
(CVE-2006-5174, Important)

* a flaw in the handling of /proc/net/ip6\_flowlabel that allowed a local

user to cause a denial of service (infinite loop) (CVE-2006-5619, Important)

* a flaw in the AIO handling that allowed a local user to cause a denial of

service (panic) (CVE-2006-5754, Important)

* a race condition in the mincore system core that allowed a local user to

cause a denial of service (system hang) (CVE-2006-4814, Moderate)

* a flaw in the ELF handling on ia64 and sparc architectures which

triggered a cross-region memory mapping and allowed a local user to cause a
denial of service (CVE-2006-4538, Moderate)

* a flaw in the dev\_queue\_xmit function of the network subsystem that

allowed a local user to cause a denial of service (data corruption)
(CVE-2006-6535, Moderate)

* a flaw in the handling of CAPI messages over Bluetooth that allowed a

remote system to cause a denial of service or potential code execution.
This flaw is only exploitable if a privileged user establishes a connection
to a malicious remote device (CVE-2006-6106, Moderate)

* a flaw in the listxattr system call that allowed a local user to cause a

denial of service (data corruption) or potential privilege escalation. To
successfully exploit this flaw the existence of a bad inode is required
first (CVE-2006-5753, Moderate)

* a flaw in the \_\_find\_get\_block\_slow function that allowed a local

privileged user to cause a denial of service (CVE-2006-5757, Low)

* various flaws in the supported filesystems that allowed a local

privileged user to cause a denial of service (CVE-2006-5823, CVE-2006-6053,
CVE-2006-6054, CVE-2006-6056, Low)

In addition to the security issues described above, fixes for the following
bugs were included:

* initialization error of the tg3 driver with some BCM5703x network card
* a memory leak in the audit subsystem
* x86\_64 nmi watchdog timeout is too short
* ext2/3 directory reads fail intermittently

Red Hat would like to thank Dmitriy Monakhov and Kostantin Khorenko for
reporting issues fixed in this erratum.

All Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 users are advised to upgrade their kernels
to the packages associated with their machine architecture and
configurations as listed in this erratum.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=207463#c0)  Vasily Averin    2006-09-21 08:52:00 UTC  ``` Dmitriy Monakhov from SWsoft Virtuozzo/OpenVZ Linux Team has noticed an information leak in __block_prepare_write() affected RHEL4 kernels: __block_prepare_write() does not clear properly the data buffers during error recovery and therefore content of previously unliked files is accessible.  It is known issue and it is fixed in mainstream by following patch: <http://www.kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=152becd26e0563aefdbc4fd1fe491928efe92d1f>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=207463#c1)  Vasily Averin    2006-09-21 08:53:37 UTC  ``` #uname -r 2.6.9-42.0.2.EL  to reproduce:  gcc -Wall ./open_write.c -o /tmp/open_write sh ./prep.sh sh ./info_leack_test.sh  test result: #sh  /tmp/info_leack_test.sh stat: cannot stat `/mnt/file': No such file or directory 00000000  53 53 53 53 53 53 53 53  53 53 53 53 53 53 53 53  |SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS| * ########## content from unlinked file visible.      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ########## must be zeros here  00000800  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................| * 00001000  6e                                                |n| 00001001   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=207463#c2)  Vasily Averin    2006-09-21 08:58:07 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 136834](attachment.cgi?id=136834 "reproducer testcase") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=136834&action=edit "reproducer testcase") reproducer testcase   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=207463#c3)  Vasily Averin    2006-09-21 08:59:00 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 136835](attachment.cgi?id=136835 "reproducer preapre script") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=136835&action=edit "reproducer preapre script") reproducer preapre script   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=207463#c4)  Vasily Averin    2006-09-21 08:59:38 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 136836](attachment.cgi?id=136836 "reproducer testcase script") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=136836&action=edit "reproducer testcase script") reproducer testcase script   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=207463#c5)  Marcel Holtmann    2006-09-21 14:06:43 UTC  ``` an you elaborate a little bit more on this issue.

Is it possible to get subscribed to rhkernel-list@?

Actually __block_prepare_write err path was broken in two places:  A)clear_buffer_new() was called too early and result in information leak. [you have fixed it.]  B)after get_block has failed original code  jump to "out" label and return without waiting for issued read requests to complete, and may later unlock page.  We must just do "break" here, and wait until IO-layer reading complete. Otherwise later access to page cause unpredictable result, because IO-layer may modify this page at this moment.

I don't think that we have made anything -worse- (i.e. the errata patch did not cause a regression) and the case we missed has been in the RHEL4 kernel since it was released.  I think that this 2nd problem does have some security implications, although it is not as severe as the problem which was addressed with the first patch.  Do you agree with this assessment?

When processing a block with a block number more than 4G and not to be mapped to buffer pages (__find_get_block will return NULL), __getblk_slow will always run and never return.  1478 struct buffer_head * 1479 __getblk(struct block_device *bdev, sector_t block, int size) 1480 { 1481         struct buffer_head *bh = __find_get_block(bdev, block, size); 1482 1483         might_sleep(); 1484         if (bh == NULL) 1485                 bh = __getblk_slow(bdev, block, size); 1486         return bh; 1487 }  The endless for loop only has a exit point (at line 1213). It terminate only when __find_get_block return a non-NULL value. If the block is not mapped to buffer pages, the first __find_get_block calling will return a NULL bh and the function grow_buffers() will be called subsequently.  1194 __getblk_slow(struct block_device *bdev, sector_t block, int size) 1195 { 1196         /* Size must be multiple of hard sectorsize */ 1197         if (unlikely(size & (bdev_hardsect_size(bdev)-1) || 1198                         (size < 512 || size > PAGE_SIZE))) { 1199                 printk(KERN_ERR "getblk(): invalid block size %d requested\n", 1200                                         size); 1201                 printk(KERN_ERR "hardsect size: %d\n", 1202                                         bdev_hardsect_size(bdev)); 1203 1204                 dump_stack(); 1205                 return NULL; 1206         } 1207 1208         for (;;) { 1209                 struct buffer_head * bh; 1210 1211                 bh = __find_get_block(bdev, block, size);	 1212                 if (bh) 1213                         return bh; 1214 1215                 if (!grow_buffers(bdev, block, size))		 1216                         free_more_memory(); 1217         } 1218 }  The function grow_buffers() is responsible for construct the relationships among page, buffer_head and block. On the 32-bit platform, the length of block and index are 64-bit and 32-bit respectively. After the operations at line 1201 and 1202, the high 32 bits of block will lost. Consequently, when the block number is beyond 4G, new block number would be differently with the original.  1189 static inline int 1190 grow_buffers(struct block_device *bdev, sector_t block, int size) 1191 { 1192         struct page *page; 1193         pgoff_t index; 1194         int sizebits; 1195 1196         sizebits = -1; 1197         do { 1198                 sizebits++; 1199         } while ((size << sizebits) < PAGE_SIZE); 1200 1201         index = block >> sizebits; 1202         block = index << sizebits; 1203 1204         /* Create a page with the proper size buffers.. */ 1205         page = grow_dev_page(bdev, block, index, size); 1206         if (!page) 1207                 return 0; 1208         unlock_page(page); 1209         page_cache_release(page); 1210         return 1; 1211 }  Follow the call sequence (grow_dev_page ==> init_page_buffers ==> init_page_buffers). In init_page_buffers(), a new buffer_head will be initialized, it's block number (bh->b_blocknr) corresponding to mapped block is assigned with the new block number.  static void init_page_buffers(struct page *page, struct block_device *bdev,                         sector_t block, int size) { 	... 	...          do {                 if (!buffer_mapped(bh)) {		                         init_buffer(bh, NULL, NULL);                         bh->b_bdev = bdev;                         bh->b_blocknr = block;                         if (uptodate)                                 set_buffer_uptodate(bh);                         set_buffer_mapped(bh);                 }                 block++;                 bh = bh->b_this_page;         } while (bh != head); }   However, __find_get_block seeks buffer head base on the original block number in __getblk_slow (). Because of wrong block number argument, __find_get_block will always return NULL. As results, system will fall in a dead loop and consume resource endlessly.   1194 __getblk_slow(struct block_device *bdev, sector_t block, int size) 1195 { 	... 	... 1207 1208         for (;;) { 1209                 struct buffer_head * bh; 1210 1211                 bh = __find_get_block(bdev, block, size);	 1212                 if (bh) 1213                         return bh; 1214 1215                 if (!grow_buffers(bdev, block, size))		 1216                         free_more_memory(); 1217         } 1218 }  The vulnerability can be triggered by mount a malformed Reiser filesystem image, the arguments of __getblk() are:  __getblk(0xcd0ed0c0, 0xffffffffa10020d9, 0x1000)  sys_mount -> do_mount -> do_kern_mount -> get_super_block -> get_sb_bdev  -> reiserfs_fill_super -> reiserfs_read_locked_inode -> search_by_key -> __getblk -> __find_get_block   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=206328#c8)  Eric Sandeen    2006-11-06 22:43:57 UTC  ``` Whoops.

* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)
* [Ubuntu 5.10](/security/notices?release=breezy)

## Details

Mark Dowd discovered that the netfilter iptables module did not

correcly handle fragmented packets. By sending specially crafted

packets, a remote attacker could exploit this to bypass firewall

rules. This has only be fixed for Ubuntu 6.10; the corresponding fix

for Ubuntu 5.10 and 6.06 will follow soon. ([CVE-2006-4572](/security/CVE-2006-4572))

Dmitriy Monakhov discovered an information leak in the

\_\_block\_prepare\_write() function. During error recovery, this function

did not properly clear memory buffers which could allow local users to

read portions of unlinked files. This only affects Ubuntu 5.10.

([CVE-2006-4813](/security/CVE-2006-4813))

ADLab Venustech Info Ltd discovered that the ATM network driver

referenced an already released pointer in some circumstances. By

sending specially crafted packets to a host over ATM, a remote

attacker could exploit this to crash that host. This does not affect

Ubuntu 6.10. ([CVE-2006-4997](/security/CVE-2006-4997))

Matthias Andree discovered that the NFS locking management daemon

(lockd) did not correctly handle mixing of 'lock' and 'nolock' option

mounts on the same client. A remote attacker could exploit this to

crash lockd and thus rendering the NFS imports inaccessible. This only

affects Ubuntu 5.10. ([CVE-2006-5158](/security/CVE-2006-5158))

The task switching code did not save and restore EFLAGS of processes.

By starting a specially crafted executable, a local attacker could

exploit this to eventually crash many other running processes. This

does not affect Ubuntu 6.10. ([CVE-2006-5173](/security/CVE-2006-5173))

James Morris discovered that the ip6fl\_get\_n() function incorrectly

handled flow labels. A local attacker could exploit this to crash the

kernel. ([CVE-2006-5619](/security/CVE-2006-5619))

Fabio Massimo Di Nitto discovered that the sys\_get\_robust\_list and

sys\_set\_robust\_list system calls lacked proper lock handling on the

powerpc platform. A local attacker could exploit this to create

unkillable processes, drain all available CPU/memory, and render the

machine unrebootable. This only affects Ubuntu 6.10. ([CVE-2006-5648](/security/CVE-2006-5648))

Fabio Massimo Di Nitto discovered a flaw in the alignment check

exception handling on the powerpc platform. A local attacker could

exploit this to cause a kernel panic and crash the machine.

([CVE-2006-5649](/security/CVE-2006-5649))

Certain corrupted squashfs file system images caused a memory

allocation to be freed twice. By mounting a specially crafted squashfs

file system, a local attacker could exploit this to crash the kernel.

This does not affect Ubuntu 5.10. ([CVE-2006-5701](/security/CVE-2006-5701))

An integer overflow was found in the get\_fdb\_entries() function of the

network bridging code. By executing a specially crafted ioctl, a local

attacker could exploit this to execute arbitrary code with root

privileges. ([CVE-2006-5751](/security/CVE-2006-5751))

## SUSE Security

# A Process That Never Ends

### SUSE is committed to delivering best effort security to its customers and to the Open Source community. We believe that trust in Open Source Software security in general, and the user's privacy in particular, are both indispensable and indefeasible.

We treat software security as a process that never ends. This means we:

* Promptly react to security incidents and deliver premium quality security updates
* Continuously improve the security-related functionality in SUSE products
* Continuously contribute to the rapidly growing maturity of Open Source Software
* Respect the Open Source Software security principles of openness, transparency and traceability

Software security is a complex challenge. Software can provide many of its own security features, such as authentication methods, encryption, intrusion prevention and detection, and backup.

At the same time, it can also contain errors (both deliberate and accidental) that can affect the system's security, including design flaws, programming errors, and backdoors.

The SUSE Security Team addresses all of these aspects of software security, on an ongoing basis. Software security cannot be thought of as a state you can achieve at a specific point in time. Instead, it is a process that must be executed with professional expertise and continuous development. This persistent focus is what has given Open Source Software, Linux and SUSE such an excellent reputation for security.
