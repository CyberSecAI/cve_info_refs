The provided content is a blog post announcing a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Panda ActiveScan.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is an XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) vulnerability, likely due to a lack of proper input sanitization/validation. The blog post title clearly indicates this, and the categories assigned to the post include "security", "vulnerability" and "XSS".

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** XSS vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious client-side scripts (e.g., JavaScript) into the application to execute in a user's browser. This can lead to:
    * Session hijacking
    * Phishing attacks
    * Defacement of the web page
    * Redirecting the user to malicious websites
    * Information theft.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector would involve manipulating input fields or URLs in a way that allows execution of attacker-controlled javascript code within the victim's browser. This would likely involve crafting a malicious URL that contains malicious javascript.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious input to the application and trick a user to execute the malicious script, for example via a crafted link. The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability (typically with XSS), and can be in any position to exploit this vulnerability.
