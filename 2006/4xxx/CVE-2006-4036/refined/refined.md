  "CVE-2006-4036": {
    "Description": "ZoneX 1.0.3 - Publishers Gold Edition is vulnerable to Remote File Inclusion. The vulnerability exists in includes/usercp_register.php due to the lack of proper input validation of the phpbb_root_path variable, which is used in include statements. This can allow an attacker to include a remote file, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization and validation of the `phpbb_root_path` variable before using it in include statements within `includes/usercp_register.php`.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)",
      "Insufficient Input Validation"
    ],
     "Impact": "An attacker can include remote files, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the server. This can lead to complete compromise of the vulnerable system, including data theft, data manipulation, and denial of service.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is remote, by manipulating the `phpbb_root_path` parameter in a request to `includes/usercp_register.php`.",
    "Required capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and provide a malicious URL as a value for the vulnerable parameter. No authentication is required."
