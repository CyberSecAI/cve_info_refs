{
  "CVE-2006-4335": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "A stack modification vulnerability exists in the LZH decompression support within the gzip program.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The `make_table()` function in `unlzh.c` assumes that no entry in `bitlen[]` exceeds 16, however, `bitlen[]` can be populated with higher values. This can lead to incrementing values outside the bounds of the stack buffer `count[]`.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could potentially overwrite saved registers on the stack, which could lead to moving a stack frame to an attacker-controlled area, adjusting the return address, or manipulating register jumps to redirect control flow.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted LZH archive to gzip.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted gzip archive that will be processed by a vulnerable version of gzip."
