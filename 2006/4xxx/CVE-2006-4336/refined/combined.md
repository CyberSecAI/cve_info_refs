How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# gzip: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200609-13**

gzip is affected by multiple vulnerabilities, including buffer overflows
and infinite loops, possibly allowing the execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-arch/gzip** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.3.5-r9** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.3.5-r9** |

### Background

gzip, the GNU zip compression utility, is a free and patent
unencumbered replacement for the standard compress utility.

### Description

Tavis Ormandy of the Google Security Team has reported multiple
vulnerabilities in gzip. A stack buffer modification vulnerability was
discovered in the LZH decompression code, where a pathological data
stream may result in the modification of stack data such as frame
pointer, return address or saved registers. A static buffer underflow
was discovered in the pack decompression support, allowing a specially
crafted pack archive to underflow a .bss buffer. A static buffer
overflow was uncovered in the LZH decompression code, allowing a data
stream consisting of pathological huffman codes to overflow a .bss
buffer. Multiple infinite loops were also uncovered in the LZH
decompression code.

### Impact

A remote attacker may create a specially crafted gzip archive, which
when decompressed by a user or automated system exectues arbitrary code
with the privileges of the user id invoking gzip. The infinite loops
may be abused by an attacker to disrupt any automated systems invoking
gzip to handle data decompression.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All gzip users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-arch/gzip-1.3.5-r9"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# USN-349-1: gzip vulnerabilities

20 September 2006

gzip vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)
* [Ubuntu 5.10](/security/notices?release=breezy)
* [Ubuntu 5.04](/security/notices?release=hoary)

## Details

Tavis Ormandy discovered that gzip did not sufficiently verify the

validity of gzip or compress archives while unpacking. By tricking an

user or automated system into unpacking a specially crafted compressed

file, this could be exploited to execute arbitrary code with the

user's privileges.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 6.06

* gzip
  -
  1.3.5-12ubuntu0.1

##### Ubuntu 5.10

* gzip
  -
  1.3.5-11ubuntu2.1

##### Ubuntu 5.04

* gzip
  -
  1.3.5-9ubuntu3.5

In general, a standard system upgrade is sufficient to effect the

necessary changes.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=204676#c0)  Josh Bressers    2006-08-30 19:26:49 UTC  ``` Tavis Ormandy of the Google Security Team discovered several vulnerabilities in gzip.  The important bits of his mail are below:  -------------------------------------------------------------------------- * NULL Dereference (gzip-huftbuild-NULL-deref.gz)     [CVE-2006-4334](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-4334)  -------------------------------------------------------------------------- * OOB Write (gzip-lzh-stack-modify.Z)     [CVE-2006-4335](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-4335)  A stack modification vulnerability (where a stack buffer can be modified out of bounds, but not in the traditional stack overrun sense) exists in the LZH decompression support, The following loop from make_table() (~139, unlzh.c) assumes that no entry in bitlen[] can exceed 16:  for (i = 0; i < nchar; i++) count[bitlen[i]]++;  This is not the case, bitlen[] can be populated with higher values by read_pt_len(), thus incrementing values outside the bounds of the stack buffer count[]. A datastream consisting entirely of huffman codes with set bits demonstrates this, for example:  $ perl -e 'print "\x1f\xa0","\xab\xcd","\xff"x"2048"' | gzip -d  Please note, this may or may not cause odd behaviour, a debugger should be used to find out if you are affected (this does not appear to be detected by valgrind).  This vulnerability may or may not be exploitable, different behaviour has been observed on different systems. On some systems, several saved registers are within reach, thus allowing them to be incremented by a significant amount (count[] is of type unsigned short[], allowing you to manipulate the 2 MSB and LSB of a saved dword register independently). This may be enough to move a stack frame into an attacker controlled area, adjust the return address, or should a register jump be performed on a saved register (eg, ljmp ebx), then an attacker may be able to move the destination to another controlled area.  If no stack data can be reached, the impact of this vulnerability is low. This can be found in gdb as follows:  $ gdb -q gzip (gdb) b make_table Breakpoint 1 at 0x804f246: file unlzh.c, line 146. (gdb) r --decompress < testcase.Z Breakpoint 1, make_table (nchar=19, bitlen=0x80551c4 "\024\024\024", tablebits=8, table=0x8054fc0) at unlzh.c:146 (gdb) info frame Stack level 0, frame at 0xffffd5d4:   eip = 0x804f246 in make_table (unlzh.c:146); saved eip 0x804f589  called by frame at 0xffffd5f4  source language c.   Arglist at 0xffffd5cc, args: nchar=19, bitlen=0x80551c4 "\024\024\024", tablebits=8, table=0x8054fc0  Locals at 0xffffd5cc, Previous frame's sp is 0xffffd5d4  Saved registers:   ebx at 0xffffd5c0, ebp at 0xffffd5cc, esi at 0xffffd5c4, edi at 0xffffd5c8, eip at 0xffffd5d0 (gdb) p/x &count[21] $1 = 0xffffd5c8  In this case, the saved ebx, esi and edi are clearly attacker controllable.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------- * Buffer underflow (gzip_pack_underflow.c, gzip-pack-underflow.z)     [CVE-2006-4336](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-4336)  A .bss buffer underflow exists in gzip's pack support, where the following loop from build_tree() (unpack.c, ~146) does not enforce any lower bound while constructing the prefix table:  while (prefixes--) *--prefixp = (uch)len;  The simplified process of constructing a prefix table is as follows:    * Read the maximum length of a huffman code used in this archive.      * Ensure the maximum length is between zero and 25.   * Read the number of leaves at each code length from the archive.      * Check the sum of leaves does not exceed 256.   * For each leaf count between code lengths 1 .. min(max_code_length, 12)     initialise the prefix table to the code length.  The prefix table could theoretically contain 1<<12 entries safely, however a leaf count table could be constructed in such a way as to write to index (1<<12 - (0xff << (12 - 1))), or -518144 (this is the furthest index directly reachable), thus underflowing the buffer considerably.  * The values written to the underflowed area are attacker controlled,   but can only be within the range 0x01 to 0x0c. * The distance from the buffer is affected by the value of the char requested,   the formula for the furthest index reachable by character value n is something  like (4096 - (0xff << 12 - n)). * The overwrite operation can only occur once, however the condition can be   be easily modified via the first overwrite, and thus repeated multiple times.  Overwriting a buffer with multiple values is possible by building up a new value using multiple overlapping writes.  On big endian systems, this vulnerability should be trivially exploitable. However exploitation on intel appears to be considerably more difficult, the most likely attack vector appears to be modifying max_len, peek_bits, eob (indirectly) and lit_base in such a way as to trigger an write of arbitrary data via put_ubyte() and window[], this can then be used to modify the `work` function pointer or a .got entry (such as free(), which is called on error) to point at an attacker controlled buffer such as inbuf.  Alternative attack vectors may include modifying ifd, ofd, infinite loops, etc.  Please note, that on systems that compile gzip with `DYN_ALLOC` defined, the buffer underflowed is a heap buffer. I have not investigated this configuration in any detail.  The file gzip_pack_underflow.c attached to this mail can be used to generate archives that demonstrate this vulnerability.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------- * Buffer overflow (gzip-lzh-bss-overflow.Z)     [CVE-2006-4337](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-4337)  A .bss buffer overflow vulnerability exists in gzip's LZH support, due to it's inability to handle exceptional input in the make_table() function, a pathological decoding table can be constructed in such a way as to generate counts so high that the rapid growth of `nextcode` exceeds the size of the table[] buffer.  The decoding table construction code is considerably more complex than that of pack's.  To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to:    * Construct a pt_len[] such that pt_len[n] is 0.   * Construct a pt_table[] such that pt_table[(code buffer) >> 16 - 8] is n (where n>2)   * Now c_len[] is filled with (n-2), generating exceptionally high values in     count[n-2].  The most likely targets for triggering the exploitation of arbitrary code would be inptr, insize and inbuf, all of which are fully controllable, and triggering a buffer refill operation with these modified variables.  A datatream that demonstrates a pathological c_len[] can be generated as follows:  $ perl -e 'print "\x1f\xa0","\xab\xcd","\xf6\x40\x01\xc2\xcc\x36\x0c\x92\x00\x00\x00\x00","\xc8","\x00"x"2048"' | gzip -d  Where the third string contains codes to populate pt_len[], which in turn is used to generate the c_len[] in read_c_len().  Please note, this may not crash, you should use a debugger to identify if an overflow has occurred (valgrind doesnt detect this either). If you compile with -funit-at-a-time, you can put a watchpoint on `foreground`, making this easier to debug, which is what I did while testing this. eg,  $ gdb -q ./gzip (gdb) thb unlzh Breakpoint 1 at 0x804fe49: file unlzh.c, line 425. (gdb) r --decompress < testcase.gz unlzh (in=0, out=1) at unlzh.c:425 (gdb) p/x foreground $1 = 0x1 (gdb) watch foreground != 1 Hardware watchpoint 2: foreground != 1 (gdb) c Hardware watchpoint 2: foreground != 1  Old value = 0 New value = 1 0x0804fb49 in make_table (nchar=510, bitlen=0x80916e0 '\005' <repeats 200 times>..., tablebits=12, table=0x8060e00) at unlzh.c:214 (gdb) p/x foreground $2 = 0x100  clearly foreground has been damaged here.  (gdb) info symbol &table[i] foreground in section .bss  oops, table[i] has reached outside d_buf.  The public domain source on which unlzh.c is based on appears to be used in multiple other decompressors, I have not investigated if these are vulnerable to the same attack.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------- * Infinite loop (gzip-lzh-infinite-loop.Z)     [CVE-2006-4338](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-4338)  The following code sequence is used in multiple locations within unlzh.c for traversing the branches of a tree structure:     do {        if (bitbuf & mask) j = right[j];        else               j = left [j];        mask >>= 1;    } while (j >= NC);  In this case, if mask is 0 and j == left[j], then the loop will continue forever, perhaps disrupting the operation of any automated systems relying on gzip for data decompression. The impact of this vulnerability is obviously a minor DoS. It does not appear to be possible to construct a tree such that (for example) left[1] == 2, left[2] == 1 and so on. Therefore, detecting this loop is relatively easy, adding the condition `&& (mask || j != left[j])` should be adequate.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=204676#c1)  Josh Bressers    2006-08-30 19:30:59 UTC  ``` These issues also affect RHEL2.1 and RHEL3   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=204676#c2)  Josh Bressers    2006-08-30 19:34:02 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 135238](attachment.cgi?id=135238&action=diff "Proposed patch from Google") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=135238&action=edit "Proposed patch from Google") Proposed patch from Google   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=204676#c7)  Mark J.

# LHa: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200611-24**

LHa is affected by several vulnerabilities including the remote execution
of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-arch/lha** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **114i-r6** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **114i-r6** |

### Background

LHa is a console-based program for packing and unpacking LHarc
archives.

### Description

Tavis Ormandy of the Google Security Team discovered several
vulnerabilities in the LZH decompression component used by LHa. The
make\_table function of unlzh.c contains an array index error and a
buffer overflow vulnerability. The build\_tree function of unpack.c
contains a buffer underflow vulnerability. Additionally, unlzh.c
contains a code that could run in an infinite loop.

### Impact

By enticing a user to uncompress a specially crafted archive, a remote
attacker could cause a Denial of Service by CPU consumption or execute
arbitrary code with the rights of the user running the application.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All LHa users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-arch/lha-114i-r6"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

More details about the issues fixed may be found in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database:    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-0758   http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-0988   http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-1228   http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4334   http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4335   http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4336   http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4337   http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4338   Here are the details from the Slackware 10.2 ChangeLog: +--------------------------+ patches/packages/gzip-1.3.5-i486-1_slack10.2.tgz:   Upgraded to gzip-1.3.5, and fixed a variety of bugs.   Some of the bugs have possible security implications if gzip or its tools are   fed a carefully constructed malicious archive.  Most of these issues were   recently discovered by Tavis Ormandy and the Google Security Team.  Thanks   to them, and also to the ALT and Owl developers for cleaning up the patch.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## gzip contains a buffer underflow

#### Vulnerability Note VU#554780

Original Release Date: 2006-09-19 | Last Revised: 2011-07-22

---

### Overview

The gzip program contains a buffer underflow vulnerability that may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code, or create a denial-of-service condition.

### Description

| The [gzip](http://www.gzip.org/) program is used to compress and decompress archived files.  A buffer underflow vulnerability exists in gzip. An attacker may be able to exploit this vulnerability by convincing a user to open a specially crafted gzip file.Note that the attacker could either convince a user to open a malicious gzip file, or save the file in a place where another program would call gzip to decompress the archive. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code, or create a denial-of-service condition. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade**This issue has been addressed in gzip 1.3.6. See the systems affected section of this document for information about specific vendors. |
| --- |

| **Workarounds**Until updates can be applied, the following workarounds may mitigate the impact of this vulnerability:     + Do not decompress gzip files that are received from unknown sources. + Do not execute gzip with system-level privileges. + Some automated processes may rely on gzip to complete their tasks. When possible, disable such programs or do not allow them to execute gzip with root privileges. |

CVE-2006-4338
For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit .
I. Background
gzip is a file compression utility.
II. Problem Description
Multiple programming errors have been found in gzip which can be
triggered when gzip is decompressing files. These errors include
insufficient bounds checks in buffer use, a NULL pointer dereference,
and a potential infinite loop.
III. Impact
The insufficient bounds checks in buffer use can cause gzip to crash,
and may permit the execution of arbitrary code. The NULL pointer
deference can cause gzip to crash. The infinite loop can cause a
Denial-of-Service situation where gzip uses all available CPU time.
IV. Workaround
No workaround is available.
V. Solution
Perform one of the following:
1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to 4-STABLE, 5-STABLE, or 6-STABLE,
or to the RELENG\_6\_1, RELENG\_6\_0, RELENG\_5\_5, RELENG\_5\_4, RELENG\_5\_3,
or RELENG\_4\_11 security branch dated after the correction date.
2) To patch your present system:
The following patches have been verified to apply to FreeBSD 4.11, 5.3,
5.4, 5.5, 6.0, and 6.1 systems.
a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-06:21/gzip.patch
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-06:21/gzip.patch.asc
b) Execute the following commands as root:
# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch
# cd /usr/src/gnu/usr.bin/gzip

gzip security update (RHSA-2006-0667)

Original Release Date: October 13, 2006

Last Revised: September 14, 2007

Number: ASA-2006-218

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 2.0

Advisory Status: Interim

---

## 1. Overview:

GNU zip (gzip) is the data compression program from the GNU project.

Two Denial of Service (DoS) issues were found in vulnerable versions of gzip.
If an attacker could get a user to decompress a specially crafted gzip file,
gzip could potentially hang or crash. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names
[CVE-2006-4334](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4334) and
[CVE-2006-4338](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4338) to these issues.

Several code execution issues were found in vulnerable versions of gzip.
If an attacker could get a user to decompress a specially crafted gzip file,
gzip could potentially hang or crash. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names
[CVE-2006-4335](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4335),
[CVE-2006-4336](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4336), and
[CVE-2006-4337](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4337) to these issues.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security
advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2006-0667.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with gzip installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya S87XX/S8500/S8300 | All | Low | Upgrade to Communication Manager 4.0 or later. |
| Avaya Intuity LX | All | Low | Upgrade to Intuity LX 2.0 or later. |
| Avaya Messaging Storage Server | All | Low | Upgrade to MSS 3.1 or later. |
| Avaya Message Networking | All | Low | Upgrade to MN 3.1 or later. |
| Avaya CCS/SES | 3.1.1 | Low | See recommended actions below.  This issue will be addressed in accordance with [Avaya's Product Security Vulnerability Response Policy](http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/security_vulnerability_response.pdf) |

**Recommended Actions:**
For all system products which use vulnerable
versions of gzip, Avaya recommends that customers restrict local and network
access to the server. This restriction should be enforced through the use of
physical security, firewalls, ACLs, VPNs, and other generally-accepted
networking practices until such time as an update becomes available and can
be installed.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating
system or applications that come with the operating system. These
vulnerabilities often do not impact the software-only product directly but
may threaten the integrity of the underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by
the vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be.
Customers should determine on which Linux operating system the product was
installed and then follow that vendors guidance:

## 4. Software-Only Products:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CVLAN | All | Low | See recommended actions below. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite(IMS) | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. The IMS application does not require the software described in this advisory. |

**Recommended Actions:**
Avaya recommends that customers follow
recommended actions supplied by RedHat Linux.
