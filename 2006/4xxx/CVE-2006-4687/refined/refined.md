Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2006-4687:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in how Microsoft Internet Explorer handles specially crafted HTML with certain layout combinations, specifically related to the CSS 'float' property. Improper parsing of these properties leads to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory corruption due to improper handling of HTML CSS 'float' properties.
- Vulnerability exists in the rendering engine of Internet Explorer when processing specific HTML layout combinations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system with the privileges of the user running Internet Explorer.
- Denial of service: An attacker might also cause a denial-of-service condition on the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Visiting a malicious website: An attacker can host a webpage containing the specially crafted HTML that triggers the vulnerability when a user visits the page with a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer.
- HTML email: A malicious HTML email could also exploit the vulnerability if the email is opened with a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer.
- Compromised websites: Attackers can inject malicious content into compromised websites to target users.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious HTML page using specific combinations of `<div>` tags and the 'float' CSS property that causes memory corruption in Internet Explorer.
- The attacker needs to persuade the target user to either visit a malicious website or open a malicious HTML email. No direct access to the victim's system is needed initially.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by the specific ordering of `div` tags and how the CSS `float` property is parsed during rendering.
- User interaction is required for exploitation (visiting the malicious page).
- This vulnerability was reported by Sam Thomas working with TippingPoint and the Zero Day Initiative.
- Microsoft released a security update (MS06-067) to address this issue.
