```
  - Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw in the 'new_calendarid' parameter within the calendar module of the more.groupware application.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL injection. The application fails to sanitize user input when constructing SQL queries, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
  - Impact of exploitation: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass authentication and execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to the disclosure of sensitive information like user passwords.
  - Attack vectors: The vulnerability is exploited via a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/modules/calendar/week.php` endpoint. The `new_calendarid` parameter is manipulated to inject SQL code.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to have an account on the vulnerable system. They can then use this account to log in and inject malicious SQL code via a HTTP POST request.
