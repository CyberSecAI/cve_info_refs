### General Information

## Executive Summary

**Executive Summary:**

This update resolves two newly discovered vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are documented in the "Vulnerability Details" section of this bulletin.

If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less affected than users who operate with administrative user rights.

We recommend that customers apply the update immediately.

**What is the** **Enterprise** **Update Scan Tool (EST)?**

As part of an ongoing commitment to provide detection tools for bulletin-class security updates, Microsoft delivers a stand-alone detection tool whenever the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) and the Office Detection Tool (ODT) cannot detect whether the update is required for an MSRC release cycle. This stand-alone tool is called the Enterprise Update Scan Tool (EST) and is designed for enterprise administrators. When a version of the Enterprise Update Scan Tool is created for a specific bulletin, customers can run the tool from a command line interface (CLI) and view the results of the XML output file. To help customers better utilize the tool, detailed documentation will be provided with the tool. There is also a version of the tool that offers an integrated experience for SMS administrators.

**Can I use a version of the** **Enterprise** **Update Scan Tool (EST) to determine whether this update is required?**

Yes. Microsoft has created a version of the EST that will determine if you have to apply this update. For download links and more information about the version of the EST that is being released this month, see the following [Microsoft Web site](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/894193). SMS customers should review the "Can I use Systems Management Server (SMS) to determine whether this update is required?" FAQ for more information about SMS and EST.

**Can I use Systems Management Server (SMS) to determine whether this update is required?**

The following table provides the SMS detection summary for this security update.

| Product | SMS 2.0 | SMS 2003 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Windows Media Player 6.4 on Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 4 | Yes | Yes |

| Windows Media Player 6.4 on Microsoft Windows XP Professional x64 Edition | Yes | Yes |
| Windows Media Player 6.4 on Microsoft Windows Server 2003, Microsoft Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1, Microsoft Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 2 | Yes | Yes |
| Windows Media Player 6.4 on Microsoft Windows Server 2003 x64 Edition | Yes | Yes |
| Windows Media Format Series Runtime on Windows 2000 Service Pack 4 | Yes (with EST) | Yes |
| Microsoft Windows Media Format Series Runtime Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 2 and Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 3 | Yes (with EST) | Yes |
| Microsoft Windows Media Format Series Runtime for Microsoft Windows XP Professional x64 Edition | Yes (with EST) | Yes |
| Microsoft Windows Media Format Series Runtime for Microsoft Windows Server 2003, Microsoft Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1, Microsoft Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 2 | Yes (with EST) | Yes |
| Microsoft Windows Media Format Series Runtime for Microsoft Windows Server 2003 x64 Edition family | Yes (with EST) | Yes |

SMS uses MBSA for detection. Therefore, SMS has the same limitation that is listed earlier in this bulletin related to programs that MBSA does not detect.

For SMS 2.0, the SMS SUS Feature Pack, which includes the Security Update Inventory Tool, can be used by SMS to detect security updates. SMS SUIT uses the MBSA 1.2.1 engine for detection. For more information about the Security Update Inventory Tool, visit the following [Microsoft Web site](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/894154/). For more information about the limitations of the Security Update Inventory Tool, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 306460](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/306460/). The SMS SUS Feature Pack also includes the Microsoft Office Inventory Tool to detect required updates for Microsoft Office applications.

For SMS 2003, the SMS 2003 Inventory Tool for Microsoft Updates can be used by SMS to detect security updates that are offered by [Microsoft Update](https://update.microsoft.com/microsoftupdate) and that are supported by [Windows Server Update Services](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=50120). For more information about the SMS 2003 Inventory Tool for Microsoft Updates, visit the following [Microsoft Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=50757).

An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing specially crafted Windows Media Player content that could potentially allow remote code execution if a user visits a malicious Web site or opens an e-mail message with malicious content. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system.

#### Mitigating Factors for Windows Media Format ASF Parsing Vulnerability - CVE-2006-4702:

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less affected than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* Windows Media Format 11 Runtime is not affected by this vulnerability and could be used to prevent an attempt to exploit this vulnerability.

#### Workarounds for Windows Media Format ASF Parsing Vulnerability - CVE-2006-4702:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

**Note** The following steps require Administrator privileges. We recommend that you restart the computer after you apply this workaround. Alternatively, you can log out and log back in after you apply the workaround.

#### FAQ for Windows Media Format ASF Parsing Vulnerability - CVE-2006-4702:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Windows Media Format Runtime due to the way it handles the processing of Advanced Systems Format files (ASF). An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing specially crafted Windows Media Format content that could potentially allow remote code execution if a user visits a malicious Web site or opens a specially crafted ASF format file in an e-mail message.

If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less affected than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

An unchecked buffer overrun in the ASF processing code within Windows Media Format Runtime.

**What is Windows Media Player?**

Windows Media Player is a feature of the Windows operating system for personal computers. It is used for playing audio and video.

**What is Windows Media Format Runtime?**

The Microsoft Windows Media Format Runtime provides information and tools for applications which use Windows Media content. For more information, see the [product documentation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/windowsmedia/techpages/default.aspx).

**What is Advanced Systems Format (ASF)?**

ASF (Advanced Systems Format) is a file format that stores audio and video information and is specially designed to run over networks like the Internet. It is compressed format that contains streaming audio, video, slide shows, and synchronized events. ASF enables content to be delivered to you as a continuous flow of data. ASF files may have the file extension ASF, WMV, or WMA.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could host a specially crafted Web site that is designed to exploit these vulnerabilities through Internet Explorer and then persuade a user to view the Web site. This can also include Web sites that accept user-provided content or advertisements, Web sites that host user-provided content or advertisements, and compromised Web sites. These Web sites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit these vulnerabilities. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site. It could also be possible to display specially crafted Web content by using banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver Web content to affected systems.

In an e-mail attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted file to the user and by persuading the user to open the file.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that Windows Media Format Runtime validates the length of data in the media data before passing the file to the allocated buffer.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

#### Windows Media Format ASX Parsing Vulnerability - CVE-2006-6134

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Windows Media Format Runtime due to the way it handles certain elements contained in Advanced Stream Redirector (ASX) files. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted ASX file that could allow remote code execution if a user visits a malicious Web site, where specially crafted ASX files are used to launch Windows Media player, or if a user clicks on a URL pointing to a specially crafted ASX file. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system.

#### Mitigating Factors for Windows Media Format ASX Parsing Vulnerability - CVE-2006-6134:

* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less affected than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.
* By default, all supported versions of Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Outlook Express open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. The Restricted sites zone helps reduce attacks that could try to exploit this vulnerability by preventing Active Scripting and ActiveX controls from being used when reading HTML e-mail. However, if a user clicks on a link within an e-mail they could still be vulnerable to this issue through the Web-based attack scenario. Similarly, a user would still be at risk if opening an e-mail attachment.
* Windows Media Format 11 Runtime, Windows Media Format Runtime 7.1, and Windows Media Player 6.4 are not affected by this vulnerability.

For more information about how administrators can use SMS 2003 to deploy security updates, visit the [SMS 2003 Security Patch Management Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=22939). SMS 2.0 users can also use [Software Updates Service Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33340) to help deploy security updates. For information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

**Note** SMS uses the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer, the Microsoft Office Detection Tool, and the Enterprise Update Scanning Tool to provide broad support for security bulletin update detection and deployment. Some software updates may not be detected by these tools. Administrators can use the inventory capabilities of the SMS in these cases to target updates to specific systems. For more information about this procedure, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33341). Some security updates require administrative rights following a restart of the system. Administrators can use the Elevated Rights Deployment Tool (available in the [SMS 2003 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33387) and in the [SMS 2.0 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21161)) to install these updates.
