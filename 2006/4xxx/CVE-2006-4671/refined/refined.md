```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The application Fantastic News 2.1.4 is vulnerable to Remote File Inclusion (RFI) due to the insecure use of the $CONFIG['script_path'] variable in `archive.php` and `headlines.php` files. The application uses `require_once` to include files based on the value of this variable, which is controllable by the user via a GET parameter.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Remote File Inclusion (RFI)

Impact of exploitation:
- Remote code execution: By injecting a malicious URL into the `script_path` parameter, an attacker can force the application to include and execute arbitrary code from a remote server, leading to complete compromise of the application and potentially the underlying server.

Attack vectors:
- HTTP GET parameter manipulation

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- The attacker must know or be able to find the vulnerable files (archive.php, headlines.php) and the parameter used to include the remote file (CONFIG[script_path]).
