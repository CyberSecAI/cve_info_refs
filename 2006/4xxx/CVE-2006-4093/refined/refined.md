{
  "CVE-2006-4093": {
    "Description": "Olof Johansson discovered that the kernel did not disable the 'HID0' bit on PowerPC 970 processors so that the ATTN instruction was enabled. A local user could exploit this to crash the kernel. This flaw only affects the powerpc architecture.",
    "Root cause": "The kernel did not disable the 'HID0' bit on PowerPC 970 processors, allowing the ATTN instruction to be executed.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect handling of the 'HID0' bit on PowerPC 970 processors"
    ],
    "Impact": "A local user can cause a denial of service by crashing the kernel.",
     "Attack vectors": [
       "Local user execution of ATTN instruction"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Local user access"
  }
