Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause is the browser's flawed implementation of DNS pinning and its handling of connection failures, allowing for a bypass.  The browser's DNS pinning mechanism, intended to prevent DNS rebinding attacks, can be undermined by deliberately causing connection failures to the initially resolved IP address of the attacker's server. This forces the browser to perform a new DNS lookup, potentially resolving to a different IP address, like an internal server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Bypass of DNS Pinning:** The primary weakness is the browser's failure to maintain a consistent DNS resolution throughout a session when connection attempts to the pinned IP fail. This circumvents the intended security measure.
*   **Same-Origin Policy Violation:**  By forcing a DNS re-resolution to an internal IP address while maintaining the original domain name in the browser context, the attacker effectively bypasses the same-origin policy, gaining access to the internal server's resources.
*   **Reliance on Connection Success:** The browser's behavior is dependent on successful connections. When a connection fails (e.g., server is shut down or port is closed), it triggers a new DNS lookup. This creates an exploitable condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Internal Information Leakage:** An attacker can potentially read sensitive information from internal network servers by exploiting the browser's flawed DNS pinning and same-origin policy bypass. This can include configuration files, internal web pages, and other sensitive data.
*   **Intranet Server Fingerprinting:** By successfully connecting to internal servers, attackers can identify the presence and type of services running on the internal network, which can be used for further attacks.
*   **CSRF Exploitation:** Although not the main focus, the ability to interact with internal servers opens the possibility of exploiting Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to perform actions on behalf of the victim.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious JavaScript:** The attack is carried out using malicious JavaScript code delivered to the victim's browser through a compromised or attacker-controlled website.
*   **DNS Manipulation:** The attacker needs to control the DNS records for their own domain to redirect traffic to the target internal server after the initial script is loaded.
*   **Connection Manipulation:** The attacker must manipulate the availability of the server on the initially resolved IP address. This could be achieved by shutting down the server or closing a specific port after the initial request to force the browser to perform a new DNS lookup.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Control Over a Domain and its DNS Records:** The attacker must have control over a domain name and the ability to modify its DNS records in real-time.
*   **Ability to Host Malicious Script:** The attacker needs a web server to host the initial malicious JavaScript, which the victim will download.
*   **Ability to Manipulate Connections:** The attacker needs to be able to cause the initial connection attempt to fail to trigger a new DNS lookup (by shutting down the server or closing a specific port).
*   **Knowledge of Internal Network:** To fully exploit the vulnerability, the attacker would need knowledge of internal network infrastructure and server IP addresses.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The described attack exploits a combination of DNS manipulation and flaws in the browser's handling of network connection failures.
*   The attack is not limited to the scenario where the attacker shuts down the web server on the initially resolved IP address. It can also be achieved by having the malicious script connect to a closed port on the attacker's server or on the intranet server.
*   The vulnerability affects older versions of browsers such as IE6 and Firefox 1.5 and may not be applicable to modern browsers.
