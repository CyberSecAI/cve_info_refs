Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) weakness in the `demarrage.php` file of Fire Soft Board RC 3. This is due to the application's failure to properly sanitize user-supplied input provided via the `racine` parameter, allowing an attacker to include arbitrary remote files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to include and execute remote files on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious file, attackers can execute arbitrary code on the server, leading to a compromise of the system.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** This vulnerability can lead to a full compromise of the web server and potentially the underlying system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `demarrage.php` file.
*   **`racine` parameter:**  The attacker manipulates the `racine` parameter in the URL to specify the location of a malicious remote file, e.g., `http://www.site.com/[path]/demarrage.php?racine=[shell]`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server hosting the Fire Soft Board application.
*   **Malicious File Hosting:** The attacker needs to host a malicious file on a publicly accessible server.
*   **Basic Web Request Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of constructing a URL to trigger the vulnerability.
