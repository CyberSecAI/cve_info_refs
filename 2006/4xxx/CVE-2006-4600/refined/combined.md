How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# VMware Workstation and Player: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200711-23**

VMware guest operating systems might be able to execute arbitrary code with
elevated privileges on the host operating system through multiple flaws.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-emulation/vmware-workstation** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **5.5.5.56455**= **6.0.0.45731** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **5.5.5.56455** |

| Package | **app-emulation/vmware-player** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.0.5.56455**= **2.0.0.45731** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.0.5.56455** |

### Background

VMware Workstation is a virtual machine for developers and system
administrators. VMware Player is a freeware virtualization software
that can run guests produced by other VMware products.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in several VMware
products. Neel Mehta and Ryan Smith (IBM ISS X-Force) discovered that
the DHCP server contains an integer overflow vulnerability
(CVE-2007-0062), an integer underflow vulnerability (CVE-2007-0063) and
another error when handling malformed packets (CVE-2007-0061), leading
to stack-based buffer overflows or stack corruption. Rafal Wojtczvk
(McAfee) discovered two unspecified errors that allow authenticated
users with administrative or login privileges on a guest operating
system to corrupt memory or cause a Denial of Service (CVE-2007-4496,
CVE-2007-4497). Another unspecified vulnerability related to untrusted
virtual machine images was discovered (CVE-2007-5617).

VMware products also shipped code copies of software with several
vulnerabilities: Samba (GLSA-200705-15), BIND (GLSA-200702-06), MIT
Kerberos 5 (GLSA-200707-11), Vixie Cron (GLSA-200704-11), shadow
(GLSA-200606-02), OpenLDAP (CVE-2006-4600), PAM (CVE-2004-0813,
CVE-2007-1716), GCC (CVE-2006-3619) and GDB (CVE-2006-4146).

### Impact

Remote attackers within a guest system could possibly exploit these
vulnerabilities to execute code on the host system with elevated
privileges or to cause a Denial of Service.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All VMware Workstation users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-emulation/vmware-workstation-5.5.5.56455"
```

All VMware Player users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-emulation/vmware-player-1.0.5.56455"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

OpenLDAP security update (RHSA-2007-0310)

Original Release Date: June 11, 2007

Last Revised: May 27, 2009

Number: ASA-2007-232

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 5.0

Advisory Status: Interim

---

## 1. Overview:

OpenLDAP is an open source LDAP suite (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)
which contains applications and development tools.

A vulnerability has been reported in the OpenLDAP handling of selfwrite access.
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to change the distinguished name of
any user. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2006-4600](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4600) to this issue.

More information about this vulnerability can be found in the security advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2007-0310.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with OpenLDAP installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Communication Manager | CM 2.x, 3.x, 4.x | Low | Upgrade to CM 5.1 or later. |
| Avaya Messaging Storage Server | MSS 3.x | Low | Upgrade to MSS 4.0 or later. |
| Avaya Message Networking | MN 3.1 | Low | See recommended actions below.  This issue will be addressed in accordance with [Avaya's Product Security Vulnerability Response Policy](http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/security_vulnerability_response.pdf) |
| Avaya CCS/SES | CCS/SES 3.1.1 and prior | Low | Upgrade to SES 4.0 or later. |
| Avaya AES | AES 4.01, 4.1 | Low | Upgrade to AES 4.2 or later. |

**Recommended Actions:**
For all system products which use vulnerable versions of
OpenLDAP, Avaya recommends that customers restrict local
and network access to the server. This restriction should be
enforced through the use of physical security, firewalls, ACLs,
VPNs, and other generally-accepted networking practices until such time as
an update becomes available and can be installed.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be. Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and then follow
that vendor's guidance.

## 4. Software-Only Products:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CVLAN | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. The CVLAN application does not require the software described in this advisory. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite(IMS) | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. The IMS application does not require the software described in this advisory. |

**Recommended Actions:**
Avaya recommends that customers follow recommended actions supplied by RedHat Linux or remove the affected package.

## 5. Additional Information:

Additional information may also be available via the Avaya support
[website](http://support.avaya.com) and through your Avaya
account representative. Please contact your Avaya product support
representative, or dial 1-800-242-2121, with any questions.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
