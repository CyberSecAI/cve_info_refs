```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper input sanitization in the `_incMgr` parameter within the `access_manager.php` file. This allows an attacker to include a remote file.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary code by including a malicious file from a remote server.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker sends a crafted HTTP GET request to `access_manager.php`, injecting a URL containing malicious code into the `_incMgr` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and have a web server to host the malicious file."
