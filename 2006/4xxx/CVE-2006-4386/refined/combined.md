How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Apple QuickTime Player H.264 Codec contains an integer overflow

#### Vulnerability Note VU#554252

Original Release Date: 2006-09-13 | Last Revised: 2006-09-13

---

### Overview

Apple QuickTime fails to properly handle H.264 movies. This vulnerability may allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial-of-service condition.

### Description

| Apple [QuickTime Player](http://www.apple.com/quicktime/) is multimedia software that allows users to view local and remote audio, video, and image content. According to [Apple](http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=304357):  *By carefully crafting a corrupt H.264 movie, an attacker can trigger an integer overflow or buffer overflow which may lead to an application crash or arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user.* This vulnerability may be triggered by sending QuickTime Player, or an application that uses the QuickTime plug-in, a specially crafted H.264 movie.Note that this issue affects QuickTime installations on both Apple Mac and Microsoft Windows operating systems. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service condition. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade** **QuickTime**Apple has addressed this issue with QuickTime 7.1.3 as specified in Apple Support Document [304357](http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=304357). |
| --- |

| **Disable QuickTime in your web browser**  An attacker may be able to exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to access a specially crafted file with a web browser. Disabling QuickTime in your web browser will defend against this attack vector. For more information, refer to the [Securing Your Web Browser](http://www.us-cert.gov/reading_room/securing_browser/) document. |

I. BACKGROUND
Apple QuickTime Player is one of the Apple QuickTime components

Apple QuickTime Player is reported prone to remote integer overflow

# Win32 binary codecs: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200803-08**

Multiple vulnerabilities in the Win32 codecs for Linux may result in the
remote execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-libs/win32codecs** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **20071007-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **20071007-r2** |

### Background

Win32 binary codecs provide support for video and audio playback.

### Description

Multiple buffer overflow, heap overflow, and integer overflow
vulnerabilities were discovered in the Quicktime plugin when processing
MOV, FLC, SGI, H.264 and FPX files.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted video
file, possibly resulting in the remote execution of arbitrary code with
the privileges of the user running the application.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Win32 binary codecs users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/win32codecs-20071007-r2"
```

Note: Since no updated binary versions have been released, the
Quicktime libraries have been removed from the package. Please use the
free alternative Quicktime implementations within VLC, MPlayer or Xine
for playback.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
