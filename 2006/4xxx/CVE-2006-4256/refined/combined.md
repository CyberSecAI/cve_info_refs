Debian Bug     : 378281 383416 434045

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Horde web
application framework. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:

CVE-2006-3548

    Moritz Naumann discovered that Horde allows remote attackers
    to inject arbitrary web script or HTML in the context of a logged
    in user (cross site scripting).

    This vulnerability applies to oldstable (sarge) only.

CVE-2006-3549

    Moritz Naumann discovered that Horde does not properly restrict
    its image proxy, allowing remote attackers to use the server as a
    proxy.

    This vulnerability applies to oldstable (sarge) only.

CVE-2006-4256

    Marc Ruef discovered that Horde allows remote attackers to
    include web pages from other sites, which could be useful for
    phishing attacks.

    This vulnerability applies to oldstable (sarge) only.

CVE-2007-1473

    Moritz Naumann discovered that Horde allows remote attackers
    to inject arbitrary web script or HTML in the context of a logged
    in user (cross site scripting).

    This vulnerability applies to both stable (etch) and oldstable (sarge).

CVE-2007-1474

    iDefense discovered that the cleanup cron script in Horde
    allows local users to delete arbitrary files.

    This vulnerability applies to oldstable (sarge) only.

For the old stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 3.0.4-4sarge6.

For the stable distribution (etch) these problems have been fixed in
version 3.1.3-4etch1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 3.1.4-1.

A vulnerability was found in [Horde IMP up to 4.1.3](?product.horde:imp) ([Groupware Software](?type.groupware_software)). It has been rated as critical. Affected by this issue is some unknown processing of the file */index.php*. The manipulation with an unknown input leads to a cross site scripting vulnerability. Using CWE to declare the problem leads to [CWE-80](?vulnerability_cwe.2456 "Cwe"). The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as "<", ">", and "&" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages. Impacted is confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

The weakness was released 08/16/2006 by Marc Ruef with scip AG (Website). The advisory is shared for download at [lists.horde.org](?advisory_url.2456). The attack may be launched remotely. Successful exploitation requires user interaction by the victim. There are known technical details, but no exploit is available.

The Horde Team is pleased to announce the final release of the Horde
Application Framework version 3.1.3.

This is a bugfix release that also fixes a cross site scripting vulnerability
and improves protection against phishing attempts.

Many thanks to the "immerda project group" (<http://www.immmerda.ch>) and Marc
Ruef for reporting these problems and working with us to test the fixes.

The Horde Application Framework is a modular, general-purpose web application
framework written in PHP.  It provides an extensive array of libraries that
are targeted at the common problems and tasks involved in developing modern
web applications.

Major changes compared to Horde 3.1.2 are:
    * Security Fixes
      - Closed an XSS problem in index.php and improved protection against
        phishing attempts.
    * Bugfixes and improvements
      - Added Kolab group ACL support.
      - Improved import of date and time fields.
      - Fixed synchronization support.
      - Updated Catalan, German and Slovenian translations.

The full list of changes (from version 3.1.2) can be viewed here:

<http://cvs.horde.org/diff.php/horde/docs/CHANGES?r1=1.515.2.252&r2=1.515.2.261&ty=h>

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
