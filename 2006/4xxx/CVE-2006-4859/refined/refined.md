The provided content details a remote code execution vulnerability in Limbo CMS 1.0.4.2L, specifically within the `com_contact` component.

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from an insecure file upload process within the `com_contact` component. The `file_ext` function in `contact.html.php` extracts the file extension by simply splitting the filename by "." and taking the second element (`$ext[1]`). This allows an attacker to bypass the extension check by uploading a file with a name like `suntzu.gif.php`. The code will incorrectly identify the extension as `gif` and pass the validation check, allowing the upload of a malicious PHP file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Insecure File Extension Check:** The `file_ext` function does not properly handle filenames with multiple dots, leading to incorrect extension parsing.
2.  **Insufficient Input Validation:** The file upload process allows files with malicious extensions to bypass validation due to the flawed extension check.
3.  **Unrestricted File Upload:** The vulnerability allows for the upload of arbitrary files, including PHP files.
4.  **Remote Code Execution:** By uploading a PHP file, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain remote code execution on the server. This can lead to:

*   Complete compromise of the server.
*   Data theft or manipulation.
*   Website defacement.
*   Malware distribution.
*   Use of the compromised server for further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

The attack vector is through the contact form's attachment upload functionality using the following request:
`http://[target]/[path]/index.php?option=contact&Itemid=$itemid`. The filename `suntzu.gif.php` is used to bypass the extension check and upload malicious PHP code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to access the website's contact form.
*   They need to be able to craft a multipart/form-data request to upload the malicious file.
*   They must know a valid `Itemid` to target the vulnerable contact form.
*   The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the server.
