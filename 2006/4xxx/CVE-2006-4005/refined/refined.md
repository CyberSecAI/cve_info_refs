CVE-2006-4005:
  - Root cause: The program copies remotely provided data unchecked
  - Weakness: Unchecked data copy
  - Impact: Denial of service via application crash
  - Attack vector: Sending a specially crafted network packet to the server.
  - Required attacker capabilities: Ability to send network packets to the server.

CVE-2006-4006:
  - Root cause: Using remotely provided data as a length argument.
  - Weakness: Using attacker-controlled data as length.
  - Impact: Disclosure of private information.
  - Attack vector: Sending a specially crafted network packet to the server.
  - Required attacker capabilities: Ability to send network packets to the server.

Additional Information from the provided content:

- **Vulnerability A (memcpy crash in rscache_add):**
    - Root cause: Unspecified errors in the `rscache_add` function when caching packets for resending. This includes issues like NULL or invalid `resend_cache.entry->packet` pointers, big endian check bypass, and incorrect packet size calculations.
    - Vulnerability: `memcpy` in rscache_add copies data from a potentially invalid pointer `packet`, using a length based on potentially attacker-controlled `packet->h.len`.
    - Impact: Program crash.
    - Attack vector: Sending a packet designed to trigger the issues in `rscache_add`.
    - Required attacker capabilities: Ability to send network packets to the server.

- **Vulnerability B (information disclosure in send_pkg):**
    - Root cause: The `len` field from incoming data isn't reset in functions like `do_gameinfo`. The same value is then used when sending a packet back to the client, potentially disclosing sensitive information such as parts of the environment string.
    - Vulnerability:  The `send_pkg` function uses an attacker-controlled length value from a previous packet, `packet->h.len`, when sending a new packet via `udp_send`, which can leak sensitive data.
    - Impact: Information disclosure
    - Attack vector: Sending a specific crafted packet and then forcing a packet to be sent back containing the data.
    - Required attacker capabilities: Ability to send network packets to the server.

- **Vulnerability C (simple error message termination):**
    - Root cause: The error packet mechanism, intended for kicking clients, can be used to terminate the server itself
    - Vulnerability: By sending an error packet to the server, an attacker can force it to terminate.
    - Impact: Denial of service.
    - Attack vector: Send an error packet to the server.
    - Required attacker capabilities: Ability to send network packets to the server.
