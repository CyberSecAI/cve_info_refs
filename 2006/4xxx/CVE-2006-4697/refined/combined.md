How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Vulnerability Details

#### COM Object Instantiation Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2006-4697:

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way Internet Explorer instantiates COM objects that are not intended to be instantiated in Internet Explorer. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Web page that could potentially allow remote code execution if a user viewed the Web page. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system.

#### Mitigating Factors for COM Object Instantiation Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2006-4697:

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability In addition, Web sites that accept or host user-provided content, or compromised Web sites and advertisement servers could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* By default, all supported versions of Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Outlook Express open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. The Restricted sites zone helps reduce the number of successful attacks that exploit this vulnerability by preventing Active Scripting and ActiveX controls from being used when reading HTML e-mail. However, if a user clicks on a link within an e-mail, they could still be vulnerable to this issue through the Web-based attack scenario.
* By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ms537183.aspx). This mode sets the security level for the Internet zone to High. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that have not been added to Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. See the FAQ subsection of this vulnerability section for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.
* COM Objects not intended to be instantiated in Internet Explorer are not included in the default allow-list for ActiveX controls in Windows Internet Explorer 7. Customers who are running Windows Internet Explorer 7 with default settings are therefore not at risk unless these COM Objects have been activated through the ActiveX opt-in feature in the Internet Zone. Customers who are upgrading to Windows Internet Explorer 7 and have enabled these COM objects in previous versions of Internet Explorer will have them enabled in Windows Internet Explorer 7. For more information on the [ActiveX Opt-in feature](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/bb250471.aspx) and how to add ActiveX controls to the pre-approved list, see the [product documentation](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/bb250471.aspx).
* Windows Internet Explorer 7 in Windows Vista is not affected by this vulnerability.

#### Workarounds for COM Object Instantiation Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2006-4697:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

* **Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running ActiveX Controls or disable ActiveX Controls in the Internet and Local intranet security zone**

  You can help protect against this vulnerability by changing your Internet Explorer settings to prompt before running ActiveX controls. To do this, follow these steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Internet Options** on the **Tools** menu.
  2. Click the **Security** tab.
  3. Click **Internet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  4. Under **Settings**, in the **ActiveX controls and plug-ins** section, under **Run ActiveX controls and plug-ins**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  5. Click **Local intranet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  6. Under **Settings**, in the **ActiveX controls and plug-ins** section, under **Run ActiveX controls and plug-ins**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK.**
  7. Click **OK** two times to return to Internet Explorer.

  **Impact of Workaround:** There are side effects to prompting before running ActiveX controls. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running ActiveX controls is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click **Yes** to run ActiveX controls. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zoneâ.

  **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone.**

  After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, follow these steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this Web site to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your computer. Two in particular that you may want to add are "\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com" and â\*.update.microsoft.comâ (without the quotation marks). These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.
* **Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to âHighâ to prompt before running ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting in these zones**

  You can help protect against this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to prompt before running ActiveX controls. You can do this by setting your browser security to **High**.

  To raise the browsing security level in Microsoft Internet Explorer, follow these steps:

  1. On the Internet Explorer **Tools** menu, click **Internet Options**.
  2. In the **Internet Options** dialog box, click the **Security** tab, and then click the **Internet** icon.
  3. Under **Security level for this zone**, move the slider to **High**. This sets the security level for all Web sites you visit to High.

  **Note** If no slider is visible, click **Default Level**, and then move the slider to **High**.

  **Note** Setting the level to **High** may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the security setting set to **High**.

  **Impact of Workaround:** There are side effects to prompting before running ActiveX controls. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running ActiveX controls is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click **Yes** to run ActiveX controls. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zoneâ.

  **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone.**

  After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  2. In the **Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this Web site to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your computer. Two in particular that you may want to add are "\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com" and â\*.update.microsoft.comâ (without the quotation marks). These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.
* **Prevent COM objects from running in Internet Explorer**

  You can disable attempts to instantiate a COM object in Internet Explorer by setting the kill bit for the control in the registry.

  **Warning** If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

  For detailed steps that you can use to prevent a control from running in Internet Explorer, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 240797](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797). Follow these steps in this article to create a Compatibility Flags value in the registry to prevent a COM object from being instantiated in Internet Explorer.

  To set the kill bit for a CLSID with a value of {XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX}, paste the following text in a text editor such as Notepad. Then, save the file by using the .reg file name extension.

  Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
  [HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{ XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX }]
  "Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400

  You can apply this .reg file to individual systems by double-clicking it. You can also apply it across domains by using Group Policy. For more information about Group Policy, visit the following Microsoft Web sites:

  [Group Policy collection](https://technet.microsoft.com/windowsserver/en/library/6d7cb788-b31d-4d17-9f1e-b5ddaa6deecd)

  **Note** You must restart Internet Explorer for your changes to take effect.

  The Class Identifiers and corresponding files where the COM objects are contained are documented under âWhat does the update do?â in the âFAQ for COM Object Instantiation Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2006-4697â section.

  **Impact of Workaround**: There is no impact as long as the COM object is not intended to be used in Internet Explorer.

#### FAQ for COM Object Instantiation Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2006-4697:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could remotely take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

When Internet Explorer tries to instantiate certain COM objects as ActiveX controls, the COM objects may corrupt the system state in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could host a specially crafted Web site that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then persuade a user to view the Web site. This can also include Web sites that accept user-provided content or advertisements, Web sites that host user-provided content or advertisements, and compromised Web sites. These Web sites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or in an Instant Messenger request that takes users to the attacker's Web site. It could also be possible to display specially crafted Web content by using banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver Web content to affected systems.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability requires that a user is logged on and visits a Web site for any malicious action to occur. Therefore, any systems where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability.

**I am running Windows Internet Explorer 7. Does this mitigate this vulnerability?**

Yes. Customers who are running Windows Internet Explorer 7 with default settings, are not at risk unless these COM Objects have been activated through the ActiveX opt-in feature in the Internet Zone. Customers who are upgrading to Windows Internet Explorer 7 and have enabled these COM objects in previous versions of Internet Explorer will have them enabled in Windows Internet Explorer 7. For more information on the ActiveX Opt-in feature and how to add ActiveX controls to the pre-approved list, see the [product documentation](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/bb250471.aspx).

Windows Internet Explorer 7 in Windows Vista is not affected by this vulnerability.

**What is the ActiveX opt-in feature in Windows Internet Explorer 7?**

Windows Internet Explorer 7 includes an ActiveX opt-in feature, which means that nearly all pre-installed ActiveX controls are off by default. Users are prompted by the Information Bar before they can instantiate a previously installed ActiveX control that has not yet been used on the Internet. This enables a user to permit or deny access on a control-by-control basis. For more information about this and other new features, see the [Windows Internet Explorer 7 features page](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/ie7/about/features/default.mspx).

**I am running Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003. Does this mitigate this vulnerability?**

Yes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ms537183.aspx). This mode sets the security level for the Internet zone to High. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that have not been added to Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. See the next FAQ in this section for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.

**What is Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration?**

Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured Internet Explorer settings that reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running malicious Web content on a server. Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration reduces this threat by modifying numerous security-related settings, including Security and Advanced tab settings in Internet Options. Some of the key modifications include:

* Security level for the Internet zone is set to High. This setting disables scripts, ActiveX components, Microsoft virtual machine (Microsoft VM) HTML content, and file downloads.
* Automatic detection of intranet sites is disabled. This setting assigns all intranet Web sites and all Universal Naming Convention (UNC) paths that are not explicitly listed in the Local intranet zone to the Internet zone.
* Install on Demand and non-Microsoft browser extensions are disabled. This setting prevents Web pages from automatically installing components and prevents non-Microsoft extensions from running.
* Multimedia content is disabled. This setting prevents music, animations, and video clips from running.

For more information regarding Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration, please consult the Managing Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration guide, which can be found at the following [Web site](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=d41b036c-e2e1-4960-99bb-9757f7e9e31b&displaylang;=en).

**What does the update do?**

Because not all COM objects are designed to be accessed through Internet Explorer, this update sets the [kill bit](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797) for a list of Class Identifiers (CLSIDs) for COM objects that have been found to exhibit similar behavior to the COM Object Instantiation Memory Corruption Vulnerability that is addressed in [Microsoft Security Bulletin MS05-054](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=53511). To help protect customers, this update prevents these CLSIDs from being instantiated in Internet Explorer. For more information about kill bits, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 240797](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797).

The Class Identifiers and corresponding files where the COM objects are contained are as follows:

| Class Identifier | File |
| --- | --- |
| DA56F851-D3C5-11D3-844C-00C04F7A06E5 | Imjpcksid.dll |

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

Yes. This vulnerability has been publicly disclosed. It has been assigned Common Vulnerability and Exposure number CVE-2006-4697.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

#### COM Object Instantiation Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0219:

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way Internet Explorer instantiates COM objects that are not intended to be instantiated in Internet Explorer. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Web page that could potentially allow remote code execution if a user viewed the Web page. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system.

#### Mitigating Factors for COM Object Instantiation Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0219:

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or compromised Web sites and advertisement servers could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* By default, all supported versions of Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Outlook Express open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. The Restricted sites zone helps reduce the number of successful attacks that exploit this vulnerability by preventing Active Scripting and ActiveX controls from being used when reading HTML e-mail. However, if a user clicks on a link within an e-mail they could still be vulnerable to this issue through the Web-based attack scenario.
* By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ms537183.aspx). This mode sets the security level for the Internet zone to High. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that have not been added to Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. See the FAQ subsection of this vulnerability section for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.
* COM Objects not intended to be instantiated in Internet Explorer are not included in the default allow-list for ActiveX controls in Windows Internet Explorer 7. Customers who are running Windows Internet Explorer 7 with default settings, are therefore not at risk unless these COM Objects have been activated through the ActiveX opt-in feature in the Internet Zone. Customers who are upgrading to Windows Internet Explorer 7 and have enabled these COM objects in previous versions of Internet Explorer will have them enabled in Windows Internet Explorer 7. For more information on the [ActiveX Opt-in feature](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/bb250471.aspx) and how to add ActiveX controls to the pre-approved list, see the [product documentation](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/bb250471.aspx).
* Windows Internet Explorer 7 in Windows Vista is not affected by this vulnerability.

#### Workarounds for COM Object Instantiation Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0219:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

* **Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running ActiveX Controls or disable ActiveX Controls in the Internet and Local intranet security zone**

  You can help protect against this vulnerability by changing your Internet Explorer settings to prompt before running ActiveX controls. To do this, follow these steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Internet Options** on the **Tools** menu.
  2. Click the **Security** tab.
  3. Click **Internet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  4. Under **Settings**, in the **ActiveX controls and plug-ins** section, under **Run ActiveX controls and plug-ins**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  5. Click **Local intranet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  6. Under **Settings**, in the **ActiveX controls and plug-ins** section, under **Run ActiveX controls and plug-ins**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK.**
  7. Click **OK** two times to return to Internet Explorer.

  **Impact of Workaround:** There are side effects to prompting before running ActiveX controls. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running ActiveX controls is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click **Yes** to run ActiveX controls. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zoneâ.

  **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone.**

  After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, follow these steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this Web site to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your computer. Two in particular that you may want to add are "\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com" and â\*.update.microsoft.comâ (without the quotation marks). These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.
* **Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to âHighâ to prompt before running ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting in these zones**

  You can help protect against this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to prompt before running ActiveX controls. You can do this by setting your browser security to **High**.

  To raise the browsing security level in Microsoft Internet Explorer, follow these steps:

  1. On the Internet Explorer **Tools** menu, click **Internet Options**.
  2. In the **Internet Options** dialog box, click the **Security** tab, and then click the **Internet** icon.
  3. Under **Security level for this zone**, move the slider to **High**. This sets the security level for all Web sites you visit to High.

  **Note** If no slider is visible, click **Default Level**, and then move the slider to **High**.

  **Note** Setting the level to **High** may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the security setting set to **High**.

  **Impact of Workaround:** There are side effects to prompting before running ActiveX controls. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements.

Two in particular that you may want to add are "\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com" and â\*.update.microsoft.comâ (without the quotation marks). These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.
* **Prevent COM objects from running in Internet Explorer**

  You can disable attempts to instantiate a COM object in Internet Explorer by setting the kill bit for the control in the registry.

  **Warning** If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

  For detailed steps that you can use to prevent a control from running in Internet Explorer, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 240797](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797). Follow these steps in this article to create a Compatibility Flags value in the registry to prevent a COM object from being instantiated in Internet Explorer.

  To set the kill bit for a CLSID with a value of {XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX}, paste the following text in a text editor such as Notepad. Then, save the file by using the .reg file name extension.

  Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
  [HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{ XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX }]
  "Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400

  You can apply this .reg file to individual systems by double-clicking it. You can also apply it across domains by using Group Policy. For more information about Group Policy, visit the following Microsoft Web sites:

  [Group Policy collection](https://technet.microsoft.com/windowsserver/en/library/6d7cb788-b31d-4d17-9f1e-b5ddaa6deecd)

  **Note** You must restart Internet Explorer for your changes to take effect.

  The Class Identifiers and corresponding files where the COM objects are contained are documented under âWhat does the update do?â in the âFAQ for COM Object Instantiation Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2006-4697â section.

  **Impact of Workaround**: There is no impact as long as the COM object is not intended to be used in Internet Explorer.

#### FAQ for COM Object Instantiation Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0219:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could remotely take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

When Internet Explorer tries to instantiate certain COM objects as ActiveX controls, the COM objects may corrupt the system state in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could host a specially crafted Web site that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then persuade a user to view the Web site. This can also include Web sites that accept user-provided content or advertisements, Web sites that host user-provided content or advertisements, and compromised Web sites. These Web sites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or in an Instant Messenger request that takes users to the attacker's Web site. It could also be possible to display specially crafted Web content by using banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver Web content to affected systems.

#### FTP Server Response Parsing Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0217:

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way Internet Explorer interprets certain responses from FTP servers. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending specially crafted FTP responses in an FTP session to the FTP client included in Internet Explorer. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

#### Mitigating Factors for FTP Server Response Parsing Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0217:

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host an FTP server that would return these specially crafted FTP server responses to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit the site with the FTP server. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes them to the attacker's site.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* By default, all supported versions of Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Outlook Express open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. The Restricted sites zone helps reduce attacks that could try to exploit this vulnerability by preventing Active Scripting and ActiveX controls from being used when reading HTML e-mail. However, if a user clicks on a link within an e-mail they could still be vulnerable to this issue through the Web-based attack scenario.

  **Note** It cannot be ruled out that this vulnerability could be used in an exploit without Active Scripting. However, using Active Scripting significantly increases the chances of a successful exploit. As a result, this vulnerability has been given a severity rating of Critical on Windows Server 2003.
* By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ms537183.aspx). This mode sets the security level for the Internet zone to High. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that have not been added to Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. See the FAQ subsection of this vulnerability section for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.

#### Workarounds for FTP Server Response Parsing Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0217:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. Although these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

* **Read e-mail messages in plain text format if you are using Outlook 2002 or a later version, or Outlook Express 6 SP1 or a later version, to help protect yourself from the HTML e-mail attack vector.**

  Microsoft Outlook 2002 users who have applied Office XP Service Pack 1 or a later version and Microsoft Outlook Express 6 users who have applied Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 or a later version can enable this setting and view e-mail messages that are not digitally signed or e-mail messages that are not encrypted in plain text only.

  Digitally signed e-mail messages or encrypted e-mail messages are not affected by the setting and may be read in their original formats. For more information about how to enable this setting in Outlook 2002, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 307594](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/307594).

  For information about this setting in Outlook Express 6, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 291387](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/291387).

  **Impact of Workaround:** E-mail messages that are viewed in plain text format will not contain pictures, specialized fonts, animations, or other rich content. Additionally:

  + The changes are applied to the preview pane and to open messages.
  + Pictures become attachments so that they are not lost.
  + Because the message is still in Rich Text or HTML format in the store, the object model (custom code solutions) may behave unexpectedly.

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you can use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. MBSA allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).

* **File Version Verification**

**Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

   **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

   **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.

* **Registry Key Verification**

You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing one of the following registry keys.

Internet Explorer 5.01 Service Pack 4 on Windows 2000 Service Pack 4 and on Small Business Server 2000:

HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Internet Explorer 5.01\SP4\KB928090-IE501SP4-20070125.120000\Filelist

Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 on Windows 2000 Service Pack 4 and on Small Business Server 2000:

HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Internet Explorer 6\SP1\KB928090-IE6SP1-20070125.120000\Filelist

**Note** This registry key may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, this registry key may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams the 928090 security update into the Windows installation source files.

#### Windows XP (all versions)

**Notes** When you install these security updates, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the Update.exe installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you can use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. MBSA allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).

* **File Version Verification**

**Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

   **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

   **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.

* **Registry Key Verification**

You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry keys.

Internet Explorer 6 for Windows XP Home Edition Service Pack 2, Windows XP Professional Service Pack 2, Windows XP Tablet PC Edition 2005, and Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005:

HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows XP\SP3\KB928090\Filelist

Internet Explorer 6 for Windows XP Professional x64 Edition:

HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows XP Version 2003\SP2\KB928090\Filelist

Internet Explorer 7 for Windows XP Home Edition Service Pack 2, Windows XP Professional Service Pack 2, Windows XP Tablet PC Edition 2005, and Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005:

HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows XP\SP0\KB928090-IE7\Filelist

Internet Explorer 7 for Windows XP Professional x64 Edition:

HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows Server 2003\SP0\KB928090-IE7\Filelist

**Note** These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly if an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams the 928090 security update into the Windows installation source files.

#### Windows Server 2003 (all versions)

**Prerequisites**

This security update requires Windows Server 2003 or Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1.

The security update for Windows Internet Explorer 7 for Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 requires Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1.

**Inclusion in Future Service Packs:**

The update for this issue will be included in a future Service Pack or Update Rollup.

**Installation Information**

This security update supports the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/help** | Displays the command-line options |
| Setup Modes |  |
| **/passive** | Unattended Setup mode. No user interaction is required, but installation status is displayed. If a restart is required at the end of Setup, a dialog box will be presented to the user with a timer warning that the computer will restart in 30 seconds. |
| **/quiet** | Quiet mode. This is the same as unattended mode, but no status or error messages are displayed. |
| Restart Options |  |
| **/norestart** | Does not restart when installation has completed |
| **/forcerestart** | Restarts the computer after installation and force other applications to close at shutdown without saving open files first. |
| **/warnrestart[:x]** | Presents a dialog box with a timer warning the user that the computer will restart in *x* seconds. (The default setting is 30 seconds.) Intended for use with the **/quiet** switch or the **/passive** switch. |
| **/promptrestart** | Display a dialog box prompting the local user to allow a restart |
| Special Options |  |
| **/overwriteoem** | Overwrites OEM files without prompting |
| **/nobackup** | Does not back up files needed for uninstall |
| **/forceappsclose** | Forces other programs to close when the computer shuts down |
| **/log:path** | Allows the redirection of installation log files |
| **/integrate:path** | Integrates the update into the Windows source files. These files are located at the path that is specified in the switch. |
| **/extract[:path]** | Extracts files without starting the Setup program |
| **/ER** | Enables extended error reporting |
| **/verbose** | Enables verbose logging. During installation, creates %Windir%\CabBuild.log. This log details the files that are copied. Using this switch may cause the installation to proceed more slowly. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports many of the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841). For more information about the Update.exe installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

**Notes** When you install these security updates, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the Update.exe installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you can use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. MBSA allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).

* **File Version Verification**

**Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

   **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

   **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.

* **Registry Key Verification**

You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry key.

## Microsoft Internet Explorer fails to properly instantiate COM objects

#### Vulnerability Note VU#753924

Original Release Date: 2007-02-13 | Last Revised: 2007-02-23

---

### Overview

A vulnerability in the way Microsoft Internet Explorer instantiates COM objects may lead to execution of arbitrary code.

### Description

| Component Object Model, or [COM](http://www.microsoft.com/com/default.mspx) objects are used to enable interprocess communication and dynamic object creation within Microsoft Windows. Microsoft Internet Explorer contains a vulnerability that could be exploited when it attempts to load specially crafted websites that instantiate specific COM objects contained in Imjpcksid.dll, and Imjpskdic.dll. According to Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS07-016](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms07-016.mspx):   *When Internet Explorer tries to instantiate certain COM objects as ActiveX controls, the COM objects may corrupt the system state in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code.* Note that this vulnerability does not affect Windows Internet Explorer 7 in Windows Vista. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial-of-service condition. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Update**Microsoft has released an update to address this issue. See Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS07-016](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms07-016.mspx) for more details. |
| --- |

| **Disable ActiveX**  Disabling ActiveX controls in the Internet Zone (or any zone used by an attacker) appears to prevent exploitation of this vulnerability. Instructions for disabling ActiveX in the Internet Zone can be found in the document [Securing Your Web Browser](http://www.us-cert.gov/reading_room/securing_browser/#Internet_Explorer) and the [Malicious Web Scripts FAQ](http://www.cert.org/tech_tips/malicious_code_FAQ.html#ie56).Note that disabling ActiveX controls in the Internet Zone will reduce the functionality of some web sites. |
