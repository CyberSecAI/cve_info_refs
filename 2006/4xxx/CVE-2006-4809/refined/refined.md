    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2006-4809",
      "source": "bugs.gentoo.org_31583b68_20250126_110419.html",
      "root_cause": "Multiple buffer overflows were discovered in various image loader functions within imlib2. Specifically, overflows were found in loader_argb.c, loader_png.c, loader_lbm.c, loader_jpeg.c, loader_tiff.c, loader_tga.c, and loader_pnm.c. Additionally, an out-of-bounds memory read was identified in loader_tga.c.",
       "weaknesses": [
        "Buffer Overflow",
        "Out-of-bounds memory read"
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application using the imlib2 library. This could lead to complete system compromise or denial of service.",
      "attack_vector": "An attacker could entice a user into processing a specially crafted image (JPG, ARGB, PNG, LBM, PNM, TIFF, or TGA format) using an 'imlib2' binary or any other application that relies on the imlib2 library.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a malicious image file and trick a user into opening it with a vulnerable application. No special privileges are required for the attacker."

      "cve_id": "CVE-2006-4809",
       "source": "www.ubuntu.com_f59c2b73_20250125_183725.html",
      "root_cause": "imlib2 did not sufficiently verify the validity of ARGB, JPG, LBM, PNG, PNM, TGA, and TIFF images.",
        "weaknesses": [
            "Insufficient input validation"
        ],
      "impact": "By tricking a user into viewing or processing a specially crafted image, an attacker could exploit the flaws to execute arbitrary code with the user's privileges.",
      "attack_vector": "The attack vector involves a user opening a malicious image file with an application that uses the vulnerable imlib2 library.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to create a malicious image file that would trigger the vulnerability when processed by the imlib2 library and trick a user into opening such a malicious image."
