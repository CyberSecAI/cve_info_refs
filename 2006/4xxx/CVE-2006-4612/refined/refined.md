Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper input sanitization in the `RepId` parameter of the `ReplyNew.asp` script in ZIXForum 1.12.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw, specifically a union-based SQL injection. An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries by manipulating the `RepId` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Disclosure:** An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, such as usernames and passwords from the `adminlogins` table.
- **Potential for Further Attacks:** By obtaining administrative credentials, an attacker can gain complete control over the forum.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through crafting a malicious URL with a manipulated `RepId` parameter within an HTTP GET request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely.
- **Basic HTTP Knowledge:**  The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with a malicious SQL injection string, using basic understanding of HTTP GET requests.
- **No authentication required**: The SQL injection can be exploited without prior authentication.

**Technical Details**
The provided content includes example attack URLs:
- To extract username: `http://www.target.com/path/ReplyNew.asp?RepId=-1 UNION SELECT null,null,null,J_user,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null FROM adminlogins`
- To extract password: `http://www.target.com/path/ReplyNew.asp?RepId=-1 UNION SELECT null,null,null,J_pass,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null FROM adminlogins`
