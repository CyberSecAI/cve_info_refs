    "vulnerability": "SQL Injection",
    "description": "YenerTurk Haber Script v1.0 is vulnerable to SQL Injection. By manipulating the 'id' parameter in the 'default.asp' file, an attacker can inject malicious SQL code. Specifically, the 'id' parameter within the URL is not properly sanitized, allowing for SQL injection attacks via a crafted UNION SELECT statement.",
    "root_cause": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input within the 'id' parameter in the 'default.asp' file before using it in an SQL query.",
    "weaknesses": [

    "impact": "An attacker can bypass authentication by retrieving user credentials from the admin table. Specifically, usernames and passwords can be extracted from the database.",
    "attack_vector": "The vulnerability is triggered via HTTP GET requests to 'default.asp' with a malicious SQL query crafted within the 'id' parameter.",
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to craft a specific URL containing a SQL injection payload. No prior authentication is required. "
