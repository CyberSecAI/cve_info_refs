    "Root cause of vulnerability": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the handling of the SIZE command within the WFTPD FTP server.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Buffer Overflow",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted SIZE command to the FTP server.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the vulnerable server. The attacker requires knowledge of the operating system, service pack and language of the target system to select the correct return address for the exploit. Basic knowledge of FTP commands is also required.",
    "Additional details": "The exploit code provided includes reverse shell functionality, allowing an attacker to gain command-line access to the target system."
