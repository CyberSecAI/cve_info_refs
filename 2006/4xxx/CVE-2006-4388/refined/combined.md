# Win32 binary codecs: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200803-08**

Multiple vulnerabilities in the Win32 codecs for Linux may result in the
remote execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-libs/win32codecs** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **20071007-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **20071007-r2** |

### Background

Win32 binary codecs provide support for video and audio playback.

### Description

Multiple buffer overflow, heap overflow, and integer overflow
vulnerabilities were discovered in the Quicktime plugin when processing
MOV, FLC, SGI, H.264 and FPX files.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted video
file, possibly resulting in the remote execution of arbitrary code with
the privileges of the user running the application.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Win32 binary codecs users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/win32codecs-20071007-r2"
```

Note: Since no updated binary versions have been released, the
Quicktime libraries have been removed from the package. Please use the
free alternative Quicktime implementations within VLC, MPlayer or Xine
for playback.

## Apple QuickTime vulnerable to denial of service via specially crafted FlashPix file

#### Vulnerability Note VU#200316

Original Release Date: 2006-09-13 | Last Revised: 2006-09-15

---

### Overview

A buffer overflow vulnerability in the way Apple QuickTime handles FlashPix files could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial-of-service condition.

### Description

| A buffer overflow vulnerability in [QuickTime](http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/) for Windows and Mac OS X may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running QuickTime. By convincing a user to open a specially-crafted FlashPix file, an attacker can trigger the overflow.  Depending on settings, a web browser could automatically open a FlashPix file with QuickTime. Apple iTunes includes QuickTime. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker can execute arbitrary code or create a denial-of-service condition. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade**Apple has addressed this issue in [Quicktime 7.1.3](http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=304357). The latest version of QuickTime is available from the [QuickTime download site](http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/). |
| --- |

| **Do not open multimedia files from untrusted sources**Do not open multimedia files that are from untrusted or unknown sources. For more information, please see [Using Caution with Email Attachments](http://www.us-cert.gov/cas/tips/ST04-010.html).**Limit privileges**Running QuickTime with reduced privileges may help mitigate the effects of this vulnerability. Users with administrator access can run QuickTime with reduced privileges by following the instructions in Microsoft knowledgebase article [294676](http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=KB;EN-US;Q294676). Run QuickTime with their regular user accounts. See the [Before You Connect a New Computer to the Internet](http://www.cert.org/tech_tips/before_you_plug_in.html) for more details. |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
