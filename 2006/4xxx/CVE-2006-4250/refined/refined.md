  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `man` command.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary code as the man user. This is particularly concerning if the man and mandb programs are setuid, allowing for privilege escalation.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by providing specially crafted arguments to the `-H` flag of the `man` command.",
     "required_capabilities": "Local access to execute `man` command. The `man` and `mandb` programs being setuid increases the risk but is not strictly required for exploitation."
