{
  "CVE-2006-4495": {
    "Description": "Multiple vulnerabilities exist in Windows 2000. When Internet Explorer attempts to instantiate specific COM objects (ciodm.dll, MyInfo.dll, msdxm.ocx, and Creator.dll) as ActiveX controls, it can lead to system memory corruption. This corruption can be exploited by an attacker for a Denial of Service (DoS) or potentially to execute arbitrary code.",
    "Root cause": "Improper handling of COM object instantiation in Windows 2000 when accessed via Internet Explorer as ActiveX controls.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Memory corruption due to flawed COM object instantiation."
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of Service (DoS), potentially arbitrary code execution.",
    "Attack vectors": "Remote via a malicious web page viewed in Internet Explorer.",
     "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to host a malicious webpage that contains the vulnerable ActiveX objects. The victim must visit this page using Internet Explorer."
