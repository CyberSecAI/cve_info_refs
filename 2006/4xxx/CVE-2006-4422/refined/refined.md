Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an unprotected file inclusion vulnerability in `search_function.php` of Jetbox CMS, which uses code from phpdig. The `$relative_script_path` variable, intended to specify the path to include files, is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to potentially include arbitrary files from the server or remote locations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unsanitized Variable:** The `$relative_script_path` variable is directly used in `include` statements without proper validation or sanitization.
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** Although the initial analysis deemed the vulnerability as non-exploitable because the variable was declared statically, it was later discovered that the include statements are actually outside the function definition and not inside, therefore, vulnerable. This can be exploited by manipulating the `$relative_script_path` variable through GET/POST requests to include arbitrary files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on the server by including a malicious file.
- **Data Leakage:** Sensitive information could be exposed by including files that contain configuration details, credentials, or other confidential data.
- **Website Defacement/Takeover:** Successful exploitation could lead to complete compromise of the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited through HTTP GET/POST requests by manipulating the `$relative_script_path` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable Jetbox CMS application.
- The attacker needs to identify the vulnerable `search.php` file that calls `phpdigSearch()` and how to manipulate the `$relative_script_path` variable to inject the path to the malicious file to be included.
