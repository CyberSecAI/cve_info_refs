# [VIM] Sendmail vendor dispute - CVE-2006-4434 (fwd)

FYI, forwarded with approval.  Given this info, I'd say that CVE concurs -
at least until the researchers figure out how to reliably exploit
"use-after-free" bugs (which BTW is going to be CVE/CWE are going to call
these bugs).

I gave the standard response to the criticism in the last paragraph, with
the observation that we vdb's had reported it because OpenBSD did.

- Steve

---------- Forwarded message ----------
Date: Tue, 29 Aug 2006 10:24:58 -0700
From: Claus Assmann
To: [cve at mitre.org](http://www.attrition.org/mailman/listinfo/vim)
Subject: CVE-2006-4434

Is there anything beyond a crash that is referenced in CVE-2006-4434?
The only denial of service that is possible here is to fill up the
disk with core dumps if the OS actually generates different core
dumps (which is unlikely, as sendmail is by default set-group-ID
and hence most OS do not generate a core unless explicitly configured).

Note: the bug is in the shutdown code (finis()) which leads directly
to exit(3), i.e., the process would terminate anyway, no mail delivery
or receiption is affected. If you have other information, then please
let me know.

Please note that I asked OpenBSD about this and the answer from
Theo de Raadt was:
"The problem is tiny."
"it is TOTALLY irrelevant"

The problem should not have been mentioned on their website.  Please
review the report and discard it or change it as explained above.

BTW: it would be nice if your process of creating a candidate for
inclusion in the CVE list makes sure that the security contact for
the software is informed, so we don't have to rely on some 3rd
party to hear about this "DoS" for the software that we maintain.

Claus Assmann
(current maintainer of sendmail)

# Sendmail Open Source

## Email Security and Threat Protection

---

The sendmail Sentrion platform is specifically designed for large, complex environments, but we make a subset of that solution available as an open-source offering. Sentrion is not for everyone, but if you are using open source email for a large complex environment and need an enterprise platform that will enable your messaging roadmap for years to come (virtualization, consolidation, cloud migration, etc.), [speak with a specialist](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/contact) to see if Sendmail Sentrion is right for you.

[Frequently Asked Questions](/us/sendmail/faq)

### Current Sendmail Open Source Release

Sendmail [8.18.1](https://ftp.sendmail.org/sendmail.8.18.1.tar.gz) is available from [ftp.sendmail.org](https://ftp.sendmail.org/). The release has a [gzipped tar](https://ftp.sendmail.org/sendmail.8.18.1.tar.gz) file and a [PGP signature](https://ftp.sendmail.org/sendmail.8.18.1.tar.gz.sig) file. The compressed/gzipped tar files are [signed](#Signing_Keys) by the [2024 signing key](https://www.proofpoint.com/sites/default/files/signing-keys/sendmail2024.asc). See the Security and PGP Signing Keys section for more information about how releases are signed.

### Signing Keys

Security advisories are issued by The Computer Emergency Response Team [CERT](http://www.cert.org/). Sendmail server related security problems should be sent to:

**sendmail-security-*YYYY*@support.sendmail.org**

Replace YYYY with the current year, e.g., 2015. This address is only for reporting security problems in sendmail. When reporting security problems, please use PGP-the public key is available in the file PGPKEYS of the sendmail distribution.

**Please do not use this address to report problems that are not related to the security of the sendmail server.**Questions about [avoiding spam risk](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-reference/spam), how to set up your own certificate authorities, etc. should be posted in comp.mail.sendmail, and Unix-related security in the comp.security.unix newsgroup.

All sendmail distributions are signed with a PGP key named "Sendmail Signing Key/*YYYY*" where *YYYY* is the year of release.

### Contact Us

These addresses are for contributing patches or reporting problems about V8 sendmail. The members of these lists do not have the resources to support vendor versions. Before sending to any of these addresses, please check the [FAQ](/us/sendmail/faq "Sendmail FAQ") and the files README, sendmail/README (on this web-site as Compiling Sendmail) and cf/README (on this web-site as the Configuration README pages) to see if they are already answered; about half of the questions received can be answered in this way.

**Notes**

* Do not send us mail in HTML format, use plain text only (even multipart/alternative with an HTML part will be classified as spam by some of our members and hence an answer will most likely be delayed).
* Do not use 8bit characters in the Subject: nor use some encoding, e.g., =?GB2312?B?, but only plain 7bit ASCII without any charset encoding.
* If you send e-mail to sendmail.org, the answer will most likely not come from a system in the sendmail.org domain. If you use some anti-spam techniques (e.g., challenge-response systems) or you block hosts that are connected via DSL then please do not expect an answer. More and more often replies are blocked which is very annoying. Do not block this address or make sure that your system accepts at least STARTTLS secured mail. A list of IPs is available in the sendmail.org SPF record.
* If you use a challenge/response system, make sure that it does NOT send us a challenge when we reply to your question or when you receive mail from the announce list. We will not reply to those annoying mails.
* If you are using the blacklist from spamlist.org then please do not send us e-mail, the reply of the sendmail maintainer will not reach you.
* Do not send us mail in proprietary formats.
* The mailservers for support.sendmail.org now (2004-11-24) use the following DNSBLs:
  + sbl-xbl.spamhaus.org
  + dnsbl.sorbs.net
  + list.dsbl.org
  + bl.spamcop.net
* The mailserver for support.sendmail.org performs strict RFC checks, for example, it does not accept mail if the domain part has an [MX record](/us/threat-reference/mx-record "MX Record") that points to an IP address (instead of hostname as required).

If you have a question about sendmail, then please post it to the Usenet group comp.mail.sendmail. This newsgroup is dedicated to sendmail. Please make sure you check the usual resources before posting and follow the netiquette.

E-mail addresses to contact sendmail.org are (do *not* send questions about sendmail to these addresses, see above instead; replace YYYY with the current year, e.g., 2006, in all of these addresses):

* sendmail-YYYY@support.sendmail.org for contributing patches, feature requests, and general comments but not questions how to use, install, or configure sendmail;
* sendmail-bugs-YYYY@support.sendmail.org to report implementation bugs;
* sendmail-faq-YYYY@support.sendmail.org only for comments / questions about the FAQ. Please mark your mail clearly with "FAQ: item" where item is the entry in the faq to which you are referring. If it is a general comment about the FAQ, use "FAQ: general", if it is an addition, use "FAQ: new".
* sendmail-security-YYYY@support.sendmail.org (use this only to report related bugs or problems in sendmail). Please do not use this to ask about problems with your configuration, including how to stop spam, how to set up your own certificate authority, how to make sendmail work with S/MIME, etc. All such questions should be asked in comp.mail.sendmail. Also, please do not tell us that you were able to forge mail by using telnet to connect to port 25; this is fundamental to the Internet design for [SMTP](/us/threat-reference/smtp-relay "SMTP Relay"), and not a sendmail bug. Please use encryption to send mail to this address.
* sendmail-mirror-YYYY@support.sendmail.org for updates about a mirror (e.g., a new mirror or an address change).
* webmaster-YYYY@support.sendmail.org for comments about the website.

These are not open lists, meaning that subscription is by invitation only.

### DKIM

The [Domain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM)](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/corporate-blog/post/what-is-dkim) Internet standard enables email senders to digitally sign their messages so that receivers can verify that those messages have not been forged. The DKIM sender authentication scheme allows the recipient of a message to confirm a message originated with the sender’s domain and that the message content has not been altered. A cryptography-based solution, DKIM provides businesses an industry-standard method for mitigating [email fraud](/us/products/email-protection/email-fraud-defense "Email Fraud Defense") and [protecting an organization’s brand](/us/solutions/digital-risk/digital-brand-protection "Digital Brand Protection") and reputation at a relatively low implementation cost.

DKIM has been approved by the IETF as a draft standard (RFC 4871). The protocol was developed through the cooperation of Sendmail, Cisco Systems and Yahoo!

Since being approved by the IETF, a new open source project was started. The OpenDKIM Project is a community effort to develop and maintain a C library for producing DKIM-aware applications and an open source milter for providing DKIM service.

The project started from a code fork of version 2.8.3 of the open source [dkim-milter](http://sourceforge.net/projects/dkim-milter/) package developed and maintained by Sendmail, Inc.

The Sendmail [Sentrion Message Processing Engine](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/products/email-protection/open-source-email-solution) comes standard with OpenDKIM. More information is available at [opendkim.org](http://opendkim.org/) and [dkim.org](http://dkim.org/)

* **001: SECURITY FIX: January 5, 2006**
    *All architectures*

  A buffer overflow has been found in the Perl interpreter with the sprintf function which
  may be exploitable under certain conditions.

  [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.8/common/001_perl.patch)

  * **002: SECURITY FIX: January 5, 2006**
      *All architectures*

    Do not allow users to trick suid programs into re-opening files via /dev/fd.

    [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.8/common/002_fd.patch)

    * **003: RELIABILITY FIX: January 13, 2006**
        *i386 architecture*

      Change the implementation of i386 W^X so that the "execute line" can move around.
      Before it was limited to being either at 512MB (below which all code normally
      lands) or at the top of the stack. Now the line can float as
      [mprotect(2)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.8/mprotect.2)
      and
      [mmap(2)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.8/mmap.2)
      requests need it to. This is now implemented using only GDT selectors
      instead of the LDT so that it is more robust as well.

      [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.8/i386/003_i386pmap.patch)

      * **004: RELIABILITY FIX: January 13, 2006**
          *i386 architecture*

        Constrain
        [i386\_set\_ioperm(2)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.8/i386/i386_set_ioperm.2)
        so even root is blocked from accessing the ioports
        unless the machine is running at lower securelevels or with an open X11 aperture.

        [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.8/i386/004_i386machdep.patch)

        * **005: SECURITY FIX: February 12, 2006**
            *All architectures*

          Josh Bressers has reported a weakness in OpenSSH caused due to the insecure use of the
          [system(3)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.8/system.3)
          function in
          [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.8/scp.1)
          when performing copy operations using filenames that are supplied by the user from the command line.
          This can be exploited to execute shell commands with privileges of the user running
          [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.8/scp.1).

          [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.8/common/005_ssh.patch)

          * **006: SECURITY FIX: March 25, 2006**
              *All architectures*

            A race condition has been reported to exist in the handling by sendmail of
            asynchronous signals. A remote attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the
            privileges of the user running sendmail, typically root.

            [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.8/common/006_sendmail.patch)

            * **007: SECURITY FIX: May 2, 2006**
                *All architectures*

              A security vulnerability has been found in the X.Org server --
              [CVE-2006-1526](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-1526).
              Clients authorized to connect to the X server are able to crash it and to execute
              malicious code within the X server.

              [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.8/common/007_xorg.patch)

              * **008: SECURITY FIX: June 15, 2006**
                  *All architectures*

                A potential denial of service problem has been found in sendmail. A malformed MIME
                message could trigger excessive recursion which will lead to stack exhaustion.
                This denial of service attack only affects delivery of mail from the queue and
                delivery of a malformed message. Other incoming mail is still accepted and
                delivered. However, mail messages in the queue may not be reattempted if a
                malformed MIME message exists.

                [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.8/common/008_sendmail2.patch)

                * **009: SECURITY FIX: July 30, 2006**
                    *All architectures*

                  [httpd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.8/httpd.8)'s
                  mod\_rewrite has a potentially exploitable off-by-one buffer overflow.
                  The buffer overflow may result in a vulnerability which, in combination
                  with certain types of Rewrite rules in the web server configuration files,
                  could be triggered remotely. The default install is not affected by the
                  buffer overflow. CVE-2006-3747

                  [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.8/common/009_httpd.patch)

                  * **010: SECURITY FIX: August 25, 2006**
                      *All architectures*

                    A potential denial of service problem has been found in sendmail. A message
                    with really long header lines could trigger a use-after-free bug causing
                    sendmail to crash.

                    [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.8/common/010_sendmail3.patch)

                    * **011: SECURITY FIX: August 25, 2006**
                        *All architectures*

                      Due to an off-by-one error in
                      [dhcpd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.8/dhcpd.8),
                      it is possible to cause
                      [dhcpd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.8/dhcpd.8)
                      to exit by sending a DHCPDISCOVER packet with a 32-byte client identifier option.
                      [CVE-2006-3122](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-3122)

                      [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.8/common/011_dhcpd.patch)

                      * **012: SECURITY FIX: August 25, 2006**
                          *All architectures*

                        It is possible to cause the kernel to panic when more than the default number of
                        semaphores have been allocated.

                        [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.8/common/012_sem.patch)

                            *All architectures*

                          A problem in
                          [isakmpd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.8/isakmpd.8)
                          caused IPsec to run partly without replay protection. If
                          [isakmpd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.8/isakmpd.8)
                          was acting as responder during SA negotiation, SA's with a replay window of size 0 were created.
                          An attacker could reinject sniffed IPsec packets, which will be accepted without checking the
                          replay counter.

                            Due to the failure to correctly validate LCP configuration option lengths,
                            it is possible for an attacker to send LCP packets via an

                              Two Denial of Service issues have been found with BIND.
                              An attacker who can perform recursive lookups on a DNS server and is able
                              to send a sufficiently large number of recursive queries, or is able to
                              get the DNS server to return more than one SIG(covered) RRsets can stop
                              the functionality of the DNS service.
                              An attacker querying an authoritative DNS server serving a RFC 2535
                              DNSSEC zone may be able to crash the DNS server.

                                Due to incorrect PKCS#1 v1.5 padding validation in OpenSSL, it is possible for
                                an attacker to construct an invalid signature which OpenSSL would accept as a
                                valid PKCS#1 v1.5 signature.

                                    Several problems have been found in OpenSSL. While parsing certain invalid ASN.1
                                    structures an error condition is mishandled, possibly resulting in an infinite
                                    loop. A buffer overflow exists in the SSL\_get\_shared\_ciphers function. A NULL
                                    pointer may be dereferenced in the SSL version 2 client code. In addition, many
                                    applications using OpenSSL do not perform any validation of the lengths of
                                    public keys being used.
