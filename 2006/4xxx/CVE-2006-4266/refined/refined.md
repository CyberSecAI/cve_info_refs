{
  "Root cause": "The vulnerability lies in the Norton Personal Firewall's insufficient protection of the 'HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Symantec\\CCPD\\SuiteOwners' registry key. The registry key stores information including names of libraries, such as 'NISProd.dll', that Norton loads into its processes. The vulnerability stems from the ability to bypass Norton's protection using RegSaveKey and RegRestoreKey API functions, allowing the modification of this registry key.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "Insufficient protection of the 'HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Symantec\\CCPD\\SuiteOwners' registry key",
    "Bypassing Norton's registry protection using RegSaveKey and RegRestoreKey API functions",
    "Ability to modify registry values to point to malicious DLLs"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious application can modify the 'SuiteOwners' registry key to load a fake library into Norton's processes. This fake library can then manipulate any Norton component, effectively bypassing all security protections.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local exploitation is required to use the RegSaveKey and RegRestoreKey API functions to modify the registry keys.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have the ability to execute code locally to use the RegSaveKey and RegRestoreKey API functions and have the ability to create a fake malicious DLL."
