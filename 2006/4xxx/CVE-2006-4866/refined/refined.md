Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause lies within the `kextload` program in Apple OSX, which is used to load kernel extensions. The vulnerability stems from two flaws:

1.  **Format String Vulnerability:** The `kextload` program uses `fprintf(stderr, kext_path)` to print the path of the kext file to standard error. If the `kext_path` contains format string specifiers (e.g., `%x`), it can lead to a format string vulnerability.
2.  **Buffer Overflow Vulnerability:** The `kextload` program has a buffer overflow when handling long kext paths.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Format String Vulnerability:** Unsanitized user-controlled input (`kext_path`) passed to `fprintf`. This allows an attacker to read from and write to arbitrary memory locations.
*   **Buffer Overflow Vulnerability:** Lack of proper bounds checking when handling the `kext_path` string, allowing an attacker to overwrite critical memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local Root Compromise:** By exploiting either vulnerability, a local attacker can gain root privileges. This allows the attacker to perform any actions on the system, including installing malware, accessing sensitive data, and taking complete control of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local access:** The attacker needs local access to the system to execute the `kextload` command with malicious input.
*   **Helper application:** The `kextload` command needs to be run as root, so it can be exploited via a helper application that runs as root (such as Roxio Toast 7).
*   **Malicious kext path:** The attack involves providing a crafted path to the kextload program which leverages format string specifiers or overflows the buffer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Account:** An attacker needs a valid user account on the target OSX system.
*   **Ability to execute kextload:** The attacker must be able to execute the `kextload` command or trigger it through a helper application that calls it with root privileges (e.g., Roxio Toast 7).

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory mentions that other applications calling `kextload` with root privileges may also be vulnerable.
*   The advisory includes examples demonstrating both the format string and buffer overflow vulnerabilities using crafted inputs via command line.
*   Proof of concept exploits are under development at the time of the advisory's release.
*   The advisory highlights that Roxio Toast 7 executes the kextload command with root privileges, making it a suitable target for exploitation.
*   The advisory provides command-line examples of how to trigger the vulnerabilities, including a `perl` command to create the overflow string.
