Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of certain variables in CubeCart. This means that user-supplied input is not being cleansed or validated before being used in database queries or displayed on the web page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The lack of input sanitization makes the application vulnerable to XSS attacks. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
*   **MySQL Injection (SQL Injection):** The same lack of sanitization makes the application vulnerable to SQL injection. This allows an attacker to manipulate database queries, potentially reading sensitive data, modifying data, or gaining control over the database server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **XSS:**  Successful XSS exploitation could lead to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Stealing of user credentials
    *   Redirection to malicious websites
    *   Defacement of the web application
    *   Other malicious actions performed in the context of a user's session.
*   **SQL Injection:** Successful SQL Injection exploitation could lead to:
    *   Unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    *   Modification or deletion of data.
    *   Complete control of the database server.
    *   Potential compromise of the application and its underlying system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Interface:** Attackers can inject malicious code into various input fields of the web application, such as search bars, comment fields, or form inputs, to trigger XSS and SQL injection vulnerabilities.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to interact with the web application and inject malicious input through a web browser. No privileged access is necessary.

**Additional Information:**
* The provided content explicitly mentions that all current versions of CubeCart are affected.
* A patch was released to address the issue which uses a `treatGet` function to sanitize the variables.
* A new version of CubeCart (3.0.12) will be released with the patch integrated.
* The patch addresses XSS and SQL injection issues.
