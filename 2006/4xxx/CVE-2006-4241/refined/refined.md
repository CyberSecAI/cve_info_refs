Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `reporter.sql.php` file of the "reporter" component of Mambo. The script uses `require_once` with a variable `$mosConfig_absolute_path` which is not properly sanitized. This allows an attacker to include arbitrary files from the server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary vulnerability is a remote file inclusion. The vulnerable script uses a user-supplied parameter `$mosConfig_absolute_path` directly in a `require_once` statement. This allows attackers to specify a URL and include it in the server context which can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The script fails to sanitize the `mosConfig_absolute_path` parameter before using it in the `require_once` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By injecting a malicious URL, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server. This could lead to complete compromise of the web server.
*   **Data Theft:** Once code is executed, sensitive data can be compromised.
*   **Denial of Service:** The attacker may execute commands which lead to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Parameter Injection:** The `mosConfig_absolute_path` parameter is passed through a GET request to the vulnerable script which makes the attack very trivial.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs remote access to the web server hosting the vulnerable Mambo component.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Path:**  The attacker needs to know the location of the vulnerable script and the GET parameter to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability is exploitable without any authentication.

**Additional Information:**

*   The provided exploit shows that the `mosConfig_absolute_path` parameter allows an attacker to inject a URL.
*   The vulnerability has been rated as High severity.
*   The exploitability subscore is 10/10 and attack complexity is low.
*   The provided Google Dork `inurl:"/com_reporter/"` helps to find vulnerable instances.

**Summary**

The provided content accurately describes a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability in the Mambo reporter component. The vulnerability stems from the use of an unsanitized user-supplied parameter in a `require_once` statement. This vulnerability could lead to RCE on the target system.
