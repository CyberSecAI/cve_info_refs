# Wireshark: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200608-26**

Wireshark is vulnerable to several security issues that may lead to a
Denial of Service and/or the execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-analyzer/wireshark** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.99.3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.99.3** |

### Background

Wireshark is a feature-rich network protocol analyzer.

### Description

The following vulnerabilities have been discovered in Wireshark.
Firstly, if the IPsec ESP parser is used it is susceptible to
off-by-one errors, this parser is disabled by default; secondly, the
SCSI dissector is vulnerable to an unspecified crash; and finally, the
Q.2931 dissector of the SSCOP payload may use all the available memory
if a port range is configured. By default, no port ranges are
configured.

### Impact

An attacker might be able to exploit these vulnerabilities, resulting
in a crash or the execution of arbitrary code with the permissions of
the user running Wireshark, possibly the root user.

### Workaround

Disable the SCSI and Q.2931 dissectors with the "Analyse" and "Enabled
protocols" menus. Make sure the ESP decryption is disabled, with the
"Edit -> Preferences -> Protocols -> ESP" menu.

### Resolution

All Wireshark users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-analyzer/wireshark-0.99.3"
```

## wnpa-sec-2006-02 · Multiple problems in Wireshark (Ethereal)

## Summary

**Name:** Multiple problems in Wireshark (Ethereal)

**Docid:** wnpa-sec-2006-02

**Date:** August 23, 2006

**Affected versions:** 0.7.9 up to and including 0.99.2

**Fixed versions:** 0.99.3

## Details

### Description

Wireshark 0.99.3 fixes the following vulnerabilities:

* The SCSI dissector could crash.

  Versions affected: 0.99.2.
  CVE: [CVE-2006-4330](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4330)* If Wireshark was compiled with ESP decryption support, the
    IPsec ESP preference parser was susceptible to off-by-one
    errors.

    Versions affected: 0.99.2.
    CVE: [CVE-2006-4331](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4331)* The DHCP dissector (and possibly others) in the Windows version of
      Wireshark could trigger a bug in Glib and crash.

      Versions affected: 0.10.13 - 0.99.2.
      CVE: [CVE-2006-4332](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4332)* If the SSCOP dissector has a port range configured
        **and** the SSCOP payload protocol is
        Q.2931, a malformed packet could make the Q.2931 dissector
        use up available memory. No port range is configured
        by default.

        Versions affected: 0.7.9 - 0.99.2.
        CVE: [CVE-2006-4333](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4333)

## Impact

It may be possible to make Wireshark or Ethereal crash, use
up available memory, or run arbitrary code by injecting a
purposefully malformed packet onto the wire or by convincing
someone to read a malformed packet trace file.
## Resolution

Upgrade to Wireshark 0.99.3.

If are running Wireshark 0.99.2 or Ethereal 0.99.0 or earlier and
cannot upgrade, you can work around each of the problems listed above
by doing the following:

* Disable the SCSI and Q.2931 dissectors. If you're running
  Wireshark under Windows, disable the DHCP dissector.
  + Select *Analyze→Enabled Protocols...* from the menu.+ Make sure "SCSI", "Q.2931", and "BOOTP/DHCP" (if needed)
      are un-checked.+ Click "Save", then click "OK".* If your copy of Wireshark has ESP decryption compiled in, make
    sure it's disabled.
    + Select *Edit→Preferences*, then
      *Protocols→ESP* from the menu.+ Make sure "Attempt to detect/decode encrypted ESP payloads"
        is un-checked.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## wnpa-sec-2006-02 · Multiple problems in Wireshark (Ethereal)

## Summary

**Name:** Multiple problems in Wireshark (Ethereal)

**Docid:** wnpa-sec-2006-02

**Date:** August 23, 2006

**Affected versions:** 0.7.9 up to and including 0.99.2

**Fixed versions:** 0.99.3

## Details

### Description

Wireshark 0.99.3 fixes the following vulnerabilities:

* The SCSI dissector could crash.

  Versions affected: 0.99.2.
  CVE: [CVE-2006-4330](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4330)* If Wireshark was compiled with ESP decryption support, the
    IPsec ESP preference parser was susceptible to off-by-one
    errors.

    Versions affected: 0.99.2.
    CVE: [CVE-2006-4331](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4331)* The DHCP dissector (and possibly others) in the Windows version of
      Wireshark could trigger a bug in Glib and crash.

      Versions affected: 0.10.13 - 0.99.2.
      CVE: [CVE-2006-4332](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4332)* If the SSCOP dissector has a port range configured
        **and** the SSCOP payload protocol is
        Q.2931, a malformed packet could make the Q.2931 dissector
        use up available memory. No port range is configured
        by default.

        Versions affected: 0.7.9 - 0.99.2.
        CVE: [CVE-2006-4333](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4333)

## Impact

It may be possible to make Wireshark or Ethereal crash, use
up available memory, or run arbitrary code by injecting a
purposefully malformed packet onto the wire or by convincing
someone to read a malformed packet trace file.
## Resolution

Upgrade to Wireshark 0.99.3.

If are running Wireshark 0.99.2 or Ethereal 0.99.0 or earlier and
cannot upgrade, you can work around each of the problems listed above
by doing the following:

* Disable the SCSI and Q.2931 dissectors. If you're running
  Wireshark under Windows, disable the DHCP dissector.
  + Select *Analyze→Enabled Protocols...* from the menu.+ Make sure "SCSI", "Q.2931", and "BOOTP/DHCP" (if needed)
      are un-checked.+ Click "Save", then click "OK".* If your copy of Wireshark has ESP decryption compiled in, make
    sure it's disabled.
    + Select *Edit→Preferences*, then
      *Protocols→ESP* from the menu.+ Make sure "Attempt to detect/decode encrypted ESP payloads"
        is un-checked.
