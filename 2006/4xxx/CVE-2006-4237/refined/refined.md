Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an insecure implementation in the `pageheaderdefault.inc.php` file of the IRSR (Invisionix Roaming System Remote) software.
*   Specifically, the `$_sysSessionPath` variable, which is intended to hold the path to session handling functions, is not properly sanitized and is directly included in a `require_once` statement.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application is vulnerable to RFI because the `$_sysSessionPath` variable is directly used in a `require_once` statement, allowing an attacker to specify a remote URL containing malicious PHP code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By injecting malicious PHP code through a remote file, the attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the vulnerable application. This can lead to complete compromise of the server, data breaches, and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the `_sysSessionPath` GET parameter in the URL to point to a remote file containing the malicious code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server to send the crafted HTTP request with the malicious `_sysSessionPath` parameter.
*   **Malicious File Hosting:** The attacker needs a publicly accessible server where they can host the malicious PHP file to be included.

**Technical Details:**

* The vulnerable code snippet is located in `pageheaderdefault.inc.php`

```php
require_once    ($_sysSessionPath);
```
* The fix is to hard code the system path by using `dirname` function to determine the path:

```php
$_sysSessionPath = @dirname(@dirname(@dirname(__FILE__)));
require_once    ($_sysSessionPath);
```
