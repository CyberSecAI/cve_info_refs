This is useful both for users unfamiliar with the CLI and for administrators who want to give only very limited access to a system. If you are familiar with the [Webmin](http://www.webmin.com/) tool for server administration you will recognize many features of the user interface.   | [Using Usermin to upload files](/images/articles/usermin_1.png) | | --- | | Using Usermin to upload files(click to enlarge) |   Many modules are included in Usermin. They are grouped into four categories: Mail, Login, Applications and Others. In the Mail category you can read and write mail, set forwarding rules, edit Procmail and SpamAssassin filters and the like. Each entry provides both an easy-to-use web form and an option to manually edit the configuration files. The Login category provides access to SSH profiles, allows to change your password or run a command in a shell. In the Application category you will find a front-end to GnuPG, client applications for MySQL and PostgreSQL and a powerful up- and download tool.  It is possible to disable some functions via ACLs in a configuration file. So if you only want to allow users to read their e-mails you don't need to give them access to controls that provide interactive access to the system.  Security is not a big problem for Usermin. If you limit access for a user to a specific resource you can be sure that he only has access to them and nothing more. Most commands are executed not as the user running the Usermin process but the as the user that is logged in. A code audit by OS Reviews only found a denial of service attack that changes the shell of the root account to a nonsensical value. This can be achieved by calling the "Change User Details" menu and setting the user's shell to an empty value. The subsequent call to chsh changes the login shell of the root user instead of the user that is logged in. Using some [well-known social engineering techniques](http://72.14.221.104/search?q=cache:giBV6K-rrAYJ:ib.usac.edu.gt/libros/GUUG/saul/misc/O%27Reilly%2520Practical%2520UNIX%2520and%2520Internet%2520Security/ch04_03.htm&hl=en&lr=&strip=1) (taken from [Practical UNIX & Internet Security](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/puis3/)) it might even be possible to obtain root access.  The documentation for Usermin is virtually nonexistent. There is a chapter in the Webmin book that covers some aspects, but is mainly focussed on the Webmin module for configuring Usermin. However, most of the configuration files are more or less self-explanatory. The actual web front-end offers a help text for some modules.  If the modules that come with Usermin don't satisfy your needs, you can write your own Perl modules to include additional features. The procedure for this is pretty straight-forward.  Altogether, Usermin is quite useful both for helping users unfamiliar with the command line and for effectively restricting users to non-interactive access.   | | Usermin | | | | --- | --- | --- | | Version: | 1.200 | | | Homepage: | <http://www.usermin.com/> | | | License: | BSD | | | Distributions: [?] | ■ Debian stable | □ Debian unstable | |  | □ Fedora | ■ Mandriva | |  | □ Suse | □ Ubuntu | | Pros: |  | | Rating: 83 | | --- | | | * Many modules * Robust implementation | | | Cons: |  | | * Poor documentation | | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |   Copyright 2006–2008  [OS Reviews](http://www.osreviews.net/).

Package        : usermin
Vulnerability  : programming error
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2006-4246
CERT advisory  :
BugTraq ID     :
Debian Bug     : 374609

Hendrik Weimer discovered that it is possible for a normal user to
disable the login shell of the root account via usermin, a web-based
administration tool.

For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.110-3.1.

In the upstream distribution this problem is fixed in version 1.220.

We recommend that you upgrade your usermin package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given at the end of this advisory:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
