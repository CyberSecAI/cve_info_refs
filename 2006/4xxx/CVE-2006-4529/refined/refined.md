Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2006-4529:

**Vulnerability:** Multiple vulnerabilities exist in Membrepass v1.5, including SQL injection, PHP code execution, and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Root Cause:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The `recherche` parameter in `/recherchemembre.php` is not properly sanitized before being used in a SQL query.
*   **PHP Code Execution:** The `aifon` parameter in `/include/change.php` is not properly sanitized before being used in the `fputs()` function.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The `recherche` parameter in `/recherchemembre.php` and the `email` parameter in `/test.php` are not properly sanitized before being returned to the user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection:** Lack of input sanitization allows for the execution of arbitrary SQL queries.
*   **PHP Code Execution:** Unsanitized input to `fputs()` allows for arbitrary PHP code execution.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting:** Unsanitized output allows for the injection of client-side scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **SQL Injection:** An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive data stored in the database (e.g., user passwords, email addresses) or potentially modify or delete data.
*   **PHP Code Execution:** An attacker could execute arbitrary PHP code on the server, potentially leading to full compromise of the system.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the web pages, which could be used to steal user credentials, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform other malicious actions in the context of the victim's browser.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted `recherche` parameter in a POST request to `/recherchemembre.php`.
*   **PHP Code Execution:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted `aifon` parameter in a GET request to `/include/change.php` when `register_globals` is enabled and `magic_quotes_gpc` is disabled.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting:** The XSS vulnerabilities can be exploited by sending a POST request with a crafted `recherche` parameter to `/recherchemembre.php` or a GET request with a crafted `email` parameter to `/test.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   For PHP code execution, `register_globals` must be enabled and `magic_quotes_gpc` must be disabled on the server.
*   For successful SQL injection, `magic_quotes_gpc` may need to be disabled.
*   For Cross-site Scripting, `register_globals` may need to be enabled.

**Additional Notes**
*  The exploit examples are given, which can help in better understanding the attack.
*  The advisory mentions that the vendor has not patched the vulnerabilities.
*  The advisory was publicly disclosed on 29. Aug. 2006
