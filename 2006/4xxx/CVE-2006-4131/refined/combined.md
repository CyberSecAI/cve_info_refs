 **** For educational purposes only! Please use responsible! ***
 *
 * NotiFlood is a PoC MMS M-notification.ind flooder written to demo the PocketPC
 * MMS Composer vulnerabilities for my DEFCON-14 talk "Advanced Attacks Against
 * PocketPC Phones".
 *
 * The tool sends MMS new message notifications to the target PocketPC device over
 * WiFi IP:UDP4:2948. In flood mode the device plays the new message sound for
 * every received notification. If auto receive is enabled the phone will try to
 * dial-up GPRS in order to receive the message. After receiving a couple
 * hundred messages the phone randomly freezes or rejects new messages. Further
 * the MMS inbox is filled up with messages that only can be deleted manually
 * one-by-one. In crash mode, each notification crashes the MMS client and
 * therefore actively keeps the user from using the Inbox application while
 * connected to WiFi (the Inbox application also handles email like via POP3 and
 * IMAP).
 *
 * This was tested with WinCE 4.2x and MMS Composer 1.5 and 2.0
 *
 * Examples:
 *  flood all clients in 192.168.1/24:
 *  notiflood -d 192.168.1.255 -n 0
 *
 *  crash client at: 192.168.42.29:
 *  notiflood -d 192.168.42.29 -i 500000 -n 1 -c

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Mobile Phone Attacks
State of the Art

● Bluetooth­based attacks

– Take control of phone, initiate calls and send text messages

– Steal phonebook and/or other files

– Denial­of­service

● Third­party application vulnerabilities

– Code injection/execution

– Denial­of­service

  Collin Mulliner  Advanced Attacks Against PocketPC Phones   defcon­14

Mobile Phone Attacks
SMS/MMS

● Symbian MMS worms

– Don't utilize vulnerabilities in applications or the OS

– Require user interaction in order to infect a target

– Examples: CommWarrior and Mabir

● SMS­based denial­of­service attacks

– Nokia 6210: vCard format string vulnerability

– Siemens 3568i: crash because of “unusual characters”

  Collin Mulliner  Advanced Attacks Against PocketPC Phones   defcon­14

PocketPC Attacks

● Third­party applications vulnerabilities

– For example: FTP servers

● Bluetooth stack remote code execution exploit

– Non­public, because it will never be fixed (Tim Hurman)

● Bluetooth OBEX push attack (bypass authentication)

– Full access to all files on the device

● ActiveSync denial­of­service

● Some “local” attacks

  Collin Mulliner  Advanced Attacks Against PocketPC Phones   defcon­14

PocketPC

● Is the WindowsCE version for PDAs and smart phones

– WindowsCE: Windows for Consumer Electronics

● Supports many platforms (x86, SH, ARM)

– Most PocketPC devices are ARM­based

● Current version of WinCE is 5.0, we are looking at 4.2x

– Still many WinCE 4.2x devices out there

  Collin Mulliner  Advanced Attacks Against PocketPC Phones   defcon­14

PocketPC Phones

● i­mate PDA2k

– PocketPC 2003 SE (WinCE 4.21)

– GSM, WLAN, Bluetooth, IrDA

● HP iPAQ h6315

– PocketPC 2003 (WinCE 4.2)

– GSM, WLAN, Bluetooth, IrDA

● Many more...

  Collin Mulliner  Advanced Attacks Against PocketPC Phones   defcon­14

The WindowsCE 4.2x OS

● One single 4GB virtual address space

– Divided into so­called slots (each slot is 32MB)

– All processes share the virtual address space

● Memory protection exists

● Limited to 32 concurrent processes

– Basically no thread limit

  Collin Mulliner  Advanced Attacks Against PocketPC Phones   defcon­14

WindowsCE OS Security

● Single user OS

– No real login, just an optional 'device lock'

● Any process can access everything

– Once you are in ... you are in

● Full access to everything...

– For example: Bluetooth API, Mobile Phone API, etc...

  Collin Mulliner  Advanced Attacks Against PocketPC Phones   defcon­14

WindowsCE Exploitation

● Buffer overflow/stack smashing

– Overwrite return address, take control of program flow

● WindowsCE/ARM shellcode and exploit development

– Covered quite well by now

● 2004 Seth Fogie (at Defcon­12)

● 2005 San (in Phrack #63)

● 2005 Collin Mulliner (at WhatTheHack!)

● 2005 Tim Hurman (pentest.co.uk)

  Collin Mulliner  Advanced Attacks Against PocketPC Phones   defcon­14

WindowsCE Exploit Issues

● No “command shell”

– Need to hard code everything the exploit is supposed to do

● Return address depends on slot used by process

– Slots are dynamically assigned

– Need to “guess” slot part of return address

  Collin Mulliner  Advanced Attacks Against PocketPC Phones   defcon­14

The Multimedia Messaging Service

● Messaging service for mobile phones

– Commonly known as MMS and/or Picture Messaging

● Designed for multimedia content (pictures, audio, video,..)

– But basically supports any kind of data

● Messages are sent in a store and forward manner

– Service requires infrastructure to function

● Pay­per­use service

– Per message fee

  Collin Mulliner  Advanced Attacks Against PocketPC Phones   defcon­14

The MMS Architecture

● IP­based service

– Utilizes HTTP and WAP (Wireless Application Protocol)

– Transported by GSM/GPRS/etc.

● Message delivery is carried out by four components

– MMS Server

– MMS Relay

– WAP Gateway/PushProxy

– SMSC (Short Message Service Center)

  Collin Mulliner  Advanced Attacks Against PocketPC Phones   defcon­14

MMS Message Delivery

● Sender submits message to MMS Relay

– Sender (WTP/WSP) → WAP Gateway (HTTP) → MMS Relay

● Recipient retrieves message after notification

– MMS Relay → WAP PushProxy/SMSC (SMS) → Recipient

– Recipient (WTP/WSP) → WAP Gateway (HTTP) → MMS Relay

  Collin Mulliner  Advanced Attacks Against PocketPC Phones   defcon­14

MMS Messages

● Structured like Internet email messages

– Messages are split into header and body

● Header contains control information

● Body contains message content (MIME multi­part)

● Messages are in binary form when transfered to and from

mobile phone user agents

– Reduce size for over­the­air transport

  Collin Mulliner  Advanced Attacks Against PocketPC Phones   defcon­14

MMS Message Types

  Collin Mulliner  Advanced Attacks Against PocketPC Phones   defcon­14

The MMS User Agent

● Represents the sending and receiving end­point

● Handles multiple different network types and protocols

– SMS­based WAPPush

– IP­based WAP GET/POST

● Processes and displays multiple media types

– SMIL and WML for the presentation part

● SMIL (Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language)

– GIF, JPEG, BMP, AMR, MV4, ... for the content part

  Collin Mulliner  Advanced Attacks Against PocketPC Phones   defcon­14

The PocketPC MMS User Agent

● The Inbox application

– Also handles SMS and email (POP3 and IMAP)

● MMS Composer

– Version 1.5.5.6 (HP iPAQ h6315 WinCE4.2)

– Version 2.0.0.13 (i­mate PDA2K WinCE 4.21)

● Application binary: tmail.exe

  Collin Mulliner  Advanced Attacks Against PocketPC Phones   defcon­14

Analyzing the MMS User Agent

● Identify the inputs to the user agent

– Possible attack vectors

● Determine message sanitization by the MMS

infrastructure

– Avoid testing sanitized parts of a message

● Implement a virtual MMS infrastructure

– Testing is done using fuzzing

  Collin Mulliner  Advanced Attacks Against PocketPC Phones   defcon­14

MMS User Agent Inputs

● New message notification (M­Notification.ind)

– Header fields

– Delivered via WAPPush (SMS)

● Message header (M­Retrieve.conf)

– Delivered via WAP/HTTP GET

● Message body (M­Retrieve.conf)

– MIME multipart

– Delivered via WAP/HTTP GET

  Collin Mulliner  Advanced Attacks Against PocketPC Phones   defcon­14

Sanitization in the MMS
Infrastructure

● MMS messages are sanitized by the MMS Relay

– Sanitization is performed during message submission

– Messages failing the checks are rejected

● Sanitization has to be avoided

– Vulnerabilities may not be exploitable if the message part used

to deliver the attack is sanitized

– Need to determine sanitization rules of MMS Relay

  Collin Mulliner  Advanced Attacks Against PocketPC Phones   defcon­14

Testing the Sanitization Rules

● Fuzzing­like testing procedure

– Test each message part to determine if it is affected by the

sanitization

● Findings:

– Message header is heavily sanitized

● Most header fields not usable for attacks

– Message body is not sanitized

● Body parts are suitable for attacks

  Collin Mulliner  Advanced Attacks Against PocketPC Phones   defcon­14

A Closer Look at MMS Delivery

● New Notification is sent to receiver as WAPPush via SMS

– Binary SMS from port 9200 to port 2948 (SMS ports!)

● PushRouter forwards WAPPush to MMS User Agent

– If content­type is: application/vnd.wap.mms­message

● MMS User Agent retrieves message via WAP/HTTP

– The message URL is part of the notification message

● PocketPC also accepts WAPPush via UDP port 2948

– Also on the wireless LAN interface!!!

  Collin Mulliner  Advanced Attacks Against PocketPC Phones   defcon­14

MMS New Message Notification

● Encapsulated in a WAPPush message

  Collin Mulliner  Advanced Attacks Against PocketPC Phones   defcon­14

Notification Attack

● Flood phone with notifications over WLAN (UDP:2948)

– Phone tries to dial­up GPRS to retrieve message

– New message “sound” is very annoying

● Sending hundreds of messages DoSs the phone

– Phone becomes slow (lots of memory is used)

● Messages fill up MMS inbox and filesystem

– Messages have to be deleted one by one

● It's not fun to delete +1000 messages

  Collin Mulliner  Advanced Attacks Against PocketPC Phones   defcon­14

Proof­of­Concept: NotiFlood

● PocketPC accepts notifications sent to broadcast address

– We don't even need to scan for devices!

● Each notification needs to be unique

– This means unique Transaction ID and ContentLocation

● PoC available online after presentation!

– http://www.mulliner.org/pocketpc/

  Collin Mulliner  Advanced Attacks Against PocketPC Phones   defcon­14

You have 1000 New Messages

  Collin Mulliner  Advanced Attacks Against PocketPC Phones   defcon­14

Fuzzing

● Feed target application half way valid input in order to find

bugs and exploitable vulnerabilities

– Fuzzing is highly effective with only access to application binary

● Fuzzing requires sending a lot of messages

– Sending thousands of messages is expensive

–  Use own MMS infrastructure for fuzzing

  Collin Mulliner  Advanced Attacks Against PocketPC Phones   defcon­14

Virtual MMS System

● MMS infrastructure

– MMS Relay/Server                  (Apache Web server)

– WAP Gateway                         (Kannel WAP Gateway)

– MMS Message Generator       (customized MMSLib)

● GSM infrastructure simulated using wireless LAN

– New message notification sent via UDP (port 2948)

● Configure User Agent to use virtual infrastructure

– WAP Gateway and MMS Relay and Server

  Collin Mulliner  Advanced Attacks Against PocketPC Phones   defcon­14

Fuzzing the User Agent

● Focused on triggering basic buffer overflows

– Mainly modified string length or replaced variable size binary

data with string

● The fuzzing process

– Attach debugger to tmail.exe

– Generate message and dump into directory accessible by

web server

– Send notification to phone

● Phone retrives message from web server

– Watch out for exceptions caught by the debugger

  Collin Mulliner  Advanced Attacks Against PocketPC Phones   defcon­14

MMS Message

● Message type is: M­Retrieve.conf

● Subject

● ContentLocation

– ~267 bytes  MMS Composer 1.5
– ~406 bytes  MMS Composer 2.0

– Non of these are exploitable for code injection

– NotiFlood now can also crash tmail.exe

● Actively prevent victim from using the Inbox application while using
wireless LAN (prevent reading and writing emails/SMSs/MMSs)

  Collin Mulliner  Advanced Attacks Against PocketPC Phones   defcon­14

Bugs Found 2/3

● M­Retrieve.conf (header)

– Buffer overflows in parsers for:

● Subject (crash only; non­exploitable)

● Content­Type (overwrites return address; potentially exploitable)

● Start­info parameter of Content­Type (non­exploitable)

  Collin Mulliner  Advanced Attacks Against PocketPC Phones   defcon­14

Bugs Found 3/3

● M­Retrieve.conf (body ­ in the Multipart Entry Header)

– Buffer overflows in parsers for:

● Content­Type

● Content­ID

● ContentLocation

– All are string length based bugs (replace fields with long string)

– All allow overwriting the return address (potentially exploitable)

● M­Retrieve.conf bugs are not exploitable in the real­world

due to sanitization by MMS infrastructure

–  Avoid sanitization through running our own MMS Server

Rogue MMS Server

● Use setup like the Virtual MMS System

● Send notification via SMS to target devices

– ContentLocation in notification points to rogue MMS Server

● Unfortunately not possible with mobile phone service

provider that operates closed WAP Gateway

– Tested major US and German mobile phone service providers,

they block this!

– Test your service provider!

  Collin Mulliner  Advanced Attacks Against PocketPC Phones   defcon­14

SMIL

● Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language

– XML­based presentation language

– Specifies how MMS content is displayed to user

– Basically the HTML for MMS

● SMIL files are transported in the message body and

therefore are not sanitized

–  Perfect attack vector!

SMIL Parser Vulnerabilities

● REGION tag, buffer overflow for ID parameter

– Exploitable (can be used to overwrite return address)

● TEXT tag, buffer overflow for REGION parameter

– Exploitable (can be used to overwrite return address)

● In both cases the content enclosed by double­quotes is

just copied to a stack based variable

– Probably the same parser code for both tags

Building an MMS User Agent

● We need our own User Agent in order to send exploit to

target device

● The User Agent basically is:

– Message generator (based on MMSLib)

– WAP Client to send message (based on JWAP)

● MMS Message type to send is: M­Send.req

● Use mobile phone for GPRS dial­up

– MMS Relay is not reachable from the Internet or is on private

IP­range

  Collin Mulliner  Advanced Attacks Against PocketPC Phones   defcon­14

MMS / SMIL Exploit (0­day)

● The first mobile phone remote code execution exploit

– MMS as the attack vector

● Real code injection/execution

– User only needs to view the message to trigger exploit

● WindowsCE exploit complications apply

– Return address guessing is tricky ...but works!

Exploit Details

● Return address and stack size

– i­mate PDA2k

● Return address 0x??05EE40 (??  slot address prefix)

● Stack size 400 bytes

– iPAQ h6315

● Return address 0x??05EE9C

● Stack size 300 bytes

● Common slots used by tmail.exe: 14, 16, 20, 24

● Have fun!!!

– Don't try this at home

  Collin Mulliner  Advanced Attacks Against PocketPC Phones   defcon­14

Vendors have been Notified

● Microsoft and CompanyX (the manufacturer of MMS

Composer) have been notified in advanced

– Both companys showed that they take this seriously

● I was told that a security fix should be available within the

next weeks

– “The OEMs just need to test it before they can release it”

  Collin Mulliner  Advanced Attacks Against PocketPC Phones   defcon­14

Defense

● WLAN notification flooding denial­of­service

– Packet filter / firewall on phone

● MMS message based attacks (the SMIL exploit)

– IDS / “Anti­Virus” on phone

– Mobile phone service provider based IDS / “Anti­Virus”

● General SMS/MMS Service Provider Measures

– Filter binary SMS that carry MMS M­Notification.ind

● Install firmware updates when available!!!

Conclusions

● Security analysis of smart phones is more complicated

– One has to deal with the service infrastructure

– One application two attack vectors

● WiFi  MMS User Agent  SMS/MMS

● Found +10 bugs in the PocketPC MMS implementation

– Full advisory will be published soon after defcon

● First code injection against a mobile/smart phone

– Stuff like this will become a major problem in the future!

  Collin Mulliner  Advanced Attacks Against PocketPC Phones   defcon­14

Future Work

● Look at other parts of MMS messages

– Especially the multimedia content should be interesting

● Attack WindowsCE 5.0 devices

– They are supposed to be “super secure”

● Find bugs in other MMS User Agents

– Symbian, PalmOS, Linux

● Abuse/attack the MMS Infrastructure

– Highly complex system ...many different protocols to play with
