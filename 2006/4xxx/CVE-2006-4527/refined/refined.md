Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2006-4527:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Multiple vulnerabilities including XSS (Cross-Site Scripting), file inclusion, and SQL injection were identified in CubeCart versions up to 3.0.12. The SQL injection vulnerability is specifically noted to occur on servers with Register Globals set to 'On'.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
- File inclusion: Allows an attacker to include external files, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
- SQL injection: Allows an attacker to manipulate SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized access.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- XSS: Could lead to user session hijacking, data theft, and defacement of websites.
- File inclusion:  Could lead to arbitrary code execution on the server.
- SQL injection: Could lead to unauthorized access to data, data modification, or denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- The provided content does not specify the exact attack vectors, but the vulnerabilities suggest:
    - XSS: Malicious code injected via user input or by manipulating parts of the application.
    - File inclusion: Manipulating parameters to include malicious files from the local or remote system.
    - SQL injection: Crafting malicious SQL queries via input fields or application parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attackers would need to be able to inject malicious input into the CubeCart application through various methods (e.g. via URL parameters, form inputs, etc.)
- For SQL injection vulnerability on servers with 'Register Globals On', attackers might need the ability to control PHP variables.
- For file inclusion vulnerabilities, the attacker needs to find a way to inject a path to malicious code.

**Additional notes:**
- A security patch was released on August 28, 2006, to address these vulnerabilities in versions up to 3.0.12.
-  CubeCart version 3.0.13 was planned to be released with the patch along with other minor changes but was delayed for a third party security audit.
- The patch was released within hours of the vulnerability report.
