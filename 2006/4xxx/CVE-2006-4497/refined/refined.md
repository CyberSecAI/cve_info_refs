Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The "comment" parameter in `comments.php` is not properly sanitized, allowing injection of arbitrary HTML or JavaScript.
*   **SQL Injection:** The "id" parameter in `comments.php` is not properly sanitized before being used in an SQL query, allowing injection of arbitrary SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **XSS vulnerability:** Insufficient input sanitization when processing the "comment" parameter.
*   **SQL Injection vulnerability:** Lack of sanitization or parameterized queries for the "id" parameter, leading to direct injection into SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **XSS:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the application, potentially leading to:
    *   Stealing user cookies or session tokens.
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Defacing the website.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user.
*   **SQL Injection:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to:
    *   Data breaches (accessing sensitive information).
    *   Data modification or deletion.
    *   Privilege escalation.
    *   Denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **XSS:**  By submitting a crafted comment containing malicious HTML or JavaScript code to `comments.php` through the "comment" parameter.
*   **SQL Injection:** By manipulating the "id" parameter in the URL when accessing `comments.php` with crafted SQL code. For example: `comments.php?id=[SQL Query]`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to submit comments to the website's comment section or directly craft a URL.
*   No authentication is required to exploit these vulnerabilities.
*   The attacker can be remote (no local access is required).

**Additional Details:**

*   The report mentions the software affected is IwebNegar v1.1.
*   The severity is rated as "Medium," with a CVSS base score of 7.5, exploitability subscore of 10, and an impact subscore of 6.4.
*   The exploit range is remote, attack complexity is low and no authentication is required.
*   The impact is partial for confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
