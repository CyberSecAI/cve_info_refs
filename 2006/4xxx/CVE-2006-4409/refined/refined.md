Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2006-4409

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The Apple Mac OS X Security Framework's Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) service fails to properly retrieve certificate revocation lists when the system is configured to use an HTTP proxy.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   The OCSP service does not use system proxy settings, preventing it from retrieving revocation lists when a proxy is configured.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Use of revoked certificates is possible, as the OCSP service cannot verify certificate status, this could result in attackers being able to impersonate the revoked certificates.
*   The full impact depends on the specific application using the certificate for verification, however, it is likely this will cause a security breach.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   An attacker could potentially use a revoked certificate to impersonate a legitimate entity since OCSP would not flag it as revoked.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to obtain a revoked certificate and use it to impersonate the legitimate certificate holder on a system relying on OCSP to confirm certificate validity. The attacker would likely also need to be positioned to leverage a MITM attack.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is specific to systems using an HTTP proxy.
*   The issue is addressed in Apple Security Update 2006-007.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Timothy J. Miller of the MITRE Corporation.
