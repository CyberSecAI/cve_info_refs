{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization in the 'cache_forum' option within the administrative settings. The application allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary PHP code through this option.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Remote Code Execution",
      "Insufficient input sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise, data theft, and denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack is performed via HTTP POST requests to the 'admin/save_opt.php' script with a specially crafted 'cache_forum' parameter. Once the malicious code is written to the configuration, it is executed through a GET request to the 'info_options.php' with a 'cmd' parameter.",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker requires administrative privileges to access the settings page. The attacker has to authenticate using valid admin credentials."
