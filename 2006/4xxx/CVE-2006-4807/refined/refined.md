  "CVE-2006-4807": {
    "relevant_content": true,
    "summary": "Multiple buffer overflows and an out-of-bounds memory read vulnerability were discovered in imlib2, an image manipulation library. These vulnerabilities can be triggered by processing specially crafted image files.",
    "details": [
      {
        "type": "root_cause",
        "description": "The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of image file formats (ARGB, JPG, LBM, PNG, PNM, TGA, and TIFF) within the imlib2 library."

        "type": "vulnerability",
        "description": "Multiple buffer overflows in `loader_argb.c`, `loader_png.c`, `loader_lbm.c`, `loader_jpeg.c`, `loader_tiff.c`, `loader_tga.c`, `loader_pnm.c` and an out-of-bounds memory read access in `loader_tga.c`."

       {
        "type": "impact",
        "description": "Successful exploitation of these flaws can lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the application that uses the imlib2 library, or a Denial of Service."

        "type": "attack_vector",
         "description": "An attacker can entice a user to open or process a specially crafted image file (JPG, ARGB, PNG, LBM, PNM, TIFF, or TGA) using an application that utilizes the imlib2 library. This could be through a website, email attachment, or other means of delivering the malicious file."

      {
        "type": "attacker_capabilities",
        "description": "The attacker needs to create a malicious image file and be able to deliver it to the victim's machine so they can process it via a vulnerable application."
