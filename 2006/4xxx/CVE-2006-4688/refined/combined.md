**Security Update Replacement:** This bulletin replaces a prior security update. See the frequently asked questions (FAQ) section of this bulletin for the complete list.

**Caveats:** None.

**Tested Software and Security Update Download Locations:**

**Affected Software:**

* Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 4 â [Download the update](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=3cf0b0d1-ff07-40ac-a6ac-44dc4a54f91e)
* Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 2 â [Download the update](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=2f54258f-1071-467b-80a2-e4dbfc050667)
* Microsoft Windows Server 2003 and Microsoft Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 â [Download the update](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=f23574f7-4033-45ac-8ad8-6cced2ee9285)

The software in this list has been tested to determine whether the versions are affected. Other versions either no longer include security update support or may not be affected. To determine the support life cycle for your product and version, visit the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742).

### General Information

## Executive Summary

**Executive Summary:**

This update resolves several newly discovered, privately reported vulnerabilities. Each vulnerability is documented in its own subsection in the "Vulnerability Details" section of this bulletin.

The Client Service for NetWare is also called the Gateway Service for NetWare on Windows 2000 Server.

On vulnerable versions of Microsoft Windows, an attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could remotely take complete control of the client workstation. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

We recommend that customers apply the update at the earliest opportunity.

**Severity Ratings and Vulnerability Identifiers:**

| Vulnerability Identifiers | Impact of Vulnerability | Windows 2000 Service Pack 4 | Windows XP Professional Service Pack 2 | Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Microsoft Client Service for NetWare Memory Corruption Vulnerability - [CVE-2006-4688](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2006-4688) | Remote Code Execution | Important | Important | Moderate |
| NetWare Driver Denial of Service Vulnerability - [CVE-2006-4689](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2006-4689) | Denial of Service | Moderate | Moderate | Low |
| **Aggregate Severity of All Vulnerabilities** |  | **Important** | **Important** | **Moderate** |

This [assessment](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21140) is based on the types of systems that are affected by the vulnerability, their typical deployment patterns, and the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would have on them.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update

* On Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 an attacker would need to be an authenticated user with valid logon credentials in order to successfully carry out an attack on an affected system.
* For customers who require the affected component firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.
* By default, the Client Service for NetWare is not installed on any affected operating system version. Only customers who install this service are likely to be vulnerable to this issue.

#### Workarounds for Client Service for NetWare Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2006-4688:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. Although these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

**Note** CSNW is commonly associated with the Internetwork Packet Exchange (IPX) and Sequenced Packet Exchange (SPX) protocols. However, CSNW could be exploited by using any installed protocol. Because TCP/IP is the most commonly used protocol, the following workarounds are based on TCP/IP. If protocols such as IPX and SPX are being used, you should also block the appropriate ports for those protocols. For more information about IPX and SPX, visit this site.

# Filter Actions

* Article
* 11/17/2009
## In this article

Applies To: Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2

A filter action defines the security requirements for the data transmission. Filter actions can be defined when you create a policy or before you create a policy. Filter lists are available to any policy. To define a filter list, right-click the IP Security Policy node and select **Manage filter lists and filter actions**.

A filter action can be configured to:

## Permit traffic

IPsec passes this traffic to and from the TCP/IP driver without modification or the requirement for security. This is appropriate for traffic from computers that are not IPsec-capable. Be sure to limit the IP filter list to a minimal scope when using this type of filter action, so that you do not permit traffic that should be secured.

Consider allowing ICMP traffic for troubleshooting purposes. You might also need to allow a computer that is not in your domain (for example, a consultant's computer) access to another computer in your domain. You can use the permit filter action to allow this access.

Important

The permit filter action allows access without authentication, data integrity, or encryption. Anyone using a computer with the IP address specified in the filter list is given the access. All traffic between the computers is done in plaintext; no integrity checks are performed.

## Block traffic

IPsec silently discards blocked traffic. When using a blocking filter action, be sure to use an IP filter list that defines the correct scope of IP addresses. Using larger scopes increases the chance of blocking traffic between valid computers.

## Negotiate security

If you enable the **Accept unsecured communication, but always respond using IPSec** option, IPsec attempts to negotiate security associations (SAs) and the sending or receiving of IPsec-protected traffic. However, if the peer cannot use IPsec, the communication will be allowed without IPsec protection. After you choose this filter action, you can also configure the following:

* Security methods and their order. This list of methods defines in which order the methods will be attempted. The first successful method will be used and the remaining methods will not be attempted. Typically, the list should be ordered from highest security to lowest security, so that the most secure method is used.
* Acceptance of initial incoming unsecured traffic (**Accept unsecured communication, but always respond using IPSec**). IPsec allows an incoming packet that matches the configured filter list to be unsecured (that is, not protected by IPsec). However, the outgoing response to the incoming packet must be protected. This setting is useful when you are using the default response rule for clients. When a group of servers are configured with a rule that secures communications with any IP address and accepts unsecured communication, responding with only secured communications, enabling the default response rule on client computers ensures that the clients will respond to the server request to negotiate security. To prevent denial-of-service attacks, this option should be disabled for secure computers connected to the Internet.
* Enabling of communication with non-IPsec-enabled computers (**Allow unsecured communication if a secure connection cannot be established**). IPsec falls back to unsecured communication, if necessary. Again, you should limit the IP filter list to a minimal scope. Otherwise, if negotiation fails for any reason, any communications affected by the rule in which this filter action resides could result in data being sent without security. If you are concerned about unsecured communication, you might consider disabling these settings. However, communication with computers that cannot initiate IPsec, such as legacy systems, might be blocked. To prevent denial-of-service attacks, this option should be disabled for secure computers connected to the Internet.
* Generation of quick mode session keys from new main mode keying material (**Session key perfect forward secrecy (PFS)**). Enabling session key PFS ensures that main mode master keying material cannot be used to derive more than one quick mode session key. When quick mode PFS is enabled, a new Diffie-Hellman key exchange is performed to generate new main mode master keying material before the new quick mode key is created. Session key (quick mode) PFS does not require main mode reauthentication and uses fewer resources than master key (main mode) PFS.

## IPsec security methods

Each security method defines the security requirements of any communications to which the associated rule applies. Creating multiple security methods increases the chance that a common method can be found between two computers. The Internet Key Exchange (IKE) component reads the list of security methods in descending order and sends a list of allowed security methods to the other peer. The first method in common is selected. Typically, the most secure methods appear at the top of the list; the least secure methods appear at the bottom of the list.

### Predefined security methods

The following security methods are predefined:

#### Encryption and Integrity

Uses the ESP protocol to provide data confidentiality (encryption) with the triple Data Encryption Standard (3DES) algorithm, data integrity and authentication with the Secure Hash Algorithm 1 (SHA1) integrity algorithm, and default key lifetimes (100 megabytes (MB), 1 hour). If you require both data and addressing (IP header) protection, you can create a custom security method. If you do not require encryption, use Integrity only.

#### Integrity only

Uses the ESP protocol to provide data integrity and authentication with the SHA1 integrity algorithm and default key lifetimes (100 MB, 1 hour). In this configuration, ESP does not provide data confidentiality (encryption).

#### Custom security methods

If the predefined Encryption and Integrity or Integrity only settings do not meet your security requirements, you can specify custom security methods. For example, you can use custom methods when encryption and address integrity, stronger algorithms, or key lifetimes must be specified. When configuring a custom security method, you can configure the following:

##### Security protocols

Both AH (data and address integrity without encryption) and ESP (data integrity and encryption) can be enabled in a custom security method when you require IP header integrity and data encryption. If you chose to enable both, you do not need to specify an integrity algorithm for ESP.

Note

The AH protocol cannot be used over network address translation (NAT) devices because it uses a hash of the header. NAT devices alter the header, so the packet will not authenticate properly.

##### Integrity algorithm

Message Digest 5 (MD5), which uses a 128-bit key. This algorithm is no longer considered secure and should be used only when interoperability requires its use.

SHA1, which uses a 160-bit key. SHA1 is a stronger hash than MD5 and is compliant with the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS).

##### Encryption algorithm

3DES is the most secure of the DES combinations and somewhat slower in performance. 3DES processes each block three times, using three unique 56-bit keys.

DES uses a single 56-bit key and is used when the higher security and overhead of 3DES is not required. This algorithm is no longer considered secure and should only be used when interoperability requires it.

Session key (quick mode) settings determine when, not how, a new key is generated. You can specify a lifetime in kilobytes (KB), seconds, or both. For example, if the communication takes 10,000 seconds and you specify the key lifetime as 1000 seconds, 10 keys will be generated to complete the transfer. This ensures that, even if an attacker manages to determine one session key and decipher part of a communication, the attacker cannot decipher the entire communication. By default, new quick mode keys are generated for every 100 MB of data or every hour. Any time a key lifetime is reached, the SA, in addition to the key refresh or regeneration, is also renegotiated.
