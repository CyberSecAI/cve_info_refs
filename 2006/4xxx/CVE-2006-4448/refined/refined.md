{
  "cve": "CVE-2006-4448",
  "description": "Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in interact 2.2, when register_globals is enabled, allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the (1) CONFIG[BASE_PATH] parameter in (a) admin/autoprompter.php and (b) includes/common.inc.php, and the (2) CONFIG[LANGUAGE_CPATH] parameter in (c) admin/autoprompter.php.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application uses user-supplied input (`CONFIG[BASE_PATH]`, `CONFIG[LANGUAGE_CPATH]`) in `require_once` statements without proper sanitization.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)",
      "Unsanitized user input",
       "Use of `register_globals`"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary PHP code execution on the server, leading to potential complete compromise of the application and server.",
    "attack_vectors": "HTTP GET requests with a malicious URL provided in the `CONFIG[BASE_PATH]` or `CONFIG[LANGUAGE_CPATH]` parameter.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. The `register_globals` setting in PHP must be enabled for the vulnerability to be exploitable."
  },
  "affected_software": {
    "name": "Interact learning community environment",
    "version": "2.2"
  },
  "fix_details": "The provided code snippets show how the vulnerability is fixed by using a static path (`../local/config.inc.php`) rather than relying on the user-supplied `CONFIG['BASE_PATH']` variable."
