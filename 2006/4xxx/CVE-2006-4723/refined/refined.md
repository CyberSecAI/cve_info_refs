  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2006-4723",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `check.php` script within the `/raidenhttpd-admin/slice` directory of RaidenHTTPD 1.1.49. The script includes a file based on the `$SoftParserFileXml` variable without proper initialization, allowing an attacker to specify an arbitrary local file or remote URL. Additionally, `register_globals` and `allow_url_fopen` are enabled by default in the PHP configuration.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Uninitialized variable leading to arbitrary file inclusion",
        "Insecure PHP configuration (register_globals and allow_url_fopen enabled)"
      ],
      "impact": "Remote code execution via inclusion of attacker-controlled PHP code.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "HTTP POST request to `/raidenhttpd-admin/slice/check.php`",
        "Specifying the malicious PHP code through the `SoftParserFileXml` parameter."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the server. No authentication is needed, as the vulnerability exists within an unauthenticated part of the application."
