    "description": "The provided content describes a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability in OPENi-CMS version 1.0.1beta, as specified in CVE-2006-4750.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `fileloader.php` script where the `$config['openi_dir']` variable is directly used in `include_once` statements without proper sanitization or validation.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)",
        "Lack of input validation",
        "Unsafe use of include function"
      ],
       "impact": "An attacker can include arbitrary remote files, leading to potential execution of malicious code on the server. This can lead to full compromise of the web application and the underlying system.",
      "attack_vectors": "An attacker can exploit this by crafting a malicious URL and injecting an external URL into the `config[openi_dir]` parameter.",
       "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and have a reachable server hosting the malicious file."
    },
    "additional_notes": "The exploit details provided in the Exploit-DB entry clearly show how to inject an arbitrary URL into the `config[openi_dir]` parameter, leading to the inclusion of a remote file. The affected lines of code are: `include_once($config[\"openi_dir\"].\"/base/constants.php\");`, `include_once($config[\"openi_dir\"].\"/base/db_classes.php\");`, and `include_once($config[\"openi_dir\"].\"/base/site_classes.php\");`"
