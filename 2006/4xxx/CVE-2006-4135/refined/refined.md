- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a potential misconfiguration of the `$calpath` variable in the `cal_config.inc.php` file of Calendarix. While the default code initializes `$calpath` to a constant value derived from the script's directory, the developer's comment suggests the possibility of manually hardcoding the variable. If a user were to modify this line to accept an external input, such as one through a GET request, and overwrite the variable before the vulnerable `require` statement, it could be exploited for remote file inclusion (RFI).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is a remote file inclusion (RFI) vulnerability if the `$calpath` variable is externally modifiable, allowing an attacker to include arbitrary files from a remote server, which would then be executed in the vulnerable server's environment. 
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
- **Attack vectors:**  The attack vector would be through manipulating an externally accessible input that would overwrite the `$calpath` variable within `cal_config.inc.php` before the vulnerable `require` statement. 
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need to identify a way to control the value of `$calpath` before it is used by a vulnerable `require` statement. This would require the vulnerable application be configured such that `$calpath` could be overwritten with an externally controlled value.
