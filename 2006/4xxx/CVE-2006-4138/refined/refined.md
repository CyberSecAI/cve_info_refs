{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists due to the way Microsoft Help (WINHLP32.EXE) handles Microsoft Windows Help files (*.HLP). Specifically, the 'RegisterRoutine' macro allows referencing exports from any DLL, enabling the execution of arbitrary code.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The use of a powerful scripting language within HLP files, specifically the 'RegisterRoutine' macro, enables execution of arbitrary code via DLL exports.",
      "Lack of user warning or validation prior to macro execution.",
	  "The software uses an old and dangerous format for documentation."
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to take complete control of the affected system, leading to remote code execution and denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Placing a specially crafted help file on a webpage.",
      "Sending the file as an attachment in an e-mail."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a malicious .HLP file that utilizes the 'RegisterRoutine' macro with a DLL export to trigger the vulnerability. No user interaction is required beyond opening the malicious .HLP file."
  },
  "additional_notes": [
        "The vulnerability was tested on Windows XP SP2, but it is suspected that all versions of Windows are affected." ,
		"The provided proof-of-concept files are available at a given URL."
