Hi,
Nobody should open an untrusted .HLP file.
An HLP file is the most similar to an executable but not being one,
mainly due to its powerful scripting language.
One of the documented macros documented and supported by this format is
"RegisterRoutine". Using this macro we can reference any Export of any Dll.
Example:
[CONFIG]
RegisterRoutine("Kernel32.dll", "Beep", "UU")
so the function can be used as a Macro within the WinHelp project
{uldb Do Beep}{v !Beep(750, 5000)}
The user wont see any warning previously the execution of this macro.
I wonder why Microsoft and a lot of vendors are still using this
old-and-dangerous format for providing documentation.
Greets,
Rubn.
