  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The application stores user passwords in a .dat file (members.dat) without proper protection, such as restricting access using .htaccess.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information",
      "Lack of Access Control"

    "impact": "Exposure of user passwords, potentially leading to unauthorized access to user accounts and related information.",

    "exploit": {
      "code": "A Perl script is provided that fetches the 'members.dat' file and extracts usernames and password hashes.",
      "steps": "The provided Perl script, when executed, sends an HTTP GET request to fetch the members.dat file.  It parses the content, extracting usernames and their corresponding MD5 password hashes, and then prints them to the standard output."
