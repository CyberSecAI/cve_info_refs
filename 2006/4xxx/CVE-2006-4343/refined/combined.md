More details about these issues may be found in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database:    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-2937   http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-3738   http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-2940   http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4343  Here are the details from the Slackware 10.2 ChangeLog: +--------------------------+ patches/packages/openssl-0.9.7l-i486-1_slack10.2.tgz:   Upgraded to shared libraries from openssl-0.9.7l.   See openssl package update below.   (* Security fix *) patches/packages/openssl-0.9.7l-i486-1_slack10.2.tgz:   Upgraded to openssl-0.9.7l.   This fixes a few security related issues:       During the parsing of certain invalid ASN.1 structures an error     condition is mishandled.  This can result in an infinite loop which     consumes system memory (CVE-2006-2937).  (This issue did not affect     OpenSSL versions prior to 0.9.7)     Thanks to Dr S. N. Henson of Open Network Security and NISCC.       Certain types of public key can take disproportionate amounts of     time to process. This could be used by an attacker in a denial of     service attack (CVE-2006-2940).     Thanks to Dr S. N. Henson of Open Network Security and NISCC.       A buffer overflow was discovered in the SSL_get_shared_ciphers()     utility function.  An attacker could send a list of ciphers to an     application that uses this function and overrun a buffer.     (CVE-2006-3738)     Thanks to Tavis Ormandy and Will Drewry of the Google Security Team.       A flaw in the SSLv2 client code was discovered. When a client     application used OpenSSL to create an SSLv2 connection to a malicious     server, that server could cause the client to crash (CVE-2006-4343).     Thanks to Tavis Ormandy and Will Drewry of the Google Security Team.   Links to the CVE entries will be found here:     http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-2937     http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-3738     http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-2940     http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4343   (* Security fix *) +--------------------------+   Where to find the new packages: +-----------------------------+  HINT:  Getting slow download speeds from ftp.slackware.com? Give slackware.osuosl.org a try.  This is another primary FTP site for Slackware that can be considerably faster than downloading from ftp.slackware.com.  Thanks to the friendly folks at the OSU Open Source Lab (http://osuosl.org) for donating additional FTP and rsync hosting to the Slackware project!  :-)  Also see the "Get Slack" section on http://slackware.com for additional mirror sites near you.

## SUSE Security

# A Process That Never Ends

### SUSE is committed to delivering best effort security to its customers and to the Open Source community. We believe that trust in Open Source Software security in general, and the user's privacy in particular, are both indispensable and indefeasible.

We treat software security as a process that never ends. This means we:

* Promptly react to security incidents and deliver premium quality security updates
* Continuously improve the security-related functionality in SUSE products
* Continuously contribute to the rapidly growing maturity of Open Source Software
* Respect the Open Source Software security principles of openness, transparency and traceability

Software security is a complex challenge. Software can provide many of its own security features, such as authentication methods, encryption, intrusion prevention and detection, and backup.

At the same time, it can also contain errors (both deliberate and accidental) that can affect the system's security, including design flaws, programming errors, and backdoors.

The SUSE Security Team addresses all of these aspects of software security, on an ongoing basis. Software security cannot be thought of as a state you can achieve at a specific point in time. Instead, it is a process that must be executed with professional expertise and continuous development. This persistent focus is what has given Open Source Software, Linux and SUSE such an excellent reputation for security.

# OpenSSL: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200610-11**

OpenSSL contains multiple vulnerabilities including the possible remote
execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-libs/openssl** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.9.8d** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.9.8d**revision >= **0.9.7l** |

### Background

OpenSSL is a toolkit implementing the Secure Sockets Layer, Transport
Layer Security protocols and a general-purpose cryptography library.

### Description

Tavis Ormandy and Will Drewry, both of the Google Security Team,
discovered that the SSL\_get\_shared\_ciphers() function contains a buffer
overflow vulnerability, and that the SSLv2 client code contains a flaw
leading to a crash. Additionally Dr. Stephen N. Henson found that the
ASN.1 handler contains two Denial of Service vulnerabilities: while
parsing an invalid ASN.1 structure and while handling certain types of
public key.

### Impact

An attacker could trigger the buffer overflow vulnerability by sending
a malicious suite of ciphers to an application using the vulnerable
function, and thus execute arbitrary code with the rights of the user
running the application. An attacker could also consume CPU and/or
memory by exploiting the Denial of Service vulnerabilities. Finally a
malicious server could crash a SSLv2 client through the SSLv2
vulnerability.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All OpenSSL 0.9.8 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/openssl-0.9.8d"
```

All OpenSSL 0.9.7 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/openssl-0.9.7l"
```

## OpenSSL SSLv2 client code fails to properly check for NULL

#### Vulnerability Note VU#386964

Original Release Date: 2006-09-28 | Last Revised: 2011-07-22

---

### Overview

A flaw in the OpenSSL library could allow a remote attacker to cause a denial of service on an affected application.

### Description

| The [OpenSSL](http://www.openssl.org/) toolkit implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL versions 2 and 3) and Transport Layer Security (TLS version 1) protocols as well as a general purpose cryptographic library. A missing check for NULL exists in the SSLv2 client get\_server\_hello() function. As a result, an affected client application using OpenSSL to create an SSLv2 connection to a malicious server could be caused to crash. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker could cause an affected client application to crash, creating a denial of service. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade or apply a patch from the vendor**  Patches have been released to address this issue. Please see the Systems Affected section of this document for more information.Users or redistributors who compile OpenSSL from the original source code distribution are encouraged to review [OpenSSL Security Advisory [28th September 2006]](http://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20060928.txt) and upgrade to the appropriate fixed version of the software. |

2) Solution or Work-Around

  There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.

3) Special Instructions and Notes

  Please close and restart all running instances of Mozilla, Firefox
  or Thunderbird after the update.

4) Package Location and Checksums

  The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
  Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
  automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
  Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
  and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
  announcement. Then install the packages using the command

    rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>

  to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
  downloaded RPM package.

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information

 - Announcement authenticity verification:

   SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
   sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
   guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
   security announcements are published with a valid signature.

   To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
   and run the command

     gpg --verify <file>

   replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
   announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:

     gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
     gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"

   where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.

   If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
   import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
   command

     gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc

 - Package authenticity verification:

   SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
   world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
   and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
   a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
   with.

   There are two verification methods that can be used independently from
   each other to prove the authenticity of a downloaded file or RPM package:

   1) Using the internal gpg signatures of the rpm package
   2) MD5 checksums as provided in this announcement

   1) The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
      authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command

       rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>

      to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
      filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
      contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.

      This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
      RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
      installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
      the end of this announcement.

   2) If you need an alternative means of verification, use the md5sum
      command to verify the authenticity of the packages. Execute the command

        md5sum <filename.rpm>

      after you downloaded the file from a SUSE FTP server or its mirrors.
      Then compare the resulting md5sum with the one that is listed in the
      SUSE security announcement. Because the announcement containing the
      checksums is cryptographically signed (by security@suse.de), the
      checksums show proof of the authenticity of the package if the
      signature of the announcement is valid. Note that the md5 sums
      published in the SUSE Security Announcements are valid for the
      respective packages only. Newer versions of these packages cannot be
      verified.

 - SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
   subscribe:

   suse-security@suse.com
       -   General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
           All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
           To subscribe, send an e-mail to
               <suse-security-subscribe@suse.com>.

   suse-security-announce@suse.com
       -   SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
           Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
           To subscribe, send an e-mail to
               <suse-security-announce-subscribe@suse.com>.

   For general information or the frequently asked questions (FAQ),
   send mail to <suse-security-info@suse.com> or
   <suse-security-faq@suse.com>.

Description:
    Previous versions of the openssl package are vulnerable to multiple
    attacks.  Three of the vulnerabilities are denials of service,
    but the other is a buffer overflow that is expected to create
    remote unauthorized access vulnerabilities in other applications.
    In particular, any connection that the mysql daemon will accept
    may be vulnerable.  In the default configuration of mysql, that
    would be a local unauthorized access vulnerability, but mysql can
    be configured to listen for network connections from remote hosts,
    which would then enable remote unauthorized access.  Any program
    that calls the SSL\_get\_shared\_ciphers() function may be vulnerable.

    29 September 2006 Update: The initial fix for this vulnerability was
    incomplete, and the fault in the fix could enable a Denial of Service
    attack in some cases of the attack described in CVE-2006-2940.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Debian Security Advisory DSA-1195-1                security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                         Noah Meyerhans
October 10, 2006
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : openssl096
Vulnerability  : denial of service (multiple)
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2006-2940 CVE-2006-3738 CVE-2006-4343

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in the OpenSSL
cryptographic software package that could allow an attacker to launch
a denial of service attack by exhausting system resources or crashing
processes on a victim's computer.

CVE-2006-3738
        Tavis Ormandy and Will Drewry of the Google Security Team
        discovered a buffer overflow in SSL_get_shared_ciphers utility
        function, used by some applications such as exim and mysql.  An
        attacker could send a list of ciphers that would overrun a
        buffer.

CVE-2006-4343
        Tavis Ormandy and Will Drewry of the Google Security Team
        discovered a possible DoS in the sslv2 client code.  Where a
        client application uses OpenSSL to make a SSLv2 connection to
        a malicious server that server could cause the client to
        crash.

CVE-2006-2940
        Dr S N Henson of the OpenSSL core team and Open Network
        Security recently developed an ASN1 test suite for NISCC
        (www.niscc.gov.uk). When the test suite was run against
        OpenSSL a DoS was discovered.

        Certain types of public key can take disproportionate amounts
        of time to process. This could be used by an attacker in a
        denial of service attack.

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.9.6m-1sarge4

This package exists only for compatibility with older software, and is
not present in the unstable or testing branches of Debian.

We recommend that you upgrade your openssl096 package.  Note that
services linking against the openssl shared libraries will need to be
restarted. Common examples of such services include most Mail
Transport Agents, SSH servers, and web servers.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Debian 3.1 (stable)
- -------------------

Stable updates are available for alpha, amd64, arm, hppa, i386, ia64, m68k, mips, mipsel, powerpc, s390 and sparc.

## SUSE Security

# A Process That Never Ends

### SUSE is committed to delivering best effort security to its customers and to the Open Source community. We believe that trust in Open Source Software security in general, and the user's privacy in particular, are both indispensable and indefeasible.

We treat software security as a process that never ends. This means we:

* Promptly react to security incidents and deliver premium quality security updates
* Continuously improve the security-related functionality in SUSE products
* Continuously contribute to the rapidly growing maturity of Open Source Software
* Respect the Open Source Software security principles of openness, transparency and traceability

Software security is a complex challenge. Software can provide many of its own security features, such as authentication methods, encryption, intrusion prevention and detection, and backup.

At the same time, it can also contain errors (both deliberate and accidental) that can affect the system's security, including design flaws, programming errors, and backdoors.

The SUSE Security Team addresses all of these aspects of software security, on an ongoing basis. Software security cannot be thought of as a state you can achieve at a specific point in time. Instead, it is a process that must be executed with professional expertise and continuous development. This persistent focus is what has given Open Source Software, Linux and SUSE such an excellent reputation for security.

openssl security update (RHSA-2006-0695)

Original Release Date: October 12, 2006

Last Revised: July 24, 2008

Number: ASA-2006-220

Risk Level: Medium

Advisory Version: 3.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

OpenSSL is an open source toolkit that implements the Secure Socket Layer
(SSL) versions 2 and 3 protocols, the Transport Layer Security (TLS) version
1 protocol as well as a general use cryptography library.

A buffer overflow vulnerability was found in vulnerable versions of OpenSSL's
SSL\_get\_shared\_ciphers() function. A malicious user could cause this
overflow condition by sending a specially crafted list of ciphers to
applications linked to OpenSSL that make use of this function. Few programs
are known to make use of this function and often times is only available when
programs are built with debugging symbols. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2006-3738](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-3738) to this issue.

OpenSSL's client code was found to contain a flaw when handling SSLv2
connections. A malicious server could possibly cause the client to crash
when negotiating a connection. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2006-4343](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4343) to this issue.

OpenSSL's ability to parse ASN.1 formatted data structures was found to
contain two Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerabilities. The first ASN.1 issue
related to parsing of particular public key types, which could take excessive
amounts of time to parse and cause a DoS. The second ASN.1 issue related to
trying to parse invalid ASN.1 data structures, which would lead to an
infinite loop condition consuming excessive amounts of system memory,
potentially creating a DoS. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names
[CVE-2006-2940](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-2940) and
[CVE-2006-2937](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-2937) respectively, to these issues.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security
advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2006-0695.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with openssl installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

**Recommended Actions:**
For all system products which use vulnerable
versions of openssl, Avaya recommends that customers restrict local and
network access to the server. This restriction should be enforced through the
use of physical security, firewalls, ACLs, VPNs, and other generally-accepted
networking practices until such time as an update becomes available and can
be installed.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating
system or applications that come with the operating system. These
vulnerabilities often do not impact the software-only product directly but
may threaten the integrity of the underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by
the vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be.
Customers should determine on which Linux operating system the product was
installed and then follow that vendors guidance:

## 4. Software-Only Products:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Interactive Response(IR) | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IR application. The IR application does not require the software described in this advisory. |
| CVLAN | All | Medium | See recommended actions below. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite(IMS) | All | Medium | See recommended actions below. |

**Recommended Actions:**
Avaya recommends that customers follow
recommended actions supplied by the Operating System vendor (e.g. RedHat
Linux).

## 5. Additional Information:

Additional information may also be available via the Avaya support
[website](http://support.avaya.com) and through your Avaya account

# AMD64 x86 emulation base libraries: OpenSSL multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200612-11**

OpenSSL contains multiple vulnerabilities including the possible execution
of remote arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-emulation/emul-linux-x86-baselibs** on the amd64 architecture |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.5.5** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.5.5** |

### Background

OpenSSL is a toolkit implementing the Secure Sockets Layer, Transport
Layer Security protocols and a general-purpose cryptography library.
The x86 emulation base libraries for AMD64 contain a vulnerable version
of OpenSSL.

### Description

Tavis Ormandy and Will Drewry, both of the Google Security Team,
discovered that the SSL\_get\_shared\_ciphers() function contains a buffer
overflow vulnerability, and that the SSLv2 client code contains a flaw
leading to a crash. Additionally, Dr. Stephen N. Henson found that the
ASN.1 handler contains two Denial of Service vulnerabilities: while
parsing an invalid ASN.1 structure and while handling certain types of
public key.

### Impact

An attacker could trigger the buffer overflow by sending a malicious
suite of ciphers to an application using the vulnerable function, and
thus execute arbitrary code with the rights of the user running the
application. An attacker could also consume CPU and/or memory by
exploiting the Denial of Service vulnerabilities. Finally, a malicious
server could crash a SSLv2 client through the SSLv2 vulnerability.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All AMD64 x86 emulation base libraries users should upgrade to the
latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-emulation/emul-linux-x86-baselibs-2.5.5"
```

OpenVPN Change Log
Copyright (C) 2002-2010 OpenVPN Technologies, Inc. <
 sales@openvpn.net

2010.11.09 -- Version 2.1.4

* Fix problem with special case route targets ('remote_host')
  The init_route() function will leave &netlist untouched for
  get_special_addr() routes ("remote_host" being one of them).
  netlist is on stack,  contains random garbage, and
  netlist.len will not be 0 - thus, random stack data is copied from
  netlist.data[] until the route_list is full.
  Thanks to Teodo MICU and Gert Doering for finding and fixing this issue.

2010.08.20 -- Version 2.1.3

* Windows build fixes
  Attempt to fix issue where domake-win build system was not properly
  signing drivers and .exe files.  This change is only affecting the
  Windows build scripts and not the OpenVPN code base.

2010.08.09 -- Version 2.1.2

* Windows security issue:
  Fixed potential local privilege escalation vulnerability in
  Windows service. The Windows service did not properly quote the
  executable filename passed to CreateService.  A local attacker
  with write access to the root directory C:\ could create an
  executable that would be run with the same privilege level as
  the OpenVPN Windows service.  However, since non-Administrative
  users normally lack write permission on C:\, this vulnerability
  is generally not exploitable except on older versions of Windows
  (such as Win2K) where the default permissions on C:\ would allow
  any user to create files there.
  Credit:  Scott Laurie, MWR InfoSecurity

* Added Python-based based alternative build system for Windows using
  Visual Studio 2008 (in win directory).

* When aborting in a non-graceful way, try to execute do_close_tun in
  init.c prior to daemon exit to ensure that the tun/tap interface is
  closed and any added routes are deleted.

* Fixed an issue where AUTH_FAILED was not being properly delivered
  to the client when a bad password is given for mid-session reauth,
  causing the connection to fail without an error indication.

* Don't advance to the next connection profile on AUTH_FAILED errors.

* Fixed an issue in the Management Interface that could cause
  a process hang with 100% CPU utilization in --management-client
  mode if the management interface client disconnected at the
  point where credentials are queried.

* Fixed an issue where if reneg-sec was set to 0 on the client,
  so that the server-side value would take precedence,
  the auth_deferred_expire_window function would incorrectly
  return a window period of 0 seconds.  In this case, the
  correct window period should be the handshake window
  period.

* Modified ">PASSWORD:Verification Failed" management interface
  notification to include a client reason string:

    >PASSWORD:Verification Failed: 'AUTH_TYPE' ['REASON_STRING']

* Enable exponential backoff in reliability layer
  retransmits.

* Set socket buffers (SO_SNDBUF and SO_RCVBUF) immediately after
  socket is created rather than waiting until after connect/listen.

* Management interface performance optimizations:

  1. Added env-filter MI command to perform filtering on env vars
     passed through as a part of --management-client-auth

  2. man_write will now try to aggregate output into larger blocks
     (up to 1024 bytes) for more efficient i/o

* Fixed minor issue in Windows TAP driver DEBUG builds
  where non-null-terminated unicode strings were being
  printed incorrectly.

* Fixed issue on Windows with MSVC compiler, where TCP_NODELAY support
  was not being compiled in.

* Proxy improvements:

  Improved the ability of http-auth "auto" flag to dynamically detect
  the auth method required by the proxy.

  Added http-auth "auto-nct" flag to reject weak proxy auth methods.

  Added HTTP proxy digest authentication method.

  Removed extraneous openvpn_sleep calls from proxy.c.

* Implemented http-proxy-override and http-proxy-fallback directives to make it
  easier for OpenVPN client UIs to start a pre-existing client config file with
  proxy options, or to adaptively fall back to a proxy connection if a direct
  connection fails.

* Implemented a key/value auth channel from client to server.

* Fixed issue where bad creds provided by the management interface
  for HTTP Proxy Basic Authentication would go into an infinite
  retry-fail loop instead of requerying the management interface for
  new creds.

* Added support for MSVC debugging of openvpn.exe in settings.in:

  # Build debugging version of openvpn.exe
  !define PRODUCT_OPENVPN_DEBUG

* Implemented multi-address DNS expansion on the network field of route
  commands.

  When only a single IP address is desired from a multi-address DNS
  expansion, use the first address rather than a random selection.

* Added --register-dns option for Windows.

  Fixed some issues on Windows with --log, subprocess creation
  for command execution, and stdout/stderr redirection.

* Fixed an issue where application payload transmissions on the
  TLS control channel (such as AUTH_FAILED) that occur during
  or immediately after a TLS renegotiation might be dropped.

* Added warning about tls-remote option in man page.

2009.12.11 -- Version 2.1.1

* Fixed some breakage in openvpn.spec (which is required to build an
  RPM distribution) where it was referencing a non-existent
  subdirectory in the tarball, causing it to fail (patch from
  David Sommerseth).

2009.12.11 -- Version 2.1.0

* Fixed a couple issues in sample plugins auth-pam.c and down-root.c.
  (1) Fail gracefully rather than segfault if calloc returns NULL.
  (2) The openvpn_plugin_abort_v1 function can potentially be called
  with handle == NULL.  Add code to detect this case, and if  so, avoid
  dereferencing pointers derived from handle  (Thanks to David
  Sommerseth for finding this bug).

* Documented "multihome" option in the man page.

2009.11.20 -- Version 2.1_rc22

* Fixed a client-side bug on Windows that occurred when the
  "dhcp-pre-release" or "dhcp-renew" options were combined with
  "route-gateway dhcp".  The release/renew would not occur
  because the Windows DHCP renew function is blocking and
  therefore must be called from another process or thread
  so as not to stall the tunnel.

* Added a hard failure when peer provides a certificate chain
  with depth > 16.  Previously, a warning was issued.

2009.11.12 -- Version 2.1_rc21

* Rebuilt OpenVPN Windows installer with OpenSSL 0.9.8l to address
  CVE-2009-3555.  Note that OpenVPN has never relied on the session
  renegotiation capabilities that are built into the SSL/TLS protocol,
  therefore the fix in OpenSSL 0.9.8l (disable SSL/TLS renegotiation
  completely) will not adversely affect OpenVPN mid-session SSL/TLS
  renegotation or any other OpenVPN capabilities.

* Added additional session renegotiation hardening.  OpenVPN has always
  required that mid-session renegotiations build up a new SSL/TLS
  session from scratch.  While the client certificate common name is
  already locked against changes in mid-session TLS renegotiations, we
  now extend this locking to the auth-user-pass username as well as all
  certificate content in the full client certificate chain.

2009.10.01 -- Version 2.1_rc20

* Fixed a bug introduced in 2.1_rc17 (svn r4436) where using the
  redirect-gateway option by itself, without any extra parameters,
  would cause the option to be ignored.

* Fixed build problem when ./configure --disable-server is used.

* Fixed ifconfig command for "topology subnet" on FreeBSD (Stefan Bethke).

* Added --remote-random-hostname option.

* Added "load-stats" management interface command to get global server
  load statistics.

* Added new ./configure flags:

  --disable-def-auth      Disable deferred authentication
  --disable-pf            Disable internal packet filter

* Added "setcon" directive for interoperability with SELinux (Sebastien
  Raveau).

* Optimized PUSH_REQUEST handshake sequence to shave several seconds
  off of a typical client connection initiation.

* The maximum number of "route" directives (specified in the config
  file or pulled from a server) can now be configured via the new
  "max-routes" directive.

* Eliminated the limitation on the number of options that can be pushed
  to clients, including routes.  Previously, all pushed options needed
  to fit within a 1024 byte options string.

* Added --server-poll-timeout option : when polling possible remote
  servers to connect to in a round-robin fashion, spend no more than
  n seconds waiting for a response before trying the next server.

* Added the ability for the server to provide a custom reason string
  when an AUTH_FAILED message is returned to the client.  This
  string can be set by the server-side managment interface and read
  by the client-side management interface.

* client-kill management interface command, when issued on server, will
  now send a RESTART message to client.
  This feature is intended to make UDP clients respond the same as TCP
  clients in the case where the server issues a RESTART message in
  order to force the client to reconnect and pull a new options/route
  list.

2009.07.16 -- Version 2.1_rc19

* In Windows TAP driver, refactor DHCP/ARP packet injection code to
  use a DPC (deferred procedure call) to defer packet injection until
  IRQL < DISPATCH_LEVEL, rather than calling NdisMEthIndicateReceive
  in the context of AdapterTransmit.  This is an attempt to reduce kernel
  stack usage, and prevent EXCEPTION_DOUBLE_FAULT BSODs that have been
  observed on Vista.  Updated TAP driver version number to 9.6.

* In configure.ac, use datadir instead of datarootdir for compatibility
  with <autoconf-2.60.

2009.06.07 -- Version 2.1_rc18

* Fixed compile error on ./configure --enable-small

* Fixed issue introduced in r4475 (2.1-rc17) where cryptoapi.c change
  does not build on Windows on non-MINGW32.

2009.05.30 -- Version 2.1_rc17

* Reduce the debug level (--verb) at which received management interface
  commands are echoed from 7 to 3.  Passwords will be filtered.

* Fixed race condition in management interface recv code on
  Windows, where sending a set of several commands to the
  management interface in quick succession might cause the
  latter commands in the set to be ignored.

* Increased management interface input command buffer size
  from 256 to 1024 bytes.

* Minor tweaks to Windows build system.

* Added "redirect-private" option which allows private subnets
  to be pushed to the client in such a way that they don't accidently
  obscure critical local addresses such as the DHCP server address and
  DNS server addresses.

* Added new 'autolocal' redirect-gateway flag.  When enabled, the OpenVPN
  client will examine the routing table and determine whether (a) the
  OpenVPN server is reachable via a locally connected interface, or (b)
  traffic to the server must be forwarded through the default router.
  Only add a special bypass route for the OpenVPN server if (b) is true.
  If (a) is true, behave as if the 'local' flag is specified, and do not
  add a bypass route.

  The new 'autolocal' flag depends on the non-portable test_local_addr()
  function in route.c, which is currently only implemented for Windows.
  The 'autolocal' flag will act as a no-op on platforms that have not
  yet defined a test_local_addr() function.

* Increased TLS_CHANNEL_BUF_SIZE to 2048 from 1024 (this will allow for
  more option content to be pushed from server to client).

* Raised D_MULTI_DROPPED debug level to 4 from 3 to filter out (at debug
  levels <=3) a common and usually innocuous warning.

* Fixed issue of symbol conflicts interfering with Windows CryptoAPI
  functionality (Alon Bar-Lev).

* Fixed bug where the remote_X environmental variables were not being
  set correctly when the 'local' option is specifed.

2009.05.17 -- Version 2.1_rc16

* Windows installer changes:

  1. ifdefed out the check Windows version code which is causing
  problems on Windows 7

  2. don't define SF_SELECTED if it is already defined

  3. Use LZMA instead of BZIP2 compression for better compression

  4. Upgraded OpenSSL to 0.9.8k

* Added the ability to read the configuration file
  from stdin, when "stdin" is given as the config
  file name.

* Allow "management-client" directive to be used
  with unix domain sockets.

* Added errors-to-stderr option.  When enabled, fatal errors
  that result in the termination of the daemon will be written
  to stderr.

* Added optional "nogw" (no gateway) flag to --server-bridge
  to inhibit the pushing of the route-gateway parameter to
  clients.

* Added new management interface command "pid" to show the
  process ID of the current OpenVPN process (Angelo Laub).

* Fixed issue where SIGUSR1 restarts would fail if private
  key was specified as an inline file.

* Added daemon_start_time and daemon_pid environmental variables.

* In management interface, added new ">CLIENT:ESTABLISHED" notification.

* Build fixes:

  1. Fixed some issues with C++ style comments that leaked into the code.

  2. Updated configure.ac to work on MinGW64.

  3. Updated common.h types for _WIN64.

  4. Fixed issue involving an #ifdef in a macro reference that breaks early gcc
     compilers.

  5. In cryptoapi.c, renamed CryptAcquireCertificatePrivateKey to
     OpenVPNCryptAcquireCertificatePrivateKey to work around
     a symbol conflict in MinGW-5.1.4.

2008.11.19 -- Version 2.1_rc15

* Fixed issue introduced in 2.1_rc14 that may cause a
  segfault when a --plugin module is used.

* Added server-side --opt-verify option: clients that connect
  with options that are incompatible with those of the server
  will be disconnected (without this option, incompatible
  clients would trigger a warning message in the server log
  but would not be disconnected).

* Added --tcp-nodelay option: Macro that sets TCP_NODELAY socket
  flag on the server as well as pushes it to connecting clients.

* Minor options check fix: --no-name-remapping is a
  server-only option and should therefore generate an
  error when used on the client.

* Added --prng option to control PRNG (pseudo-random
  number generator) parameters.  In previous OpenVPN
  versions, the PRNG was hardcoded to use the SHA1
  hash.  Now any OpenSSL hash may be used.  This is
  part of an effort to remove hardcoded references to
  a specific cipher or cryptographic hash algorithm.

* Cleaned up man page synopsis.

2008.11.16 -- Version 2.1_rc14

* Added AC_GNU_SOURCE to configure.ac to enable struct ucred,
  with the goal of fixing a build issue on Fedora 9 that was
  introduced in 2.1_rc13.

* Added additional method parameter to --script-security to preserve
  backward compatibility with system() call semantics used in OpenVPN
  2.1_rc8 and earlier.  To preserve backward compatibility use:

    script-security 3 system

* Added additional warning messages about --script-security 2
  or higher being required to execute user-defined scripts or
  executables.

* Windows build system changes:

  Modified Windows domake-win build system to write all openvpn.nsi
  input files to gen, so that gen can be disconnected from
  the rest of the source tree and makensis openvpn.nsi will
  still function correctly.

  Added additional SAMPCONF_(CA|CRT|KEY) macros to settings.in
  (commented out by default).

  Added optional files SAMPCONF_CONF2 (second sample configuration
  file) and SAMPCONF_DH (Diffie-Helman parameters) to Windows
  build system, and may be defined in settings.in.

* Extended Management Interface "bytecount" command
  to work when OpenVPN is running as a server.
  Documented Management Interface "bytecount" command in
  management/management-notes.txt.

* Fixed informational message in ssl.c to properly indicate
  deferred authentication.

* Added server-side --auth-user-pass-optional directive, to allow
  connections by clients that do not specify a username/password, when a
  user-defined authentication script/module is in place (via
  --auth-user-pass-verify, --management-client-auth, or a plugin module).

* Changes to easy-rsa/2.0/pkitool and related openssl.cnf:

  Calling scripts can set the KEY_NAME environmental variable to set
  the "name" X509 subject field in generated certificates.

  Modified pkitool to allow flexibility in separating the Common Name
  convention from the cert/key filename convention.

  For example:

  KEY_CN="James's Laptop" KEY_NAME="james" ./pkitool james

  will create a client certificate/key pair of james.crt/james.key
  having a Common Name of "James's Laptop" and a Name of "james".

* Added --no-name-remapping option to allow Common Name, X509 Subject,
  and username strings to include any printable character including
  space, but excluding control characters such as tab, newline, and
  carriage-return (this is important for compatibility with external
  authentication systems).

  As a related change, added --status-version 3 format (and "status 3"
  in the management interface) which uses the version 2 format except
  that tabs are used as delimiters instead of commas so that there
  is no ambiguity when parsing a Common Name that contains a comma.

  Also, save X509 Subject fields to environment, using the naming
  convention:

  X509_{cert_depth}_{name}={value}

  This is to avoid ambiguities when parsing out the X509 subject string
  since "/" characters could potentially be used in the common name.

* Fixed some ifconfig-pool issues that precluded it from being combined
  with --server directive.

  Now, for example, we can configure thusly:

    server 10.8.0.0 255.255.255.0 nopool
    ifconfig-pool 10.8.0.2 10.8.0.99 255.255.255.0

  to have ifconfig-pool manage only a subset
  of the VPN subnet.

* Added config file option "setenv FORWARD_COMPATIBLE 1" to relax
  config file syntax checking to allow directives for future OpenVPN
  versions to be ignored.

2008.10.07 -- Version 2.1_rc13

* Bundled OpenSSL 0.9.8i with Windows installer.

* Management interface can now listen on a unix
  domain socket, for example:

    management /tmp/openvpn unix

  Also added management-client-user and management-client-group
  directives to control which processes are allowed to connect
  to the socket.

* Copyright change to OpenVPN Technologies, Inc.

2008.09.23 -- Version 2.1_rc12

* Patched Makefile.am so that the new t_cltsrv-down.sh script becomes
  part of the tarball (Matthias Andree).

* Fixed --lladdr bug introduced in 2.1-rc9 where input validation code
  was incorrectly expecting the lladdr parameter to be an IP address
  when it is actually a MAC address (HoverHell).

2008.09.14 -- Version 2.1_rc11

* Fixed a bug that can cause SSL/TLS negotiations in UDP mode
  to fail if UDP packets are dropped.

2008.09.10 -- Version 2.1_rc10

* Added "--server-bridge" (without parameters) to enable
  DHCP proxy mode:  Configure server mode for ethernet
  bridging using a DHCP-proxy, where clients talk to the
  OpenVPN server-side DHCP server to receive their IP address
  allocation and DNS server addresses.

* Added "--route-gateway dhcp", to enable the extraction
  of the gateway address from a DHCP negotiation with the
  OpenVPN server-side LAN.

* Fixed minor issue with --redirect-gateway bypass-dhcp or bypass-dns
  on Windows.  If the bypass IP address is 0.0.0.0 or 255.255.255.255,
  ignore it.

* Warn when ethernet bridging that the IP address of the bridge adapter
  is probably not the same address that the LAN adapter was set to
  previously.

* When running as a server, warn if the LAN network address is
  the all-popular 192.168.[0|1].x, since this condition commonly
  leads to subnet conflicts down the road.

* Primarily on the client, check for subnet conflicts between
  the local LAN and the VPN subnet.

* Added a 'netmask' parameter to get_default_gateway, to return
  the netmask of the adapter containing the default gateway.
  Only implemented on Windows so far.  Other platforms will
  return 255.255.255.0.  Currently the netmask information is
  only used to warn about subnet conflicts.

* Minor fix to cryptoapi.c to not compile itself unless USE_CRYPTO
  and USE_SSL flags are enabled (Alon Bar-Lev).

* Updated openvpn/t_cltsrv.sh (used by "make check") to conform to new
  --script-security rules.  Also adds retrying if the addresses are in
  use (Matthias Andree).

* Fixed build issue with ./configure --disable-socks --disable-http.

* Fixed separate compile errors in options.c and ntlm.c that occur
  on strict C compilers (such as old versions of gcc) that require
  that C variable declarations occur at the start of a {} block,
  not in the middle.

* Workaround bug in OpenSSL 0.9.6b ASN1_STRING_to_UTF8, which
  the new implementation of extract_x509_field_ssl depends on.

* LZO compression buffer overflow errors will now invalidate
  the packet rather than trigger a fatal assertion.

* Fixed minor compile issue in ntlm.c (mid-block declaration).

* Added --allow-pull-fqdn option which allows client to pull DNS names
  from server (rather than only IP address) for --ifconfig, --route, and
  --route-gateway.  OpenVPN versions 2.1_rc7 and earlier allowed DNS names
  for these options to be pulled and translated to IP addresses by default.
  Now --allow-pull-fqdn will be explicitly required on the client to enable
  DNS-name-to-IP-address translation of pulled options.

* 2.1_rc8 and earlier did implicit shell expansion on script
  arguments since all scripts were called by system().
  The security hardening changes made to 2.1_rc9 no longer
  use system(), but rather use the safer execve or CreateProcess
  system calls.  The security hardening also introduced a
  backward incompatibility with 2.1_rc8 and earlier in that
  script parameters were no longer shell-expanded, so
  for example:

    client-connect "docc CLIENT-CONNECT"

  would fail to work because execve would try to execute
  a script called "docc CLIENT-CONNECT" instead of "docc"
  with "CLIENT-CONNECT" as the first argument.

  This patch fixes the issue, bringing the script argument
  semantics back to pre 2.1_rc9 behavior in order to preserve
  backward compatibility while still using execve or CreateProcess
  to execute the script/executable.

* Modified ip_or_dns_addr_safe, which validates pulled DNS names,
  to more closely conform to RFC 3696:

  (1) DNS name length must not exceed 255 characters

  (2) DNS name characters must be limited to alphanumeric,
      dash ('-'), and dot ('.')

* Fixed bug in intra-session TLS key rollover that was introduced with
  deferred authentication features in 2.1_rc8.

2008.07.31 -- Version 2.1_rc9

* Security Fix -- affects non-Windows OpenVPN clients running
  OpenVPN 2.1-beta14 through 2.1-rc8 (OpenVPN 2.0.x clients are NOT
  vulnerable nor are any versions of the OpenVPN server vulnerable).
  An OpenVPN client connecting to a malicious or compromised
  server could potentially receive an "lladdr" or "iproute" configuration
  directive from the server which could cause arbitrary code execution on
  the client. A successful attack requires that (a) the client has agreed
  to allow the server to push configuration directives to it by including
  "pull" or the macro "client" in its configuration file, (b) the client
  successfully authenticates the server, (c) the server is malicious or has
  been compromised and is under the control of the attacker, and (d) the
  client is running a non-Windows OS.  Credit: David Wagner.
  CVE-2008-3459

* Miscellaneous defensive programming changes to multiple
  areas of the code.  In particular, use of the system() call
  for calling executables such as ifconfig, route, and
  user-defined scripts has been completely revamped in favor
  of execve() on unix and CreateProcess() on Windows.

* In Windows build, package a statically linked openssl.exe to work around
  observed instabilities in the dynamic build since the migration to
  OpenSSL 0.9.8h.

2008.06.11 -- Version 2.1_rc8

* Added client authentication and packet filtering capability
  to management interface.  In addition, allow OpenVPN plugins
  to take advantage of deferred authentication and packet
  filtering capability.

* Added support for client-side connection profiles.

* Fixed unbounded memory growth bug in environmental variable
  code that could have caused long-running OpenVPN sessions
  with many TLS renegotiations to incrementally
  increase memory usage over time.

* Windows release now packages openssl-0.9.8h.

* Build system changes -- allow building on Windows using
  autoconf/automake scripts (Alon Bar-Lev).

* Changes to Windows build system to make it easier to do
  partial builds, with a reduced set of prerequisites,
  where only a subset of OpenVPN installer
  components are built.  See ./domake-win comments.

* Cleanup IP address for persistence interfaces for tap and also
  using ifconfig, gentoo#209055 (Alon Bar-Lev).

* Fall back to old version of extract_x509_field for OpenSSL 0.9.6.

* Clarified tcp-queue-limit man page entry (Matti Linnanvuori).

* Added new OpenVPN icon and installer graphic.

* Minor pkitool changes.

* Added --pkcs11-id-management option, which will cause OpenVPN to
  query the management interface via the new NEED-STR asynchronous
  notification query to get additional PKCS#11 options (Alon Bar-Lev).

* Added NEED-STR management interface asynchronous query and
  "needstr" management interface command to respond to the query
  (Alon Bar-Lev).

* Added Dragonfly BSD support (Francis-Gudin).

* Quote device names before passing to up/down script (Josh Cepek).

* Bracketed struct openvpn_pktinfo with #pragma pack(1) to
  prevent structure padding from causing an incorrect length
  to be returned by sizeof (struct openvpn_pktinfo) on 64-bit
  platforms.

* On systems that support res_init, always call it
  before calling gethostbyname to ensure that
  resolver configuration state is current.

* Added NTLMv2 proxy support (Miroslav Zajic).

* Fixed an issue in extract_x509_field_ssl where the extraction
  would fail on the first field of the subject name, such as
  the common name in:  /CN=foo/emailAddress=
 foo@bar.com

* Made "Linux ip addr del failed" error nonfatal.

* Amplified --client-cert-not-required warning.

* Added #pragma pack to proto.h.

2008.01.29 -- Version 2.1_rc7

* Added a few extra files that exist in the svn repo but were
  not being copied into the tarball by make dist.

* Fixup null interface on close, don't use ip addr flush (Alon Bar-Lev).

2008.01.24 -- Version 2.1_rc6

* Fixed options checking bug introduced in rc5 where legitimate configuration
  files might elicit the error: "Options error: Parameter pkcs11_private_mode
  can only be specified in TLS-mode, i.e. where --tls-server or --tls-client
  is also specified."

2008.01.23 -- Version 2.1_rc5

* Fixed Win2K TAP driver bug that was introduced by Vista fixes,
  incremented driver version to 9.4.

* Windows build system changes:

  Incremented included OpenSSL version to openssl-0.9.7m.

  Updated openssl.patch for openssl-0.9.7m and added some
  brief usage comments to the head of the patch.

  Added build-pkcs11-helper.sh for building the pkcs11-helper
  library.

  Integrated inclusion of pkcs11-helper into Windows build
  system.

  Upgraded TAP build scripts to use WDK 6001.17121
  (Windows 2008 Server pre-RTM).

* Windows installer changes:

  Clean up the start menu folder.

  Allow for a site-specific sample configuration file and keys
  to be included in a custom installer (see SAMPCONF macros
  in settings.in).

  New icon (temporary).

* Added "forget-passwords" command to the management interface
  (Alon Bar-Lev).

* Added --management-signal option to signal SIGUSR1 when the
  management interface disconnects (Alon Bar-Lev).

* Modified command line and config file parser to allow
  quoted strings using single quotes ('') (Alon Bar-Lev).

* Use pkcs11-helper as external library, can be downloaded from
  https://www.opensc-project.org/pkcs11-helper (Alon Bar-Lev).

* Fixed interim memory growth issue in TCP connect loop where
  "TCP: connect to %s failed, will try again in %d seconds: %s"
  is output.

* Fixed bug in epoll driver in event.c, where the lack of a
  handler for EPOLLHUP could cause 99% CPU usage.

* Defined ALLOW_NON_CBC_CIPHERS for people who don't
  want to use a CBC cipher for OpenVPN's data channel.

* Added PLUGIN_LIBDIR preprocessor string to prepend a default
  plugin directory to the dlopen search list when the user
  specifies the basename of the plugin only (Marius Tomaschewski).

* Rewrote extract_x509_field and modified COMMON_NAME_CHAR_CLASS
  to allow forward slash characters ("/") in the X509 common name
  (Pavel Shramov).

* Allow OpenVPN to run completely unprivileged under Linux
  by allowing openvpn --mktun to be used with --user and --group
  to set the UID/GID of the tun device node.  Also added --iproute
  option to allow an alternative command to be executed in place
  of the default iproute2 command (Alon Bar-Lev).

* Fixed --disable-iproute2 in ./configure to actually disable
  iproute2 usage (Alon Bar-Lev).

* Added --management-forget-disconnect option -- forget
  passwords when management session disconnects (Alon Bar-Lev).

2007.04.25 -- Version 2.1_rc4

* Worked out remaining issues with TAP driver signing
  on Vista x64.  OpenVPN will now run on Vista x64
  with driver signing enforcement enabled.

* Fixed 64-bit portability bug in time_string function
  (Thomas Habets).

2007.04.22 -- Version 2.1_rc3

* Additional fixes to TAP driver for Windows x64.  Driver
  now runs successfully on Vista x64 if driver signing
  enforcement is disabled.

* The Windows Installer and TAP driver are now signed by
  OpenVPN Solutions LLC (in addition to the usual GnuPG
  signatures).

* Added OpenVPN GUI (Mathias Sundman version) as install
  option in Windows installer.

* Clean up configure on FreeBSD for recent autotool versions
  that require that all .h files have to be compiled.
  Also, FreeBSD install does not support GNU long options
  which the Makefile in easy-rsa/2.0 uses (not checked the
  others as we don't install those on Gentoo) (Roy Marples).

* Added additional scripts to easy-rsa/Windows for working
  with password-protected keys; also add -extensions server
  option when generating server cert via
  build-key-server-pass.bat (Daniel Zauft).

2007.02.27 -- Version 2.1_rc2

* auth-pam change:  link with -lpam rather
  than dlopen (Roy Marples).

* Prevent SIGUSR1 or SIGHUP from causing program
  exit from initial management hold.

* SO_REUSEADDR should not be set on Windows TCP sockets
  because it will cause bind to succeed on port conflicts.

* Added time_ascii, time_duration, and time_unix
  environmental variables for plugins and callback
  scripts.

* Fixed issue where OpenVPN does not apply the --txqueuelen option
  to persistent interfaces made with --mktun (Roy Marples).

* Attempt at rational signal handling when in the
  management hold state.  During management hold, ignore
  SIGUSR1/SIGHUP signals thrown with the "signal" command.
  Also, "signal" command will now apply remapping as
  specified with the --remap-usr1 option.
  When a signal entered using the "signal" command from a management
  hold is ignored, output: >HOLD:Waiting for hold release

* Fixed issue where struct env_set methods that
  change the value of an existing name=value pair
  would delay the freeing of the memory held by
  the previous name=value pair until the underlying
  client instance object is closed.
  This could cause a server that handles long-term
  client connections, resulting in many periodic calls
  to verify_callback, to needlessly grow the env_set
  memory allocation until the underlying client instance
  object is closed.

* Renamed TAP-Win32 driver from tap0801.sys to tap0901.sys
  to reflect the fact that Vista has blacklisted the tap0801.sys
  file name due to previous compatibility issues which have now
  been resolved.  TAP-Win32 major/minor version number is now 9/1.

* Windows installer will delete a previously installed
  tap0801.sys TAP driver before installing tap0901.sys.

* Added code to Windows installer to fail gracefully on 64 bit
  installs until 64-bit TAP driver issues can be resolved.

* Added code to Windows installer to fail gracefully on
  versions of Windows which are not explicitly supported.

* The Windows version will now use a default route-delay
  of 5 seconds to deal with an apparent routing table race
  condition on Vista.

* Worked around an incompatibility in the Windows Vista
  version of CreateIpForwardEntry as described in
[Debugging (or reverse engineering…) a real life Windows Vista compatibility problem: CreateIpForwardEntry in iphlpapi](http://www.nynaeve.net/?p=59)

  This issue would cause route additions using the
  IP Helper API to fail on Vista.

* On Windows, revert to "ip-win32 dynamic" as the default.

2006.10.31 -- Version 2.1_rc1

* Support recovery (return to hold) from signal at
  management password prompt.

* Added workaround for OpenSC PKCS#11 bug#108
  (Alon Bar-Lev).

2006.10.01 -- Version 2.1-beta16

  (Henry Nestler).

* Autodetect 32/64 bit Windows in installer and install
  appropriate TAP driver (Mathias Sundman, Hypherion).

* Fixed bug in loopback self-test introduced
  in 2.1-beta15 where self test as invoked by
  "make check" would not properly exit after
  2 minutes (Paul Howarth).

2006.09.12 -- Version 2.1-beta15

* Windows installer updated with OpenSSL 0.9.7k DLLs to fix
  RSA Signature Forgery (CVE-2006-4339).

* Fixed bug introduced with the --port-share directive
  (back in 2.1-beta9 which causes TLS soft resets
  (1 per hour by default) in TCP server mode to force
  a blockage of tunnel packets and later time-out and
  restart the connection.

* easy-rsa update (Alon Bar-Lev)
  Makefile (install) is now available so that
  distribs will be able to install it safely.

* PKCS#11 changes: (Alon Bar-Lev)
  - Modified ssl.c to not FATAL and return to init.c
    so auth-retry will work.
  - Modifed pkcs11-helper.c to fix some problem with
    multiple providers.
  - Added retry counter to PKCS#11 PIN hook.
  - Modified PKCS#11 PIN retry loop to return correct error
    code when PIN is incorrect.
  - Fix handling (ignoring) zero sized attributes.
  - Fix gcc-2 issues.
  - Fix openssl 0.9.6 (first version) issues.

* Minor fixes of lladdr (Alon Bar-Lev)
  Updated makefile.w32-vc to include lladdr.*, updated
  linkage libraries.
  Modified lladdr.c to be compiled under visual C.

* Added two new management states:
   OPENVPN_STATE_RESOLVE      -- DNS lookup
   OPENVPN_STATE_TCP_CONNECT  -- Connecting to TCP server

* Echo management state change to log.

* Minor syshead.h change for NetBSD to allow
  TCP_NODELAY flag to work.

* Modified --port-share code to remove the assumption that
  CMSG_SPACE always evaluates to a constant, to enable
  compilation on NetBSD and possibly other BSDs as well.

* Eliminated gcc 3.3.3 warnings on NetBSD
  when ./configure --enable-strict is used.

* Added optional minimum-number-of-bytes parameter
  to --inactive directive.

2006.04.13 -- Version 2.1-beta14

* Fixed Windows server bug in time backtrack handling code which
  could cause TLS negotiation failures on legitimate clients.

* Rewrote gettimeofday function for Windows to be
  simpler and more efficient.

* Merged PKCS#11 extensions to easy-rsa/2.0  (Alon Bar-Lev).

* Added --route-metric option to set a default route metric
  for --route (Roy Marples).

* Added --lladdr option to specify the link layer (MAC) address
  for the tap interface on non-Windows platforms (Roy Marples).

2006.04.12 -- Version 2.1-beta13

* Code added in 2.1-beta7 and 2.0.6-rc1 to extend byte counters
  to 64 bits caused a bug in the Windows version which has now
  been fixed.  The bug could cause intermittent crashes.

2006.04.05 -- Version 2.1-beta12

* Security Vulnerability -- An OpenVPN client connecting to a
  malicious or compromised server could potentially receive
  "setenv" configuration directives from the server which could
  cause arbitrary code execution on the client via a LD_PRELOAD
  attack.  A successful attack appears to require that (a) the
  client has agreed to allow the server to push configuration
  directives to it by including "pull" or the macro "client" in
  its configuration file, (b) the client configuration file uses
  a scripting directive such as "up" or "down", (c) the client
  succesfully authenticates the server, (d) the server is
  malicious or has been compromised and is under the control of
  the attacker, and (e) the attacker has at least some level of
  pre-existing control over files on the client (this might be
  accomplished by having the server respond to a client web request
  with a specially crafted file).  Credit: Hendrik Weimer.
  CVE-2006-1629.

  The fix is to disallow "setenv" to be pushed to clients from
  the server, and to add a new directive "setenv-safe" which is
  pushable from the server, but which appends "OPENVPN_" to the
  name of each remotely set environmental variable.

* "topology subnet" fix for FreeBSD (Benoit Bourdin).

* PKCS11 fixes (Alon Bar-Lev).  For full description:
  svn log -r990 http://svn.openvpn.net/projects/openvpn/branches/BETA21

* When deleting routes under Linux, use the route metric
  as a differentiator to ensure that the route teardown
  process only deletes the identical route which was originally
  added via the "route" directive (Roy Marples).

* Fix the t_cltsrv.sh file in FreeBSD 4 jails
  (Matthias Andree, Dirk Meyer, Vasil Dimov).

* Extended tun device configure code to support ethernet
  bridging on NetBSD (Emmanuel Kasper).

2006.02.19 -- Version 2.1-beta11

* Fixed --port-share bug that caused premature closing
  of proxied sessions.

2006.02.17 -- Version 2.1-beta10

* Fixed --port-share breakage introduced in 2.1-beta9.

2006.02.16 -- Version 2.1-beta9

* Added --port-share option for allowing OpenVPN and HTTPS
  server to share the same port number.
* Added --management-client option to connect as a client
  to management GUI app rather than be connected to as a
  server.
* Added "bytecount" command to management interface.
* --remote-cert-tls fixes (Alon Bar-Lev).

2006.01.03 -- Version 2.1-beta8

* --remap-usr1 will now also remap signals thrown during
  initialization.
* Added --connect-timeout option to control the timeout
  on TCP client connection attempts (doesn't work on all
  OSes).  This patch also makes OpenVPN signalable during
  TCP connection attempts.
* Fixed bug in acinclude.m4 where capability of compiler
  to handle zero-length arrays in structs is tested
  (David Stipp).
* Fixed typo in manage.c where inline function declaration
  was declared without the "static" keyword (David Stipp).
* Patch to support --topology subnet on Mac OS X (Mathias Sundman).
* Added --auto-proxy directive to auto-detect HTTP or SOCKS
  proxy settings (currently Windows only).
* Removed redundant base64 code.
* Better sanity checking of --server and --server-bridge
  IP pool ranges, so as not to hit the assertion at
  pool.c:119 (2.0.5).
* Fixed bug where --daemon and --management-query-passwords
  used together would cause OpenVPN to block prior to
  daemonization.
* Fixed client/server race condition which could occur
  when --auth-retry interact is set and the initially
  provided auth-user-pass credentials are incorrect,
  forcing a username/password re-query.
* Fixed bug where if --daemon and --management-hold are
  used together, --user or --group options would be ignored.
* --ip-win32 adaptive is now the default.
* --ip-win32 netsh (or --ip-win32 adaptive when in netsh
  mode) can now set DNS/WINS addresses on the TAP-Win32
  adapter.
* Added new option --route-method adaptive (Win32)
  which tries IP helper API first, then falls back to
  route.exe.
* Made --route-method adaptive the default.

2005.11.12 -- Version 2.1-beta7

* Allow blank passwords to be passed via the management
  interface.
* Fixed bug where "make check" inside a FreeBSD "jail"
  would never complete (Matthias Andree).
* Fixed bug where --server directive in --dev tap mode
  claimed that it would support subnets of /30 or less
  but actually would only accept /29 or less.
* Extend byte counters to 64 bits (M. van Cuijk).
* Fixed bug in Linux get_default_gateway function
  introduced in 2.0.4, which would cause redirect-gateway
  on Linux clients to fail.
* Moved easy-rsa 2.0 scripts to easy-rsa/2.0 to
  be compatible with 2.0.x distribution.
* Documented --route-nopull.
* Documented --ip-win32 adaptive.
* Windows build now linked with LZO2.
* Allow ca, cert, key, and dh files to be specified
  inline via XML-like syntax without needing to
  reference an explicit file.
  For example:
  <ca>
	data here...
  </ca>
* Allow plugin and push directives to have multi-line
  parameter lists such as:
  <plugin>
    my-plugin.so
    parm1
    parm2
  </plugin>
* Added connect-retry-max option (Alon Bar-Lev).
* Fixed problems where signals thrown during initialization
  were not returning to a management-hold state.
* Added a backtrack-hardened system time algorithm.
* Added --remote-cert-ku, --remote-cert-eku, and
  --remote-cert-tls options for verifying certificate
  attributes (Alon Bar-Lev).
* For Windows, reverted --ip-win32 default back to "dynamic".
  To use new adaptive mode, set explicitly.

2005.11.01 -- Version 2.1-beta6

* Security fix (merged from 2.0.4) -- Affects non-Windows
  OpenVPN clients of version 2.0 or higher which connect to
  a malicious or compromised server.  A format string
  vulnerability in the foreign_option function in options.c
  could potentially allow a malicious or compromised server
  to execute arbitrary code on the client.  Only
  non-Windows clients are affected.  The vulnerability
  only exists if (a) the client's TLS negotiation with
  the server succeeds, (b) the server is malicious or
  has been compromised such that it is configured to
  push a maliciously crafted options string to the client,
  and (c) the client indicates its willingness to accept
  pushed options from the server by having "pull" or
  "client" in its configuration file (Credit: Vade79).
  CVE-2005-3393
* Security fix -- (merged from 2.0.4) Potential DoS
  vulnerability on the server in TCP mode.  If the TCP
  server accept() call returns an error status, the resulting
  exception handler may attempt to indirect through a NULL
  pointer, causing a segfault.  Affects all OpenVPN 2.0 versions.
  CVE-2005-3409
* Fix attempt of assertion at multi.c:1586 (note that
  this precise line number will vary across different
  versions of OpenVPN).
* Windows reliability changes:
  (a) Added code to make sure that the local PATH environmental
      variable points to the Windows system32 directory.
  (b) Added new --ip-win32 adaptive mode which tries 'dynamic'
      and then fails over to 'netsh' if the DHCP negotiation fails.
  (c) Made --ip-win32 adaptive the default.
* More PKCS#11 additions/changes (Alon Bar-Lev).
* Added ".PHONY: plugin" to Makefile.am to work around
  "make dist" issue.
* Fixed double fork issue that occurs when --management-hold
  is used.
* Moved TUN/TAP read/write log messages from --verb 8 to 6.
* Warn when multiple clients having the same common name or
  username usurp each other when --duplicate-cn is not used.
* Modified Windows and Linux versions of get_default_gateway
  to return the route with the smallest metric
  if multiple 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0 entries are present.
* Added ">NEED-OK" alert and "needok" command to management
  interface to provide a general interface for sending
  alerts to the end-user.  Used by the PKCS#11 code
  to send Token Insertion Requests to the user.
* Added actual remote address used to the ">STATE" alert
  in the management interface (Rolf Fokkens).

2005.10.17 -- Version 2.1-beta4

* Fixed bug introduced in 2.1-beta3 where management
  socket bind would fail.
* --capath fix in ssl.c (Zhuang Yuyao).
* Added ".PHONY: plugin" to Makefile.am, reverted
  location of "plugin" directory (thanks to
  Matthias Andree for figuring this out).

2005.10.16 -- Version 2.1-beta3

* Added PKCS#11 support (Alon Bar-Lev).
* Enable the use of --ca together with --pkcs12.  If --ca is
  used at the same time as --pkcs12, the CA certificate is loaded
  from the file specified by --ca regardless if the pkcs12 file
  contains a CA cert or not (Mathias Sundman).
* Merged --capath patch (Thomas Noel).
* Merged --multihome patch.
* Added --bind option for TCP client connections (Ewan Bhamrah
  Harley).
* Moved "plugin" directory to "plugins" to deal with strange
  automake problem that ended up being also fixable with
  ".PHONY: plugin" in Makefile.am.

2005.10.13 -- Version 2.1-beta2

* Made --sndbuf and --rcvbuf pushable.

2005.10.01 -- Version 2.1-beta1

* Made LZO setting pushable.
* Renamed sample-keys/tmp-ca.crt to ca.crt.
* Fixed bug where remove_iroutes_from_push_route_list
  was missing routes if those routes had
  an implied netmask (by omission) of 255.255.255.255.
* Merged with 2.0.3-rc1
* easy-rsa/2.0 moved to easy-rsa
* old easy-rsa moved to easy-rsa/1.0

2005.09.23 -- Version 2.0.2-TO4

* Added feature to TAP-Win32 adapter to allow it to be
  opened from non-administrator mode.  This feature
  is enabled by default, and can be enabled/disabled
  in the adapter advanced properties dialog.
* Added --allow-nonadmin standalone option for Windows to
  set TAP adapter to allow non-admin access.  This
  is a user-mode version of the code, and duplicates
  the same feature as the above entry.
* Added fix that attempts to solve corner case of tunnel not
  forwarding packets when system clock is reset to an earlier time.
* Added --redirect-gateway bypass-dns option.  (Developers:
  To add bypass-dhcp or bypass-dns support to other OSes,
  add a get_bypass_addresses function to route.c for
  your OS.)
* Added OPENVPN_PLUGIN_CLIENT_CONNECT_V2 plugin callback, which
  allows a client-connect plugin to return configuration text
  in memory, rather than via a file.
* Fixed a bug where --mode server --proto tcp-server --cipher none
  operation could cause tunnel packet truncation.
* openvpn --version will show [LZO1] or [LZO2], depending on
  version that was linked.

2005.09.07 -- Version 2.0.2-TO1

* Added --topology directive.  See man page.
* Added --redirect-gateway bypass-dhcp option to add a route
  allowing DHCP packets to bypass the tunnel, when the
  DHCP server is non-local.  Currently only implemented
  on Windows clients.
* Modified OpenVPN Service on Windows to declare the DHCP
  client service as a dependency.
* Extended the plugin interface to allow plugins to declare
  per-client constructor and destructor functions, to make
  it simpler for plugins to maintain per-client state.

2005.09.25 -- Version 2.0.3-rc1

* openvpn_plugin_abort_v1 function wasn't being properly
  registered on Windows.
* Fixed a bug where --mode server --proto tcp-server --cipher none
  operation could cause tunnel packet truncation.

2005.08.25 -- Version 2.0.2

* No change from 2.0.2-rc1.

2005.08.24 -- Version 2.0.2-rc1

* Fixed regression bug in Win32 installer, introduced in 2.0.1,
  which incorrectly set OpenVPN service to autostart.
* Don't package source code zip file in Windows installer
  in order to reduce the size of the installer.  The source
  zip file can always be downloaded separately if needed.
* Fixed bug in route.c in FreeBSD, Darwin, OpenBSD and NetBSD
  version of get_default_gateway.  Allocated socket for route
  manipulation is never freed so number of mbufs continuously
  grow and exhaust system resources after a while (Jaroslav Klaus).
* Fixed bug where "--proto tcp-server --mode p2p --management
  host port" would cause the management port to not respond until
  the OpenVPN peer connects.
* Modified pkitool script to be /bin/sh compatible (Johnny Lam).

2005.08.16 -- Version 2.0.1

* Security Fix -- DoS attack against server when run with "verb 0" and
  without "tls-auth".  If a client connection to the server fails
  certificate verification, the OpenSSL error queue is not properly
  flushed, which can result in another unrelated client instance on the
  server seeing the error and responding to it, resulting in disconnection
  of the unrelated client (CAN-2005-2531).
* Security Fix -- DoS attack against server by authenticated client.
  This bug presents a potential DoS attack vector against the server
  which can only be initiated by a connected and authenticated client.
  If the client sends a packet which fails to decrypt on the server,
  the OpenSSL error queue is not properly flushed, which can result in
  another unrelated client instance on the server seeing the error and
  responding to it, resulting in disconnection of the unrelated client
  (CAN-2005-2532).  Credit: Mike Ireton.
* Security Fix -- DoS attack against server by authenticated client.
  A malicious client in "dev tap" ethernet bridging mode could
  theoretically flood the server with packets appearing to come from
  hundreds of thousands of different MAC addresses, causing the OpenVPN
  process to deplete system virtual memory as it expands its internal
  routing table.  A --max-routes-per-client directive has been added
  (default=256) to limit the maximum number of routes in OpenVPN's
  internal routing table which can be associated with a given client
  (CAN-2005-2533).
* Security Fix -- DoS attack against server by authenticated client.
  If two or more client machines try to connect to the server at the
  same time via TCP, using the same client certificate, and when
  --duplicate-cn is not enabled on the server, a race condition can
  crash the server with "Assertion failed at mtcp.c:411"
  (CAN-2005-2534).
* Fixed server bug where under certain circumstances, the client instance
  object deletion function would try to delete iroutes which had never been
  added in the first place, triggering "Assertion failed at mroute.c:349".
* Added --auth-retry option to prevent auth errors from being fatal
  on the client side, and to permit username/password requeries in case
  of error.  Also controllable via new "auth-retry" management interface
  command.  See man page for more info.
* Added easy-rsa 2.0 scripts to the tarball in easy-rsa/2.0
* Fixed bug in openvpn.spec where rpmbuild --define 'without_pam 1'
  would fail to build.
* Implement "make check" to perform loopback tests (Matthias Andree).

2005.07.21 -- Version 2.0.1-rc7

* Support LZO 2.01 which renamed its library to lzo2 (Matthias Andree).
* Include linux/types.h before checking for linux/errqueue.h (Matthias
  Andree).

2005.07.15 -- Version 2.0.1-rc6

* Commented out "user nobody" and "group nobody" in sample
  client/server config files.
* Allow '@' character to be used in --client-config-dir
  file names.

2005.07.04 -- Version 2.0.1-rc5

* Windows version will log a for-further-info URL when
  initialization sequence is completed with errors.
* Added DLOPEN_PAM parameter to plugin/auth-pam/Makefile
  to control whether auth-pam plugin links to PAM via
  dlopen or -lpam.  By default, DLOPEN_PAM=1 so pre-existing
  behavior should be preserved.  DLOPEN_PAM=0 is the preferred
  setting to link via -lpam, but DLOPEN_PAM=1 works around
  a bug in SuSE 9.1 (and possibly other distros as well)
  where the PAM modules are not linked with -lpam.  See
  thread on openvpn-devel for more discussion about this
  patch (Simon Perreault).

2005.06.15 -- Version 2.0.1-rc4

* Support LZO 2.00, including changes to configure script to
  autodetect LZO version.

2005.06.12 -- Version 2.0.1-rc3

* Fixed a bug which caused standard file handles to not be closed
  after daemonization when --plugin and --daemon are used together,
  and if the plugin initialization function forks (as does auth-pam
  and down-root) (Simon Perreault).
* Added client-side up/down scripts in contrib/pull-resolv-conf
  for accepting server-pushed "dhcp-option DOMAIN" and "dhcp-option DNS"
  on Linux/Unix systems (Jesse Adelman).
* Fixed bug where if client-connect scripts/plugins were cascaded,
  and one (but not all) of them returned an error status, there might
  be cases where for an individual script/plugin, client-connect was
  called but not client-disconnect.  The goal of this fix is to
  ensure that if client-connect is called on a given client instance,
  then client-disconnect will definitely be called.  A potential
  complication of this fix is that when client-connect functions are
  cascaded, it's possible that the client-disconnect function would
  be called in cases where the related client-connect function returned
  an error status.  This fix should not alter OpenVPN behavior when
  scripts/plugins are not cascaded.
* Changed the hard-to-reproduce "Assertion failed at fragment.c:312"
  fatal error to a warning: "FRAG: outgoing buffer is not empty".
  Need more info on how to reproduce this one.
* When --duplicate-cn is used, the --ifconfig-pool allocation
  algorithm will now allocate the first available IP address.
* When --daemon and --management-hold are used together,
  OpenVPN will daemonize before it enters the management hold state.

2005.05.16 -- Version 2.0.1-rc2

* Modified vendor test in openvpn.spec file to match against
  "Mandrakesoft" in addition to "MandrakeSoft".
* Using --iroute in a --client-config-dir file while in --dev tap
  mode is not currently supported and will produce a warning
  message. Fixed bug where in certain cases, in addition to
  generating a warning message, this combination of options
  would also produce a fatal assertion in mroute.c.
* Pass --auth-user-pass username to server-side plugin without
  performing any string remapping (plugins, unlike scripts,
  don't get any security benefit from string remapping).
  This is intended to fix an issue with openvpn-auth-pam/pam_winbind
  where backslash characters in a username ('\') were being remapped
  to underscore ('_').
* Updated OpenSSL DLLs in Windows build to 0.9.7g.
* Documented --explicit-exit-notify in man page.
* --explicit-exit-notify seconds parameter defaults to 1 if
  unspecified.

2005.04.30 -- Version 2.0.1-rc1

* Fixed bug where certain kinds of fatal errors after
  initialization (such as port in use) would leave plugin
  processes (such as openvpn-auth-pam) still running.
* Added optional openvpn_plugin_abort_v1 plugin function for
  closing initialized plugin objects in the event of a fatal
  error by main OpenVPN process.
* When the --remote list is > 1, and --resolv-retry is not
  specified (meaning that it defaults to "infinite"), apply the
  infinite timeout to the --remote list as a whole, but try each
  list item only once before moving on to the next item.
* Added new --syslog directive which redirects output
  to syslog without requiring the use of the --daemon or --inetd
  directives.
* Added openvpn.spec option to allow RPM to be built with support
  for passwords read from a file:
  rpmbuild -tb [openvpn.x.tar.gz] --define 'with_password_save 1'

2005.04.17 -- Version 2.0

* Fixed minor options string typo in options.c.

2005.04.10 -- Version 2.0-rc21

* Change license description from "GPL Version 2 or (at your
  option) any later version" to just "GPL Version 2".

2005.04.04 -- Version 2.0-rc20

* Dag Wieers has put together an OpenVPN/LZO binary RPM set with
  excellent distro/version coverage for RH/EL/Fedora, though
  using his own SPEC.  I modified openvpn.spec to follow some of
  the same conventions such as putting sample scripts and doc
  files in %doc rather than /usr/share/openvpn.
* Minor change to init scripts to run the user-defined script
  /etc/openvpn/openvpn-startup (if it exists) before any OpenVPN
  configs are started, and to run /etc/openvpn/openvpn-shutdown
  after all OpenVPN configs have been stopped.  The
  openvpn-startup script can be used for stuff like
  insmod tun.o, setting up firewall rules, or starting
  ethernet bridges.

2005.03.29 -- Version 2.0-rc19

* Omit additions of routes where the network and
  gateway are equal and the netmask is 255.255.255.255.
  This can come up if you are using both
  server/ifconfig-pool and client-config-dir with
  ifconfig-push static addresses for some subset of clients
  which directly reference the server IP address as the
  remote endpoint.

2005.03.28 -- Version 2.0-rc18

* Packaged Windows installer with OpenSSL 0.9.7f.
* Built Windows installer with NSIS 2.06.

2005.03.12 -- Version 2.0-rc17

* "MANAGEMENT: CMD" log file output will now only occur
  at --verb 7 or greater.
* Added an optional name/value configuration list to
  the openvpn-auth-pam plugin module argument list.  See
  plugin/auth-pam/README for documentation. This is necessary
  in order for openvpn-auth-pam to work with queries generated
  by arbitrary PAM modules.
* In both auth-pam and down-root plugins, in the forked process,
  a read error on the parent process socket is no longer fatal.
* MandrakeSoft liblzo1 RPM only Provides for a 'liblzo1'.
  A conditional test of the vendor has been added to
  Require the appropriately named 'lzo' (liblzo1 / lzo).
  (Tom Walsh - http://openhardware.net)

2005.02.20 -- Version 2.0-rc16

* Fixed bug introduced in rc13 where Windows service wrapper
  would be installed with a startup type of Automatic.
  This fix restores the previous behavior of installing
  with a startup type of Manual.

2005.02.19 -- Version 2.0-rc15

* Added warning when --keepalive is not used in a server
  configuration.
* Don't include OpenSSL md4.h file if we are not building
  NTLM proxy support (Waldemar Brodkorb).
* Added easy-rsa/build-key-pkcs12 and
  easy-rsa/Windows/build-key-pkcs12.bat scripts
  (Mathias Sundman).

2005.02.16 -- Version 2.0-rc14

* Fixed small memory leak that occurs when --crl-verify
  is used.
* Upgraded Windows installer and .nsi script to NSIS 2.05
  (Mathias Sundman).
* Changed #include backslash usage in cryptoapi.c to use
  forward slashes instead (Gisle Vanem).
* Created easy-rsa/revoke-full to handle revocations in
  a single step: (a) revoke crt, (b) regenerate CRL, and
  (c) verify that revocation succeeded.
* Renamed easy-rsa/Windows/revoke-key to revoke-full so
  that both *nix and Windows scripts are equivalent.

2005.02.11 -- Version 2.0-rc13

* Improve human-readability of local/remote options
  diff, when inconsistencies are present.
* For Windows easy-rsa, distribute vars.bat.sample and
  openssl.cnf.sample, then copy them to their normal
  filenames (without the .sample) when init-config.bat
  is run.  This is to prevent OpenVPN upgrades from
  wiping out vars.bat and openssl.cnf edits.
* Modified service wrapper (Windows) to use a
  case-insensitive search when scanning for .ovpn files
  in \Program Files\OpenVPN\config.  Prior versions
  required an all-lower-case .ovpn file extension.
* Miscellaneous service wrapper code cleanup.
* If --user/--group is used on Windows, treat it
  as a no-op with a warning (this makes it easier to
  distribute the same client config file to Windows
  and *nix users).
* Warn if --ifconfig-pool-persist is used with
  --duplicate-cn.

2005.02.05 -- Version 2.0-rc12

* Removed some debugging code inadvertently included
  in rc11 which would print the --auth-user-pass
  username/password provided by clients in the server
  logfile.
* Client code for cycling through --remote list will
  retry the last address which successfully authenticated
  before moving on through the list.
* Windows installer will now install sample configuration
  files in \Program Files\OpenVPN\sample-configs as well
  as generate a start menu shortcut to this directory.
* Minor type change in buffer.[ch] to work around char-type
  ambiguity bug.  Caused management interface lock-ups on
  ARM when building with armv4b-hardhat-linux-gcc 2.95.3.

2005.02.03 -- Version 2.0-rc11

* Windows installer will now install easy-rsa directory
  in \Program Files\OpenVPN
* Allow syslog facility to be controlled at compile time,
  e.g. -DLOG_OPENVPN=LOG_LOCAL6 (P Kern).
* Changed certain shell scripts in distribution to use
  #!/bin/sh rather than #!/bin/bash for better portability.
* If --ifconfig-pool-persist seconds parameter is 0, treat
  persist file as an allocation of fixed IP addresses
  (previous versions took IP-to-common-name associations
  from this list as hints, not mandatory static allocations).
* Fixed bug on *nix where if --auth-user-pass and --log
  were used together, the username prompt would be sent to
  the log file rather than /dev/tty.
* Spurious text in openvpn.8 detected by doclifter
  (Eric S. Raymond).
* Call closelog later on daemon kill so that process
  exit message is written to syslog.

2005.01.27 -- Version 2.0-rc10

* When ./configure is run with plugins enabled (the default),
  check whether or not dlopen exists in libc before testing
  for libdl.  This is to fix an issue on FreeBSD and possibly
  other OSes which bundle libdl functions in libc.
* On Windows, filter initial WSAEINVAL warning which occurs
  on the initial read attempt of an unbound socket.
* The easy-rsa scripts build-key, build-key-pass, and
  build-key-server will now chmod the .key file
  to 0600.  This is in addition to the fact the generated
  keys directory has always been similarly protected
  (Pete Harlan).

2005.01.23 -- Version 2.0-rc9

* Fixed error "ROUTE: route addition failed using
  CreateIpForwardEntry ..." on Windows when --redirect-gateway
  is used over a RRAS internet link.
* When using --route-method exe on Windows, include the
  gateway parameter on route delete commands (Mathias Sundman).
* Try not to do a hard reset (i.e. SIGHUP) when two
  SIGUSR1 signals are received in close succession.
* If the push list tries to grow beyond its buffer capacity,
  the resulting error will be non-fatal.
* To increase the push list capacity (must be done on both
  client and server), increase TLS_CHANNEL_BUF_SIZE in
  common.h (default=1024).

2005.01.15 -- Version 2.0-rc8

* Fixed bug introduced in rc7 where options error
  "--auth-user-pass requires --pull" might occur even
  if --pull was correctly specified.
* Changed management interface code to bind once
  to TCP socket, rather than rebinding after every
  client disconnect.
* Added "disable" directive for client-config-dir
  files.
* Windows binary install is now distributed with
  OpenSSL 0.9.7e.
* Query the management interface for --http-proxy
  username/password if authfile is set to "stdin".
* Added current OpenVPN version number to "Unrecognized
  option or missing parameter" error message.
* Added "-extensions server" to "openssl req" command
  in easy-rsa/build-key-server (Nir Yeffet).

2005.01.10 -- Version 2.0-rc7

* Fixed bug in management interface which could cause
  100% CPU utilization in --proto tcp-server mode
  on all *nix OSes except for Linux 2.6.
* --ifconfig-push now accepts DNS names as well as
  IP addresses.
* Added sanity check errors when --pull or
  --auth-user-pass is used in an incorrect mode.
* Updated man page entries for --client-connect and
  --ifconfig-push.
* Added "String Types and Remapping" section to man
  page to consisely document the way which OpenVPN
  may convert certain types of characters in strings
  to ('_').
* Modified bridging description in HOWTO to emphasize
  the fact that bridging allows Windows file and print
  sharing without a WINS server (Charles Duffy).

2004.12.20 -- Version 2.0-rc6

* Improved checking for epoll support in ./configure
  to fix false positive on RH9 (Jan Just Keijser).
* Made the "MULTI TCP: I/O wait required blocking in
  multi_tcp_action, action=7" error nonfatal and replaced
  with "MULTI: Outgoing TUN queue full, dropped packet".
  So far the issue only seems to occur on Linux 2.2
  in --mode server --proto tcp mode.  It occurs when
  the TUN/TAP driver locks up and refuses to accept
  new packet writes for a second or more.
* Fixed bug where if a --client-config-dir file tried
  to include another file using "config", and if that
  include failed, OpenVPN would abort with a fatal
  error.  Now such inclusion failures will be logged
  but are no longer fatal.
* Global changes to the way that packet buffer alignment
  is handled.  Previously we didn't care about alignment
  and took care, when handling 16 and 32 bit words
  in buffers, to always use alignment-safe transfers.
  This approach appears to be inadequate on some
  architectures such as alpha.  The new approach is
  to initialize packet buffers in a way that anticipates
  how component structures will be allocated within
  them, to maintain correct alignment.
* Added --dhcp-option DISABLE-NBT to disable NetBIOS
  over TCP (Jan Just Keijser).
* Added --http-proxy-option directive for controlling
  miscellaneous HTTP proxy options.
* Management state will no longer transition to "WAIT"
  during TLS renegotiations.

2004.12.16 -- Version 2.0-rc5

* The --client-config-dir option will now try to open
  a default file called "DEFAULT" if no file matching
  the common name of the incoming client was found.
* The --client-connect script/plugin can now veto client
  authentication by returning a failure code.
* The --learn-address script/plugin can now prevent a
  client-instance/address association from being learned
  by returning a failure code.
* Changed RPM group in .spec file to Applications/Internet.

2004.12.14 -- Version 2.0-rc4

* SuSE only -- Fixed interaction between openvpn.spec and
  suse/openvpn.init where the .spec file was writing the
  OpenVPN binary to a different location than where the
  .init script was referencing it (Stefan Engel).
* Solaris only -- Split Solaris ifconfig command into two
  parts (Jan Just Keijser).
* Some cleanup in add_option().
* Better error checking on input dotted quad IP addresses.
* Verify that --push argument is quoted, if there is
  more than one.
* More miscellaneous option sanity checks.

2004.12.13 -- Version 2.0-rc3

* On Windows, when --log or --log-append is used,
  save the original stderr for username and password
  prompts.
* Fixed a bug introduced in the late 2.0 betas where
  if a "verb" parameter >= 16 was used, it would be
  ignored and the actual verb level would remain at 1.
* Fixed a bug mostly seen on OS X where --management-hold
  or --management-query-passwords would cause the management
  interface to be unresponsive to incoming client connections.
* Trigger an options error if one of the management-modifying
  options is used without "management" itself.

2004.12.12 -- Version 2.0-rc2

* Amplified warnings in documentation about possible
  man-in-the-middle attack when clients do not properly
  verify server certificate.  Changes to easy-rsa README,
  FAQ, HOWTO, man page, and sample client config file.
* Added a warning message if --tls-client or --client
  is used without also specifying one of either
  --ns-cert-type, --tls-remote, or --tls-verify.
* status_open() fixes for MSVC builds (Blaine Fleming).
* Fix attempt of "ntlm.c:55: error: `des_cblock' undeclared"
  compiler error which has been reported on some platforms.
* The openvpn.spec file for rpmbuild has several
  new build-time options.  See comments in the file.
* Plugins are now built and packaged in the RPM and
  will be saved in /usr/share/openvpn/plugin/lib.
* Added --management-hold directive to start OpenVPN
  in a hibernating state until released by the
  management interface.  Also added "hold" command
  to the management interface.

2004.12.07 -- Version 2.0-rc1

* openvpn.spec workaround for SuSE confusion regarding
  /etc/init.d vs. /etc/rc.d/init.d (Stefan Engel).

2004.12.05 -- Version 2.0-beta20

* The ability to read --askpass and --auth-user-pass
  passwords from a file has been disabled by default.
  To re-enable, use ./configure --enable-password-save.
* Added additional pre-connected states to management
  interface.  See management/management-notes.txt
  for more info.
* State history is now recorded by the management
  interface, and the "state" command now works like
  the log or echo commands.
* State history and real-time state change notifications
  are now prepended with an integer unix timestamp.
* Added --http-proxy-timeout option, previously
  the timeout was hardcoded to 5 seconds.

2004.12.02 -- Version 2.0-beta19

* Fixed bug in management interface line termination
  where output lines incorrectly contained a \00 char
  after the customary \0d \0a.
* Fixed bug introduced in beta18 where Windows version
  would segfault on options errors.
* Fixed bug in management interface where an empty
  quoted string ("") entered as a parameter would cause
  a segfault.
* Fixed bug where --resolv-retry was not working
  properly with multiple --remote hosts.
* Added additional ./configure options to reduce
  executable size for embedded applications.
  See ./configure --help.

2004.11.28 -- Version 2.0-beta18

* Added management interface.  See new --management-*
  options or the full management interface documentation
  in management/management-notes.txt in the tarball.
  Management interface inclusion can be disabled by
  ./configure --disable-management.
* Added two new plugin modules: auth-pam and down-root.
  Auth-pam supports pam-based authentication using a
  split privilege execution model, while down-root enables
  a down script to be executed with root privileges, even
  when --user/--group is used to drop root privileges.
  See the plugin directory in the tarball for READMEs,
  source code, and Makefiles.
* Plugin developers should note that some changes were
  made to the plugin interface since beta17.  See
  openvpn-plugin.h for details.
  Plugin interface inclusion can be disabled with
  ./configure --disable-plugins
* Added easy-rsa/build-key-server script which will
  build a certificate with with nsCertType=server.
* Added --ns-cert-type option for verification
  of nsCertType field in peer certificate.
* If --fragment n is specified and --mssfix is specified
  without a parameter, default --mssfix to n.  This restores
  the 1.6 behavior when using --mssfix without a parameter.
* Fixed SSL context initialization bug introduced in beta14
  where this error might occur on restarts: "Cannot load
  certificate chain ... PEM_read_bio:no start line".

2004.11.11 -- Version 2.0-beta17

* Changed default port number to 1194 per IANA official
  port number assignment.
* Added --plugin directive which allows compiled
  modules to intercept script callbacks.  See
  plugin folder in tarball for more info.
* Fixed bug introduced in beta12 where --key-method 1
  authentications which should have succeeded would fail.
* Ignore SIGUSR1 during DNS resolution.
* Added SuSE support to openvpn.spec (Umberto Nicoletti).
* Fixed --cryptoapicert SUBJ: parsing bug (Peter 'Luna'
  Runestig).

2004.11.07 -- Version 2.0-beta16

* Modified sample-scripts/auth-pam.pl to get username
  and password from OpenVPN via a file rather than
  via environmental variables.
* Added bytes_sent and bytes_received environmental
  variables to be set prior to client-disconnect script.
* Changed client virtual IP derivation precedence:
  (1) use --ifconfig-push directive from --client-connect
  script, (2) use --ifconfig-push directive from
  --client-config-dir, and (3) use --ifconfig-pool
  address.
* If a --client-config-dir file specifies --ifconfig-push,
  it will be visible to the --client-connect-script in
  the ifconfig_pool_remote_ip environmental variable.
* For tun-style tunnels, the ifconfig_pool_local_ip
  environmental variable will be set, while for
  tap-style tunnels, the ifconfig_pool_netmask variable
  will be set.
* Added intelligence to autoconf script to test
  compiler for the accepted form of zero-length arrays.
* Fixed a bug introduced in beta12 where --ip-win32
  netsh would fail if --dev-node was not explicitly
  specified.
* --ip-win32 netsh will now work on hidden adapters.
* Fix attempt of "Assertion failed at crypto.c:149".
  This assertion has also been reported on 1.x with a
  slightly different line number.  The fix is twofold:
  (1) In previous releases, --mtu-test may trigger this
  assertion -- this bug has been fixed.  (2) If something
  else causes the assertion to be thrown, don't panic,
  just output a nonfatal warning to the log and drop
  the packet which generated the error.
* Support TAP interfaces on Mac OS X (Waldemar Brodkorb).
* Added --echo directive.
* Added --auth-nocache directive.

2004.10.28 -- Version 2.0-beta15

* Changed environmental variable character classes
  so that names must consist of alphanumeric or
  underbar chars and values must consist of printable
  characters.  Illegal chars will be deleted.
  Versions prior to 2.0-beta12 were more restrictive
  and would map spaces to '.'.
* On Windows, when the TAP adapter fails to
  initialize with the correct IP address, output
  "Initialization Sequence Completed with Errors"
  to the console or log file.
* Added a warning when user/group/chroot is used
  without persist-tun and persist-key.
* Added cryptoapi.[ch] to tarball and source zip.
* --tls-remote option now works with common name
  prefixes as well as with the full X509 subject
  string.  This is a useful alternative to using
  a CRL on the client.
* common names associated with a static
  --ifconfig-push setting will no longer leave
  any state in the --ifconfig-pool-persist file.
* Hard TLS errors (TLS handshake failed) will now
  trigger either a SIGUSR1 signal by default
  or SIGTERM (if --tls-exit is specified).  In TCP
  mode, all TLS errors are considered to be hard.
  In server mode, the signal will be local to the
  client instance.
* Added method parameter to --auth-user-pass-verify
  directive to select whether username/password
  is passed to script via environment or a temporary
  file.
* Added --status-version option to control format
  of --status file.  The --mode server
  --status-version 2 format now includes a line
  type token, the virtual IP address is shown
  in the client list (even in --dev tap mode),
  and the integer time_t value is shown anywhere
  an ascii-formatted time/date is also shown.
* Added --remap-usr1 directive which can be used
  to control whether internally or externally
  generated SIGUSR1 signals are remapped to
  SIGHUP (restart without persisting state) or
  SIGTERM (exit).
* When running as a Windows service (using
  --service option), check the exit event before
  and after reading one line of input from
  stdin, when reading username/password info.
* For developers: Extended the --gremlin function
  to better stress-test the new 2.0 features,
  added Valgrind support on Linux and Dmalloc
  support on Windows.

2004.10.19 -- Version 2.0-beta14

* Fixed a bug introduced in Beta12 that would occur
  if you use a --client-connect script without also
  defining --tmp-dir.
* Fixed a bug introduced in Beta12 where a learn-address
  script might segfault on the delete method.
* Added Crypto API support in Windows version via
  the --cryptoapicert option (Peter 'Luna' Runestig).

2004.10.18 -- Version 2.0-beta13

* Fixed an issue introduced in Beta12 where the private
  key password would not be prompted for unless --askpass
  was explicitly specified in the config.

2004.10.17 -- Version 2.0-beta12

* Added support for username/password-based authentication.
  Clients can now authentication themselves with the server
  using either a certificate, a username/password, or both.
  New directives: --auth-user-pass, --auth-user-pass-verify,
  --client-cert-not-required, and --username-as-common-name.
* Added NTLM proxy patch (William Preston).
* Added --ifconfig-pool-linear server flag to allocate
  individual tun addresses for clients rather than /30
  subnets (won't work with Windows clients).
* Modified --http-proxy code to cache username/password
  across restarts.
* Modified --http-proxy code to read username/password
  from the console when the auth file is given as "stdin".
* Modified --askpass to take an optional filename argument.
* --persist-tun and --persist-key now work in client mode
  and can be pushed to clients as well.
* Added --ifconfig-pool-persist directive, to maintain
  ifconfig-pool info in a file which is persistent across
  daemon instantiations.
* --user and --group privilege downgrades as well as
  --chroot now also work in client mode (the
  dowgrade/chroot will be delayed until the initialization
  sequence is completed).
* Added --show-engines standalone directive to show
  available OpenSSL crypto accelerator engine support.
* --engine directive now accepts an optional engine-ID
  parameter to control which engine is used.
* "Connection reset, restarting" log message now shows
  which client is being reset.
* Added --dhcp-pre-release directive in Windows version.
* Second parm to --ip-win32 can be "default", e.g.
  --ip-win32 dynamic default 60.
* Fixed documentation bug regarding environmental
  variable settings for --ifconfig-pool IP addresses.
  The correct environmental variable names are:
  ifconfig_pool_local_ip and ifconfig_pool_remote_ip.
* ifconfig_pool_local_ip and ifconfig_pool_remote_ip
  environmental variables are now passed to the
  client-disconnect script.
* In server mode, environmental variables are now scoped
  according to the client they are associated with,
  to solve the problem of "crosstalk" between different
  client's environmental variable sets.
* Added --down-pre flag to cause --down script to be
  called before TUN/TAP close (rather than after).
* Added --tls-exit flag which will cause OpenVPN
  to exit on any TLS errors.
* Don't push a route to a client if it exactly
  matches an iroute (this lets you push routes to
  all clients, and OpenVPN will automatically remove
  the route from the route push list only for that client
  which the route actually belongs to).
* Made '--resolv-retry infinite' the default.
  --resolv-retry can be disabled by using a parameter of 0.
* For clients which plan to pull config info from server,
  set an initial default ping-restart of 60 seconds.
* Optimized mute code to lessen the load on the processor
  when messages are being muted at a higher frequency.
* Made route log messages non-mutable.
* Silence the Linux "No buffer space available" message.
* Added miscellaneous additional option sanity checks.
* Added Windows version of easy-rsa scripts in
  easy-rsa/Windows directory (Andrew J. Richardson).
* Added NetBSD route patch (Ed Ravin).
* Added OpenBSD patch for TAP + --redirect-gateway
  (Waldemar Brodkorb).
* Directives which prompt for a username and/or password
  will now work with --daemon (OpenVPN will prompt
  before forking).
* Warn if CRL is from a different issuer than the
  issuer of the peer certificate (Bernhard Weisshuhn).
* Changed init script chkconfig parameters to start
  OpenVPN daemon(s) before NFS.
* Bug fix attempt of "too many I/O wait events" which occurs
  on OSes which prefer select() over poll() such as Mac OS X.
* Added --ccd-exclusive flag.  This flag will require, as a
  condition of authentication, that a connecting client has
  a --client-config-dir file.
* TAP-Win32 open code will attempt to open a free adapter
  if --dev-node is not specified (Mathias Sundman).
* Resequenced --nice and --chroot ordering so that --nice
  occurs first.
* Added --suppress-timestamps flag (Charles Duffy).
* Source code changes to allow compilation by MSVC
  (Peter 'Luna' Runestig).
* Added experimental --fast-io flag which optimizes
  TUN/TAP/UDP writes on non-Windows systems.

2004.08.18 -- Version 2.0-beta11

* Added --server, --server-bridge, --client, and
  --keepalive helper directives.  See client.conf
  and server.conf in sample-config-files for sample
  configurations which use the new directives.
* On Windows, added --route-method to control
  whether IP Helper API or route.exe is used
  to add/delete routes.
* On Windows, added a second parameter to
  --route-delay to control the maximum time period
  to wait for the TAP-Win32 adapter to come up
  before adding routes.
* Fixed bug in Windows version where configurations
  which omit --ifconfig might fail to recognize when
  the TAP adapter is up.
* Proxy connection failures will now retry according
  to the --connect-retry parameter.
* Fixed --dev null handling on Windows so that TLS
  loopback test described in INSTALL file works
  correctly on Windows.
* Added "Initialization Sequence Completed" message
  after all initialization steps have been completed
  and the VPN can be considered "up".
* Better sanity-checking on --ifconfig-pool parameters.
* Added --tcp-queue-limit option to control
  TUN/TAP -> TCP socket overflow.
* --ifconfig-nowarn flag will now silence general
  warnings about possible --ifconfig address
  conflicts, including the warning about --ifconfig
  and --remote addresses being in same /24 subnet.
* Fixed case where server mode did not correctly
  identify certain types of ethernet multicast packets
  (Marcel de Kogel).
* Added --explicit-exit-notify option (experimental).

2004.08.02 -- Version 2.0-beta10

* Fixed possible reference after free of option strings
  after a restart, bug was introduced in beta8.
* Fixed segfault at route.c:919 in the beta9
  Windows version that was being caused by indirection
  through a NULL pointer.
* Mistakenly built debug version of TAP-Win32 driver
  for beta9.  Beta10 has correct release build.

2004.07.30 -- Version 2.0-beta9

* Fixed --route issue on Windows that was introduced with
  the new beta8 route implementation based on the
  IP Helper API.

2004.07.27 -- Version 2.0-beta8

* Added TCP support in server mode.
* Added PKCS #12 support (Mathias Sundman).
* Added patch to make revoke-crt and make-crl work
  seamlessly within the easy-rsa environment (Jan Kiszka).
* Modified --mode server ethernet bridge code to forward
  special IEEE 802.1d MAC Groups, i.e. 01:80:C2:XX:XX:XX.
* Added --dhcp-renew and --dhcp-release flags to Windows
  version.  Normally DHCP renewal and release on the TAP
  adapter occurs automatically under Windows, however
  if you set the TAP-Win32 adapter Media Status property
  to "Always Connected", you may need these flags.
* Added --show-net standalone flag to Windows version to
  show OpenVPN's view of the system adapter and routing
  tables.
* Added --show-net-up flag to Windows version to output
  the system routing table and network adapter list to
  the log file after the TAP-Win32 adapter has been brought
  up and any routes have been added.
* Modified Windows version to add routes using the IP Helper
  API rather than by calling route.exe.
* Fixed bug where --route-up script was not being called
  if no --route options were specified.
* Added --mute-replay-warnings to suppress packet replay
  warnings.  This is a common false alarm on WiFi nets.
* Added "def1" flag to --redirect-gateway option to override
  the default gateway by using 0.0.0.0/1 and 128.0.0.0/1
  rather than 0.0.0.0/0.  This has the benefit of overriding
  but not wiping out the original default gateway.
  (Thanks to Jim Carter for pointing out this idea).
* You can now run OpenVPN with a single config file argument.
  For example, you can now say "openvpn config.conf"
  rather than "openvpn --config config.conf".
* On Windows, made --route and --route-delay more adaptive
  with respect to waiting for interfaces referenced by the
  route destination to come up.  Routes added by --route
  should now be added as soon as the interface comes up,
  rather than after an obligatory 10 second delay.  The
  way this works internally is that --route-delay now
  defaults to 0 on Windows.  Previous versions would
  wait for --route-delay seconds then add the routes.
  This version will wait --route-delay seconds and then
  test the routing table at one second intervals for the
  next 30 seconds and will not add the routes until they
  can be added without errors.
* On Windows, don't setsockopt SO_SNDBUF or SO_RCVBUF by
  default on TCP/UDP socket in light of reports that this
  action can have undesirable global side effects on the
  MTU settings of other adapters.  These parameters can
  still be set, but you need to explicitly specify
  --sndbuf and/or --rcvbuf.
* Added --max-clients option to limit the maximum number
  of simultaneously connected clients in server mode.
* Added error message to illuminate shell escape gotcha when
  single backslashes are used in Windows path names.
* Added optional netmask parm to --ifconfig-pool.
* Fixed bug where http-proxy connect retry attempts were
  incorrectly going to the remote OpenVPN server,
  not to the HTTP proxy server.

2004.06.29 -- Version 2.0-beta7

* Fixed bug in link_socket_verify_incoming_addr() which
  under certain circumstances could have caused --float
  behavior even if --float was not specified.
* --tls-auth option now works with --mode server.
  All clients and the server should use the same
  --tls-auth key when operating in client/server mode.
* Added --engine option to make use of OpenSSL-supported
  crypto acceleration hardware.
* Fixed some high verbosity print format size issues
  in event.c for 64 bit platforms (Janne Johansson).
* Made failure to open --log or --log-append file
  a non-fatal error.

2004.06.23 -- Version 2.0-beta6

* Fixed Windows installer to intelligently put
  up a reboot dialog only if tapinstall tells
  us that it's really necessary.
* Fixed "Assertion failed at fragment.c:309"
  bug when --mode server and --fragment are used
  together.
* Ignore HUP, USR1, and USR2 signals during
  initialization.  Prior versions would abort.
* Fixed bug on OS X: "Assertion failed at event.c:406".
* Added --service option to Windows version, for use
  when OpenVPN is being programmatically instantiated
  by another process (see man page for info).
* --log and --log-append options now work on Windows.
* Update OpenBSD INSTALL notes (Janne Johansson).
* Enable multicast on tun interface when running on
  OpenBSD (Pavlin Radoslavov).
* Fixed recent --test-crypto breakage, where options
  such as --cipher were not being parsed correctly.
* Modified options compatibility string by removing
  ifconfig substring if it is empty.  Incremented
  options compatibility string version number to 4.
* Fixed typo in --tls-timeout option parsing
  (Mikael Lonnroth).

2004.06.13 -- Version 2.0-beta5

* Fixed rare --mode server crash that could occur
  if data was being routed to a client at
  high bandwidth at the precise moment that the
  client instance object on the server was being
  deleted.
* Fixed issue on machines which have epoll.h and
  the epoll_create glibc call defined, but which
  don't actually implement epoll in the kernel.
  OpenVPN will now gracefully fall back to the
  poll API in this case.
* Fixed Windows bug which would cause the following
  error in a --mode server --dev tap configuration:
  "resource limit WSA_MAXIMUM_WAIT_EVENTS has been
  exceeded".
* Added CRL (certificate revocation list) management
  scripts to easy-rsa directory (Jon Bendtsen).
* Do a better job of getting the ifconfig component
  of the options consistency check to work correctly
  when --up-delay is used.
* De-inlined some functions which were too complex
  to be inlined anyway with gcc.
* If a --dhcp-option option is pushed to a non-windows
  client, the option will be saved in the client's
  environment before the --up script is called, under
  the name "foreign_option_{n}".
* Added --learn-address script (see man page) which
  allows for firewall access through the VPN to be
  controlled based on the client common name.
* In mode --server mode, when a client connects to
  the server, the server will disconnect any
  still-active clients which use the same common
  name.  Use --duplicate-cn flag to revert to
  previous behavior of allowing multiple clients
  to concurrently connect with the same common name.

2004.06.08 -- Version 2.0-beta4

* Fixed issue with beta3 where Win32 service wrapper
  was keying off of old TAP HWID as a dependency.  To
  ensure that the new service wrapper is correctly
  installed, the Windows install script will uninstall
  the old wrapper before installing the new one,
  causing a reset of service properties.
* Fixed permissions issue on --status output file,
  with default access permissions of owner read/write
  only (default permissions can be changed of course with
  chmod).

2004.06.05 -- Version 2.0-beta3

* More changes to TAP-Win32 driver's INF file which
  affects the placement of the driver in the Windows
  device namespace.  This is done to work around an
  apparent bug in Windows when short HWIDs are used,
  and will also ease the upgrade from 1.x to 2.0 by
  reducing the chances that a reboot will be needed
  on upgrade.  Like beta2, this upgrade will
  delete existing TAP-Win32 interfaces, and reinstall
  a single new interface with default properties.
* Major rewrite of I/O event wait layer in the style
  of libevent.  This is a precursor to TCP support
  in --mode server.
* New feature: --status.  Outputs a SIGUSR2-like
  status summary to a given file, updated once
  per n seconds.  The status file is comma delimited
  for easy machine parsing.
* --ifconfig-pool now remembers common names and
  will try to assign a consistent IP to a given
  common name.  Still to do: persist --ifconfig-pool
  memory across restarts by saving state in file.
* Fixed bug in event timer queue which could cause
  recurring timer events such as --ping to not
  correctly schedule again after firing.  This in
  turn would cause spurrious ping restarts and possible
  connection outages.  Thanks to Denis Vlasenko for
  tracking this down.
* Possible fix to reported bug where --daemon argument
  was not printing to syslog correctly after restart.
* Fixed bug where pulling --route or --dhcp-option
  directives from a server would problematically
  interact with --persist-tun on the client.
* Updated contrib/multilevel-init.patch (Farkas Levente).
* Added RPM build option to .spec and .spec.in files
  to optionally disable LZO inclusion (Ian Pilcher).
* The latest MingW runtime and headers define
  'ssize_t', so a patch is needed (Gisle Vanem).

2004.05.14 -- Version 2.0-beta2

* Fixed signal handling bug in --mode server, where
  SIGHUP and SIGUSR1 were treated as SIGTERM.
* Changed the TAP-Win32 HWID from "TAP" to "TAPDEV".
  Apparently the larger string may work around
  a problem where the TAP adapter is sometimes missing
  from the network connections panel, especially under
  XP SP2. Also note that installing this upgrade will
  uninstall any pre-existing TAP-Win32 adapters, and then
  install a single new adapter, meaning that old adapter
  properties will be lost.  Thanks to Md5Chap for solving
  this one.
* For --mode server --dev tap, the options --ifconfig and
  --ifconfig-pool are now optional.  This allows address
  assignment via DHCP or use of a TAP VPN without
  IP support, as has always been possible with 1.x.
* Fixed bug where --ifconfig may not work correctly on
  Linux 2.2.
* Added 'local' flag to --redirect-gateway for use on
  networks where both OpenVPN daemons are connected
  to a shared subnet, such as wireless.

2004.05.09 -- Version 2.0-beta1

* Unchanged from test29 except for version number
  upgrade.

2004.05.08 -- Version 2.0-test29

* Modified --dev-node on Windows to accept a TAP-Win32
  GUID name.  In addition, --show-adapters will now
  display the high-level name and GUID of each adapter.
  This is an attempt to work around an issue in Windows
  where sometimes the TAP-Win32 adapter installs correctly
  but has no icon in the network connections control
  panel.  In such cases, being able to specify
  --dev-node {TAP-GUID} can work around the missing icon.

2004.05.07 -- Version 2.0-test28

* Fixed bug which could cause segfault on program
  shutdown if --route and --persist-tun are used
  together.

2004.05.06 -- Version 2.0-test27

* Fixed bug in close_instance() which might cause
  memory to be accessed after it had already been freed.
* Fixed bug in verify_callback() that might have
  caused uninitialized data to be referenced.
* --iroute now allows full CIDR subnet routing.
* In "--mode server --dev tun" usage, source addresses
  on VPN packets coming from a particular client must
  be associated with that client in the OpenVPN internal
  routing table.

2004.04.28 -- Version 2.0-test26

* Optimized broadcast path in multi-client mode.
* Added socket buffer size options --rcvbuf & --sndbuf.
* Configure Linux tun/tap driver to use a more sensible
  txqueuelen default.  Also allow explicit setting
  via --txqueuelen option (Harald Roelle).
* The --remote option now allows the port number
  to be specified as the second parameter.  If
  unspecified, the port number defaults to the
  --rport value.
* Multiple --remote options on the client can now be
  specified for load balancing and failover.  The
  --remote-random flag can be used to initially randomize
  the --remote list for basic load balancing.
* If a remote DNS name resolves to multiple DNS addresses,
  one will be chosen by random as a kind of basic
  load-balancing feature if --remote-random is used.
* Added --connect-freq option to control maximum
  new connection frequency in multi-client mode.
* In multi-client mode, all syslog messages associated
  with a specific client now include a client-ID prefix.
* For Windows, use a gettimeofday() function based
  on QueryPerformanceCounter (Derek Burdick).
* Fixed bug in interaction between --key-method 2
  and DES ciphers, where dynamic keys would be generated
  with bad parity and then be rejected.

2004.04.17 -- Version 2.0-test24

* Reworked multi-client broadcast handling.

2004.04.13 -- Version 2.0-test23

* Fixed bug in --dev tun --client-to-client routing.
* Fixed a potential deadlock in --pull.
* Fixed a problem with select() usage which could
  cause a repeating sequence of "select : Invalid
  argument (code=22)"

2004.04.11 -- Version 2.0-test22

* Fixed bug where --mode server + --daemon was
  prematurely closing syslog connection.
* Added support for --redirect-gateway on Mac OS X
  (Jeremy Apple).
* Minor changes to TAP-Win32 driver based on feedback
  from the NDISTest tool.

2004.04.11 -- Version 2.0-test21

* Optimizations in multi-client server event loop.

2004.04.10 -- Version 2.0-test20

* --mode server capability now works with either tun
  or tap interfaces.  When used with tap interfaces,
  OpenVPN will internally bridge all client tap
  interfaces with the server tap interface.
* Connecting clients can now have a client-specific
  configuration on the server, based on the client
  common name embedded in the client certificate.
  See --client-config-dir and --client-connect.
  These options can be used to configure client-specific
  routes.
* Added an option --client-to-client that enables
  internal client-to-client routing or bridging.
  Otherwise, clients will only "see" the server,
  not other connected clients.
* Fixed bug in route scheduling which would have caused
  --mode server to not work on Windows in test18
  and test19 with the sample config file.
* Man page is up to date with all new options.
* OpenVPN 2.0 release notes on web site updated
  with tap-style tunnel examples.

2004.04.02 -- Version 2.0-test19

* Fixed bug where routes pushed from server were
  not working correctly on Windows clients.
* Added Mac OS X route patch (Jeremy Apple).

2004.03.30 -- Version 2.0-test18

* Minor fixes + Windows self-install modified
  to use OpenSSL 0.9.7d.

2004.03.29 -- Version 2.0-test17

* Fixed some bugs related to instance timeout and deletion.
* Extended --push/--pull option to support additional
  option classes.

2004.03.28 -- Version 2.0-test16

* Successful test of --mode udp-server, --push,
  --pull, and --ifconfig-pool with server on
  Linux 2.4 and clients on Linux and Windows.

2004.03.25 -- Version 2.0-test15

* Implemented hash-table lookup of client instances
  based either on remote UDP address/port or remote
  ifconfig endpoint.
* Implemented a randomized binary tree based
  scheduler for scalably scheduling a large number
  of client instance events.  Uses the treap
  data structure and node rotation algorithm
  to keep the tree balanced.
* Initial implementation of ifconfig-pool.
* Made --key-method 2 the default.

2004.03.20 -- Version 2.0-test14

* Implemented --push and --pull.

2004.03.20 -- Version 2.0-test13

* Reduced struct tls_multi and --single-session
  memory footprint.
* Modified --single-session flag to be used
  in multi-client UDP server client instances.

2004.03.19 -- Version 2.0-test12

* Added the key multi-client UDP server options,
  --mode, --push, --pull, and --ifconfig-pool.
* Revamped GC (garbage collection) code to not rely
  on any global data.
* Modifications to thread.[ch] to allow a more
  flexible thread model.

2004.03.16 -- Version 2.0-test11

* Moved all timer code to interval.h, added new file
  interval.c.
* Fixed missing include.

2004.03.16 -- Version 2.0-test10

* More TAP-Win32 fixes.
* Initial debugging and testing of multi.[ch].

2004.03.14 -- Version 2.0-test9

* Branch merge with 1.6-rc3
* More point-to-multipoint work in multi.[ch].
* Major TAP-Win32 driver restructuring to use
  NdisMRegisterDevice instead of
  IoCreateDevice/IoCreateSymbolicLink.
* Changed TAP-Win32 symbolic links to use \DosDevices\Global\
  pathname prefix.
* In the majority of cases, TAP-Win32 should now be
  able to install and uninstall on Win2K without requiring
  a reboot.
* TAP-Win32 MAC address can now be explicitly set in the
  adapter advanced properties page.

2004.03.04 -- Version 2.0-test8

* Branch merge with 1.6-rc2.

2004.03.03 -- Version 2.0-test7

* Branch merge with 1.6-rc1.2.

2004.03.02 -- Version 2.0-test6

* Branch merge with 1.6-rc1.

2004.03.02 -- Version 2.0-test5

* Move Socks5 UDP header append/remove to socks.c, and is
  called from forward.c.
* Moved verify statics from ssl.c into struct tls_session.
* Wrote multi.[ch] to handle top level of point-to-multipoint
  mode.
* Wrote some code to allow a struct link_socket in a child context
  to be slaved to the parent context.
* Broke up packet read and process functions in forward.c
  (from socket or tuntap) into separate functions for read
  and process, so that point-to-point and point-to-multipoint can
  share the same code.
* Expand TLS control channel to allow the passing of configuration
  commands.
* Wrote mroute.[ch] to handle internal packet routing for
  point-to-multipoint mode.

2004.02.22 -- Version 2.0-test3

* Initial work on UDP multi-client server.
* Branch merge of 1.6-beta7

2004.02.14 -- Version 2.0-test2

* Refactorization of openvpn.c into openvpn.[ch]
  init.[ch] forward.[ch] forward-inline.h
  occ.[ch] occ-inline.h  ping.[ch] ping-inline.h
  sig.[ch].  Created a master per-tunnel
  struct context in openvpn.h.
* Branch merge of 1.6-beta6.2

2003.11.06 -- Version 2.0-test1

* Initial testbed for 2.0.

2004.05.09 -- Version 1.6.0

* Unchanged from 1.6-rc4 except for version number
  upgrade.

2004.04.01 -- Version 1.6-rc4

* Made minor customizations to devcon and
  renamed as tapinstall.exe for Windows version.
* Fixed "storage size of `iv' isn't known" build
  problem on FreeBSD.
* OpenSSL 0.9.7d bundled with Windows self-install.

2004.03.13 -- Version 1.6-rc3

* Minor Windows fixes for --ip-win32 dynamic, relating to
  the way the TAP-Win32 driver responds to a DHCP request
  from the Windows DHCP client.
* The net_gateway environmental variable wasn't being
  set correctly for called scripts (Paul Zuber).
* Added code to determine the default gateway on FreeBSD,
  allowing the --redirect-gateway option to work
  (Juan Rodriguez Hervella).

2004.03.04 -- Version 1.6-rc2

* Fixed bug in Windows version where the NetBIOS node-type
  DHCP option might have been passed even if it was not
  specified.
* Fixed bug in Windows version introduced in 1.6-rc1, where
  DHCP timeout would be set to 0 seconds if --ifconfig option
  was used and --ip-win32 option was not explicitly specified.
* Added some new --dhcp-option types for Windows version.

2004.03.02 -- Version 1.6-rc1

* For Windows, make "--ip-win32 dynamic" the default.
* For Windows, make "--route-delay 10" the default
  unless --ip-win32 dynamic is not used or --route-delay
  is explicitly specified.
* L_TLS mutex could have been left in a locked state
  for certain kinds of TLS errors.

2004.02.22 -- Version 1.6-beta7

* Allow scheduling priority increase (--nice) together
  with UID/GID downgrade (--user/--group).
* Code that causes SIGUSR1 restart on TLS errors in TCP
  mode was not activated in pthread builds.
* Save the certificate serial number in an environmental
  variable called tls_serial_{n} prior to calling the
  --tls-verify script.  n is the current cert chain level.
* Added NetBSD IPv6 tunnel capability (also requires
  a kernel patch) (Horst Laschinsky).
* Fixed bug in checking the return value of the nice()
  function (Ian Pilcher).
* Bug fix in new FreeBSD IPv6 over TUN code which was
  originally added in 1.6-beta5 (Nathanael Rensen).
* More Socks5 fixes -- extended the struct frame
  infrastructure to accomodate proxy-based encapsulation
  overhead.
* Added --dhcp-option to Windows version for setting
  adapter properties such as WINS & DNS servers.
* Use a default route-delay of 5 seconds when
  --ip-win32 dynamic is specified (only applicable when
  --route-delay is not explicitly specified).
* Added "log_append" registry variable to control
  whether the OpenVPN service wrapper on Windows
  opens log files in append (log_append="1") or
  truncate (log_append="0") mode.  The default
  is truncate.

2004.02.05 -- Version 1.6-beta6

* UDP over Socks5 fix to accomodate Socks5 encapsulation
  overhead (Christof Meerwald).
* Minor --ip-win32 dynamic tweaks (use long lease time,
  invalidate existing lease with DHCPNAK).

2004.02.01 -- Version 1.6-beta5

* Added Socks5 proxy support (Christof Meerwald).
* IPv6 tun support for FreeBSD (Thomas Glanzmann).
* Special TAP-Win32 debug mode for Windows self-install that was
  enabled in beta4 is now turned off.
* Added some new Solaris notes to INSTALL (Koen Maris).
* More work on --ip-win32 dynamic.

2004.01.27 -- Version 1.6-beta4

* For this beta, the Windows self-install is a debug version
  and will run slower -- use only for testing.
* Reverted the --ip-win32 default back to 'ipapi'
  from 'dynamic'.
* Added the offset parameter to '--ip-win32 dynamic' which
  can be used to control the address of the masqueraded
  DHCP server which replies to Windows DHCP requests.
* Added a wait/nowait option to --inetd (nowait can only
  be used with TCP sockets, TLS authentication, and over
  a bridged configuration -- see FAQ for more info)
  (Stefan `Sec` Zehl).
* Added a build-time capability where TAP-Win32 driver
  debug messages can be output by OpenVPN at --verb 6
  or higher.

2004.01.20 -- Version 1.6-beta2

* Added ./configure --enable-iproute2 flag which
  uses iproute2 instead of route + ifconfig --
  this is necessary for the LEAF Linux distro
  (Martin Hejl).
* Added renewal-time and rebind-time to set of
  DHCP options returned by the TAP-Win32 driver when
  "--ip-win32 dynamic" is used.

2004.01.14 -- Version 1.6-beta1

* Fixed --proxy bug that sometimes caused plaintext
  control info generated by the proxy prior to http
  CONNECT method establishment to be incorrectly
  parsed as OpenVPN data.
* For Windows version, implemented the
  "--ip-win32 dynamic" method and made it the default.
  This method sets the TAP-Win32 adapter IP address
  and netmask by replying to the kernel's DHCP queries.
  See the man page for more detailed info.
* Added --connect-retry parameter which controls
  the time interval (in seconds) between connect()
  retries when --proto tcp-client is used.  Previously,
  this value was hardcoded to 5 seconds, and still
  defaults as such.
* --resolv-retry can now be used with a parameter
  of "infinite" to retry indefinitely.
* Added SSL_CTX_use_certificate_chain_file() to ssl.c
  for support of multi-level certificate chains
  (Sten Kalenda).
* Fixed --tls-auth incompatibility with 1.4.x and earlier
  versions of OpenVPN when the passphrase file is an
  OpenVPN static key file (as generated by --genkey).
* Added shell-escape support in config files using
  the backslash character ("\") so that (for example)
  double quotes can be passed to the shell.
* Added "contrib" subdirectory on tarball, source zip,
  and CVS containing user-submitted contributions.
* Added an optional patch to the Redhat init script to
  allow the configuration file directory to be a
  multi-level directory hierarchy (Farkas Levente).
  See contrib/multilevel-init.patch
* Added some scripts and documentation on using
  Linux "fwmark" iptables rules to enable
  fine-grained routing control over the VPN
  (Sean Reifschneider, <
 jafo@tummy.com>).
  See contrib/openvpn-fwmarkroute-1.00

2003.11.20 -- Version 1.5.0

* Minor documentation changes.

2003.11.04 -- Version 1.5-beta14

* Fixed build problem with ./configure --disable-ssl
  that was reported on Debian woody.
* Fixed bug where --redirect-gateway could not be used
  together with --resolv-retry.

2003.11.03 -- Version 1.5-beta13

* Added CRL (certificate revocation list) capability using
  --crl-verify option (Stefano Bracalenti).
* Added --replay-window option for variable replay-protection
  window sizes.
* Fixed --fragment bug which might have caused certain large
  packets to be sent unfragmented.
* Modified --secret and --tls-auth to permit different cipher and
  HMAC keys to be used for each data flow direction.  Also
  increased static key file size generated by --genkey from
  1024 to 2048 bits, where 512 bits each are reserved for
  send-HMAC, encrypt, receive-HMAC, and decrypt.  Key file forward
  and backward compatibility is maintained.  See --secret option
  documentation on the man page for more info.
* Added --tls-remote option (Teemu Kiviniemi).
* Fixed --tls-cipher documention regarding correct delimiter
  usage (Teemu Kiviniemi).
* Added --key-method option for selecting alternative data
  channel key negotiation methods.  Method 1 is the default.
  Method 2 has been added (see man page for more info).
* Added French translation of HOWTO to web site
  (Guillaume Lehmann).
* Fixed problem caused by late resolver library load on
  certain platforms when --resolv-retry and --chroot are
  used together (Teemu Kiviniemi).
* In TCP mode, all decryption or TLS errors will abort the current
  connection (this is not done in UDP mode because UDP is
  "connectionless").
* Fixed a TCP client reconnect bug that only occurs on the
  BSDs, where connect() fails with an invalid argument.  This
  bug was partially (but not completely) fixed in beta7.
* Added "route_net_gateway" environmental variable which contains
  the pre-existing default gateway address from the routing table
  (there's no standard API for getting the default gateway, so
  right now this feature only works on Windows or Linux).
* Renamed the "route_default_gateway" enviromental variable to
  "route_vpn_gateway" -- this is the remote VPN endpoint.
* The special keywords vpn_gateway, net_gateway, and remote_host
  can now be used for the network or gateway components of the
  --route option.  See the man page for more info.
* Added the --redirect-gateway option to configure the VPN
  as the default gateway (implemented on Linux and Windows only).
* Added the --http-proxy option with basic authentication
  support for use in TCP client mode.  Successfully tested
  using Squid as the HTTP proxy, with and without authentication.

2003.10.12 -- Version 1.5-beta12

* Fixed Linux-only bug in --mktun and --rmtun which was
  introduced around beta8 or so, which would cause
  an error such as "I don't recognize device tun0 as a
  tun or tap device1".
* Added --ifconfig-nowarn option to disable options
  consistency warnings about --ifconfig parameters.
* Don't allow any kind of sequence number backtracking or
  message reordering when in TCP mode.
* Changed beta naming convention to use '_' (underscore)
  rather than '-' (dash) to pacify rpmbuild.

2003.10.08 -- Version 1.5-beta11

* Modified code in the Windows version which sets the IP address
  and netmask of the TAP-Win32 adapter using the IP Helper API.
  Most of the changes involve better error recovery when
  the IP Helper API returns an error status.  See the
  manual page entry on --ip-win32 for more info.

2003.10.08 -- Version 1.5-beta10

* Added getpass() function for Windows version so that --askpass
  option works correctly (Stefano Bracalenti).
* Added reboot advisory to end of Win32 install script.
* Changed crypto code to use pseudo-random IVs rather than
  carrying forward the IV state from the previous packet.
  This is in response to item 2 in the following document:
  http://www.openssl.org/~bodo/tls-cbc.txt which points
  out weaknesses in TLS's use of the same IV carryforward
  approach.  This change does not break protocol compatibility
  with previous versions of OpenVPN.
* Made a change to the crypto replay protection code to also
  protect against certain kinds of packet reordering attacks.
  This change does not break protocol compatibility with
  previous versions of OpenVPN.
* Added --ip-win32 option to provide several choices for
  setting the IP address on the TAP-Win32 adapter.
* #ifdefed out non-CBC crypto modes by default.
* Added --up-delay option to delay TUN/TAP open and --up script
  execution until after connection establishment.  This option
  replaces the earlier windows-only option --tap-delay.

2003.10.01 -- Version 1.5-beta9

* Fixed --route-noexec bug where option was not parsed correctly.
* Complain if --dev tun is specified without --ifconfig on Windows.
* Fixed bug where TCP connections on windows would sometimes cause
  an assertion failure.
* Added a new flag to TAP-Win32 advanced properties that allows one
  to set the adapter to be always "connected" even when an OpenVPN
  process doesn't have it open.  The default behavior is to report
  a media status of connected only when an OpenVPN process has the
  adapter open.
* Rebuilt the Windows self-install distribution with OpenSSL 0.9.7c
  DLLs in response to an OpenSSL security advisory.

2003.09.30 -- Version 1.5-beta8

* Extended the --ifconfig option to work on tap devices as well
  as tun devices.
* Implemented the --ifconfig option for Windows, by calling the
  netsh tool.
* By default, do an "arp -d *" on Windows after TAP-Win32 open to
  refresh the MAC cache.  This behaviour can be disabled with
  --no-arp-del.
* On Windows, allow the --dev-node parameter (which specifies
  the name of the TAP-Win32 adapter) to be omitted in cases where
  there is a single TAP-Win32 adapter on the system which can be
  assumed to be the default.
* Modified the diagnostic --verb 5 debugging level to print 'R'
  for TCP/UDP read, 'W' for TCP/UDP write, 'r' for TUN/TAP read,
  and 'w' for TUN/TAP write.
* Conditionalize OpenBSD read_tun and write_tun based on tun or tap
  mode.
* Added IPv6 tun support to OpenBSD (Thomas Glanzmann).
* Make the --enable-mtu-dynamic ./configure option enabled by
  default.
* Deprecated the --mtu-dynamic run-time option, in favor of
  --fragment.
* DNS names can now be used as --ifconfig parameters.
* Significant work on TAP-Win32 driver to bring up to SMP standards.
* On Windows, fixed dangling IRP problem if TAP-Win32 driver is
  unloaded or disabled, while a user-space process has it open.
* On Windows, if --tun-mtu is not specified, it will be read from
  the TAP-Win32 driver via ioctl.
* On Windows, added TAP-Win32 driver status info to "F2" keyboard
  signal (only when run from a console window).
* Added --mssfix option to control TCP MSS size (YANO Hirokuni).
* Renamed --mtu-dynamic option to --fragment to more accurately
  reflect its function.  Fragment accepts a single parameter which
  is the upper limit on acceptable UDP packet size.
* Changed default --tun-mtu-extra parameter to 32 from 64.
* Eliminated reference to malloc.o in configure.ac.
* Added tun device emulation to the TAP-Win32 driver.
* Added --route and related options.
* Added init script for SuSE Linux (Frank Plohmann).
* Extended option consistency check between peers to function
  in all crypto modes, including static-key and cleartext modes.
  Previously only TLS mode was supported.  Disable with
  --disable-occ.
* Overall, increased the amount of configuration option sanity
  checking, especially of networking parameters.
* Added --mtu-test option for empirical MTU measurement.
* Added Windows-only option --tap-delay to not set the TAP-Win32
  adapter media state to 'connected' until TCP/UDP connection
  establishment with peer.
* Slightly modified --route/--route-delay semantics so that when
  --route is given without --route-delay, routes are added
  immediately after tun/tap device open.  When --route-delay is
  specified, routes will be added n seconds after connection
  initiation, where n is the --route-delay parameter (which
  can be set to 0).
* Made TCP framing error into a non-fatal error that triggers a
  connection reset.

2003.08.28 -- Version 1.5-beta7

* Fixed bug that caused OpenVPN not to respond to exit/restart
  signals when --resolv-retry is used and a local or remote DNS
  name cannot be resolved.
* Exported a series of environmental variables with useful
  info for scripts.  See man page for more info.  Based
  on a suggestion by Anthony Ciaravalo.
* Moved TCP/UDP socket bind to a point in the initialization
  before the --up script gets called.  This is desirable
  because (a) a socket bind failure will happen before
  daemonization, allowing an error status code to be returned
  to the shell and (b) the possibility is eliminated of a
  socket bind failure causing the --up script to be run
  but not the --down script.  This change has a side effect
  that --resolv-retry will no longer work with --local.
* Fixed bug where if an OpenVPN TCP server went down and back
  up again, Solaris or FreeBSD clients would fail to reconnect
  to it.
* Fixed bug that prevented OpenVPN from being run by
  inetd/xinetd in TCP mode.
* Added --log and --log-append options for logging messages to
  a file.
* On Windows, check that the current user is a member of the
  Administrator group before attempting install or uninstall.

2003.08.16 -- Version 1.5-beta6

* Fixed TAP-Win32 driver to properly increment the Rx/Tx count.

2003.08.14 -- Version 1.5-beta5

* Added user-configurability of the TAP-Win32 adapter MTU
  through the adapter advanced properties page.
* Added Windows Service support.
* On Windows, added file association and right-clickability
  for .ovpn files (OpenVPN config files).

2003.08.05 -- Version 1.5-beta4

* Extra refinements and error checking added to Windows
  NSIS install script.

2003.08.05 -- Version 1.5-beta3

* Added md5.h include to crypto.c to fix build problem on
  OpenBSD.
* Created a Win32 installer using NSIS.
* Removed DelService command from TAP-Win32 INF file.  It appears
  to be not necessary and it interfered with the ability to
  uninstall and reinstall the driver without needing to reboot.
* On Windows version, added "addtap" and "deltapall" batch
  files to add and delete TAP-Win32 adapter instances.

2003.07.31 -- Version 1.5-beta2

* Renamed INSTALL.w32 to INSTALL-win32.txt and reformatted
  in Windows ASCII so it's easier to click and view.
* Added postscript and PDF versions of the HOWTO to the web
  site (C R Zamana).
* Merged Michael Clarke's stability patch into TAP-Win32
  driver which appears to fix the suspend/resume driver bug
  and significantly improve driver stability.
* Added Christof Meerwald's Media Status patch to the
  TAP-Win32 driver which shows the TAP adapter to be
  disconnected when OpenVPN is not running.
* Moved socket connect and TCP server listen code to a later
  point in openvpn() function so that the TCP server listen
  state is entered after daemonization.
* Added keyboard shortcuts to simulate signals in the Windows
  version, see the window title bar for descriptions.

2003.07.24 -- Version 1.5-beta1

* Added TCP support via the new --proto option.
* Renamed udp-centric options such as --udp-mtu to
  --link-mtu (old option names preserved for compatibility).
* Ported to Windows 2000 + XP using mingw and a TAP driver
  derived from the Cipe-Win32 project by Damion K. Wilson.
* Added --show-adapters flag for windows version.
* Reworked the SSL/TLS packet acknowledge code to better
  handle certain corner cases.
* Turned off the default enabling of IP forwarding in the
  sample-scripts/openvpn.init script for Redhat.
  Forwarding can be enabled by users in their --up scripts
  or firewall config.
* Added --up-restart option based on suggestion from Sean
  Reifschneider.
* If --dev tap or --dev-type tap is specified, --tun-mtu
  defaults to 1500 and --tun-mtu-extra defaults to 64.
* Enabled --verb 5 debugging mode that prints 'R' and 'W'
  for each packet read or write on the TCP/UDP socket.

2003.08.04 -- Version 1.4.3

* Added md5.h include to crypto.c
  to fix build problem on OpenBSD.

2003.07.15 -- Version 1.4.2

* Removed adaptive bandwidth from
  --mtu-dynamic -- its absence appears
  to work better than its existence (1.4.1.2).
* Minor changes to --shaper to fix long
  retransmit timeouts at low bandwidth
  (1.4.1.2).
* Added LOG_RW flag to openvpn.h for
  debugging (1.4.1.2).
* Silenced spurious configure warnings (1.4.1.2).
* Backed out --dev-name patch, modified --dev
  to offer equivalent functionality (1.4.1.4).
* Added an optional parameter to --daemon and
  --inetd to support the passing of a custom
  program name to the system logger (1.4.1.5).
* Add compiled-in options to the program title
  (1.4.1.5).
* Coded the beginnings of a WIN32 port (1.4.1.5).
* Succeeded in porting to Win32 Mingw environment
  and running loopback tests (1.4.1.6).  Still
  need a kernel driver for full Win32
  functionality.
* Fixed a bug in error.h where
  HAVE_CPP_VARARG_MACRO_GCC was misspelled.
  This would have caused a significant slowdown
  of OpenVPN when built by compilers that
  lack ISO C99 vararg macros (1.4.1.6).
* Created an init script for Gentoo Linux
  in ./gentoo directory (1.4.1.6).

2003.05.15 -- Version 1.4.1

* Modified the Linux 2.4 TUN/TAP open code to
  fall back to the 2.2 TUN/TAP interface if the
  open or ioctl fails.
* Fixed bug when --verb is set to 0 and non-fatal
  socket errors occur, causing 100% CPU utilization.
  Occurs on platorms where
  EXTENDED_SOCKET_ERROR_CAPABILITY is defined,
  such as Linux 2.4.
* Fixed typo in tun.c that was preventing
  OpenBSD build.
* Added --enable-mtu-dynamic configure option
  to enable --mtu-dynamic experimental option.

2003.05.07 -- Version 1.4.0

* Added --replay-persist feature to allow replay
  protection across sessions.
* Fixed bug where --ifconfig could not be used
  with --tun-mtu.
* Added --tun-mtu-extra parameter to deal with
  the situation where a read on a TUN/TAP device
  returns more data than the device's MTU size.
* Fixed bug where some IPv6 support code for
  Linux was not being properly ifdefed out for
  Linux 2.2, causing compile errors.
* Added OPENVPN_EXIT_STATUS_x codes to
  openvpn.h to control which status value
  openvpn returns to its caller (such as
  a shell or inetd/xinetd) for various conditions.
* Added OPENVPN_DEBUG_COMMAND_LINE flag to
  openvpn.h to allow debugging in situations
  where stdout, stderr, and syslog cannot be used
  for message output, such as when OpenVPN is
  instantiated by inetd/xinetd.
* Removed owner-execute permission from file
  created by static key generator (Herbert Xu
  and Alberto Gonzalez Iniesta).
* Added --passtos option to allow IPv4 TOS bits
  to be passed from TUN/TAP input packets to
  the outgoing UDP socket (Craig Knox).
* Added code to prevent open socket file descriptors
  from being accessible to called scripts.
* Added --dev-name option (Christian Lademann).
* Added --mtu-disc option for manual control
  over MTU options.
* Show OS MTU value on UDP socket write failures
  (linux only).
* Numerous build system and portability
  fixes (Matthias Andree).
* Added better sensing of compiler support for
  variable argument macros, including (a) gcc
  style, (b) ISO C 1999 style, and (c) no support.
* Removed generated files from CVS.  Note INSTALL
  file for new CVS build commands.
* Changed certain internal symbol names
  for C standards compliance.
* Added TUN/TAP open code to cycle dynamically
  through unit numbers until it finds a free
  unit (based on code from Thomas Gielfeldt
  and VTun).
* Added dynamic MTU and fragmenting infrastructure
  (Experimental).  Rebuild with FRAGMENT_ENABLE
  defined to enable.
* Minor changes to SSL/TLS negotiation, use
  exponential backoff on retransmits, and use
  a smaller MTU size (note that no protocol
  changes have been made which would break
  compatibility with 1.3.x).
* Added --enable-strict-options flag
  to ./configure.  This option will cause
  a more strict check for options compatibility
  between peers when SSL/TLS negotiation is used,
  but should only be used when both OpenVPN peers
  are of the same version.
* Reorganization of debugging levels.
* Added a workaround in configure.ac for
  default SSL header location on Linux
  to fix RH9 build problem.
* Fixed potential deadlock when pthread support
  is used on OSes that allocate a small socketpair()
  message buffer.
* Fixed openvpn.init to be sh compliant
  (Bishop Clark).
* Changed --daemon to wait until all
  initialization is finished before becoming a
  daemon, for the benefit of initialization
  scripts that want a useful return status from
  the openvpn command.
* Made openvpn.init script more robust, including
  positive indication of initialization errors
  in the openvpn daemon and better sanity checks.
* Changed --chroot to wait until initialization
  is finished before calling chroot(), and allow
  the use of --user and --group with --chroot.
* When syslog logging is enabled (--daemon or
  --inetd), set stdin/stdout/stderr to point
  to /dev/null.
* For inetd instantiations, dup socket descriptor
  to a >2 value.
* Fixed bug in verify-cn script, where test would
  incorrectly fail if CN=x was the last component
  of the X509 composite string (Anonymous).
* Added Markus F.X.J. Oberhumer's special
  license exception to COPYING.

2002.10.23 -- Version 1.3.2

* Added SSL_CTX_set_client_CA_list call
  to follow the canonical form for TLS initialization
  recommended by the OpenSSL docs.  This change allows
  better support for intermediate CAs and has no impact
  on security.
* Added build-inter script to easy-rsa package, to
  facilitate the generation of intermediate CAs.
* Ported to NetBSD (Dimitri Goldin).
* Fixed minor bug in easy-rsa/sign-req.  It refers to
  openssl.cnf file, instead of $KEY_CONFIG, like all
  other scripts (Ernesto Baschny).
* Added --days 3650 to the root CA generation command
  in the HOWTO to override the woefully small 30 day
  default (Dominik 'Aeneas' Schnitzer).
* Fixed bug where --ping-restart would sometimes
  not re-resolve remote DNS hostname.
* Added --tun-ipv6 option and related infrastructure
  support for IPv6 over tun.
* Added IPv6 over tun support for Linux (Aaron Sethman).
* Added FreeBSD 4.1.1+ TUN/TAP driver notes to
  INSTALL (Matthias Andree).
* Added inetd/xinetd support (--inetd) including
  documentation in the HOWTO.
* Added "Important Note on the use of commercial certificate
  authorities (CAs) with OpenVPN" to HOWTO based on
  issues raised on the openvpn-users list.

2002.07.10 -- Version 1.3.1

* Fixed bug in openvpn.spec and openvpn.init
  which caused RPM upgrade to fail.

2002.07.10 -- Version 1.3.0

* Added --dev-node option to allow explicit selection of
  tun/tap device node.
* Removed mlockall call from child thread, as it doesn't
  appear to be necessary (child thread inherits mlockall
  state from parent).
* Added --ping-timer-rem which causes timer for --ping-exit
  and --ping-restart not to run unless we have a remote IP
  address.
* Added condrestart to openvpn.init and openvpn.spec
  (Bishop Clark).
* Added --ifconfig case for FreeBSD (Matthias Andree).
* Call openlog with facility=LOG_DAEMON (Matthias Andree).
* Changed LOG_INFO messages to LOG_NOTICE.
* Added warning when key files are group/others accessible.
* Added --single-session flag for TLS mode.
* Fixed bug where --writepid would segfault if used with
  an invalid filename.
* Fixed bug where --ipchange status message was formatted
  incorrectly.
* Print more concise error message when system() call
  fails.
* Added --disable-occ option.
* Added --local, --remote, and --ifconfig options sanity
  check.
* Changed default UDP MTU to 1300 and TUN/TAP MTU to
  1300.
* Successfully tested with OpenSSL 0.9.7 Beta 2.
* Broke out debug level definitions to errlevel.h
* Minor documentation and web site changes.
* All changes maintain protocol compatibility
  with OpenVPN versions since 1.1.0, however default
  MTU changes will require setting the MTU explicitly
  by command line option, if you want 1.3.0 to
  communicate with previous versions.

2002.06.12 -- Version 1.2.1

* Added --ping-restart option to restart
  connection on ping timeout using SIGUSR1
  logic (Matthias Andree).
* Added --persist-tun, --persist-key,
  --persist-local-ip, and --persist-remote-ip
  options for finer-grained control over SIGUSR1
  and --ping-restart restarts.  To
  replicate previous SIGUSR1 functionality,
  use --persist-remote-ip.
* Changed residual IV fetching code to take
  IV from tail of ciphertext.
* Added check to make sure that CFB or OFB
  cipher modes are only used with SSL/TLS
  authentication mode, and added a caveat
  to INSTALL.
* Changed signal handling during initialization
  (including re-initialization during restarts)
  to exit on SIGTERM or SIGINT and ignore other
  signals which would ordinarily be caught.
* Added --resolv-retry option to allow
  retries on hostname resolution.
* Expanded the --float option to also
  allow dynamic changes in source port number
  on incoming datagrams.
* Added --mute option to limit repetitive
  logging of similar message types.
* Added --group option to downgrade GID
  after initialization.
* Try to set ifconfig path automatically
  in configure.
* Added --ifconfig code for Mac OS X
  (Christoph Pfisterer).
* Moved "Peer Connection Initiated" message
  to --verb level 1.
* Successfully tested with
  OpenSSL 0.9.7 Beta 1 and AES cipher.
* Added RPM notes to INSTALL.
* Added ACX_PTHREAD (from the autoconf
  macro archive) to configure.ac
  to figure out the right pthread
  options for a given platform.
* Broke out macro definitions from
  configure.ac to acinclude.m4.
* Minor changes to docs and HOWTO.
* All changes maintain protocol compatibility
  with OpenVPN versions since 1.1.0.

2002.05.22 -- Version 1.2.0

* Added configuration file support via
  the --config option.
* Added pthread support to improve latency.
  With pthread support, OpenVPN
  will offload CPU-intensive tasks such as RSA
  key number crunching to a background thread
  to improve tunnel packet forwarding
  latency.  pthread support can be enabled
  with the --enable-pthread configure option.
  Pthread support is currently available
  only for Linux and Solaris.
* Added --dev-type option so that tun/tap
  device names don't need to begin with
  "tun" or "tap".
* Added --writepid option to write main
  process ID to a file.
* Numerous portability fixes to ease
  porting to other OSes including changing
  all network types to uint8_t and uint32_t,
  and not assuming that time_t is 32 bits.
* Backported to OpenSSL 0.9.5.
* Ported to Solaris.
* Finished OpenBSD port except for
  pthread support.
* Added initialization script:
  sample-scripts/openvpn.init
  (Douglas Keller)
* Ported to Mac OS X (Christoph Pfisterer).
* Improved resilience to DoS attacks when
  TLS mode is used without --remote or
  --tls-auth, or when --float is used
  with --remote.  Note however that the best
  defense against DoS attacks in TLS mode
  is to use --tls-auth.
* Eliminated automake/autoconf dependency
  for non-developers.
* Ported configure.in to configure.ac
  and autoconf 2.50+.
* SIGHUP signal now causes OpenVPN to restart
  and re-read command line and or config file,
  in conformance with canonical daemon behaviour.
* SIGUSR1 now does what SIGHUP did in
  version 1.1.1 and earlier -- close and reopen
  the UDP socket for use when DHCP changes
  host's IP address and preserve most recently
  authenticated peer address without rereading
  config file.
* SIGUSR2 added -- outputs current statistics,
  including compression statistics.
* All changes maintain protocol compatibility
  with 1.1.1 and 1.1.0.

2002.04.22 -- Version 1.1.1

* Added --ifconfig option to automatically configure
  TUN device.
* Added inactivity disconnect (--inactive
  and --ping-exit options).
* Added --ping option to keep stateful firewalls
  from timing out.
* Added sanity check to command line parser to
  err if any TLS options are used in non-TLS mode.
* Fixed build problem with compiler environments that
  define printf as a macro.
* Fixed build problem on linux systems that have
  an integrated TUN/TAP driver but lack the persistent
  tunnel feature (TUNSETPERSIST).  Some linux kernels
  >= 2.4.0 and < 2.4.7 fall into this category.
* Changed all calls to EVP_CipherInit to use explicit
  encrypt/decrypt mode in order to fix problem with
  IDEA-CBC and AES-256-CBC ciphers.
* Minor changes to control channel transmit limiter
  algorithm to fix problem where TLS control channel
  might not renegotiate within the default 60 second window.
* Simplified man page examples by taking advantage
  of the new --ifconfig option.
* Minor changes to configure.in to check more
  rigourously for OpenSSL 0.9.6 or greater.
* Put back openvpn.spec, eliminated
  openvpn.spec.in.
* Modified openvpn.spec to reflect new automake-based
  build environment (Bishop Clark).
* Other documentation changes.
* Added --test-crypto option for debugging.
* Added "missing" and "mkinstalldirs" automake
  support files.

2002.04.09 -- Version 1.1.0

* Strengthened replay protection and IV handling,
  extending it fully to both static key and
  TLS dynamic key exchange modes.
* Added --mlock option to disable paging and ensure that key
  material and tunnel data is never paged to disk.
* Added optional traffic shaping feature to cap the maximum
  data rate of the tunnel.
* Converted to automake (The Platypus Brothers 2002-04-01).
* Ported to OpenBSD by Janne Johansson.
* Added --tun-af-inet option to work around an incompatibility
  between Linux and BSD tun drivers.
* Sequence number-based replay protection using the
  IPSec sliding window model is now the default,
  disable with --no-replay.
* Explicit IV is now the default, disable with --no-iv.
* Disabled all cipher modes except CBC, CFB, and OFB.
* In CBC mode, use explicit IV and carry forward residuals,
  using IPSec model.
* In CFB/OFB mode, IV is timestamp, sequence number.
* Eliminated --packet-id, --timestamp, and max-delta parameter to
  the --tls-auth option as they are now supplanted by improved
  replay code which is enabled by default.
* Eliminated --rand-iv as it is now obsolete with improved
  IV code.
* Eliminated --reneg-err option as it increases vulnerability
  to DoS attacks.
* Added weak key check for DES ciphers.
* --tls-freq option is no longer specified on the command line,
  instead it now inherits its parameter from the
  --tls-timeout option.
* Fixed bug that would try to free memory on exit that was
  never malloced if --comp-lzo was not specified.
* Errata fixed in the man page examples: "test-ca" should be
  "tmp-ca".
* Updated manual page.
* Preliminary work in porting to OpenSSL 0.9.7.
* Changed license to allowing linking with OpenSSL.

2002.03.29 -- Version 1.0.3

* Fixed a problem in configure with library ordering on the
  command line.

2002.03.28 -- Version 1.0.2

* Improved the efficiency of the inner event loop.
* Fixed a minor bug with timeout handling.
* Improved the build system to build on RH 6.2 through 7.2.
* Added an openvpn.spec file for RPM builders (Bishop Clark).

2002.03.23 -- Version 1.0

* Added TLS-based authentication and key exchange.
* Added gremlin mode to stress test.
* Wrote man page.

2001.12.26 -- Version 0.91

* Added any choice of cipher or HMAC digest.

2001.5.13 -- Version 0.90

* Initial release.
* IP tunnel over UDP, with blowfish cipher and SHA1 HMAC signature.

The Ingate product is easy to install and directly provides full VoIP and data security in any network environment since it includes its own advanced firewall/router.** Connect the IP PBX to a SIP Trunk For enterprises wanting to make full use of their installed IP-PBXs and not only communicate over IP within the enterprise, but also outside the enterprise the Ingate SIP Trunking offers an easy and smooth transition to a modern and future-proofed SIP trunk provided by an Internet Telephony Service Provider to connect to the traditional PSTN network. SIP trunks can offer significant cost-savings for enterprises, eliminating the need for local PSTN gateways, costly ISDN BRIs (Basic Rate Interfaces) or PRIs (Primary Rate Interfaces). What is SIP Trunking? SIP trunking is a service offered by Internet Telephony Service Providers (ITSPs) which permits businesses to adopt Voice-over-IP (VoIP) using the same connection as the Internet connection and remain in touch with others who rely on the PSTN as the enterprise IP-PBX is connected to the service provider’s PSTN gateways over the Internet.  SIP Trunking IP-PBX Solving the NAT/Firewall Traversal problem **Ingate's SIP Trunking software, working in conjunction with an Ingate SIParator®/Firewall®, solves the Network Address Translation (NAT) traversal issues that are faced by businesses using a SIP trunk.**  Together, they control both incoming and outgoing communications and route the communication to the intended users. All voice traffic (as well as data traffic) must traverse the enterprise firewall/NAT. However, SIP traffic cannot traverse traditional enterprise firewalls and NAT devices. As a result, the firewall/NAT device blocks all SIP traffic, which includes VoIP. Ingate resolves the [SIP NAT](/solving-sip-voip-nat-problem) issue, enabling enterprises to utilize SIP trunks. Advantages and Benefits of SIP Trunking SIP trunking provides flexible solutions for growing enterprises, along with significant cost-savings.   * **Eliminating the need for local PSTN gateways, costly ISDN BRIs (Basic Rate Interfaces) and PRIs (Primary Rate Interfaces).** SIP trunking offers substantial cost benefits over PRI. SIP Trunking allows enterprises and small businesses to eliminate a PSTN gateway at their site and outsource that function to a carrier. * **Least Cost Routing (LCR), call worldwide for the cost of local calls.** Ingate’s flexible routing functions allow for calls to be routed to specified service providers in order to leverage the best rates. By choosing Ingate, calls to anywhere worldwide can be made for the cost of a local call, which means no more long-distance charges. By routing calls to the cheapest service provider based on country codes, significant savings can be achieved. * **Reliability & redundancy with multiple service providers.** SIP trunking is a reliable technology and it comes with redundancy as multiple SIP trunks can be chosen. If a connection to one ITSP goes down, the Ingate can immediately transfer the traffic to another ITSP. * **Only ONE connection needed for both data and voice.** Instead of paying for and maintaining both data and telephone voice networks, with SIP trunking only one connection is needed. In addition, SIP trunking facilitates the growth, by avoiding the need to invest in PSTN gateways and additional line cards as the number of additional users increase.  Advanced Routing Capabilities Ingate SIP Trunking provides advanced routing capabilities that enable enterprises to connect to SIP trunks. Frequently, the SIP traffic coming from the PBX to be routed to the ITSP (and vice versa) is neither written in the format that the other expects nor contains the correct routing information to get it to its intended destination. Ingate’s SIP Trunking software can overcome these issues, and provide a seamless connection to and from the provider.  Ingate SIP Trunking can handle authentication at the service provider to validate the enterprise as the correct user of the SIP trunk. It also provides the flexibility to interoperate with carrier-specific requirements like numbering plans. Support for Multiple SIP Trunks **Eliminating international calling costs, Ingate SIP Trunking can direct international calls to national, or local, PSTN lines within the country being called.**  Businesses can use multiple service providers by establishing least cost routing rules, and switch between them depending on which offers the best possible rates (which may vary by time, day or location). Long distance calls cost the same as a local call, reducing expenses for businesses as well as their customers, partners, etc. trying to reach, for example, the corporate sales force. The support for multiple SIP trunks also offers redundancy. If a connection to one ITSP goes down, Ingate can immediately transfer the traffic to another ITSP. ENUM Support Ingate SIP Trunking supports ENUM. This feature can automatically look up phone numbers to determine whether they match a known SIP address, allowing the call to be completed over the Internet (instead of transferring it out to the PSTN). Since no traffic is placed on the PSTN, ENUM provides an additional means of cost-savings for businesses that communicate with other firms using SIP. Security Over The Public Internet Ingate SIP Trunking works with the Ingate SIParator®/Firewall® to leverage all the security benefits available with SIP communications. Ingate’s enterprise-class Firewalls secure data and SIP traffic, while SIParators secure SIP media while leaving the traditional firewall in place (working in parallel to the SIParator) to secure data traffic. Both products feature Ingate’s full SIP proxy technology, which allows for advanced filtering, verification, authentication and routing, as well as dynamic control of the opening and closing of media ports. They also encrypt the SIP signaling using Transport Layer Security (TLS) and media (voice, video, etc.) using Secure RTP (SRTP). With encryption, sessions are kept private with no chance of eavesdropping. Easy SIP Trunk configuration with the Startup Tool The Startup Tool is an installation tool for SIParator®/Firewall® products using the Ingate SIP Trunking software, which facilitates the setup of complete SIP trunking solutions. The tool will automatically configure a user’s Ingate SIParator®/Firewall® to work with the IP-PBX or SIP trunking service provider of their choice. With the push of a button, the configuration tool will automatically create a SIP trunk connection designed to the user’s individual setup.  Read more about the tool [here](/Startup_Tool_TG). Confirmed interoperability Ingate has confirmed interoperability several of the leading IP-PBX vendors and ITSPs.

CVE Name: CVE-2006-2937, CVE-2006-2940, CVE-2006-3738, CVE-2006-4343
For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit .
0. Revision History
v1.0 2006-09-28 Initial release.
v1.1 2006-09-29 Corrected patch.
I. Background
FreeBSD includes software from the OpenSSL Project. The OpenSSL Project is
a collaborative effort to develop a robust, commercial-grade, full-featured,
and Open Source toolkit implementing the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3)
and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols as well as a full-strength
general purpose cryptography library.
II. Problem Description
Several problems have been found in OpenSSL:
1. During the parsing of certain invalid ASN1 structures an error condition
is mishandled, possibly resulting in an infinite loop. [CVE-2006-2937]
2. A buffer overflow exists in the SSL\_get\_shared\_ciphers function.
[CVE-2006-3738]
3. A NULL pointer may be dereferenced in the SSL version 2 client code.
[CVE-2006-4343]
In addition, many applications using OpenSSL do not perform any validation
of the lengths of public keys being used. [CVE-2006-2940]
III. Impact
Servers which parse ASN1 data from untrusted sources may be vulnerable to
a denial of service attack. [CVE-2006-2937]
An attacker accessing a server which uses SSL version 2 may be able to
execute arbitrary code with the privileges of that server. [CVE-2006-3738]
A malicious SSL server can cause clients connecting using SSL version 2 to
crash. [CVE-2006-4343]
Applications which perform public key operations using untrusted keys may
be vulnerable to a denial of service attack. [CVE-2006-2940]
IV. Workaround
No workaround is available, but not all of the vulnerabilities mentioned
affect all applications.
V. Solution
Perform one of the following:
1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to 4-STABLE, 5-STABLE, or 6-STABLE,
or to the RELENG\_6\_1, RELENG\_6\_0, RELENG\_5\_5, RELENG\_5\_4, RELENG\_5\_3,
or RELENG\_4\_11 security branch dated after the correction date.
2) To patch your present system:
The following patch has been verified to apply to FreeBSD 4.11, 5.3,
5.4, 5.5, 6.0, and 6.1 systems.
a) Download the patch from the location below, and verify the detached
PGP signature using your PGP utility.
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-06:23/openssl.patch
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-06:23/openssl.patch.asc
NOTE: The patch distributed at the time of the original advisory was
incorrect. Systems to which the original patch was applied should be
patched with the following corrective patch, which contains only the
changes between the original and updated patch:
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-06:23/openssl-correction.patch
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-06:23/openssl-correction.patch.asc
b) Execute the following commands as root:
# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch
c) Recompile the operating system as described in
 and reboot the
system.
NOTE: Any third-party applications, including those installed from the
FreeBSD ports collection, which are statically linked to libcrypto(3)
should be recompiled in order to use the corrected code.
NOTE ALSO: The above patch reduces the functionality of libcrypto(3) by
prohibiting the use of exceptionally large public keys. It is believed
that no existing applications legitimately use such key lengths as would
be affected by this change.

corrected in FreeBSD.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

##### 1. Summary

Several critical security vulnerabilities have been addressed in the newest releases of VMware's hosted product line.

#####

##### 2. Relevant releases

VMware Workstation 6.0.2 and earlier
VMware Workstation 5.5.4 and earlier
VMware Player 2.0.2 and earlier
VMware Player 1.0.4 and earlier
VMware ACE 2.0.2 and earlier
VMware ACE 1.0.2 and earlier
VMware Server 1.0.4 and earlier
VMware Fusion 1.1.1 and earlier

##### 3. Problem description

a. Host to guest shared folder (HGFS) traversal vulnerability
On Windows hosts, if you have configured a VMware host to guest shared folder (HGFS), it is possible for a program running in the guest to gain access to the host's file system and create or modify executable files in sensitive locations.

NOTE: VMware Server is not affected because it doesn't use host to guest shared folders. No versions of ESX Server, including ESX Server 3i, are affected by this vulnerability. Because ESX Server is based on a bare-metal hypervisor architecture and not a hosted architecture, and it doesn't include any shared folder abilities. Fusion and Linux based hosted products are unaffected.

VMware would like to thank CORE Security Technologies for working with us on this issue. This addresses advisory CORE-2007-0930.

The Common Vulnerabilities and exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2008-0923 to this issue.

#####

b. Insecure named pipes
An internal security audit determined that a malicious Windows user could attain and exploit LocalSystem privileges by causing the authd process to connect to a named pipe that is opened and controlled by the malicious user.

The same internal security audit determined that a malicious Windows user could exploit an insecurely created named pipe object to escalate privileges or create a denial of service attack. In this situation, the malicious user could successfully impersonate authd and attain privileges under which Authd is executing.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names CVE-2008-1361, CVE-2008-1362 to these issues.

#####

e. VIX API default setting changed to a more secure default value
Workstation 6.0.2 allowed anonymous console access to the guest by means of the VIX API. This release, Workstation 6.0.3, disables this feature.

This means that the Eclipse Integrated Virtual Debugger and the Visual Studio Integrated Virtual Debugger will now prompt for user account credentials to access a guest.

i. Virtual Machine Communication Interface (VMCI) memory corruption resulting in denial of service
VMCI was introduced in VMware Workstation 6.0, VMware Player 2.0, and VMware ACE 2.0. It is an experimental, optional feature and it may be possible to crash the host system by making specially crafted calls to the VMCI interface. This may result in denial of service via memory exhaustion and memory corruption.

VMware would like to thank Andrew Honig of the Department of Defense for reporting this issue.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2008-1340 to this issue.

# USN-353-1: openssl vulnerabilities

29 September 2006

openssl vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)
* [Ubuntu 5.10](/security/notices?release=breezy)
* [Ubuntu 5.04](/security/notices?release=hoary)

## Details

Dr. Henson of the OpenSSL core team and Open Network Security

discovered a mishandled error condition in the ASN.1 parser. By

sending specially crafted packet data, a remote attacker could exploit

this to trigger an infinite loop, which would render the service

unusable and consume all available system memory. ([CVE-2006-2937](/security/CVE-2006-2937))

Certain types of public key could take disproportionate amounts of

time to process. The library now limits the maximum key exponent size

to avoid Denial of Service attacks. ([CVE-2006-2940](/security/CVE-2006-2940))

Tavis Ormandy and Will Drewry of the Google Security Team discovered a

buffer overflow in the SSL\_get\_shared\_ciphers() function. By sending

specially crafted packets to applications that use this function (like

Exim, MySQL, or the openssl command line tool), a remote attacker

could exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the server's

privileges. ([CVE-2006-3738](/security/CVE-2006-3738))

Tavis Ormandy and Will Drewry of the Google Security Team reported

that the get\_server\_hello() function did not sufficiently check the

client's session certificate. This could be exploited to crash clients

by remote attackers sending specially crafted SSL responses.

([CVE-2006-4343](/security/CVE-2006-4343))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 6.06

* libssl0.9.8
  -
  0.9.8a-7ubuntu0.2

##### Ubuntu 5.10

* libssl0.9.7
  -
  0.9.7g-1ubuntu1.3

##### Ubuntu 5.04

* libssl0.9.7
  -
  0.9.7e-3ubuntu0.4

After a standard system upgrade you need to reboot your computer to

effect the necessary changes.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
