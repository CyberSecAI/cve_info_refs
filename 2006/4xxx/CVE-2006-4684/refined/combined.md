Package        : zope2.7
Vulnerability  : programming error
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2006-4684

It was discovered that the Zope web application server does not disable
the csv_table directive in web pages containing ReST markup, allowing
the exposure of files readable by the Zope server.

For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.7.5-2sarge2.

The unstable distribution (sid) doesn't contain zope2.7 any longer, for
zope2.8 this problem has been fixed in version 2.8.8-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your Zope package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

# [Zope-Annce] Hotfix for Further reST Integration Issue

**Jim Fulton**
jim at zope.com

*Mon Aug 21 16:06:38 EDT 2006*

* Previous message: [[Zope-Annce] Zope 3.3.0 beta 2 released!](002003.html)
* Next message: [[Zope-Annce] [German Zope Conference] Reminder/Correction](002006.html)

After reviewing the docutils / reStructuredText integration in Zope
2, we have discovered that versions 2.7.0 - 2.7.8 and 2.8.0 - 2.8.8
are vulnerable to a further information disclosure exploit.

Overview

This hotfix removes the exploit by disabling the reStructuredText
feature which exposes the vulnerability. This vulnerability has been
fixed on the 2.8 branch, and will thus not be present in any future
release from that branch (2.8.9 or later).

Zope2 versions from 2.9 and the trunk are not vulnerable to this
exploit.

Note that this hotfix fixes a problem not attressed by the earlier
reStructuredText integration hotfix ; that hotfix needs to remain
installed until after upgrading to a fixed version of Zope.
Hotfix

We have prepared a hot fix for this problem at:

<http://www.zope.org/Products/Zope/Hotfix-2006-08-21/Hotfix-20060821/.>

This hotfix should be installed as soon as possible.

To install, simply extract the archive into your Products directory
in your Zope installation.

See: <http://www.zope.org/Products/Zope/Hotfix-2006-08-21/>
Hotfix-20060821/README.txt,

for installation instructions.

It is important to install this hotfix as soon as possible.

This fix will disable the reStructuredText csv-table directive.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
