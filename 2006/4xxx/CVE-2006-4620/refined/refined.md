{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A domain administrator within the default domain of a MDaemon server can gain access to the server's \"MDaemon\" account through WebAdmin by manipulating the useredit_account.wdm module.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The WebAdmin interface does not properly restrict access to the \"MDaemon\" account's details via a crafted URL, allowing modification of the mailbox to which this account directs its queue.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious domain administrator can take over the \"MDaemon\" system account. This allows them to access the system queue, which contains messages for all domains on the server, not just the local one, potentially leading to compromise of sensitive data.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exploited through sending a specially crafted URL to the useredit_account.wdm module within the WebAdmin interface. ",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be a domain administrator within the default domain of a MDaemon server. They require the ability to send HTTP requests to the WebAdmin interface to exploit the vulnerability remotely."
