{
  "CVE-2006-4333": {
    "Description": "If the SSCOP dissector has a port range configured and the SSCOP payload protocol is Q.2931, a malformed packet could make the Q.2931 dissector use up available memory. No port range is configured by default.",
    "Root cause": "A malformed packet sent to the Q.2931 dissector, when used as payload for SSCOP with a configured port range, triggers excessive memory consumption.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of malformed packets leading to excessive memory usage."
    ],
    "Impact": "A denial-of-service condition can occur due to the excessive memory usage, causing Wireshark to crash or become unresponsive.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Sending a malformed packet over the network.",
        "Convincing a user to open a malformed capture file."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker must be able to inject a malformed network packet, or provide a malformed trace file, to a system running a vulnerable version of Wireshark with the SSCOP dissector enabled, a port range configured, and the SSCOP payload protocol set to Q.2931."
