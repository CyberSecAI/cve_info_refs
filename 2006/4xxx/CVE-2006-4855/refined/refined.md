Based on the provided content, here's the information related to CVE-2006-4855:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The SymEvent driver in Norton Personal Firewall does not sufficiently validate its input buffer. It allows arbitrary data to be sent to it without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insufficient input validation.
- Lack of protection against malicious manipulation of the driver.
- Driver implicitly trusts the data sent to it.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can send crafted data to the driver leading to an invalid memory operation.
- The vulnerability can cause a crash of the operating system, resulting in a denial of service.
- The attacker could potentially gain further impacts, but those were not explicitly examined in the report.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local attack.
- An attacker can open the vulnerable driver and send arbitrary data.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs local access to the system with the vulnerable software installed.
- No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Vulnerable software:**
- Norton Personal Firewall 2006 version 9.1.0.33
- Likely all versions of Norton Personal Firewall 2006 and Norton Internet Security 2006
- Possibly older versions of Norton Personal Firewall and Norton Internet Security

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by David Matousek.
- A proof of concept and source code was made available.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 4.9, with an impact subscore of 6.9, and an exploitability subscore of 3.9.
- The attack complexity is low.
- The confidentiality and integrity impact are none, while the availability impact is complete.
