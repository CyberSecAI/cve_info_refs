Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2006-4987:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of proper input validation in the Wili-CMS application, specifically related to the `globals[content_dir]` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application is vulnerable to RFI through the `globals[content_dir]` parameter in several files (`article.php`, `root.php`, `dates_list.php`). This allows an attacker to include a remote file by setting this parameter to a URL.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application has XSS vulnerabilities in `relocate.php` and `print_button.php` due to unsanitized input.
- **Full Path Disclosure (FPD):** The application discloses the full path of files through parameters like the `filename` parameter in `thumbnail.php`. FPD also occurs in `functions/admin/all.php`, `functions/admin/init_session.php`, `functions/all.php`, and in admin templates.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **RFI:** An attacker can include and execute arbitrary code from a remote server, potentially leading to complete compromise of the server, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **XSS:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the application, allowing them to steal user session cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or deface the website.
- **FPD:** An attacker can gain valuable information about the server's file system structure, which might be useful for planning more sophisticated attacks or for discovering sensitive configuration files.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **RFI:** By manipulating the `globals[content_dir]` parameter in the URL of the vulnerable files.
- **XSS:** By injecting JavaScript code into the URL of the vulnerable files (e.g., `relocate.php` and `print_button.php`)
- **FPD:** By providing specific file names to the `filename` parameter in `thumbnail.php` or by accessing the vulnerable files directly.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **RFI:** The attacker needs to be able to make requests to the server, and host a malicious file on a remote server.
- **XSS:** The attacker only needs to be able to make requests to the server.
- **FPD:** The attacker needs to be able to make requests to the server.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content indicates that there may be "many other XSS and Full Path vulnerabilities" beyond those specifically listed.
- The vulnerability report was published on 2006-09-28 / 2006-09-29, and the original discovery was by "HACKERS PAL".
