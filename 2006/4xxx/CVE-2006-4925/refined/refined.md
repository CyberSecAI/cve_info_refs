  "CVE-2006-4925": {
    "Description": "The provided content describes two vulnerabilities in OpenSSH. CVE-2006-4925 refers to a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability in sshd servers when using SSH protocol version 1. A remote attacker can send a malicious SSH message with multiple identical blocks, which triggers an inefficient O(N^3) compensation attack detector, causing 100% CPU usage until the LoginGraceTime expires. This attack has a low impact but allows a small amount of traffic to saturate the host CPU.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability lies in the inefficient implementation of the compensation attack detector, which uses an O(N^3) algorithm when processing SSH protocol version 1 messages containing multiple identical blocks. This allows a remote attacker to trigger excessive CPU usage on the server.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Inefficient algorithm for detecting compensation attacks",
      "Lack of proper input validation/rate limiting"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of Service (DoS). A remote attacker can cause high CPU usage on the server, potentially preventing legitimate users from connecting or disrupting existing SSH sessions.",
    "Attack vectors": "Remote. The attacker sends specially crafted SSH messages to the vulnerable SSH server.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker can be remote and needs network access to the vulnerable SSH server. They do not need to be authenticated."
