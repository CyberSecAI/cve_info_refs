{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the way the `phpbb_root_path` variable is handled in the `bb_usage_stats.php` file. The script directly includes files based on the value provided in this variable without proper sanitization or validation.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)",
        "Lack of input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can include and execute arbitrary code from a remote server. This could lead to complete compromise of the affected system, including data theft, malware installation, or denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": "A malicious user can manipulate the `phpbb_root_path` parameter in the URL to point to a malicious PHP file hosted on an external server. When `bb_usage_stats.php` includes the specified file, the attacker's code will be executed on the server.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and host a malicious PHP file on a server accessible to the vulnerable application."
