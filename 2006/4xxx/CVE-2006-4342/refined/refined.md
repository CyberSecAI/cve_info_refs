{
  "CVE-2006-4342": {
    "description": "A flaw in the IPC shared-memory implementation that allowed a local user to cause a denial of service (deadlock) that resulted in freezing the system.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability occurs due to a race condition between the shmat() and shmctl(IPC_RMID) system calls. When shmat() is executed concurrently with shmctl(IPC_RMID) for the same shared memory segment, the shmat process can get stuck waiting at a spinlock in the ipc_lock function. Simultaneously, shmctl deletes the path to the kern_ipc_perm structure (which holds the spinlock) and frees the memory. Thus, ipc_unlock() does not unlock the spinlock, leading to a deadlock and causing the shmat process to wait indefinitely.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Race condition",
      "Improper synchronization",
       "Memory corruption"
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS) by triggering a deadlock, resulting in system freeze.  This issue could also cause other deadlocks related to IPC features (e.g., IPC semaphore).",
    "attack_vectors": "Local access to the system.",
     "required_capabilities": "An authenticated local user with the ability to execute shmat() and shmctl() system calls."
