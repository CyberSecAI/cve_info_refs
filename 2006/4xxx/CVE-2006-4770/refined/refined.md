Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) flaw present in the `skiny` parameter of the `dodatki/menu.php` file. This parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to include a remote file.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    *   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The core vulnerability is the ability to include and execute arbitrary remote files on the server.

*   **Impact of exploitation**:
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious PHP file, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the vulnerable application, leading to a complete compromise of the server.
    *   **Data theft:** The attacker can read sensitive data like database credentials
    *   **Defacement:** The attacker can modify or delete contents on the website.
    *   **Malware propagation:** The attacker can use the compromised server to distribute malware.

*   **Attack vectors**:
    *   **HTTP GET Request**: The attacker crafts a malicious URL that injects a remote file path into the `skiny` parameter of `dodatki/menu.php`. This crafted URL is sent to the server through an HTTP GET request.

*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    *   **Network access**: The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
    *   **Remote Server**: The attacker needs a server to host the malicious PHP file that will be included in the vulnerable application.

**Technical Details**:

The exploit code provided is a Perl script that automates the attack process. It takes three command-line arguments:

1.  **`<MiniPort@l Location>`**: The base URL of the vulnerable MiniPort@l installation.
2.  **`<shell location>`**: The URL of the remote PHP shell file.
3.  **`<shell cmd>`**: The variable name used in the remote PHP shell to pass commands.

The script constructs a malicious URL by appending the provided arguments to `dodatki/menu.php?skiny=`. It then uses LWP::UserAgent to send a GET request to the crafted URL.

The script then enters a loop to send commands to the remote shell. It prompts the user for a command, sends it to the server via the crafted URL, and prints the output.
