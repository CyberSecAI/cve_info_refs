  "CVE-2006-4567": {
    "Description": "The Firefox and Thunderbird auto-update mechanism protects itself against DNS spoofing using SSL; only a site presenting a valid certificate for aus2.mozilla.org will be trusted as a source of update information. Jon Oberheide points out, however, that many users accept unverifiable self-signed certificates without much thought on \"low value\" sites, and this could be used as the basis of an attack on the update system.",
    "Root cause": "The auto-update mechanism trusts user-accepted certificates without properly verifying their validity for the update process.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient verification of SSL certificates during auto-updates.",
      "Trusting user-accepted certificates for critical system updates.",
      "Vulnerable to DNS spoofing attacks combined with user-accepted certificates."
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine by hijacking the auto-update process and serving malicious updates.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "DNS spoofing",
      "Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks",
      "Social engineering to get users to accept unverifiable certificates"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be in a position to spoof DNS and intercept traffic between the user and the update server. They must also trick the user into accepting a malicious certificate.",
    "Additional details": "The vulnerability can be exploited if a user accepts a self-signed or otherwise invalid certificate for an arbitrary website. The attacker spoofs DNS to redirect the auto-update process to a malicious server. The previously accepted certificate is then trusted for the update server, allowing the attacker to serve malicious updates. The vulnerability is triggered when a user clicks 'Help -> Check for Updates' or when Firefox/Thunderbird automatically checks for updates. A patch was created which checks the issuer of the certificate during auto-updates.",
      "Affected software": [
        "Mozilla Firefox",
        "Mozilla Thunderbird"
      ]
