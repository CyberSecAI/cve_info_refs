        "rootCause": "A DoS vulnerability exists in sshd servers with ssh protocol version 1 enabled. A remote attacker can send a pathological ssh message with multiple identical blocks, causing the O(N^3) compensation attack detector to use 100% available CPU until LoginGraceTime expires.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "The vulnerability lies in the CRC compensation attack detector within OpenSSH when processing multiple identical blocks in an SSHv1 packet which results in computationally expensive operations (O(N^3))."

          "Remote, unauthenticated attacker sends specially crafted SSHv1 packets.",
