    {
      "CVE_ID": "CVE-2006-4055",
      "description": "TSEP 0.942 has a remote file inclusion vulnerability in colorswitch.php. When register_globals is enabled, the tsep_config[absPath] parameter can be used to include remote files.",
      "root_cause": "The application uses the 'tsep_config[absPath]' parameter without proper sanitization which allows an attacker to specify a remote file URL, leading to remote file inclusion.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)"
      ],
       "impact": "An attacker can include and execute malicious code from a remote server, potentially leading to full system compromise. This could involve arbitrary code execution, data theft, or other malicious actions.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "HTTP GET request"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to send a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable script with a modified 'tsep_config[absPath]' parameter. The server also needs to have 'register_globals' enabled.",
