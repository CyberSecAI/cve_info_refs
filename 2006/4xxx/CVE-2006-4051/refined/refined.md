Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2006-4051:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `global.php` file of PHP Live Helper 2.0. The `abs_path` parameter is not properly sanitized before being used in `require_once` and `include_once` statements.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The lack of proper sanitization allows an attacker to inject arbitrary URLs into the `abs_path` parameter. This enables the inclusion of remote files, leading to the execution of malicious PHP code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **System access:** By including and executing remote files containing malicious code, attackers can gain full control over the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET request:** The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious HTTP GET request to `global.php` with a manipulated `abs_path` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote attacker:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely over the network.
- **Basic web request knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to craft and send HTTP GET requests.
- **Malicious file hosting:** The attacker requires a server to host the malicious PHP file that they will include remotely.
