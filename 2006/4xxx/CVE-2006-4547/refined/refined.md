{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A design flaw in the Lyris ListManager's web-based administrative interface.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The web form used to add an administrator to a list contains a hidden form field (`MEMBERS\_.List\_`) that specifies the target list. This field can be manipulated by an attacker to add an administrator to an arbitrary list.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker who is an administrator of one list can add an arbitrary user as an administrator to any other list on the same server. This could allow an attacker to intercept or disrupt communications on lists they should not have access to.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack is performed by manipulating the value of the hidden form field `MEMBERS\_.List\_` in the web-based administration interface before submitting the form. This can be done using tools like TamperData for Firefox.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be an existing administrator of at least one list on the vulnerable Lyris ListManager server."
