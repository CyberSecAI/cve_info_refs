firefox security update (RHSA-2006-0675)

Original Release Date: October 12, 2006

Last Revised: October 12, 2006

Number: ASA-2006-224

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 1.0

Advisory Status: Interim

---

## 1. Overview:

Firefox is a popular open source Web browser.

Vulnerable versions of Firefox were found to contain bugs in the
regular
expression parsing routines. When viewing a malformed and/or
malicious
webpage, Firefox could possibly crash or arbitrary code could be
executed
as the user running Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures
project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names
[CVE-2006-4565](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4565) and
[CVE-2006-4566](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4566) to these issues.

Numerous unspecified vulnerabilities were found in Firefox which
could allow
a malicious web page to crash Firefox or possibly execute arbitrary
code as
the user running Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2006-4571](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4571) to this issue.

Firefox's handling of timed Javascript events was found to contain a
security
vulnerability. If Firefox viewed a malformed webpage, it could crash
or
arbitrary code could be executed as the user running Firefox. The
Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned
the name
[CVE-2006-4253](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4253) to this issue.

The NSS library Firefox bundles internally was found to contain a bug
in its
implementation of RSA signature verification. If an RSA key had an
exponent
of 3, an attacker could possibly craft a digital signature that would
appear
to be from a Certificate Authority that hadn't actually signed the
certificate. A small number of the root Certificate Authority RSA
keys
Firefox shipped with contained an exponent of 3. The Common
Vulnerabilities
and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2006-4340](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4340) to this issue.

The auto-update verification mechanism in Firefox was found to
contain a
security vulnerability. If a malicious attacker could get a user to
accept
an unverifiable certificate and then get the user to read spoofed DNS
entries, the attacker could get Firefox to download and install
arbitrary
code. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the name
[CVE-2006-4567](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4567) to this issue.

A cross-site scripting issue was found in Firefox's handling of
sub-frames
when the sub-frame belonged to a different domain than the main
frame. A
frame could possibly inject content into the sub-frame belonging to
another
domain. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the name
[CVE-2006-4568](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4568) to this issue.

Due to a flaw in Firefox's handling of blocked popups that were
manually
blocked, a cross-site scripting attack was possible where a malicious
attacker could possibly get a user to manually open a blocked popup.
The
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the
name
[CVE-2006-4569](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4569) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the
security
advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2006-0675.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with Firefox installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Messaging Storage Server | MSS 3.0 | Low | See recommended actions below.  This issue will be addressed in accordance with [Avaya's Product Security Vulnerability Response Policy](http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/security_vulnerability_response.pdf) |

**Recommended Actions:**
For all system products which use
vulnerable
versions of Firefox, Avaya recommends that customers restrict local
and
network access to the server. This restriction should be enforced
through the
use of physical security, firewalls, ACLs, VPNs, and other
generally-accepted
networking practices until such time as an update becomes available
and can
be installed.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating
systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying
operating
system or applications that come with the operating system. These
vulnerabilities often do not impact the software-only product
directly but
may threaten the integrity of the underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not
affected by
the vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be.
Customers should determine on which Linux operating system the
product was
installed and then follow that vendors guidance:

## 4. Software-Only Products:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CVLAN | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. The CVLAN application does not require the software described in this advisory. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite(IMS) | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. The IMS application does not require the software described in this advisory. |

**Recommended Actions:**
Avaya recommends that customers follow
recommended actions supplied by the Operating System vendor (e.g.
RedHat
Linux) or remove the affected package.

## 5. Additional Information:

Additional information may also be available via the Avaya support
[website](http://support.avaya.com) and through your Avaya
account
representative. Please contact your Avaya product support
representative, or

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 5.10](/security/notices?release=breezy)
* [Ubuntu 5.04](/security/notices?release=hoary)

## Details

Various flaws have been reported that allow an attacker to execute

arbitrary code with user privileges by tricking the user into opening

a malicious URL. ([CVE-2006-2788](/security/CVE-2006-2788), [CVE-2006-3805](/security/CVE-2006-3805), [CVE-2006-3806](/security/CVE-2006-3806),

[CVE-2006-3807](/security/CVE-2006-3807), [CVE-2006-3809](/security/CVE-2006-3809), [CVE-2006-3811](/security/CVE-2006-3811), [CVE-2006-4565](/security/CVE-2006-4565),

[CVE-2006-4568](/security/CVE-2006-4568), [CVE-2006-4571](/security/CVE-2006-4571))

A bug was found in the script handler for automatic proxy

configuration. A malicious proxy could send scripts which could

execute arbitrary code with the user's privileges. ([CVE-2006-3808](/security/CVE-2006-3808))

The NSS library did not sufficiently check the padding of PKCS #1 v1.5

signatures if the exponent of the public key is 3 (which is widely

used for CAs). This could be exploited to forge valid signatures

without the need of the secret key. ([CVE-2006-4340](/security/CVE-2006-4340))

Georgi Guninski discovered that even with JavaScript disabled, a

malicous email could still execute JavaScript when the message is

viewed, replied to, or forwarded by putting the script in a remote XBL

file loaded by the message. ([CVE-2006-4570](/security/CVE-2006-4570))

Several security related problems have been discovered in Mozilla and
derived products.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following vulnerabilities:

CVE-2006-2788

    Fernando Ribeiro discovered that a vulnerability in the getRawDER
    functionallows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
    (hang) and possibly execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2006-4340

    Daniel Bleichenbacher recently described an implementation error
    in RSA signature verification that cause the application to
    incorrectly trust SSL certificates.

CVE-2006-4565, CVE-2006-4566

    Priit Laes reported that that a JavaScript regular expression can
    trigger a heap-based buffer overflow which allows remote attackers
    to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2006-4568

    A vulnerability has been discovered that allows remote attackers
    to bypass the security model and inject content into the sub-frame
    of another site.

CVE-2006-4570

    Georgi Guninski demonstrated that even with JavaScript disabled in
    mail (the default) an attacker can still execute JavaScript when a
    mail message is viewed, replied to, or forwarded.

CVE-2006-4571

    Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in Firefox, Thunderbird and
    SeaMonkey allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service,
    corrupt memory, and possibly execute arbitrary code.

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.7.8-1sarge7.3.1.

We recommend that you upgrade your Mozilla package.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Mozilla Network Security Service (NSS): RSA signature forgery — GLSA **200610-06**

NSS fails to properly validate PKCS #1 v1.5 signatures.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-libs/nss** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.11.3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.11.3** |

### Background

The Mozilla Network Security Service is a library implementing security
features like SSL v.2/v.3, TLS, PKCS #5, PKCS #7, PKCS #11, PKCS #12,
S/MIME and X.509 certificates.

### Description

Daniel Bleichenbacher discovered that it might be possible to forge
signatures signed by RSA keys with the exponent of 3. This affects a
number of RSA signature implementations, including Mozilla's NSS.

### Impact

Since several Certificate Authorities (CAs) are using an exponent of 3
it might be possible for an attacker to create a key with a false CA
signature. This impacts any software using the NSS library, like the
Mozilla products Firefox, Thunderbird and Seamonkey.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All NSS users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/nss-3.11.3"
```

Note: As usual after updating a library, you should run
'revdep-rebuild' (from the app-portage/gentoolkit package) to ensure
that all applications linked to it are properly rebuilt.

| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=351079#c0)• 18 years ago |
|  | |

This bug is similar to, but not the same as, [bug 350640](/show_bug.cgi?id=350640 "RESOLVED FIXED - rsa signature verification ignores garbage bytes (CVE-2006-4340)").
There are many paths through NSS for RSA signature verification.
Some of them supply the expected "DigestInfo" as input to the
verification function, which compares the entire digestInfo with
the one extracted from the "decrypted" signature.
But most of them don't work that way.
Instead, most paths parse the DigestInfo from the decrypted signature
into its component parts, and then examine (some of) them.
The DigestInfo contains a "DigestAlgorithm" and a "Digest" (hash value).
The DigestAlgorithm contains an Algorithm IDentifier OID, and an optional
octet (byte) string of "parameters".
We always check the hash value. Some paths check the Algorithm ID OID,
to ensure that it's at least a known OID. None check the parameters.
This gives an attacker room to create forgeries.
We need to
a) always check the OID for being a known valid OID. It would be best
if we checked it against a single expected value, or at least against
a small list of expected values. And,
b) always check the parameters. I \*think\* they should be empty, (not sure),
but we mustn't allow them to be arbitrary size (e.g. 100 bytes) and
contain "random" cruft.
If we give an attacker a place to hide a hundred bytes of "random"
stuff, we are vulnerable to forged signatures.
I don't yet know how easy this is to exploit, so I cannot yet rate this vulnerability as being critical or even high. If this is exploitable
with ordinary computer resources (no super computers required) then it
is "high" vulnerability.

Attached patch

[patch v1](attachment.cgi?id=236478&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=236478&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=351079&attachment=236478)

This patch addresses the vulnerability, in all places I found it, except 1,
which is RSA\_CheckSign, called only from NSC\_Verify. This function does not
verify that the caller is passing in the entire DigestIinfo. So the caller
could pass in just the raw hash value, without the AlgorithmID and parameters,
and this function could still pass, ignoring the signature's values for
those fields.
I need to investigate the formal definition of C\_Verify to see if it is
permitted to use less than the full DER-encoded digestInfo.

I still dislike the algorithm flexibility as part of signature interpretation.
The certifying key has an attribute stating which algorithm it signs with, afaik. It should get checked that the subject at hand indeed matches the algorithm.
A way to avoid interpreting anything alien is to pad out the expected hash according to the CA cert and compare the entirety of the padded image against the one resulting from raising the signature.
And yes, constructing a fake cert to tickle this bug requires no searching or heavy computation. Instant gratification, once one gets past the DER encoding intricacies.

I like this way of checking, at least unless we can get a lot of testing on other ways.
I seem to remember there were issues that some toolkits produced signatures with explicitly encoded NULLs for the parameters and some which encoded the parameter field as blank.

Marius, did you really mean 'key'? most public keys (in particular RSA public keys), have no way of restricting which hash algorithms you need to use with the key. This is why the Hash oid is encoded in the signature blob.
Most X509 signatures have an algorithm parameter which specifies the hash and the signing algorithm.
This value is checked against the one that is specified by this code before the hash is even processed. If the values don't match the code fails. (Note it's important to make this check one way or the other. Either the OID is passed in or the oid is passed out).
Older programs had cases where they had raw RSA signatures and fetched the hash from that signature. NSS maintains binary compatibility with those programs.

I was referring to the attributes that come with a self-signed cert (i.e. the CA roots?), which seem to include an algorithm specifier. I'm by no means expert on what get interpreted how, but to me that would the correct, unambiguous way to go: the algorithm/interpretation gets specified along with the public key.
I understand the legacy problem and the history behind optional becoming mandatory null etc.
That said, I know of no way around the patch as proposed, given the limited set of tolerated algorithms.
At some point in the future, when another algorithm is added to the trusted set, hopefully this co-dependency gets taken into account.

I was mistaken. It does check. So patch 1 above addresses all the potential
vulnerabilities I've found so far.

patch v1
r=wtc.
These checks should be centralized in SGN\_DecodeDigestInfo
so that all its callers benefit automatically.
PKCS #1 v2.1 only allows MD2, MD5, SHA-1, SHA-224 (added
later), SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512 as the digest algorithm
in DigestInfo, and the parameters for these digest algorithms
are all NULL. So the checks should only allow these 7
digest algorithms and should only allow NULL algorithm
parameters.
The maximum algorithm parameters length of 2 is a magic
number.

Hi marius,
The only hash specifier in a certificate is the hash specifier for the actual signature on the certificate itself. This mirrors the identifier inside the signature or RSA (sort off, the outer oid specifies something like RSA with SHA1, the inner oid just specifies sha1). This does not say anything about what the key is allowed to sign. Once you go up the certificate chain to intermediates, it may not be possible for the hash to match the key that's verified (the signer may be an RSA certificate MD2 signature and the key a DSA which can only use SHA1).

Regarding [comment 12](/show_bug.cgi?id=351079#c12 "RESOLVED FIXED - RSA signature DigestInfo not checked properly in NSS (CVE-2006-4340)"):
I think we want to continue to keep decoding separate from validating.
I believe we want to be able to decode the digestInfo, even if we
subsequently decide that the decoded value is not acceptable.
Testing for a valid/known OID, as opposed to testing for one of a smaller
set of OIDs, allows us to add new hash OIDs without having to modify
this code again.
I agree that 2 is a magic number, designed to be just large enough to
permit decoded NULLs. Perhaps in a subsequent patch to the trunk,
we can define a symbol for it, perhaps in util/secoidt.h, perhaps
#define SEC\_ALGORITHM\_ID\_PARAMETERS\_BYTES\_MAX 2
but I wanted to get this reviewed patch checked in now, in case this
bug is blocking FF2.

Then we should check that di->digestAlgorithm.parameters is
a decoded NULL. The lesson we should learn from these two
bugs is that every byte in the RSA-decrypted block should be
accounted for.

(In reply to [comment #11](/show_bug.cgi?id=351079#c11 "RESOLVED FIXED - RSA signature DigestInfo not checked properly in NSS (CVE-2006-4340)"))
Nelson, all good variants to test indeed. Also, the NULL parameter with non-null data is an interesting one.
Unittests for the DER signature blob parser should be able to take plaintext DER blobs, which are 'easily' constructed for the variants.
Actually constructing the fake signatures is the hard way to tickle that code.
Perhaps a testing root CA with public exponent 1 goes a long way; I'm not familiar at all with the Mozilla testing framework.
I'll try to find some time later today and prep these cube roots for the 2048 bit case, just for kicks. If someone would care to list the input DER encodings for the variants, that'd save me some hexediting time.

I believe the lesson is that there should be no "large" blocks of bytes that
are unaccounted/uncontrolled. I have defined "large" as exceeding two bytes.

Marius, I'll contact you outside of bugzilla about the test certs.
I can tell by mere code inspection whether mozilla/NSS is vulnerable to
any of these. Test certs for the other cases would facilitate "black box"
testing of numerous implementations.

Bob Relyea recommends we add this fix to Mozilla as soon as possible.
I just filed [bug 351494](/show_bug.cgi?id=351494 "RESOLVED FIXED - Upgrade to NSS_3_11_20060905_TAG") to update NSS on Mozilla's trunk to a snapshot that includes Nelson's patch. I will check in today so we'll have it on the trunk ASAP.
For branches, including MOZILLA\_1\_8\_BRANCH, Bob is ok to take the isolated patch only.

[multiple flavors of forged certs for localhost](attachment.cgi?id=237001)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=237001&action=edit)

6 flavors of ASN1 signature blobs as forged signatures, for the 2048 bit modulus, exponent 3 case.
See testcases.README for details.
testcase-A.crt is the original test cert with garbage after proper sig blob,
testcase-B.crt is the 2nd one with the additional parameter inside the sig blob.
And then some variations. Only A & B fool my unpatched firefox & openssl but other implementations/configurations might be less lucky.
I'll add some more. Suggestions welcome.

patch v1
The ASN.1 NULL is encoded as two octets: 0x05 (tag) 0x00 (length).
This explains the magic number 2 in this patch.
I found that Microsoft Outlook Express checks the digest algorithm
identifier's parameters is an encoded NULL. I created a signature
in which the digest algorithm identifier's parameters is 0x38 0x00.
Outlook Express says the signature is invalid, while Thunderbird
says the signature is valid.
While researching the parameters for the digest algorithms, I found
that PKCS #1 seems to require a NULL parameters to be present in the
digest algorithm identifier, even though in general an AlgorithmIdentifier's
parameters field is optional. The following comment in
SGN\_CreateDigestInfo seems to support this:
/\*
\* PKCS #1 specifies that the AlgorithmID must have a NULL parameter
\* (as opposed to no parameter at all).
\*/
But I found that Outlook Express also allows a digest algortihm
identifier with a missing parameters.

In reply to [comment 29](/show_bug.cgi?id=351079#c29 "RESOLVED FIXED - RSA signature DigestInfo not checked properly in NSS (CVE-2006-4340)"),
Yes, the magic length of 2 is to permit optional NULLs. (I thought that was
known.) Some implementations don't supply those NULLs in the signatures they
create. They rely on the fact that algorithm parameters are declared optional.
And they expect other implementations to honor that declaration.
NSS interoperates with both flavors of parameters: explicit NULL, and omitted.
I did not want the fix for this bug to break any valid signatures accepted
by NSS before the fix.
Yes, we could write code that more strictly permits only parameter length of
zero, or paramater length of 2 with value 0x0500. I wouldn't oppose such an
implementation, but I believe it is unnecessary. I didn't do that because
I have been told (by an unnamed cryptographer :) that 2 bytes is not enough
space to be exploitable in the manner of the forgeries being considered here
(not enough to permit the construction of a perfect cube). Perhaps Marius
would like to comment on that.
Now that Marius has developed additional test forgeries for the other test
cases that seemed like potentials, and NSS has shown not to be vulnerable to them (only to case a, subject of [bug 350640](/show_bug.cgi?id=350640 "RESOLVED FIXED - rsa signature verification ignores garbage bytes (CVE-2006-4340)"), and case b), I feel very
confident that mozilla can proceed to respin FF2 based on the existing
patches for these two bugs. (Many Thanks! Marius)
Has this patch been checked into a enough branches that this bug can now be
marked resolved/fixed?

# USN-352-1: Thunderbird vulnerabilities

25 September 2006

Thunderbird vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Details

Various flaws have been reported that allow an attacker to execute

arbitrary code with user privileges by tricking the user into opening

a malicious email containing JavaScript. Please note that JavaScript

is disabled by default for emails, and it is not recommended to enable

it. ([CVE-2006-4253](/security/CVE-2006-4253), [CVE-2006-4565](/security/CVE-2006-4565), [CVE-2006-4566](/security/CVE-2006-4566), [CVE-2006-4571](/security/CVE-2006-4571))

The NSS library did not sufficiently check the padding of PKCS #1 v1.5

signatures if the exponent of the public key is 3 (which is widely

used for CAs). This could be exploited to forge valid signatures

without the need of the secret key. ([CVE-2006-4340](/security/CVE-2006-4340))

Jon Oberheide reported a way how a remote attacker could trick users

into downloading arbitrary extensions with circumventing the normal

SSL certificate check. The attacker would have to be in a position to

spoof the victim's DNS, causing them to connect to sites of the

attacker's choosing rather than the sites intended by the victim. If

they gained that control and the victim accepted the attacker's cert

for the Mozilla update site, then the next update check could be

hijacked and redirected to the attacker's site without

detection. ([CVE-2006-4567](/security/CVE-2006-4567))

Georgi Guninski discovered that even with JavaScript disabled, a

malicous email could still execute JavaScript when the message is

viewed, replied to, or forwarded by putting the script in a remote XBL

file loaded by the message. ([CVE-2006-4570](/security/CVE-2006-4570))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 6.06

* mozilla-thunderbird
  -
  1.5.0.7-0ubuntu0.6.06

After a standard system upgrade you need to restart Thunderbird to

effect the necessary changes.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2006-60

## RSA Signature Forgery

Announced
September 14, 2006
Reporter
Philip Mackenzie, Marius Schilder
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox, NSS, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox 1.5.0.7
* NSS 3.11.3
* SeaMonkey 1.0.5
* Thunderbird 1.5.0.7

### Description

Philip Mackenzie and Marius Schilder of Google informed us of Daniel Bleichenbacher's
recent presentation of a common implementation error in RSA signature verification,
a failure to account for extra data in the signature. For signatures with a small
exponent such as 3 it is possible for an attacker to calculate a value for this extra data to make an altered message appear to be correctly signed, allowing the signature to be forged.
Mozilla's Network Security Services (NSS) library was vulnerable to this flaw.

Because the set of root Certificate Authorities that ship with Mozilla clients
contain some with an exponent of 3 it was possible to make up certificates,
such as SSL/TLS and email certificates, that were not detected as invalid.
This raised the possibility of the sort of Man-in-the-Middle attacks
SSL/TLS was invented to prevent.

We thank Philip Mackenzie and Marius Schilder for bringing
this result to our attention and working with us to ensure the NSS library was
safe from variations on this basic attack.

### Workaround

None, upgrade to a fixed version.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

My own re-reading of the code doesn't concur with the above analysis.
There are 4 functions that do RSA signature verification, all in
security/nss/lib/softoken/rsawrapr.c
They are:
RSA\_CheckSign (PKCS#1)
RSA\_CheckSignRecover (PKCS#1)
RSA\_CheckSignRaw (not PKCS#1)
RSA\_CheckSignRecoverRaw (not PKCS#1)
So, the two routines of interest are the ones for PKCS#1.
The first one checks that the hash is contained in the right-most
(least significant) bytes of the output of the RSA private key calculation.
So there is no room for garbage to follow it there.
RSA\_CheckSignRecover returns the decrypted result, including DER hash
and anything following it to the caller. It is the caller's duty to
determine if the result is expected. That function is called through/from
the PKCS#11 API call C\_VerifyRecoverInit, and from a function named
RSA\_HashCheckSign, which passes the entire result to a DER decoder,
which should return error if the input is too long.
I'll have to do more checking of the callers of C\_VerifyRecoverInit, to
see if they check the results properly. But it surely appears to me that
the (garbage) would be detected by RSA\_CheckSign.

Darin, we would like to discuss this with your co-worker
Philip Mackenzie.
RSA\_CheckSignRecover and its caller DecryptSigBlock are
the functions most commonly used to verify an RSA signature.
We should find out whether SEC\_ASN1DecodeItem fails if there is
extra input. Since secasn1d.c doesn't contain the error code
SEC\_ERROR\_EXTRA\_INPUT, it's possible that SEC\_ASN1DecodeItem
doesn't detect that error.

Nelson's correct about the caller duty. Anything below the PKCS #11 layer cannot determine, a priori, how long the signature data is supposed to be, or if it supposed to be DER data, since in some cases it's not (SSL for instance).
We need to check in one of the following places:
sec\_vfy.c or SGN\_DecodeDigestInfo in util/secdig.c
Our SECASN1\_Decoders do not throw errors if you provide more data than it needs, which is reasonable behavior for decodes (be accepting of what you send). In this case, however we will need to verify that there is no additional data in the block.

RSA\_HashCheckSign calls SGN\_DecodeDigestInfo which calls SEC\_ASN1DecodeItem
which doesn't check that the input is entirely consumed. So there it is.
I think QuickDER decoder does check it.
If signature hashes are always DER encoded (are they)? then we could just
call QuickDer instead of SEC\_ASN1DecodeItem in SGN)DecodeDigestInfo.

I added SEC\_ERROR\_EXTRA\_INPUT when I coded QuickDER . IIRC, the original decoder ignores extra input. I don't remember anyone ever reporting that they got that error from QuickDER, so I think it's a reasonable thing to enforce.

nelson... err almost. We currently don't use the multi-part functions in our verification code. The code that's failing is sec\_vfy.c, but it's calling the same SEC\_DecodeDigestInfo function in segdig.c.
Julien, is there any reason we didn't update this function when we did the mass change to QuickDecoder? Can signature data be BER decoded (to ask nelson's question in other words)?

Bob, RSA\_HashCheckSIgn does a RSA\_CheckSignRecover call, and then decodes
the result. Its only caller is sftk\_hashCheckSign, which in turn is only
called by NSC\_VerifyInit (in several places). Given that C\_VerifyInit
never returns the result of the verification (it's not C\_VerifyRecoverInit),
why does it internally use the blapi RSA\_CheckSignRecover function?
Why doesn't it use RSA\_CheckSign ?
How difficult would it be to change NSC\_VerifyInit to stop using RSA\_CheckSignRecover and start using RSA\_CheckSign?
Tonight I will write a patch to SGN\_DecodeDigestInfo to switch it to use
the QuickDER decoder. It will have to copy the input digest data into the
arenapool first, since QuickDER won't do that (unlike the old decoder).

Bob,
I think this one got skipped because it wasn't a performance win . It cannot be BER encoded.
This change isn't mentioned specifically by name, but I think it is the one in [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=178897#c5](/show_bug.cgi?id=178897#c5 "RESOLVED FIXED - Quick decoder updates in lib/pkcs7 lib/pkcs12 lib/smime lib/util")
This change came up recently in one of Wan-Teh's patches.
See bugzilla 53427 . In particular the attachment from Wan-Teh that says "Use QuickDER in the softoken" - [attachment 233665](/attachment.cgi?id=233665 "Another way: use QuickDER in the softoken") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=233665&action=edit "Another way: use QuickDER in the softoken") [[diff]](/attachment.cgi?id=233665&action=diff "Another way: use QuickDER in the softoken") [[review]](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=53427&attachment=233665) .
And my review of it in

> why does it internally use the blapi RSA\_CheckSignRecover function?
> Why doesn't it use RSA\_CheckSign ?
History I suspect. In any case no one actually calls the hashing versions of these functions. All our current callers either call C\_VerifyRecoverInit followed by C\_VerifyRecover or they call C\_VerifyInit (with CKM\_RSA\_PKCS rather than one of the hashing versions) followed by a single C\_Verify (not update, final).
The particular code that is failing is cryptohi, which does the decoding itself.

It seems this issue is more or less public given the link above, and philmac is probably not be the only one who heard the talk and tried it out on Firefox. We should get this into the 1.8 and 1.8.0 branches ASAP, and I'm sure Sun, Novell, etc will want this on the 1.7/aviary branches as well.

Here is more information to help understand the scope of this vulnerability.
This vulnerability makes it possible to create forged signatures that pass
the test, IF and only if the signer's public key (the public key in the
certificate used to verify the signature) contains a public exponent that
is the value 3.
Here are two possible scenarios:
a) a CA certificate has a public key with a public exponent of 3. Then false
certificates can be created with falsified signatures that pass the flawed verification.
b) a victim server has a server certificate with a public key with a public exponent of 3. Another server performs a MITM attack, pretending to be the victim server, using DHE\_RSA cipher suites, generating false signatures that
pass the (flawed) verification test using the victim server's public key.
Mitigating factors: AFAIK, few (if any) public CAs use or issue certs with
public keys with a public exponent of 3. So, people won't be able to use
this attack against (say) www.amazon.com, because amazon's cert (and its
issuer's cert) use public keys with public exponents of 65537, not 3.
So, while it remains unfixed, this vulnerability makes some small percentage
of the SSL certificates in the world vulnerable, but it doesn't make all
(or even most) of them vulnerable. This isn't the end of the world for
SSL, even while it remains unfixed. URL: [http://www.imc.org/ietf-openpgp/mail-...](http://www.imc.org/ietf-openpgp/mail-archive/msg14307.html)

I guess a new NSS tag needs to be made (perhaps NSS\_3\_11\_20060830\_TAG ?)
so that the maintainers of the other branches can update their branches
with the difference between the previous tag and this one. I'm not
really familiar with that process.

Nelson,
Surely, the form and shape of existing certs is irrelevant. Due to this bug anyone can mint themselves a 'valid' cert for any domain of their choice. This does affect every domain mozilla users think they're visiting, and we're back to reliance on DNS for security.
Note the various root CAs keys that ship with the standard install that use exponent 3.

The exponent of the public key in the CA certs is what matters.
If we have CAs in the root list with public exponents of 3,
or if trusted roots have issued intermediates with exponents of 3,
then yes, this is a big deal.
I haven't done a survey of all the roots in the list. I have looked at
some, and have not yet seen any that have exponents of 3. But it only
takes one, and probabilistically speaking, there is likely to be at
least one out there.
Anyway, the patch is committed. The branch owners need to propagate it
to their branches, I believe.

Updating the NSS snapshot ([bug 340724](/show_bug.cgi?id=340724 "RESOLVED FIXED - Upgrade NSS on Mozilla 1.8 branch for 1.8.1 final")) is absolutely the right thing for the trunk, probably right for 1.8.1 (though it's really late -- I'll let the 1.8.1 team decide), and really not at all what we should do for the 1.8.0 branch.
Is the standalone patch in this bug appropriate for Firefox 1.5.0.7?

Mike, instead of taking this patch for MOZILLA\_1\_8\_BRANCH (1.8.1 branch), are you willing to approve Patch v3 in [bug 340724](/show_bug.cgi?id=340724 "RESOLVED FIXED - Upgrade NSS on Mozilla 1.8 branch for 1.8.1 final"), which includes this patch?

Attached file
[For testing: a faked cert for 'localhost'](attachment.cgi?id=236352)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=236352&action=edit)

Run an https server, using the key and crt from the attachment.
Mozilla connects successfully. So does 'openssl s\_client ..' if it knows about the particular root CA used here.
For fun, inspect the certificate and especially the signature field.

Kai, let's get this patch in on the branch ASAP and consider the bigger NSS update separately, OK? Thanks!

Hi Mike,
We were just offering the fastest way to get the patch in. The changes in [bug 340724](/show_bug.cgi?id=340724 "RESOLVED FIXED - Upgrade NSS on Mozilla 1.8 branch for 1.8.1 final"), are changes that have been reviewed and tested by multiple NSS reviewers and patch regresssions in FF 2.0 from 1.5. These changes are on the NSS 3.11 branch, which has very similiar checkin rules to the FF 2.0 branch itself (it's not all the changes made to NSS). It was NSS with these changes that Nelson verified the patch, and it would be the NSS teams recommendation for FF 2.0 to pick up these patches anyway. Kaie can make this change in a matter of minutes.
Not picking them up will put FF 2.0 out of sync with any recognizable NSS release, making more work when it come times to actually pick up the changes.
If the review approval is such it is the bottleneck, then we can take the hit of applying two patches with a merge... as long as the tree doesn't stay in that state very long (a couple of days maybe).
Thanks,
bobFlags: blocking1.8.1+ → blocking1.8.1?

FYI, I tested the latest FF 1.5.0.x build (with this patch included) and found that it correctly blocks philmac's testcase. Firefox reports that the certificate is invalid or corrupt.

Patch landed on MOZILLA\_1\_8\_BRANCH for target 1.8.1 with checkin for [bug 340724](/show_bug.cgi?id=340724 "RESOLVED FIXED - Upgrade NSS on Mozilla 1.8 branch for 1.8.1 final"), "patch v3". Thanks for approving.
In [comment 18](/show_bug.cgi?id=350640#c18 "RESOLVED FIXED - rsa signature verification ignores garbage bytes (CVE-2006-4340)") Nelson said he checked in the NSS patch to trunk of NSS and stable 3.11 branch, so I'm resolving this NSS bug as fixed.

Attached file
[different fake cert for localhost](attachment.cgi?id=236479)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=236479&action=edit)

This one forms a valid DER blob, so no extra unparsed bytes.
Instead, the algo sequence has a blob parameter that contains random noise. But the hash is properly located at the least significant bytes.
This could foil your patch (dunno), and or some other implementations.
The forged signature cubed looks like 0001fff..ff0030..xxxx..0410hhhh with xxxx the random but ignored attribute data and hhhh the expected hash.

The possibility of a vulnerability due to "grabage" in the DigestInfo's
AlgID's OID or parameters is the subject of [bug 351079](/show_bug.cgi?id=351079 "RESOLVED FIXED - RSA signature DigestInfo not checked properly in NSS (CVE-2006-4340)"). There is a patch
attached to that bug. I have just tested it with this second cert, and
it fixes that vulnerability, too.

PKCS #1 v2.1 Section 9.2 Note 2 (page 38) says DigestInfo
should be encoded with DER but a cautious implementer of
the signature verification operation may want to decode
DigestInfo with BER. I have no opinion on whether we need
to be that cautious.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=351848#c0)• 18 years ago |
|  | |

The callers of DecryptSigBlock pass a buffer of size
HASH\_LENGTH\_MAX to ensure it is large enough to hold
any message digest. But DecryptSigBlock only checks
that the message digest can fit in the buffer. It doesn't
check that the message digest's length is correct for the
message digest algorithm, and it doesn't return the length
to the callers, so the callers can't check that, either.
So for MD5, one can append up to 48 bytes of arbitrary data
after the MD5 hash, and for SHA-1, up to 44 bytes. However,
the length octet in the ASN.1 encoding of the hash must
match the length. Because of the smaller number of bytes to
play with and the constraint on the length octet, it may be
impossible to implement an attack similar to [bug 350640](/show_bug.cgi?id=350640 "RESOLVED FIXED - rsa signature verification ignores garbage bytes (CVE-2006-4340)").

This form of forgery is one of the 9 test cases attached to [bug 351079](/show_bug.cgi?id=351079 "RESOLVED FIXED - RSA signature DigestInfo not checked properly in NSS (CVE-2006-4340)").

|  | |

It's e) garbage appended to the hash, inside the DER encoding
that is: header, DER(Algorithm OID, algorithm parameters, hash+garbage)

| [Comment 3](/show_bug.cgi?id=351848#c3)• 18 years ago |
|  | |

oh, wait, are you suggesting something like this:
header, DER(Algorithm OID, algorithm parameters, hash, garbage)
where the garbage is inside the sequence that includes the hash, but
comes after the hash?

|  | |

It is
header, DER(Algorithm OID, algorithm parameters, hash+garbage)
NSS 3.11.3 release candidate has this bug.
I also tried
header, DER(Algorithm OID, algorithm parameters, hash, garbage)
Thunderbird says the signature is invalid. I believe it fails in
the decoding of DigestInfo but didn't verify it in a debugger or
with printf statements.

We have a forged cert for that test case.
3.11.3 has been tested against it (certutil -V and vfychain)
and detects it. So I conclude that one of these must be true:
a) test forgery is defective. (I will investigate that)
b) you're testing a different code path than I have been testing
(I've been testing CERT\_VerifyCert).

I tested email signature verification in Thunderbird. This is the
code path (the line numbers may be slightly off because of the
printf statements and other changes I added):
1. Decoding of DigestInfo:

This bug, together with [bug 350640](/show_bug.cgi?id=350640 "RESOLVED FIXED - rsa signature verification ignores garbage bytes (CVE-2006-4340)") and [bug 351079](/show_bug.cgi?id=351079 "RESOLVED FIXED - RSA signature DigestInfo not checked properly in NSS (CVE-2006-4340)"), are all vulnerabilities to
malformed PKCS#1 v1.5 RSA signatures. There are several code paths through
NSS that check these signatures. One of them was fixed for [bug 351079](/show_bug.cgi?id=351079 "RESOLVED FIXED - RSA signature DigestInfo not checked properly in NSS (CVE-2006-4340)").
This bug reports another path that is vulnerable to one of the same cases as
shown in that bug.
It appears that the difference is that this path is used to verify
signatures on things other than certificates, whereas the other path was
used to verify signatures on certificates.
I consider this to be part of the same vulnerability. If NSS accepts the
malformed signature, NSS is vulnerable to it, regardless of what kind of
data (cert or other) is being signed. Perhaps we should reopen [bug 351079](/show_bug.cgi?id=351079 "RESOLVED FIXED - RSA signature DigestInfo not checked properly in NSS (CVE-2006-4340)")
and make this bug a dup of that one.

The u.buffer data really calls out to be a secitem which points to the u.buffer space. That should also simplify the DSA and ECDSA verification code.

I believe the issue here is that the forged signature case uses more data than the biggest HASH we support, so it is being detected. The reduced size means that it will likely be harder to construct a perfect cube in the space we allow, but 40 bytes is enough to make me worried. Especially if one starts trying to attack 1024 bit keys (which may need less 'garbage' than 2048 or 3072 bit keys).
Anyway I concur this should be fixed as part of the other signing issues.

The use of the local variable 'digestlen' is intended to
bring your attention to the similar use of 'hashid' in
the original code.
Feel free to eliminate 'digestlen' and pass &cx->rsadigestlen
directly, but please also eliminate 'hashid' and pass &cx->alg
directly.

Since this file is already SO different between trunk and branch,
this patch for the trunk differs significantly from the branch patch.
I took the liberty of renaming one variable to avoid ambiguity,
and I also took Wan-Teh's suggestion about the hashid variable.
This patch is not blocking any other mozilla branches.

merged to client 1.8.0 branch
I'm giving this a qualified r+ for the 1.8.0 branch.
I believe this patch accurately carries the change from
the NSS\_3\_11\_BRANCH back to this older branch.
However, because there are other preceeding changes
from the NSS\_3\_11\_BRANCH that have not been carried back
I cannot state with any certainty that, with this patch
applied, the 1.8.0 branch will be as free of vulnerabilities
as the 3\_11\_BRANCH is now.

Dan, your patch is correct. I renamed the rsadigestlen field of
VFYContext because 'digestlen' looks nicer on the MOZILLA\_1\_8\_0\_BRANCH
(and NSS\_3\_10\_BRANCH).

I added my new comment for digestlen and renamed the 'len'

You missed the change to one PORT\_Memcmp call. If it's
intentional, please remove that change from this patch.

Attached patch

[Patch for trunk v3 (as checked in)](attachment.cgi?id=238003&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=238003&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=351848&attachment=238003)

I made two additional changes to vfy\_CreateContext.
1. I removed a break statement that's no longer necessary.
2. I fixed a leak of 'cx' on an error return. Coverity
should be able to catch this leak, but Coverity was only
run on some NSS branch used by Mozilla, and this code is
new on the trunk only.
Please review these two changes. I've checked in this patch
on the NSS trunk for NSS 3.12.

This revision fixes a problem due to the added declaration of QuickDER
coming from a different revision than the source to QuickDER. The MSVC
compiler didn't complain, but Sun's compiler rightly called it an error.

# USN-351-1: firefox vulnerabilities

23 September 2006

firefox vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Details

Various flaws have been reported that allow an attacker to execute

arbitrary code with user privileges by tricking the user into opening

a malicious web page containing JavaScript. ([CVE-2006-4253](/security/CVE-2006-4253),

[CVE-2006-4565](/security/CVE-2006-4565), [CVE-2006-4566](/security/CVE-2006-4566), [CVE-2006-4568](/security/CVE-2006-4568), [CVE-2006-4569](/security/CVE-2006-4569)

[CVE-2006-4571](/security/CVE-2006-4571))

The NSS library did not sufficiently check the padding of PKCS #1 v1.5

signatures if the exponent of the public key is 3 (which is widely

used for CAs). This could be exploited to forge valid signatures

without the need of the secret key. ([CVE-2006-4340](/security/CVE-2006-4340))

Jon Oberheide reported a way how a remote attacker could trick users

into downloading arbitrary extensions with circumventing the normal

SSL certificate check. The attacker would have to be in a position to

spoof the victim's DNS, causing them to connect to sites of the

attacker's choosing rather than the sites intended by the victim. If

they gained that control and the victim accepted the attacker's cert

for the Mozilla update site, then the next update check could be

hijacked and redirected to the attacker's site without

detection. ([CVE-2006-4567](/security/CVE-2006-4567))

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 6.06

* firefox
  -
  1.5.dfsg+1.5.0.7-ubuntu0.6.06
* libnss3
  -
  1.5.dfsg+1.5.0.7-ubuntu0.6.06

After a standard system upgrade you need to restart Firefox to effect

the necessary changes.

Please note that Firefox 1.0.8 in Ubuntu 5.10 and Ubuntu 5.04 are also

affected by these problems. Updates for these Ubuntu releases will be

delayed due to upstream dropping support for this Firefox version. We

strongly advise that you disable JavaScript to disable the attack

vectors for most vulnerabilities if you use one of these Ubuntu

versions. An update is currently in progress.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2006-66

## RSA Signature Forgery (variant)

Announced
November 7, 2006
Reporter
Ulrich Kuehn
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox 1.5.0.8
* SeaMonkey 1.0.6
* Thunderbird 1.5.0.8

### Description

MFSA 2006-60 reported that RSA digital signatures with a low exponent
(typically 3) could be forged. This flaw was corrected in the
Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS) library version 3.11.3 used
by Firefox 2.0 and current development versions of Mozilla clients.

**Ulrich Kuehn** reported that Firefox 1.5.0.7, which incorporated
NSS version 3.10.2, was incompletely patched and remained vulnerable
to a variant of this attack.

### Workaround

None, upgrade to a fixed version.

# USN-350-1: Thunderbird vulnerabilities

22 September 2006

Thunderbird vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 5.10](/security/notices?release=breezy)

## Details

This update upgrades Thunderbird from 1.0.8 to 1.5.0.7. This step was

necessary since the 1.0.x series is not supported by upstream any

more.

Various flaws have been reported that allow an attacker to execute

arbitrary code with user privileges by tricking the user into opening

a malicious email containing JavaScript. Please note that JavaScript

is disabled by default for emails, and it is not recommended to enable

it. ([CVE-2006-3113](/security/CVE-2006-3113), [CVE-2006-3802](/security/CVE-2006-3802), [CVE-2006-3803](/security/CVE-2006-3803), [CVE-2006-3805](/security/CVE-2006-3805),

[CVE-2006-3806](/security/CVE-2006-3806), [CVE-2006-3807](/security/CVE-2006-3807), [CVE-2006-3809](/security/CVE-2006-3809), [CVE-2006-3810](/security/CVE-2006-3810),

[CVE-2006-3811](/security/CVE-2006-3811), [CVE-2006-3812](/security/CVE-2006-3812), [CVE-2006-4253](/security/CVE-2006-4253), [CVE-2006-4565](/security/CVE-2006-4565),

[CVE-2006-4566](/security/CVE-2006-4566), [CVE-2006-4571](/security/CVE-2006-4571))

A buffer overflow has been discovered in the handling of .vcard files.

By tricking a user into importing a malicious vcard into his contacts,

this could be exploited to execute arbitrary code with the user's

privileges. ([CVE-2006-3804](/security/CVE-2006-3804))

The NSS library did not sufficiently check the padding of PKCS #1 v1.5

signatures if the exponent of the public key is 3 (which is widely

used for CAs). This could be exploited to forge valid signatures

without the need of the secret key. ([CVE-2006-4340](/security/CVE-2006-4340))

Jon Oberheide reported a way how a remote attacker could trick users

into downloading arbitrary extensions with circumventing the normal

SSL certificate check. The attacker would have to be in a position to

spoof the victim's DNS, causing them to connect to sites of the

attacker's choosing rather than the sites intended by the victim. If

they gained that control and the victim accepted the attacker's cert

for the Mozilla update site, then the next update check could be

hijacked and redirected to the attacker's site without detection.

([CVE-2006-4567](/security/CVE-2006-4567))

Georgi Guninski discovered that even with JavaScript disabled, a

malicous email could still execute JavaScript when the message is

viewed, replied to, or forwarded by putting the script in a remote XBL

file loaded by the message. ([CVE-2006-4570](/security/CVE-2006-4570))

The "enigmail" plugin and the translation packages have been updated

to work with the new Thunderbird version.

these problems. An update will be provided shortly.

## Workarounds

Two workarounds for Sun Alert ID 102652 are provided below (as provided by
the Sun Alert). Select one of the two to implement.

A) Use an alternate login mechanism such as dtlogin(1) or if using Solaris
10, gdm(1).

or:

B) Modify the xdm(1) configuration file, xdm-config, and create a new
Xsession file using the following commands as the root user:

**# cd /usr/openwin/lib/X11/xdm

# mv xdm-config xdm-config.orig

# sed -e 's/cp \/dev\/null "$errfile"/umask 077 \&\& cp \/dev\/null
"$errfile"/' Xsession > /etc/X11/Xsession

# sed -e 's/\/usr\/openwin\/lib\/X11\/xdm\/Xsession/\/etc\/X11\/Xsession/'
xdm-config.orig > xdm-config**

then restore executable permissions to the file by running the following
command:

**# chmod 755 Xsession**
