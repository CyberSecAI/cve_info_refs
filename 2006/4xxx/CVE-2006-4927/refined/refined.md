```
Root cause of vulnerability: Improper validation of address space within the "IOCTL" handlers of certain Symantec device drivers (NAVENG.sys and NAVEX15.sys). Specifically, the drivers fail to verify the address space before writing to a user-supplied address.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Lack of address space validation in IOCTL handlers.
- Overwriting arbitrary memory locations with a constant value.
- The vulnerability exists in multiple IOCTL codes: 0x222AD3, 0x222AD7, and 0x222ADB

Impact of exploitation:
- Local privilege escalation: An attacker can execute arbitrary code with kernel-level privileges by overwriting kernel memory.

Attack vectors:
- A local attacker can send a specially crafted I/O request packet (IRP) to the vulnerable device driver's IOCTL handler.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- A local user with the ability to send IRPs to device drivers.
- No authentication required.
