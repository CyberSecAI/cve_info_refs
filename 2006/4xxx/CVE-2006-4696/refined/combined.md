# Filter Actions

* Article
* 11/17/2009
## In this article

Applies To: Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2

A filter action defines the security requirements for the data transmission. Filter actions can be defined when you create a policy or before you create a policy. Filter lists are available to any policy. To define a filter list, right-click the IP Security Policy node and select **Manage filter lists and filter actions**.

A filter action can be configured to:

## Permit traffic

IPsec passes this traffic to and from the TCP/IP driver without modification or the requirement for security. This is appropriate for traffic from computers that are not IPsec-capable. Be sure to limit the IP filter list to a minimal scope when using this type of filter action, so that you do not permit traffic that should be secured.

Consider allowing ICMP traffic for troubleshooting purposes. You might also need to allow a computer that is not in your domain (for example, a consultant's computer) access to another computer in your domain. You can use the permit filter action to allow this access.

Important

The permit filter action allows access without authentication, data integrity, or encryption. Anyone using a computer with the IP address specified in the filter list is given the access. All traffic between the computers is done in plaintext; no integrity checks are performed.

## Block traffic

IPsec silently discards blocked traffic. When using a blocking filter action, be sure to use an IP filter list that defines the correct scope of IP addresses. Using larger scopes increases the chance of blocking traffic between valid computers.

## Negotiate security

If you enable the **Accept unsecured communication, but always respond using IPSec** option, IPsec attempts to negotiate security associations (SAs) and the sending or receiving of IPsec-protected traffic. However, if the peer cannot use IPsec, the communication will be allowed without IPsec protection. After you choose this filter action, you can also configure the following:

* Security methods and their order. This list of methods defines in which order the methods will be attempted. The first successful method will be used and the remaining methods will not be attempted. Typically, the list should be ordered from highest security to lowest security, so that the most secure method is used.
* Acceptance of initial incoming unsecured traffic (**Accept unsecured communication, but always respond using IPSec**). IPsec allows an incoming packet that matches the configured filter list to be unsecured (that is, not protected by IPsec). However, the outgoing response to the incoming packet must be protected. This setting is useful when you are using the default response rule for clients. When a group of servers are configured with a rule that secures communications with any IP address and accepts unsecured communication, responding with only secured communications, enabling the default response rule on client computers ensures that the clients will respond to the server request to negotiate security. To prevent denial-of-service attacks, this option should be disabled for secure computers connected to the Internet.
* Enabling of communication with non-IPsec-enabled computers (**Allow unsecured communication if a secure connection cannot be established**). IPsec falls back to unsecured communication, if necessary. Again, you should limit the IP filter list to a minimal scope. Otherwise, if negotiation fails for any reason, any communications affected by the rule in which this filter action resides could result in data being sent without security. If you are concerned about unsecured communication, you might consider disabling these settings. However, communication with computers that cannot initiate IPsec, such as legacy systems, might be blocked. To prevent denial-of-service attacks, this option should be disabled for secure computers connected to the Internet.
* Generation of quick mode session keys from new main mode keying material (**Session key perfect forward secrecy (PFS)**). Enabling session key PFS ensures that main mode master keying material cannot be used to derive more than one quick mode session key. When quick mode PFS is enabled, a new Diffie-Hellman key exchange is performed to generate new main mode master keying material before the new quick mode key is created. Session key (quick mode) PFS does not require main mode reauthentication and uses fewer resources than master key (main mode) PFS.

## IPsec security methods

Each security method defines the security requirements of any communications to which the associated rule applies. Creating multiple security methods increases the chance that a common method can be found between two computers. The Internet Key Exchange (IKE) component reads the list of security methods in descending order and sends a list of allowed security methods to the other peer. The first method in common is selected. Typically, the most secure methods appear at the top of the list; the least secure methods appear at the bottom of the list.

### Predefined security methods

The following security methods are predefined:

#### Encryption and Integrity

Uses the ESP protocol to provide data confidentiality (encryption) with the triple Data Encryption Standard (3DES) algorithm, data integrity and authentication with the Secure Hash Algorithm 1 (SHA1) integrity algorithm, and default key lifetimes (100 megabytes (MB), 1 hour). If you require both data and addressing (IP header) protection, you can create a custom security method. If you do not require encryption, use Integrity only.

#### Integrity only

Uses the ESP protocol to provide data integrity and authentication with the SHA1 integrity algorithm and default key lifetimes (100 MB, 1 hour). In this configuration, ESP does not provide data confidentiality (encryption).

#### Custom security methods

If the predefined Encryption and Integrity or Integrity only settings do not meet your security requirements, you can specify custom security methods. For example, you can use custom methods when encryption and address integrity, stronger algorithms, or key lifetimes must be specified. When configuring a custom security method, you can configure the following:

##### Security protocols

Both AH (data and address integrity without encryption) and ESP (data integrity and encryption) can be enabled in a custom security method when you require IP header integrity and data encryption. If you chose to enable both, you do not need to specify an integrity algorithm for ESP.

Note

The AH protocol cannot be used over network address translation (NAT) devices because it uses a hash of the header. NAT devices alter the header, so the packet will not authenticate properly.

##### Integrity algorithm

Message Digest 5 (MD5), which uses a 128-bit key. This algorithm is no longer considered secure and should be used only when interoperability requires its use.

SHA1, which uses a 160-bit key. SHA1 is a stronger hash than MD5 and is compliant with the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS).

##### Encryption algorithm

3DES is the most secure of the DES combinations and somewhat slower in performance. 3DES processes each block three times, using three unique 56-bit keys.

DES uses a single 56-bit key and is used when the higher security and overhead of 3DES is not required. This algorithm is no longer considered secure and should only be used when interoperability requires it.

Session key (quick mode) settings determine when, not how, a new key is generated. You can specify a lifetime in kilobytes (KB), seconds, or both. For example, if the communication takes 10,000 seconds and you specify the key lifetime as 1000 seconds, 10 keys will be generated to complete the transfer. This ensures that, even if an attacker manages to determine one session key and decipher part of a communication, the attacker cannot decipher the entire communication. By default, new quick mode keys are generated for every 100 MB of data or every hour. Any time a key lifetime is reached, the SA, in addition to the key refresh or regeneration, is also renegotiated.

**To create a filter action using the New Rule Properties dialog box**

5. Click **OK**.
6. Repeat steps 4 through 8 to add additional filter actions to the list.

Note

Although the rule can list several filter actions, only one filter action can be used per rule.

7. On the **Filter Action** tab, select the appropriate filter action for the rule and click **OK**.

**To create a filter action using the Manage filter lists and filter actions dialog box**

1. Right-click the IP Security Policy node and select **Manage IP filter lists and filter actions**.

## Vulnerability Details

#### Server Service Denial of Service Vulnerability- CVE-2006-3942:

A [denial of service](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21142) vulnerability exists in the Server service because of the way it handles certain network messages. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted network message to a computer running the Server service. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause the computer to stop responding.

#### Mitigating Factors for Server Service Denial of Service Vulnerability- CVE-2006-3942:

* Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.

#### Workarounds for Server Service Denial of Service Vulnerability- CVE-2006-3942:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. Although these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

* **Block the following at the firewall:** - UDP ports 135, 137, 138, and 445, and TCP ports 135, 139, and 445.
* **To help protect from network-based attempts to exploit this vulnerability, use a personal firewall, such as the** [**Internet Connection Firewall**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33335)**, which is included with Windows XP and with Windows Server 2003.**

  By default, the Internet Connection Firewall feature in Windows XP and in Windows Server 2003 helps protect your Internet connection by blocking unsolicited incoming traffic. We recommend that you block all unsolicited incoming communication from the Internet. In Windows XP Service Pack 2 this features is called the Windows Firewall.

  To enable the Internet Connection Firewall feature by using the Network Setup Wizard, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Control Panel**.
  2. In the default Category View, click **Network and Internet Connections**, and then click **Setup or change your home or small office network**. The Internet Connection Firewall feature is enabled when you select a configuration in the Network Setup Wizard that indicates that your system is connected directly to the Internet.

  To configure Internet Connection Firewall manually for a connection, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Control Panel**.
  2. In the default Category View, click **Networking and Internet Connections**, and then click **Network Connections**.
  3. Right-click the connection on which you want to enable Internet Connection Firewall, and then click **Properties**.
  4. Click the **Advanced** tab.
  5. Click to select the **Protect my computer or network by limiting or preventing access to this computer from the Internet** check box, and then click **OK**.

  **Note** If you want to enable certain programs and services to communicate through the firewall, click **Settings** on the **Advanced** tab, and then select the programs, the protocols, and the services that are required.
* **To help protect from network-based attempts to exploit this vulnerability, block the affected ports by using IPSec on the affected systems.**

  Use Internet Protocol security (IPSec) to help protect network communications. Detailed information about IPSec and about how to apply filters is available in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 313190](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/313190) and [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 813878](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/813878).

#### FAQ for Server Service Denial of Service Vulnerability- CVE-2006-3942:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a [denial of service](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21142) vulnerability. An attacker who exploited this vulnerability could cause the affected system to stop responding and automatically restart. During that time, the server would be unable to respond to requests. Note that the denial of service vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate their user rights, but it could cause the affected system to stop accepting requests.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

An uninitialized buffer in the Server service.

**What is the Server service?**

The Server service provides remote procedure cal (RPC) support, file and print support and named pipe sharing over the network. The Server service allows the sharing of your local resources (such as disks and printers) so that other users on the network can access them. It also allows named pipe communication between applications running on other computers and your computer.

**Who could exploit the vulnerability?**

Any anonymous user who could deliver a specially crafted message to the affected system could try to exploit this vulnerability.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could try to exploit the vulnerability by creating a specially crafted message and sending the message to an affected system. The message could then cause the affected system to stop responding.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

All Windows computers are equally at risk from this vulnerability.

**Could the vulnerability be exploited over the Internet?**

Yes. An attacker could try to exploit this vulnerability over the Internet. Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect against attacks that originate from the Internet. Microsoft has provided information about how you can help protect your PC. End users can visit the [Protect Your PC Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21169). IT professionals can visit the [Security Guidance Center Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21171).

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by initializing a buffer before it is used.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

Yes. This vulnerability has been publicly disclosed. It has been assigned Common Vulnerability and Exposure number CVE-2006-3942. It also has been named âMailslot DOSâ by the larger security community

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had seen examples of proof of concept code published publicly but had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**Does applying this security update help protect customers from the code that has been published publicly that attempts to exploit this vulnerability?**

Yes. This security update addresses the vulnerability that potentially could be exploited by using the published proof of concept code. The vulnerability that has been addressed has been assigned the Common Vulnerability and Exposure number CVE-2006-3942.

**How does this vulnerability relate to the vulnerabilities that are corrected by MS06-035 and MS06-040?**

All three vulnerabilities were in the Server service. However, this update addresses a new vulnerability that was not addressed as part of MS06-035 or as part of MS06-040. MS06-035 and MS06-040 help protect against the vulnerabilities that were discussed in those bulletins, but do not address this new vulnerability. This update does not replace MS06-040. You must install this update and the update that is provided as part of the MS06-040 security bulletin to help protect your system against both vulnerabilities. This bulletin does replace MS06-035. Installing this update will protect against all vulnerabilities fixed in MS06-035.

#### SMB Rename Vulnerability - CVE-2006-4696:

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Server service because of the way it handles certain network messages. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted network message to a system running the Server service as an authenticated user. While an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system, attempts to exploit this vulnerability will most probably result in a Denial of Service condition.

#### Mitigating Factors for SMB Rename Vulnerability - CVE-2006-4696:

* Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.
* Attempts to exploit this vulnerability will most probably result in a Denial of Service condition caused by an unexpected restart of the affected system rather than Remote Code Execution.
* An attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on over the network to exploit this vulnerability. The vulnerability could not be exploited by anonymous users.

#### Workarounds for SMB Rename Vulnerability - CVE-2006-4696

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. Although these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

* **Block the following at the firewall:** - UDP ports 135, 137, 138, and 445, and TCP ports 135, 139, and 445
* **To help protect from network-based attempts to exploit this vulnerability, use a personal firewall, such as the** [**Internet Connection Firewall**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33335)**, which is included with Windows XP and with Windows Server 2003.**

  By default, the Internet Connection Firewall feature in Windows XP and in Windows Server 2003 helps protect your Internet connection by blocking unsolicited incoming traffic. We recommend that you block all unsolicited incoming communication from the Internet. In Windows XP Service Pack 2 this features is called the Windows Firewall.

  To enable the Internet Connection Firewall feature by using the Network Setup Wizard, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Control Panel**.
  2. In the default Category View, click **Network and Internet Connections**, and then click **Setup or change your home or small office network**. The Internet Connection Firewall feature is enabled when you select a configuration in the Network Setup Wizard that indicates that your system is connected directly to the Internet.

  To configure Internet Connection Firewall manually for a connection, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Control Panel**.
  2. In the default Category View, click **Networking and Internet Connections**, and then click **Network Connections**.
  3. Right-click the connection on which you want to enable Internet Connection Firewall, and then click **Properties**.
  4. Click the **Advanced** tab.
  5. Click to select the **Protect my computer or network by limiting or preventing access to this computer from the Internet** check box, and then click **OK**.

  **Note** If you want to enable certain programs and services to communicate through the firewall, click **Settings** on the **Advanced** tab, and then select the programs, the protocols, and the services that are required.
* **To help protect from network-based attempts to exploit this vulnerability, block the affected ports by using IPSec on the affected systems.**

  Use Internet Protocol security (IPSec) to help protect network communications. Detailed information about IPSec and about how to apply filters is available in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 313190](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/313190) and [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 813878](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/813878).

#### FAQ for SMB Rename Vulnerability - CVE-2006-4696

**Installation Information**

This security update supports the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/help** | Displays the command-line options. |
| Setup Modes |  |
| **/passive** | Unattended Setup mode. No user interaction is required, but installation status is displayed. If a restart is required at the end of setup, a dialog box will be presented to the user with a timer warning that the computer will restart in 30 seconds. |
| **/quiet** | Quiet mode. This is the same as unattended mode, but no status or error messages are displayed. |
| Restart Options |  |
| **/norestart** | Does not restart when installation has completed. |
| **/forcerestart** | Restarts the computer after installation and forces other applications to close at shutdown without saving open files first. |
| **/warnrestart[:x]** | Displays a dialog box with a timer warning the user that the computer will restart in *x* seconds. (The default setting is 30 seconds.) Intended for use with the **/quiet** switch or the **/passive** switch. |
| **/promptrestart** | Display a dialog box prompting the local user to allow a restart. |
| Special Options |  |
| **/overwriteoem** | Overwrites OEM files without prompting. |
| **/nobackup** | Does not back up files needed for uninstallation. |
| **/forceappsclose** | Forces other programs to close when the computer shuts down. |
| **/log:path** | Allows the redirection of installation log files. |
| **/integrate:path** | Integrates the update into the Windows source files. These files are located at the path that is specified in the switch. |
| **/extract[:path]** | Extracts files without starting the Setup program. |
| **/ER** | Enables extended error reporting. |
| **/verbose** | Enables verbose logging. During installation, creates %Windir%\CabBuild.log. This log details the files that are copied. Using this switch may cause the installation to proceed more slowly. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841).

**Software Update Services:**

By using Microsoft Software Update Services (SUS), administrators can quickly and reliably deploy the latest critical updates and security updates to Windows 2000 and Windows Server 2003-based servers, and to desktop systems that are running Windows 2000 Professional or Windows XP Professional.

For more information about how to deploy security updates by using Software Update Services, visit the [Software Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21133).

**Windows Server Update Services:**

By using Windows Server Update Services (WSUS), administrators can quickly and reliably deploy the latest critical updates and security updates for Windows 2000 operating systems and later, Office XP and later, Exchange Server 2003, and SQL Server 2000 onto Windows 2000 and later operating systems.

For more information about how to deploy security updates using Windows Server Update Services, visit the [Windows Server Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=50120).

**Systems Management Server:**

Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) delivers a highly configurable enterprise solution for managing updates. By using SMS, administrators can identify Windows-based systems that require security updates and can perform controlled deployment of these updates throughout the enterprise with minimal disruption to end users. For more information about how administrators can use SMS 2003 to deploy security updates, visit the [SMS 2003 Security Patch Management Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=22939). SMS 2.0 users can also use [Software Updates Service Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33340) to help deploy security updates. For information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

**Note** SMS uses the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer, the Microsoft Office Detection Tool, and the Enterprise Update Scanning Tool to provide broad support for security bulletin update detection and deployment. Some software updates may not be detected by these tools. Administrators can use the inventory capabilities of the SMS in these cases to target updates to specific systems. For more information about this procedure, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33341). Some security updates require administrative rights following a restart of the system. Administrators can use the Elevated Rights Deployment Tool (available in the [SMS 2003 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33387) and in the [SMS 2.0 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21161)) to install these updates.
