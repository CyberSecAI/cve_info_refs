Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) flaw within the Mambo CatalogShop component. Specifically, the `mosConfig_absolute_path` parameter is vulnerable to manipulation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application includes a file based on user-supplied input without sufficient sanitization. This allows an attacker to include remote files, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The `mosConfig_absolute_path` parameter is not validated, allowing the injection of malicious paths.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious file, the attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially taking full control of the system.
*   **Data Theft/Manipulation:** Attackers might gain access to sensitive data, modify the application's behavior, or deface the website.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET request:** The attacker sends a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable page, manipulating the `mosConfig_absolute_path` parameter to point to a malicious script.
*  Example URL from provided content: `http://www.site.com/catalogshop.php?mosConfig_absolute_path=shell`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Remote access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
*   **Basic understanding of RFI:** The attacker needs to understand how to craft a malicious URL to exploit the RFI vulnerability.
*   **No authentication required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without prior authentication.
