Patches for the OpenBSD base system are distributed as unified diffs.
Each patch contains usage instructions.
All the following patches are also available in one
[tar.gz file](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.8.tar.gz)
for convenience.

Patches for supported releases are also incorporated into the
[-stable branch](stable.html).

* **001: SECURITY FIX: January 5, 2006**
    *All architectures*

  A buffer overflow has been found in the Perl interpreter with the sprintf function which
  may be exploitable under certain conditions.

  [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.8/common/001_perl.patch)

  * **002: SECURITY FIX: January 5, 2006**
      *All architectures*

    Do not allow users to trick suid programs into re-opening files via /dev/fd.

    [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.8/common/002_fd.patch)

    * **003: RELIABILITY FIX: January 13, 2006**
        *i386 architecture*

      Change the implementation of i386 W^X so that the "execute line" can move around.
      Before it was limited to being either at 512MB (below which all code normally
      lands) or at the top of the stack. Now the line can float as
      [mprotect(2)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.8/mprotect.2)
      and
      [mmap(2)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.8/mmap.2)
      requests need it to. This is now implemented using only GDT selectors
      instead of the LDT so that it is more robust as well.

      [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.8/i386/003_i386pmap.patch)

      * **004: RELIABILITY FIX: January 13, 2006**
          *i386 architecture*

        Constrain
        [i386\_set\_ioperm(2)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.8/i386/i386_set_ioperm.2)
        so even root is blocked from accessing the ioports
        unless the machine is running at lower securelevels or with an open X11 aperture.

        [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.8/i386/004_i386machdep.patch)

        * **005: SECURITY FIX: February 12, 2006**
            *All architectures*

          Josh Bressers has reported a weakness in OpenSSH caused due to the insecure use of the
          [system(3)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.8/system.3)
          function in
          [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.8/scp.1)
          when performing copy operations using filenames that are supplied by the user from the command line.
          This can be exploited to execute shell commands with privileges of the user running
          [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.8/scp.1).

          [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.8/common/005_ssh.patch)

          * **006: SECURITY FIX: March 25, 2006**
              *All architectures*

            A race condition has been reported to exist in the handling by sendmail of
            asynchronous signals. A remote attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the
            privileges of the user running sendmail, typically root.

            [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.8/common/006_sendmail.patch)

            * **007: SECURITY FIX: May 2, 2006**
                *All architectures*

              A security vulnerability has been found in the X.Org server --
              [CVE-2006-1526](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-1526).
              Clients authorized to connect to the X server are able to crash it and to execute
              malicious code within the X server.

              [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.8/common/007_xorg.patch)

              * **008: SECURITY FIX: June 15, 2006**
                  *All architectures*

                A potential denial of service problem has been found in sendmail. A malformed MIME
                message could trigger excessive recursion which will lead to stack exhaustion.
                This denial of service attack only affects delivery of mail from the queue and
                delivery of a malformed message. Other incoming mail is still accepted and
                delivered. However, mail messages in the queue may not be reattempted if a
                malformed MIME message exists.

                [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.8/common/008_sendmail2.patch)

                * **009: SECURITY FIX: July 30, 2006**
                    *All architectures*

                  [httpd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.8/httpd.8)'s
                  mod\_rewrite has a potentially exploitable off-by-one buffer overflow.
                  The buffer overflow may result in a vulnerability which, in combination
                  with certain types of Rewrite rules in the web server configuration files,
                  could be triggered remotely. The default install is not affected by the
                  buffer overflow. CVE-2006-3747

                  [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.8/common/009_httpd.patch)

                  * **010: SECURITY FIX: August 25, 2006**
                      *All architectures*

                    A potential denial of service problem has been found in sendmail. A message
                    with really long header lines could trigger a use-after-free bug causing
                    sendmail to crash.

                    [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.8/common/010_sendmail3.patch)

                    * **011: SECURITY FIX: August 25, 2006**
                        *All architectures*

                      Due to an off-by-one error in
                      [dhcpd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.8/dhcpd.8),
                      it is possible to cause
                      [dhcpd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.8/dhcpd.8)
                      to exit by sending a DHCPDISCOVER packet with a 32-byte client identifier option.
                      [CVE-2006-3122](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-3122)

                      [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.8/common/011_dhcpd.patch)

                      * **012: SECURITY FIX: August 25, 2006**
                          *All architectures*

                        It is possible to cause the kernel to panic when more than the default number of
                        semaphores have been allocated.

                        [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.8/common/012_sem.patch)

                        * **013: SECURITY FIX: August 25, 2006**
                            *All architectures*

                          A problem in
                          [isakmpd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.8/isakmpd.8)
                          caused IPsec to run partly without replay protection. If
                          [isakmpd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.8/isakmpd.8)
                          was acting as responder during SA negotiation, SA's with a replay window of size 0 were created.
                          An attacker could reinject sniffed IPsec packets, which will be accepted without checking the
                          replay counter.

                          * **014: SECURITY FIX: September 2, 2006**
                              *All architectures*

                            Due to the failure to correctly validate LCP configuration option lengths,
                            it is possible for an attacker to send LCP packets via an
                            [sppp(4)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.8/sppp.4)
                            connection causing the kernel to panic.
                            [CVE-2006-4304](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4304)

                            * **015: SECURITY FIX: September 8, 2006**
                                *All architectures*

                              Two Denial of Service issues have been found with BIND.
                              An attacker who can perform recursive lookups on a DNS server and is able
                              to send a sufficiently large number of recursive queries, or is able to
                              get the DNS server to return more than one SIG(covered) RRsets can stop
                              the functionality of the DNS service.
                              An attacker querying an authoritative DNS server serving a RFC 2535
                              DNSSEC zone may be able to crash the DNS server.
                              [CVE-2006-4095](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4095)

                                  *All architectures*

                                Due to incorrect PKCS#1 v1.5 padding validation in OpenSSL, it is possible for
                                an attacker to construct an invalid signature which OpenSSL would accept as a
                                valid PKCS#1 v1.5 signature.

                                    Several problems have been found in OpenSSL. While parsing certain invalid ASN.1
                                    structures an error condition is mishandled, possibly resulting in an infinite
                                    loop. A buffer overflow exists in the SSL\_get\_shared\_ciphers function. A NULL
                                    pointer may be dereferenced in the SSL version 2 client code. In addition, many
                                    applications using OpenSSL do not perform any validation of the lengths of
                                    public keys being used.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Debian Security Advisory DSA 1175-1                    security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                             Noah Meyerhans
September 13th, 2006                    <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : isakmpd
Vulnerability  : programming error
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2006-4436
BugTraq ID     : 19712
Debian Bug     : 385894

A flaw has been found in isakmpd, OpenBSD's implementation of the
Internet Key Exchange protocol, that caused Security Associations to be
created with a replay window of 0 when isakmpd was acting as the
responder during SA negotiation.  This could allow an attacker to
re-inject sniffed IPsec packets, which would not be checked against the
replay counter.

For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 20041012-1sarge1

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 20041012-4

We recommend that you upgrade your isakmpd package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.
