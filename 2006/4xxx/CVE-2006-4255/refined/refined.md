       "details": "A vulnerability classified as critical has been found in Horde IMP up to 4.1.3. This affects an unknown function of the file /horde/imp/search.php. The manipulation with an unknown input leads to a cross site scripting vulnerability. The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages. This is going to have an impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.\n The weakness was disclosed 08/16/2006 by Marc Ruef with scip AG (Website). It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. It demands that the victim is doing some kind of user interaction. Technical details are known, but no exploit is available. MITRE ATT&CK project uses the attack technique T1059.007 for this issue."
