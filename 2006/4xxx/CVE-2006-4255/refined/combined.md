The Horde Team is pleased to announce the final release of the IMP Webmail
Client version H3 (4.1.3).

This is a bugfix release that also fixes a cross site scripting vulnerability
with not properly escaped folder names.

Many thanks to Marc Ruef for reporting this problem.

IMP, the Internet Messaging Program, is one of the most popular webmail
applications available.  It allows universal, web-based access to IMAP and
POP3 mail servers and provides a full range of features normally found only in
desktop email clients.

Major changes compared to the IMP H3 (4.1.2) version are:
    * Added server configuration option to limit numer of login tries.
    * Added link to view attached S/MIME key details.
    * Fixed escaping of folder names.
    * Updated Catalan, German and Slovenian translations.
    * Several small bugfixes and improvements.

The full list of changes (from version H3 (4.1.2)) can be viewed here:

<http://cvs.horde.org/diff.php/imp/docs/CHANGES?r1=1.699.2.194&r2=1.699.2.206&ty=h>

| CVSS Meta Temp ScoreCVSS is a standardized scoring system to determine possibilities of attacks. The Temp Score considers temporal factors like disclosure, exploit and countermeasures. The unique Meta Score calculates the average score of different sources to provide a normalized scoring system. | Current Exploit Price (≈)Our analysts are monitoring exploit markets and are in contact with vulnerability brokers. The range indicates the observed or calculated exploit price to be seen on exploit markets. A good indicator to understand the monetary effort required for and the popularity of an attack. | CTI Interest ScoreOur Cyber Threat Intelligence team is monitoring different web sites, mailing lists, exploit markets and social media networks. The CTI Interest Score identifies the interest of attackers and the security community for this specific vulnerability in real-time. A high score indicates an elevated risk to be targeted for this vulnerability. |

A vulnerability classified as critical has been found in [Horde IMP up to 4.1.3](?product.horde:imp) ([Groupware Software](?type.groupware_software)). This affects an unknown function of the file */horde/imp/search.php*. The manipulation with an unknown input leads to a cross site scripting vulnerability. CWE is classifying the issue as [CWE-80](?vulnerability_cwe.2457 "Cwe"). The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as "<", ">", and "&" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages. This is going to have an impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

The weakness was disclosed 08/16/2006 by Marc Ruef with scip AG (Website). The advisory is shared at [vuldb.com](?advisory_url.2457). It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. It demands that the victim is doing some kind of user interaction. Technical details are known, but no exploit is available. MITRE ATT&CK project uses the attack technique [T1059.007](?vulnerability_attck.2457 "Attck") for this issue.

By approaching the search of [inurl:horde/imp/search.php](?exploit_googlehack.2457) it is possible to find vulnerable targets with Google Hacking.

Upgrading eliminates this vulnerability. Applying a patch is able to eliminate this problem. The bugfix is ready for download at [ftp.horde.org](?countermeasure_patch_url.2457). The best possible mitigation is suggested to be upgrading to the latest version.

The entry [VDB-2456](?id.2456) is pretty similar.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
