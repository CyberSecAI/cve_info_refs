Airscanner Mobile Security Advisory #05081201:
PDAapps Verichat v1.30bh Local Password Disclosure
Product:
PDAapps Verichat v1.30bh
Platform:
Tested on Windows Mobile Pocket PC 2003
Requirements:
Mobile device running Windows Mobile Pocket PC with Verichat v1.30bh installed
Credits:

http://www.mobileav.org
Date:
August 12 2005
Risk Level:
Medium; a local attacker can view passwords in plain text.
Summary:
Verichat is instant messaging software that allows a user to connect to many different instant messaging accounts at once. It supports AOL, Yahoo!, MSN and ICQ on a Pocket PC device.
http://www.pdaapps.com/verichat\_ppc/index.html
Details:
Verichat instant messenger does not implement any security measures for user passwords. Usernames and passwords are stored in plain text in the device&#8217;s registry. Although Windows Mobile does not come with a native registry editor, third party software can be used to view these passwords with ease.
Passwords are stored in the following location by default:
HKEY\_CURRENT\_USERSoftwarePDAappsVeriChat
Each messenger client is represented at this path. For example, if an attacker wanted to find the MSN password, he would simply browse to the MSN registry key and look at the first two values. The first value is the password and the second value is the username.
Workaround:
None
Vendor Response
Waiting response.
