How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Patches for the OpenBSD base system are distributed as unified diffs.
Each patch contains usage instructions.
All the following patches are also available in one
[tar.gz file](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.8.tar.gz)
for convenience.

Patches for supported releases are also incorporated into the
[-stable branch](stable.html).

---

* **001: SECURITY FIX: January 5, 2006**
    *All architectures*

  A buffer overflow has been found in the Perl interpreter with the sprintf function which
  may be exploitable under certain conditions.

  [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.8/common/001_perl.patch)

  * **002: SECURITY FIX: January 5, 2006**
      *All architectures*

    Do not allow users to trick suid programs into re-opening files via /dev/fd.

    [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.8/common/002_fd.patch)

    * **003: RELIABILITY FIX: January 13, 2006**
        *i386 architecture*

      Change the implementation of i386 W^X so that the "execute line" can move around.
      Before it was limited to being either at 512MB (below which all code normally
      lands) or at the top of the stack. Now the line can float as
      [mprotect(2)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.8/mprotect.2)
      and
      [mmap(2)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.8/mmap.2)
      requests need it to. This is now implemented using only GDT selectors
      instead of the LDT so that it is more robust as well.

      [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.8/i386/003_i386pmap.patch)

      * **004: RELIABILITY FIX: January 13, 2006**
          *i386 architecture*

        Constrain
        [i386\_set\_ioperm(2)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.8/i386/i386_set_ioperm.2)
        so even root is blocked from accessing the ioports
        unless the machine is running at lower securelevels or with an open X11 aperture.

                A potential denial of service problem has been found in sendmail. A malformed MIME
                message could trigger excessive recursion which will lead to stack exhaustion.
                This denial of service attack only affects delivery of mail from the queue and
                delivery of a malformed message. Other incoming mail is still accepted and
                delivered. However, mail messages in the queue may not be reattempted if a
                malformed MIME message exists.
