The provided content discusses a vulnerability in ModuleBased CMS, specifically a remote file inclusion vulnerability, that was reported by researcher ScorpinO. The discussion revolves around a CVE dispute.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is claimed to be caused by the inclusion of files using `$_SERVER[DOCUMENT_ROOT]` in the `admin/avatar.php` script and other files:
```php
include_once($_SERVER[DOCUMENT_ROOT]."/libs/profile.class.php");
include($_SERVER[DOCUMENT_ROOT]."/libs/config.php");
```

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The researcher ScorpinO claims a remote file inclusion vulnerability exists by modifying the `_SERVER` superglobal using a parameter like: `.../admin/avatar.php?_SERVER=[evil script]`

However, the author of this email disputes the possibility of exploitation because in PHP it is not possible to redeclare the `_SERVER` global array or the `_SERVER[DOCUMENT_ROOT]` index.

**Impact of exploitation:** According to ScorpinO, if the vulnerability could be exploited, it would lead to arbitrary code execution by including a malicious file.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector would be through an HTTP request to the vulnerable script, attempting to pass a malicious value for `_SERVER` or `_SERVER[DOCUMENT_ROOT]` through a URL parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
