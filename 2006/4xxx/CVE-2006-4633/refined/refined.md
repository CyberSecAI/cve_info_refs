{
  "CVE-2006-4633": {
    "Description": "The SoftBB 0.1 forum software is vulnerable to remote command execution. By exploiting an insecure 'cache_forum' variable in the 'admin/save_opt.php' page an attacker can inject malicious PHP code, leading to the execution of arbitrary commands.",
    "Root cause": "The application does not properly sanitize user-controlled input used in the 'cache_forum' variable in the 'admin/save_opt.php' page, allowing for PHP code injection.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "PHP code injection"
    ],
    "Impact": "Arbitrary command execution on the server, leading to potential complete compromise of the affected system.",
    "Attack vectors": "HTTP POST request to 'admin/save_opt.php' with crafted 'cache_forum' parameter, followed by accessing 'info_options.php' with a 'cmd' parameter to execute the injected code.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker must be logged in as an administrator in order to reach the vulnerable save_opt.php page. Requires a working installation of SoftBB 0.1."
