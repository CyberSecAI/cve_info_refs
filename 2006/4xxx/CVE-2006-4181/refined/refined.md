  "CVE-2006-4181": {
    "Description": "A format string vulnerability was found in the sqllog function from the SQL accounting code for radiusd in GNU Radius. This function is only used if one or more of the \"postgresql\", \"mysql\" or \"odbc\" USE flags are enabled.",
    "Root cause": "A format string vulnerability exists in the `sqllog` function within the SQL accounting code of GNU Radius.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Format string vulnerability"
    ],
    "Impact": "An unauthenticated remote attacker can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running radiusd, potentially leading to complete system compromise if radiusd is run as root.",
     "Attack vectors": [
      "Remote exploitation over the network by sending specially crafted data to trigger the vulnerable sqllog function."
    ],
     "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker does not need to be authenticated, they only need to be able to send data to the vulnerable radius service."
