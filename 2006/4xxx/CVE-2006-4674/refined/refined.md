{
  "Root cause": "DokuWiki does not sanitize the X-FORWARDED-FOR HTTP header, allowing injection of arbitrary content, including PHP commands, into a file. Additionally, accessory scripts in the 'bin' directory are vulnerable to directory traversal attacks.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "Improper sanitization of the X-FORWARDED-FOR HTTP header leading to arbitrary content injection.",
    "Directory traversal vulnerability in accessory scripts within the 'bin' directory."
  ],
  "Impact": "A remote attacker can execute arbitrary PHP (and potentially system) commands with the privileges of the user running the DokuWiki process.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Injecting malicious content into the X-FORWARDED-FOR HTTP header.",
    "Using directory traversal vulnerabilities in 'bin' scripts to execute injected code."
   ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the DokuWiki instance and needs to be able to access the 'bin' directory or the scripts within it."
