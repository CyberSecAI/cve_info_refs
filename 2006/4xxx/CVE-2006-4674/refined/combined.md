# DokuWiki: Arbitrary command execution — GLSA **200609-10**

Vulnerabilities in some accessory scripts of DokuWiki allow remote code
execution.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-apps/dokuwiki** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **20060309d** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **20060309d** |

### Background

DokuWiki is a wiki targeted at developer teams, workgroups and small
companies. It does not use a database backend.

### Description

"rgod" discovered that DokuWiki doesn't sanitize the X-FORWARDED-FOR
HTTP header, allowing the injection of arbitrary contents - such as PHP
commands - into a file. Additionally, the accessory scripts installed
in the "bin" DokuWiki directory are vulnerable to directory traversal
attacks, allowing to copy and execute the previously injected code.

### Impact

A remote attacker may execute arbitrary PHP (and thus probably system)
commands with the permissions of the user running the process serving
DokuWiki pages.

### Workaround

Disable remote access to the "bin" subdirectory of the DokuWiki
installation. Remove the directory if you don't use the scripts in
there.

### Resolution

All DokuWiki users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apps/dokuwiki-20060309d"
```
