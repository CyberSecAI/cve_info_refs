  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "CVE": "CVE-2006-4110",
      "root_cause": "Case-insensitive file system on Windows combined with case-sensitive ScriptAlias directive check.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The Apache web server performs a case-sensitive check for the 'ScriptAlias' directive, but file systems on Windows are case-insensitive.",
        "When the script directory is located within the document root and shares a similar name but with different case (e.g., 'cgi-bin' vs 'CGI-BIN'), the server misinterprets the request.",
         "The server does not handle the case difference and serves the source code instead of executing the script."
      ],
      "impact": "Source code disclosure of CGI scripts. An attacker can obtain the source code of CGI scripts by sending a request to the script directory with a different case (e.g., `/CGI-BIN/foo` instead of `/cgi-bin/foo`). This allows an attacker to view potentially sensitive information within the scripts, but will not execute the script.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Direct HTTP GET request to the script's directory using a case different from that defined in the 'ScriptAlias' directive (e.g., 'CGI-BIN' instead of 'cgi-bin').",
         "The attacker must know the location of the CGI scripts, and where they are located within the DocumentRoot."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to know the location of the script directory and have the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.",
      "additional_info": "The vulnerability is specific to Apache servers running on Windows operating systems. The issue arises when the 'ScriptAlias' directory is inside the 'DocumentRoot' and the case of the directory name in the request differs from that in the 'ScriptAlias' configuration."
