{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `$ide` variable in `print.php` is not sanitized, allowing for local file inclusion.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Local File Inclusion (LFI)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can include and execute arbitrary local files on the server, potentially leading to disclosure of sensitive information or remote code execution if the included file contains executable code.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "By manipulating the `ide` parameter in the `print.php` URL."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No authentication is required.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerable code constructs a file path using user-supplied input without proper sanitization, specifically `../$ide.txt` . This enables an attacker to traverse the file system and include arbitrary files by using relative path traversal techniques combined with a null byte termination to bypass checks for file extensions or existence."
