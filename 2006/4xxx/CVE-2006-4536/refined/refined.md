```
- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a SQL injection in the `podpis` parameter during user registration in `module/rejestracja.php`. The code directly includes user-supplied data into the SQL query without sanitization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code to create a new administrator account, allowing them to gain full control of the application.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a web request to the `login.php` page, specifically exploiting the `podpis` parameter during the registration process.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable web server.
