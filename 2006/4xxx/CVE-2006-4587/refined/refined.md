    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2006-4587",
      "source": "www.security-net.biz_c2072412_20250125_034623.html",
      "root_cause": "Multiple vulnerabilities due to lack of proper input sanitization and privilege checks.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Unrestricted File Upload: The `fileupload.html` allows arbitrary file uploads without any privilege checks.",
        "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The `description` variable in all modules and `solution` variable in the `HelpDesk` module are not properly sanitized, leading to XSS vulnerabilities.",
        "Privilege Bypass: There are no proper privilege checks in place allowing any user to access admin modules by directly accessing their URLs."
      ],
      "impact": "Attackers can execute arbitrary code, HTML/script in user's browsers, and bypass privilege restrictions.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "File upload vulnerability can be exploited by uploading malicious files to the server.",
        "XSS vulnerabilities can be exploited by injecting malicious script in the `description` or `solution` variables.",
         "Privilege bypass can be exploited by directly accessing URLs of admin modules."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities remotely without authentication for file upload. For the privilege bypass and XSS vulnerabilities, a valid login to the application is needed but not admin privileges."
