    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2006-4042",
      "description": "MyBloggie 2.1.4 is vulnerable to multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in the trackback.php script due to insufficient sanitization of the 'title', 'url', 'excerpt', and 'blog_name' parameters. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands by injecting malicious code into these parameters.",
      "root_cause": "Insufficient input sanitization in trackback.php. The script takes user-supplied parameters from the POST request ('title', 'url', 'excerpt', 'blog_name') and passes them to the database without proper sanitization. The urldecode() function is used, but this doesn't prevent SQL injection as it doesn't remove SQL injection specific characters.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "SQL Injection (CWE-89)"
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation can lead to: \n- Disclosure of sensitive information, such as admin usernames and password hashes. \n- Modification of database content. \n- Potential full compromise of the database.",
        "attack_vectors": [
        "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted POST request to the trackback.php script. The attacker injects malicious SQL code into the 'title', 'url', 'excerpt' or 'blog_name' parameters, which are then processed by the vulnerable script."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable trackback.php script. No special privileges or authentication is required."
