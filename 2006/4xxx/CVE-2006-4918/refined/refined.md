    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2006-4918",
      "description": "Simple Discussion Board 0.1.0 suffers from a remote file inclusion vulnerability. By manipulating the `env_dir` or `script_root` parameters, an attacker can include and execute arbitrary remote files.",
      "root_cause": "The application fails to sanitize user-supplied parameters (`env_dir`, `script_root`) used in file inclusion operations, leading to arbitrary remote file inclusion.",
       "weaknesses": [
        "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)",
        "Lack of input sanitization"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server by including a malicious remote file.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "HTTP GET requests with vulnerable parameters in URL"
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable application and to host a malicious file accessible to the webserver.",
       "additional_details": "The vulnerable parameters are `env_dir` and `script_root`, present in multiple PHP files such as `blank.php`, `admin.php` and `builddb.php`. An attacker can inject a URL pointing to a malicious PHP script. The included script will be executed with the privileges of the web server."
