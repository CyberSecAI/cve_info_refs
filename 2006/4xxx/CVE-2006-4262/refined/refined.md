{
  "CVE-2006-4262": {
    "Description": "Multiple buffer overflows in cscope, a source browsing tool, which might lead to the execution of arbitrary code.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Unchecked use of strcpy() and *scanf() during file list parsing, path variable expansion, and command line argument parsing.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Stack buffer overflows due to unchecked use of `strcpy` and `*scanf`.",
      "Insufficient bounds checking when processing file paths from `cscope.files`.",
      "Lack of validation during expansion of environment variables in command line arguments.",
        "Vulnerable to command line based overflow attack due to unchecked use of strcpy()"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Execution of arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running cscope.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Specially crafted `cscope.files` placed in shared working directories.",
      "Specially crafted directory and file names in a source tree or archive.",
      "Use of `-I` option with maliciously crafted paths and environment variables.",
        "Malicious command line arguments",
        "Directory or file names with embedded newline or `$` characters"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be able to craft files or manipulate file paths that are processed by cscope. This could involve creating files in a shared working directory, modifying shared source trees or prepackaged source archives, or manipulating command-line arguments.",
      "Additional Information": "Some text editors or IDEs may automatically execute cscope on startup making the attack more stealthy."
