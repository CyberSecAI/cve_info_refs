{
  "CVE-2006-4736": [
    {
      "Root cause": "The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in an SQL query.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "SQL Injection"
      ],
      "Impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion, and potentially full control of the application's database.",
      "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through the `adminname` and `adminpass` parameters in the `index.php` file.",
       "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the affected application and knowledge of the vulnerable parameters."
    },
    {
        "Root cause": "The vulnerability exists due to a lack of proper sanitization of the `adminname` and `adminpass` parameters before they are used in an SQL query.",
        "Weaknesses": [
          "SQL Injection (CWE-89)"
         ],
        "Impact": "An attacker can bypass the admin authentication, gaining unauthorized access to the administrative interface. Exploitation can lead to full control over the database, including reading, modifying, or deleting sensitive data.",
        "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is remote, achieved by manipulating the `adminname` parameter in a POST request to `index.php`.",
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the web application."
