```
- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `exbb[home_path]` parameter in `modules/userstop/userstop.php` is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to include arbitrary files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can include a malicious file from a remote server, leading to arbitrary code execution on the target server.
- **Attack vectors**: By sending a crafted HTTP request with a malicious URL in the `exbb[home_path]` parameter to `modules/userstop/userstop.php`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application and host the malicious file on a server accessible to the vulnerable application.
