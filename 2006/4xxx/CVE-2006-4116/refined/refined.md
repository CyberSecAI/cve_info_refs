{
  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by two stack-based buffer overflows when extracting LZH files with overly long filenames.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Failure to validate the length of the filename before copying it to a 260-byte stack buffer using `strcpy`.",
        "Unsafe use of `sprintf` to construct error messages when the filename is too long, leading to a buffer overflow into a 256-byte stack buffer."
      ],
      "impact": "The buffer overflows allow overwriting the saved EIP, leading to arbitrary code execution.",
      "attack_vectors": "The attacker must convince a user to extract a malicious LZH file.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a malicious LZH file with a filename exceeding the buffer size.",
       "additional_details": "The first overflow occurs when the filename is copied to the `overflowedBuffer` and the second occurs during the creation of an error message into `textBuffer`. The first vulnerability is related to earlier vulnerabilities in the LHA for UNIX code."
