Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2006-4593

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the `page` parameter of the `index.php` script within SoftBB v0.1.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could lead to:
*   Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
*   Session hijacking.
*   Defacement of the web page.
*   Redirection to malicious websites.
*   Potentially other client-side attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through a crafted URL that injects malicious JavaScript code into the `page` parameter of the SoftBB application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker does not need any authentication.
*   The attacker only needs to craft a malicious URL with the payload in the `page` parameter and trick the victim to visit that URL.
*   The attack is remote and does not need any local access to the server or the victim's machine.

**Technical Details:**
The provided exploit demonstrates how to inject malicious javascript code:
`http://Www.Site.Com/[Script]/index.php?page=<script>alert('hacking%20xss')</script>`

This URL, when accessed, will cause the javascript code to be executed in the browser.
