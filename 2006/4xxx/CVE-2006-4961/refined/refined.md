RELATED: CVE-2006-4961
 
The provided content contains information about a vulnerability in PHP Blue Dragon CMS 2.9.1.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a combination of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL injection flaws in the application, specifically in `public_includes/pub_kernel/pbd_modules.php`. This file does not properly sanitize user-supplied input that is included directly in an SQL query, specifically the `ModuleName` parameter. Additionally, user supplied input is not properly handled on the page itself, resulting in XSS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The `GetModuleConfig` function in `pbd_modules.php` is vulnerable to SQL injection because the `ModuleName` parameter is not sanitized before being used in the SQL query.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application fails to sanitize user input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts through the `m` parameter.
- **Remote Code Execution:** The provided exploit takes advantage of the XSS vulnerability to inject PHP code into the application. The injected PHP code allows arbitrary command execution through a `passthru()` call.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the application's database, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or complete database takeover.
- By exploiting the XSS vulnerability, an attacker can inject and execute malicious code on the victim's browser when they view the vulnerable page. This can lead to session hijacking, defacement of the website, or the execution of arbitrary code on the victim's machine.
- The combined vulnerabilities can lead to remote code execution on the web server, enabling an attacker to take full control of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET parameters:** The `m` parameter can be used to perform XSS and SQL injection attacks by sending malicious data through HTTP GET requests.
- **HTTP POST requests:** The attack leverages POST requests to register and login a malicious user, creating a log entry that can be used for command execution.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable application.
- No authentication is required to inject malicious PHP code as the register and login forms can be submitted without valid credentials.
