Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2006-4959:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Multiple web-based vulnerabilities exist in Sun Secure Global Desktop (SSGD) prior to version 4.3 due to a lack of proper authentication and input sanitization in several scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Some scripts allow the execution of arbitrary script code due to insufficient protection.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Certain scripts expose sensitive information such as internal hostnames, software version details, and settings.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts into the web application, potentially leading to:
    *   Extraction of sensitive cookie information.
    *   Launching attacks against other web browser sessions (e.g. buffer overflows).
*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can gather information about the target system, which can be used for further attacks.
*   **Elevated Privileges:** Exploitation of these vulnerabilities can lead to non-authenticated users gaining elevated privileges.
*   **Compromised Secure Environments:** Due to the non-authenticated nature of the affected scripts, these vulnerabilities pose a significant risk to secure environments.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web-Based Attacks:** Exploitation occurs through web-based attacks using classic script injection techniques and manipulated input data.
*   **Unprotected Scripts:** The vulnerabilities reside in scripts that lack proper authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities remotely.
*   **Web Browser:** The attacker must use a web browser to interact with the vulnerable application.
*   **No Authentication Required:** Attackers do not need to authenticate to exploit these vulnerabilities.

**Additional Details:**

*   The specific vulnerable scripts are identified as:
    *   ttaarchives.cgi
    *   ttaAuthentication.jsp
    *   ttalicense.cgi
    *   ttawlogin.cgi
    *   ttawebtop.cgi
    *   ttaabout.cgi
    *   test-cgi
*   The vendor, Sun Microsystems, was initially informed but failed to provide timely patches and stopped responding.
*   The advisory suggests deactivating the identified scripts to mitigate the risk.
*   The vulnerabilities were discovered by Marc Ruef at scip AG.
