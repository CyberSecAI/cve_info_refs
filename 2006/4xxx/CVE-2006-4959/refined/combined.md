How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Sun Secure Global Desktop prior 4.3 multiple remote vulnerabilities
scip AG Vulnerability ID 2555 (09/21/2006)
http://www.scip.ch/cgi-bin/smss/showadvf.pl?id=2555
I. INTRODUCTION
Sun Secure Global Desktop (SSGD, formerly known as Tarantella[1]) is an
open-source remote desktop solution with a basic amount of security.
More information is available at the official product demo web site at
the following URL:
https://sgddemo.sun.com/
II. DESCRIPTION
Marc Ruef at scip AG found six undisclosed web-based vulnerabilities in
Sun Secure Global Desktop prior 4.3. These can be divided into two classes:
1. Cross site scripting
Some scripts that are not protected by any authentication procedure can
be used to run arbitrary script code within a cross site scripting attack.
2. Revealing of sensitive information
Some scripts that are not protected by any authentication procedure can
be accessed to reveal sensitive information (e.g. internal hostnames,
applied software version, details about settings) about the target host.
III. EXPLOITATION
Classic script injection techniques and unexpected input data within a
browser session can be used to exploit these vulnerabilities.
A plugin for the open-source exploiting framework "Attack Tool Kit"
(ATK) will be published in the near future. [2]
We are not going to publish any further technical details or an exploit
suite due to Sun has not published any patches as far as we know. See
vendor response and disclosure timeline for further details.
IV. IMPACT
Because non-authenticated parts of the software are affected, this
vulnerabilities are serious for every secure environment.
Non-authenticated users might be able to exploit the flaws to gain
elevated privileges (e.g. extracting sensitive cookie information or
launch a buffer overflow attack against another web browser).
V. DETECTION
Detection of web based attacks requires a specialized web proxy and/or
intrusion detection system. Patterns for such a detection are available
and easy to implement.
VI. SOLUTION
We have informed sun on a very early stage. They said that the problems
will be addressed with a bugfix for the currently shipping version 4.2
and will no longer be existing in the upcoming version 4.3. We were told
that the public release for the patch is at the end of August 2006. Due
to no public release was made and our last emails were not answered, we
do not know what kind of official solution is available. This is why we
are not going to publish any technical details or exploits at the
moment. De-activate the following scripts to gain a higher level of
security:
- ttaarchives.cgi
- ttaAuthentication.jsp
- ttalicense.cgi
- ttawlogin.cgi
- ttawebtop.cgi
- ttaabout.cgi
- test-cgi
VII. VENDOR RESPONSE
Sun Microsystems Inc. has been informed a first time at 07/04/2006 via
email to contactus-at-sun.com. Because no reply came back we decided to
send a forwarding at 07/18/2006 to security-alert-at-sun.com. A first
response came back on the same day. Several email messages were
exchanged to discuss the vulnerabilities and to co-ordinate the
disclosure of this advisory. However, the last emails since 09/15/2006
have not been answered.
