          "By injecting a URL into the `mosConfig_absolute_path` parameter in a GET request to `Tar.php`."

        "affected_software": "Mambo Component bigAPE-Backup 1.1",
       "additional_info": "The vulnerability is exploitable due to a bypass of globals in PHP versions 4 <= 4.4.0 and 5 <= 5.0.5 using a multipart/form-data POST request, although the specific exploit listed uses a GET request.
