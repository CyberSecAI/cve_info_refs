{
  "CVE-2006-4334": {
    "Description": "GNU zip (gzip) is vulnerable to a NULL pointer dereference. A specially crafted gzip file may trigger a NULL dereference in the huft_build() function during decompression. This may lead to a denial of service or arbitrary code execution.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to a NULL pointer dereference in the huft_build() function of gzip, which is triggered when processing specially crafted gzip files.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "NULL pointer dereference"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation may allow a remote attacker to trigger a denial of service condition or potentially achieve arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user invoking gzip.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker can exploit this by convincing a user or an automated system to decompress a malicious gzip file.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to create a specially crafted gzip archive and induce a user or system to decompress the malicious archive."
