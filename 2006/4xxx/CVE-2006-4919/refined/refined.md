RELATED: CVE-2006-4920, CVE-2006-4921, CVE-2006-4922
The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in Site@School version 2.4.02 and below:

1.  **Remote File Inclusion:**
    *   **Root cause:** The `cmsdir` variable is not properly sanitized in `starnet/modules/sn_allbum/slideshow.php` (lines 39-46), `starnet/modules/include/include.php`, and `starnet/themes/editable/main.inc.php`. This allows an attacker to specify a remote URL, which is then included by the `include()` function.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of input validation on the `cmsdir` parameter.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary command execution with the privileges of the web server.
    *   **Attack vector:** By crafting a malicious URL with the `cmsdir` parameter pointing to a remote file containing malicious code, and then accessing the vulnerable PHP scripts.
    *   **Attacker capabilities:** Requires the ability to host a malicious file on a server accessible to the vulnerable application.

2.  **Directory Traversal:**
    *   **Root cause:** The `dir` parameter in `starnet/editors/htmlarea/popups/images.php` is not properly sanitized.
    *    **Weakness**: Improper input sanitization of the 'dir' parameter.
    *   **Impact:** Allows an attacker to traverse the file system of the server.
    *   **Attack vector:** By crafting a URL with the `dir` parameter containing directory traversal sequences like `../../`.
    *   **Attacker capabilities:** Requires no authentication.

3.  **Arbitrary File Upload:**
    *   **Root cause:** The `starnet/editors/htmlarea/popups/images.php` script is directly accessible without authentication, and it does not validate the file extension of uploaded files. Additionally, the `dirPathPost` variable is not sufficiently sanitized.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of authentication and insufficient file extension validation and directory path sanitization in the file upload process.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary file upload, leading to remote code execution.
    *   **Attack vector:** By crafting a POST request with a malicious file and specifying the target directory through the `dirPath` parameter, then accessing the uploaded file.
    *  **Attacker capabilities:** Requires no authentication.

The provided exploit code demonstrates how to upload a PHP file containing a system command execution function to achieve remote command execution through the file upload vulnerability.

The vendor released version 2.4.03 to fix these vulnerabilities.
