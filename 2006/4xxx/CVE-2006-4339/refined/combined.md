The minimum OpenSSL version was raised to OpenSSL 0.9.7l and OpenSSL 0.9.8d to avoid exposure to known security flaws in older versions (these patches were already issued for Slackware).  If you have not upgraded yet, get those as well to prevent a potentially exploitable security problem in named.  In addition, the default RSA exponent was changed from 3 to 65537.  Both of these issues are essentially the same as ones discovered in OpenSSL at the end of September 2006, only now there's protection against compiling using the wrong OpenSSL version.  RSA keys using exponent 3 (which was previously BIND's default) will need to be regenerated to protect against the forging of RRSIGs.  More details about this issue may be found in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database:    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4339   Here are the details from the Slackware 11.0 ChangeLog: +--------------------------+ patches/packages/bind-9.3.2_P2-i486-1_slack11.0.tgz:   Upgraded to bind-9.3.2-P2.

Package        : openssl096
Problem-Type   : local
Vulnerability  : cryptographic weakness
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2006-4339
BugTraq ID     : 19849
Debian Bug     : 386247

Daniel Bleichenbacher discovered a flaw in OpenSSL cryptographic package
that could allow an attacker to generate a forged signature that OpenSSL
will accept as valid.

For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.6m-1sarge2

This package exists only for compatibility with older software, and is
not present in the unstable or testing branches of Debian.

We recommend that you upgrade your openssl packages.  Note that services
linking against the openssl shared libraries will need to be restarted.
Common examples of such services include most Mail Transport Agents, SSH
servers, and web servers.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenât normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## New Features and What's Fixed in 14.0 SP7?

The following new features and fixes are included in the Reflection
14.0 Service Pack 7. To view features and fixes relevant to the
Reflection product you are using or evaluating, scroll to the
appropriate product name below or use these quick reference links.

**Note:** This service pack is cumulative, and includes all of the fixes originally contained in 14.0 SP1 â SP6 (including SP2.1).

### Reflection for IBM 14.0 SP7

New features in Reflection for IBM 14.0 SP7:

* Configure Reflection Certificate Manager to store trusted certificates in a shared location

A new option, Store trusted certificates in the common application
data folder, is now available in the Reflection Certificate Manager on
the Trusted Certificate Authorities tab. By default trusted roots are
added to a user-specific location. When this option is selected, trusted
roots are saved to the following location, which makes them available
to all users of the computer:

`common_application_data_folder\Attachmate\Reflection\.pki\trust_store.p12.`

**Note the following**:

If a shared store exists, trusted roots are read exclusively from
the shared store. Trusted roots you have configured for individual user
accounts no longer have any effect.Â·

To revert to user-specific trusted root stores after creating a
shared store, you must delete or rename the shared trust\_store.p12 file.
If you simply clear this setting, subsequent changes will modify your
personal store, but the personal store continues to have no effect on
Reflection's behavior as long as trust\_store.p12 is still present in the
common application data folder.Â·

If the operating system has been configured by the administrator to
deny users write access to
common\_application\_data\_folder\Attachmate\Reflection, this setting is
not available to those users and they will not be able to modify items
in the shared trusted root store.

Issues resolved in Reflection for IBM 14.0 SP7:

* Security fix for vulnerabilities in Microsoft Active Template Library (ATL).

This service packs addresses vulnerabilities described in Microsoft
Security Bulletin MS09-035 and Microsoft Security Advisory 973882:
Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Active Template Library (ATL) Could Allow
Remote Code Execution.

* IBM host sessions now connect if an SNA BIND Image is split across multiple Telnet packets.

This resolves a problem seen when data is split and transmitted as two packets to the workstation client.

* The Level button, which is available in the Transfer dialog box for TSO sessions, now works as expected.

This service pack resolves problems seen when browsing files using
the Level button. The Level command now correctly handles strings that
include a period and commands in which the filter supplied is a subset
of the current view.

* Cursor placement in 3270 ISPF session.

When set to use Japanese locale, Reflection now places the cursor correctly when it receives an Insert Cursor order.

* Reflection Certificate Manager correctly handles removing and reinserting a token.

The PKCS #11 tab of the Reflection Certificate Manager includes a
setting called Disconnect automatically when token is removed. Prior to
this service pack, removing the token correctly triggered a disconnect,
but reinserting it caused the client to close unexpectedly. This service
pack fixes this issue; you can now reinsert your token and connect
again.

* Support for TLS connections to hosts that request a client certificate, but don't require one.

If Reflection is configured for a TLS connection and has no suitable
certificates, it now sends a certificate message containing no
certificates as specified in RFC 2246. Previously Reflection terminated
the connection. This change enables Reflection to connect to a server
that requests a client certificate but doesn't require one.

* Fixes previously released in [Reflection for IBM 14.0 SP6](#Reflection_for_IBM_14.0_SP6).

### Reflection for HP, UNIX and OpenVMS 14.0 SP7

Resolved issues in Reflection for HP, UNIX and OpenVMS 14.0 SP7:

* Security fix for vulnerabilities in Microsoft Active Template Library (ATL).

This service packs addresses vulnerabilities described in Microsoft
Security Bulletin MS09-035 and Microsoft Security Advisory 973882:
Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Active Template Library (ATL) Could Allow
Remote Code Execution.

* Fixed trace problems.

This service pack resolves some issues seen when processing traces or using the StartTrace method.

* Correct display of Korean characters.

This service pack resolves several issues reported when connecting to a server configured to use the Korean UFT8 locale.

* Support for TLS connections to hosts that request a client certificate, but don't require one.

If Reflection is configured for a TLS connection and has no suitable
certificates, it now sends a certificate message containing no
certificates as specified in RFC 2246. Previously Reflection terminated
the connection. This change enables Reflection to connect to a server
that requests a client certificate but doesn't require one.

* Fixes previously released in [Reflection for HP, UNIX and OpenVMS 14.0 SP6](#Reflection_for_HP_UNIX_and_OpenVMS_14.0_SP6).

### Reflection X 14.0 SP7

Issues resolved in Reflection X 14.0 SP7:

* Reflection X Profiler correctly supports configuring "Font server fonts storage settings"

The Reflection X profiler no longer closes unexpectedly when you click the Font server fonts storage settings button.

* Corrected display of X Screen panel on Japanese systems

This service pack corrects a Japanese display problem in the X Screen panel that was introduced in SP6.

* Restore GLX pixmap functionality

Reflection X uses the following approach to support GLX
functionality. It attempts to offer 8bit GLX pixmaps of both the RGBA
render type and the COLORINDEX render type. If the GLX pixmap was
created with pre-GLX 1.3 protocol, Reflection uses the visual in the
render context to determine which kind to use.

* Fix for unexpected display of the HTTP proxy dialog box

The HTTP proxy dialog box no longer appears unexpectedly when making a client Telnet connection.

* Fix for flipped GLX pixmaps

All drawing into a pixmap now has the same orientation as drawing into a GLXPixmap that was made from the X pixmap.

* Host name drop-down list now updates immediately

Reflection now updates the host drop-down list in the Reflection X
Manager immediately when a client command is run on a host for the first
time.

* Fix for window decoration display problems seen in some pop-up windows

Top-level windows now show correct window decoration (display of the
title bar, close button, window border, etc.) if the window's Motif
hints ask for a title bar. This fixes problems that were reported
against Reflection version 14 SP 6 by customers using ILOG and CADENCE
a-SX applications.

* Copy and Paste support between Windows applications and X applications

Copy and paste now works correctly between Windows applications and X
applications running in an X terminal window. This fixes a problem
reported in version 14 SP6.

* Correct display of Japanese characters in Windows taskbar

This service pack provides additional fixes for Japanese character display problems seen in the Windows taskbar display.

* Unknown host error message is now displayed for Secure Shell connections

Reflection X sessions configured to connect using SECURE SHELL now
display the following error message when a host is unknown or the host
name can't be resolved: "No such host is known".

* X Client Wizard support on newer versions of Linux

The X Client Wizard is now supported on platforms that use the path /usr/bin for common X clients.

* The XI Driver Client dialog box is now minimized by default

When the setting Auto start XI Driver Client is selected, the XI
Driver Client dialog box is now minimized when you start the Reflection X
Manager, and the dialog box title bar now includes buttons to support
minimizing and restoring the dialog box display.

* PolyPoints drawing support on systems with nVidia video drivers

Reflection X no longer closes unexpectedly when drawing many
thousands of PolyPoints multiple times on an x86 system with a current
nVidia video driver.

* Fixes previously released in [Reflection X 14.0 SP6](#Reflection_X_14.0_SP6).

### Reflection FTP 14.0 SP7

New features in Reflection FTP 14.0 SP7:

* Preserve timestamps and file attributes during SFTP transfers

A new site-specific setting, Preserve timestamps and file
attributes, is available for SFTP transfers. When this option is
selected, file attributes and timestamps are not modified when files are
transferred to and from the server. To configure this setting, select
your site, click Security, then click the Secure Shell tab. Note:
Selecting this setting sets the PreserveTimestamps in the Secure Shell
configuration file.

* Configure default file attributes for uploads and downloads

You can now configure global default attributes for file transfers
to and from any server using Tools > Options > Attributes. (Note:
To be able to specify non-default attributes during a file transfer, go
to the Site Properties dialog box. On the Transfer tab, enable Show
upload options before transfer and/or Show download options before
transfer.)

* Server view filter is now supported for SFTP connections

File view filters (configured using either View > Filter, or Site
Properties > Directories > File view filter) are now supported
for SFTP connections.

Resolved issues in Reflection FTP 14.0 SP7:

* Intermittent "File or directory not found" errors no longer interrupt transfers made using the FTP Client API

This service pack resolves a problem that caused intermittent errors
in transfers made using the FTP Client API. The error interrupted
program execution and reported "File or directory not found" even though
the required files were present on the server and the program was able
to execute successfully on many other attempts.

* Fixes previously released in [Reflection FTP 14.0 SP6](#Reflection_FTP_14.0_SP6).

### Secure Shell 14.0 SP7

The following Secure Shell updates apply to these Reflection applications:

Reflection for HP

Reflection for UNIX and OpenVMS

Reflection for ReGIS Graphics

Reflection X

Reflection FTP Client

New feature in Reflection Secure Shell 14.0 SP7:

* Configure Reflection Certificate Manager to store trusted certificates in a shared location

A new option, Store trusted certificates in the common application
data folder, is now available in the Reflection Certificate Manager on
the Trusted Certificate Authorities tab. By default trusted roots are
added to a user-specific location. When this option is selected, trusted
roots are saved to the following location, which makes them available
to all users of the computer:

`common_application_data_folder\Attachmate\Reflection\.pki\trust_store.p12.`

**Notes the following**:

If a shared store exists, trusted roots are read exclusively from
the shared store. Trusted roots you have configured for individual user
accounts no longer have any effect.Â·

To revert to user-specific trusted root stores after creating a
shared store, you must delete or rename the shared trust\_store.p12 file.
If you simply clear this setting, subsequent changes will modify your
personal store, but the personal store continues to have no effect on
Reflection's behavior as long as trust\_store.p12 is still present in the
common application data folder.Â·

If the operating system has been configured by the administrator to
deny users write access to
common\_application\_data\_folder\Attachmate\Reflection, this setting is
not available to those users and they will not be able to modify items
in the shared trusted root store.

Resolved issues in Reflection Secure Shell 14.0 SP7:

* CPU management for Secure Shell sessions running in Citrix environments.

Improvements have been made to how CPU is managed in Citrix ennviroments.

* Rekeying when host key is not present no longer disconnects the session.

The client now presents the unknown host key prompt if a reky occures and the host key is not present.

* Reflection Certificate Manager correctly handles removing and reinserting a token.

The PKCS #11 tab of the Reflection Certificate Manager includes a
setting called Disconnect automatically when token is removed. Prior to
this service pack, removing the token correctly triggered a disconnect,
but reinserting it caused the client to close unexpectedly. This service
pack fixes this issue; you can now reinsert your token and connect
again.

* Banner text wraps correctly.

The client now correctly handles new line requests in banners
displayed in Secure Shell connections. This fixes a problem that was
reported with SP 6.

* scp transfer now returns non-zero return codes when an error occurs.

Prior to this service pack some failing scp transfers returned a
zero error code. This was reported for transfers in which the error was
"Access is denied" and "The system cannot find the path specified".
These errors now return the appropriate non-zero error codes.

* Host logout is now successfully displayed during Secure Shell sessions.

This service pack resolves a problem reported with Secure Shell
connections that sometimes resulted in no host logout message being
displayed in the Reflection terminal window.

* Window-change requests no longer cause the Secure Shell connection to fail.

Reflection no longe sends incorrect pixel values with the client's
Window-change request. This resolves a problem caused the Secure Shell
connection to be terminated when using the BalaBit Shell Control Box.

* Smart card authentication no longer fails with a provider exception error for some manufacturers.

Prior to this service pack, some smartcard hardware and software
configurations led to authentication failures with the error
"ProviderException (11) when attempting to sign data." This problem has
been resolved.

* Recursive scp copies now include the top level directory.

After execution of the command scp -r user@host:Demo, the directory
"Demo" is now created on the server. Previously only files and
subdirectories contained within "Demo" were copied to the server

* Password error messages from the server are now displayed.

During Secure Shell password authentication, error messages from the server are now displayed in the Reflection window.

* Authentication with a certificate stored in the Key Agent.

Authentication now succeeds when you authenticate using a valid certificate stored in the Reflection Key Agent.

* Kerberos "Use Window Logon" option is now dimmed on systems that don't support it.

The "Use Window Logon" option is not available on some 64-bit
operating systems, which don't support this option. Previously, attempts
to use this option on these systems caused an unexpected shutdown. The
control is no longer available to set on systems that don't support it.

* Default values can now be saved to the user's configuration file.

The default value of a setting configured using the Reflection
Secure Shell Settings dialog box is now written to the user-specific
config file if and only if a non-default value for that setting is
configured in a system-wide ssh\_config file. Also, if a user adds a
default value by manually editing the user-specific configuration file,
the default value is honored and not removed from the user's file.

* Values from the global configuration file are no longer written to the user-specific file.

Prior to this service pack, if a global configuration file was
present, any non-default values in the global file were written to the
user-specific file when the user made any changes using the Secure Shell
Settings dialog box. Settings configured in the system-wide ssh\_config
file no longer have any effect on user-specific config files.

* Remote commands that include spaces now execute correctly.

If you specify a remote command that includes spaces as part of an
ssh command line, the remote command is now executed as expected.

* Fixes previously released in [Secure Shell 14.0 SP6](#Secure_Shell_14.0_SP6).

(for example, ASCII or binary) and and file properties (UNIX attributes
or Windows read-only or hidden properties, depending on the server)
before each transfer. Note: The FTP server must support the SITE UMASK
command for the attributes settings to succeed on uploads.

* Configure default permissions for uploaded files.

You can now specify an initial umask value to send to the server
upon connection. The FTP server must support the SITE UMASK command for
this setting to succeed. This value modifies the default permissions
attributes set on subsequently created files. From the Connect to FTP
Site dialog box, go to Properties > Connection > Initial umask.
Note: This setting is not available for SFTP connections.

* IPv6 support.

You can now specify host names using IPv6 addresses.

Issues resolved in Reflection FTP 14.0 SP6:

values for the following configuration file keywords:
UserConfigDirectory, IdentityFile, PasswordFile, UserKnownHostsFile,
GlobalKnownHostsFile, User, and AuthCookie. Use "%" before and after the
environment variable name. For example:

`IdentityFile %EnvironmentVariableFolder%\key`

* IPv6 support in command line utilities.

You can now specify IPv6 host names when using the Secure Shell
command line utilities. Note: IPv6 formatted IP addresses must be
enclosed in square brackets. For example:

`ssh user@[fec0::14:a00:20ff:feb8:1234]`

* New option to add a new host key when a change to an existing host key is detected.

When the client detects a change in the host key file, you are now
given the option of adding a new key to the known hosts file (using the
same host name but a different IP address, port, or key) in addition to
the option of overwriting the existing key.

* New CheckHostPort keyword.

Use the new CheckHostPort keyword to configure the client to check
the host port in the known hosts file in addition to checking the host
public key. When this keyword is set to "yes", the connection is allowed
only if the host port in the known hosts list matches the port you are
using for the connection. The default is "no". Note: This setting has no
effect if StrictHostKeyChecking = no.

* Fixes previously released in [Secure Shell 14.0 SP5](#Secure_Shell_14.0_SP5).

## New Features and What's Fixed in 14.0 SP5?

The following new features and fixes are included in the Reflection
14.0 Service Pack 5. To view features and fixes relevant to the
Reflection product you are using or evaluating, scroll to the
appropriate product name below or use these quick reference links.

**Note:** This service pack is cumulative, and includes all of the fixes originally contained in 14.0 SP1, SP2, SP2.1, SP3, and SP4.

### Reflection for IBM 14.0 SP5

**Note:** Starting with Reflection 14.0 SP5, HiT drivers are no
longer included with Reflection software media. For addition
information, see [KBÂ 7021477](doc.php?id=7021477).

New features in Reflection for IBM 14.0 SP5:

* New Setting for enabling and disabling the reference to a shared macros file.

You can now configure whether or not Reflection includes a reference
to a shared macros settings file using the new setting "Automatically
add a reference to Shared Macros settings file." The default value of
this setting is Yes. To configure this, go to Setup > View Settings.

* New setting for enabling or disabling LISTDS command for IND$FILE transfer.

You can now configure whether or not Reflection sends a LISTDS
command during IND$FILE transfer using the new setting TSO Require
Member Name. Use this setting if the LISTDS command causes information
to be sent to the terminal screen, which causes an application error.
When set to No (the default) a "LISTDS <dataset>" is issued to
determine if the dataset is a PDS. If it is, and no member name has been
supplied, a new member name is created automatically based on the
source file name. When set to Yes, this feature is disabled, and the
user must supply a member name (for example, dataset(member)) or the
transfer attempt fail with the following error: TRANS17 Missing or
incorrect TSO data set name: file transfer cancelled.

Issues resolved in Reflection for IBM 14.0 SP5:

* Section 508 updates.

Updates have been made to ensure compliance with Section 508 accessibility standards.

* Alt+F6 support in Reflection ActiveX control.

Reflection now handles the Alt+F6 keystroke combination correctly when it is running as an ActiveX control.

* SaveSettings method.

This service pack resolves problems seen when running macros and saving settings files that use the SaveSettings method.

* DBCS printing.

This service pack resolves a printing issue that was seen when
Reflection is configured for 5553 DBCS printer emulation and the print
job contains wide columns. Reflection now acknowledges a single FormFeed
character from the host.

* Opening multiple sessions in quick succession using third-party software.

Reflection can now handle multiple synchronous calls issued by
HLLAPI clients. This resolves a problem that was reported when opening
several sessions in quick succession using the eSSO single signon
solution.

* JOIN BY statement in LIPI File Transfer.

LIPI file transfers that use the JOIN BY statement no longer
generate the error "Spaces not allowed in library, file, or member
names."

* Show Host Files with Visara controller.

The file transfer Show Host Files feature now works correctly when
you are connected through a Visara controller and logged onto TSO.

* Support for mapping additional valid DBCS characters.

You can now map DBCS characters that were previously not supported in the Reflection DBCS Translation Table Editor.

* Fixes previously released in [Reflection for IBM 14.0 SP4](#Reflection_for_IBM_14.0_SP4).

### Reflection for HP, UNIX and OpenVMS 14.0 SP5

New features in Reflection for HP, UNIX and OpenVMS 14.0 SP5:

* New Setting for enabling and disabling the reference to a shared macros file.

You can now configure whether or not Reflection includes a reference
to a shared macros settings file using the new setting "Automatically
add a reference to Shared Macros settings file." The default value of
this setting is Yes. To configure this, go to Setup > View Settings.

* Configure ambiguous-width Unicode characters to be displayed as wide characters.

Use the new setting Ambiguous Width Unicode Chars Are Always
Displayed as Wide. To configure this, go to Setup > View Settings.

* Configure Reflection to clear the user name from memory immediately after a connection closes.

This feature is available for Secure Shell connections. Use the new
setting Cache Secure Shell User Name. To configure this, go to Setup
> View Settings. When this setting is Yes (the default), the user
name remains in memory after the client disconnects and users can
reconnect without re-entering their user name. The user name remains in
memory until Reflection closes and can be seen using the read-only
setting Connection Setting UserName. When this setting is No, the user
name is cleared from memory when the client disconnects, and users must
re-enter their user name for each connection.

Issues resolved in Reflection for HP, UNIX and OpenVMS 14.0 SP5:

* Section 508 updates.

Updates have been made to ensure compliance with Section 508 accessibility standards.

* Configure serial port connection on 64-bit Windows.

Reflection running on a 64-bit version of Windows now supports connections using a serial port.

* Copy and paste problems introduced in SP4 are resolved.

This service pack resolves some copy and paste problems that were introduced in Service Pack 4.

* Save settings to a file that includes a locked VBA project.

You can now update and save settings in a settings file that includes a locked VBA project.

* Host logout is now successfully displayed.

This service pack resolves a problem reported with Telnet
connections that sometimes resulted in no host logout message being
displayed in the Reflection terminal window.

* Terminal type negotiation during Telnet negotiations.

Reflection now sends a "WILL TERMINAL TYPE" to the server with the initial Telnet negotiation packet.

* Reflection for the Web metering server support.

Reflection now runs correctly when it is installed on a computer
configured for metering by the Reflection for the Web metering server.

* Connection directory allows configurations with no user name.

If you are configuring Rlogin or Secure Shell connections using the
Connection directory (a prior version feature), you can now specify just
the host name with no user name. You will be prompted for the user name
when you connect.

* Launch Reflection on Vista in some scenarios when other software is running.

You can now launch Reflection on a computer running on Windows Vista
when certain other software programs (including Dell Support Center)
are running.

* SOCKS sessions no longer disconnect with unknown packet error.

This service pack resolves problems that caused SOCKS connections to
become disconnected with an unknown packet error in some environments
with a slow server response time.

* Saving changes to fonts.

Saved changes to terminal window fonts are now preserved correctly for all terminal types.

* Fixes previously released in [Reflection for HP, UNIX and OpenVMS 14.0 SP4](#Reflection_for_HP_UNIX_and_OpenVMS_14.0_SP4).

### Reflection X 14.0 SP5

New features in Reflection X 14.0 SP5:

* New startup parameter: Set timeout option for XDMCP.

The new -xdmcptimeout parameter can be used in conjunction with the
-b, -d, and -i options to set an XDMCP timeout when initiating XDMCP
from the command line. If not specified, the timeout defaults to 15
seconds.

Syntax: -xdmcptimeout <number> (where number is number of seconds)

Example with timeout set to 30 seconds: "C:\Program Files\Attachmate\Reflection\Rx.exe" -xdmcptimeout 30 -d <host>

* Upgrade enhancement: Upgrade installed x32 Reflection X to a newer x64 version.

You can now use the Reflection X x64 Installer package to upgrade an
older x32 Reflection X product that is running on an x64 platform. The
upgrade converts Reflection X x32 to the new x64 version of Reflection X
14.0.5.

* New check box: Use retained fonts.

The new Use retained fonts check box allows users to control whether
Reflection X will use cached font server fonts. By default Reflection X
looks for cached fonts and uses them. Previously, Reflection X always
implicitly looked for the fonts and used them if found.

* New startup parameter: Assign template status to an \*.rxs settings file that is not stored in the default templates directory.

The new -template startup option can be used in conjunction with the
-s option to specify that Reflection X should treat the settings file
used to start the X server as a template, and that all settings
previously associated with that server should be deleted.

Example: "C:\Program Files\Attachmate\Reflection\Rx.exe" -template -s "C:\Documents and Settings\larry\<file>.rxs"

Using this option guarantees that when the X server is started, a
predictable set of X server settings are used. Settings in the -template
server settings file are honored every time the file is launched with
this switch. Server settings that are not in the file will inherit
application default values.

* New templates available to display X clients from VMS hosts.

Four new templates can be used to obtain X application displays from
X clients running on VMS hosts over Telnet or SSH. To obtain the
templates see [KBÂ 7021798](doc.php?id=7021798).

Issues resolved in Reflection X 14.0 SP5:

* Microsoft fonts now correctly aligned in programs.

When a Windows scalable font is opened, Reflection X now creates
font property atoms filled in with default or computed values when those
values were not explicitly set by the client when it specified the XLFD
name. For example, when the client specifies 0 for point size, pixel
size, and width, Reflection X will compute values and report those in
the font property atoms. This behavior now matches what Reflection X
does for scalable X bitmap fonts.

* Taskbar icon and popup menu character corruption fixed.

Reflection X now shows window titles in icons correctly in X desktop mode in both Japanese and Chinese locales.

* Local IME now enters Japanese characters in GNOME text editor (gEdit).

When pasting Japanese characters in the GNOME text editor (gEdit),
Reflection X now uses the current Windows cursor location as the
insertion point. There is no reliable way to determine the insertion
point for gEdit based on X protocol received.

* Zooming/Unzooming in Synopsys CATS application now works correctly.

Rapid zooming and unzooming in Synopsys CATS application no longer causes Reflection X to crash.

* Section 508 updates.

Updates have been made to ensure compliance with Section 508 accessibility standards.

* Dimensions of Xscreens in a multi-monitor PC environment are now calculated correctly on secondary monitors.

Screen mm width and height now account for virtual screen sizes and screens that span multiple monitors.

* When using a multiple monitor system, it is now possible to drag the X terminal desktop to a second monitor.

Panning no longer forces an X terminal desktop root window back to a
specific monitor even though it was configured to be placed initially
on a specific monitor.

* A single button click from Vista taskbar now restores a minimized X root window.

On Vista systems, a minimized Reflection X root window is now restored with a single click on the taskbar button.

* Font logging now identifies font file name when font is found on a font server.

Reflection X now logs the font file name when font logging is on and the font was retrieved from a font server.

* Restored ability to launch Reflection X from the command line without GLX enabled.

The -noglx command line option now functions correctly, launching Reflection X without GLX enabled.

* "Create a shortcut when saving X client files" check box can now be cleared to disable this functionality.

When you clear the "Create a shortcut when saving X client files"
check box and click OK, Reflection X now saves the changed state.

* Use of %#% macro no longer causes VMS connections to fail.

On all hosts, the display macro now sends the IP address and display
number to the host. The macro no longer includes the screen number in
information sent.

* Resolved problem waiting for unresponsive font server.

Reflection X no longer waits indefinitely on an unresponsive font
server. When a font server stops responding, Reflection X will put the
client to sleep and intermittently check to see if the font server is
available. When it becomes available Reflection X will wake the client
and allow it to continue where it left off.

* Fixes previously released in [Reflection X 14.0 SP4](#Reflection_X_14.0_SP4).

### Reflection FTP 14.0 SP5

Issues resolved in Reflection FTP 14.0 SP5:

* Section 508 updates.

Updates have been made to ensure compliance with Section 508 accessibility standards.

* Transfer of compressed zip files in SFTP connections.

Users without local administrative rights can now successfully
transfer folders containing compressed zip files when the FTP Client is
configured to use SFTP transfer.

* Wildcard support for the OpenDirectoryListing method.

Using the OpenDirectoryListing method with an asterisk (.OpenDirectoryListing "\*" ) now works as expected.

* Fixes previously released in [Reflection FTP 14.0 SP4](#Reflection_FTP_14.0_SP4).

### Secure Shell 14.0 SP5

The following Secure Shell updates apply to these Reflection applications:

Reflection for HP

Reflection for UNIX and OpenVMS

Reflection for ReGIS Graphics

Reflection X

Reflection FTP Client

New features in Reflection Secure Shell 14.0 SP5:

* Set environment variables on the remote host.

From the Reflection Secure Shell Settings dialog box, click the new
Host Data tab. Under Environment variables, click Add to specify a new
variable and value. (This change is saved to the Secure Shell
configuration file using the SendEnv keyword.)

* Specify one or more commands to execute on the remote server.

From the Reflection Secure Shell Settings dialog box, click the new
Host Data tab. Use the Command text box to specify one or more remote
commands. Use a semi-colon (;) to separate multiple commands. (This
change is saved to the Secure Shell configuration file using the
RemoteCommand keyword.)

Issues resolved in Reflection Secure Shell 14.0 SP5:

* scp -r transfers continue after permission denied error.

The client now continues to transfer the remaining files and folders
after a "permission denied" error occurs during an scp -r transfer.

* Client searches for global known host keys during a rekey exchange.

During a rekey exchange, the client now searches for the host key in
the global known hosts file in addition to the user-specific known
hosts file.

* Source file is not deleted after a scp -u transfer fails.

When an scp -u transfer fails, the source file is no longer removed from the remote host.

* Enforce Fips Mode from the command line.

You can now enforce FIPS-approved ciphers and MACs from the ssh command line using ssh -o FipsMode.

* Batch transfers with scp and sftp no longer fail with packet too long error.

Batch transfers made using the scp and sftp command line utilities
no longer fail with a packet too long error when a packet exceeds the
expected length.

* rsshe.exe processes no longer remain after multiple scp and sftp commands.

Executing multiple, simultaneous scp and sftp batch files no longer
results in several rssh.exe processes left running after the scp.exe and
sftp.exe processes have completed.

* The expected error is now returned when scp -r transfer fails.

When an scp -r transfer fails because the folder doesn't exist, the client now returns an error.

* Support for using scp with a folder name.

The scp command now correctly handles commands that specify a folder name rather than a file name on the command line.

* Import trusted root certificates that contain UTF-8 strings.

The client can now import trusted root certificates that contain
UTF-8 strings. If a parsing error occurs when loading a certificate, the
client logs the error and continues running.

* Support for -k and -o UserKnownHostsFile.

The -k and -o UserKnownHostsFile options now work as expected with the ssh2, sftp2, and scp2 command line utilities.

* Warning message for sftp rename of an existing file.

The sftp command line utility now warns users when you attempt to rename a file using an existing filename.

* Preservation of timestamp on read-only files.

The timestamp is now preserved when you download read-only files from the remote server using scp -p.

* Warning messages from the command line no longer display in a pop-up window.

When the ssh command line utility is used with StrictHostKeyChecking
set to yes, warning messages for failed connections are now displayed
in the command window rather than in a pop-up. This change enables
scripts to run without requiring user intervention.

* Japanese character support for scp transfer.

Transfers made using scp no longer fail when certain Japanese characters are used in the file or folder name.

* The "user@" syntax is no longer required for scp2.

The scp2 command line utility no longer requires you to include user@ with the host name.

* Fixes previously released in [Secure Shell 14.0 SP4](#Secure_Shell_14.0_SP4).

## New Features and What's Fixed in 14.0 SP4?

The following new features and fixes are included in the Reflection
14.0 Service Pack 4. To view features and fixes relevant to the
Reflection product you are using or evaluating, scroll to the
appropriate product name below or use these quick reference links.

**Note:** This service pack is cumulative, and includes all of the fixes originally contained in 14.0 SP1, SP2, SP2.1, and SP3.

### Reflection for IBM 14.0 SP4

New feature in Reflection for IBM 14.0 SP4:

* New Setting: "Allow unpaired SI"

This setting is off by default. When set to 'Yes', unpaired SIs do
not result in a XPROG 750, but are also not marked as being part of a
SO/SI subfield.

Known issue in Reflection for IBM 14.0 SP4:

* If you are using VBA projects, refer to Technical Note [2364](https://support.microfocus.com/techdocs/2364.html).

Issues resolved in Reflection for IBM 14.0 SP4:

* Cannot open a transfer request file on a mapped drive.

This service pack fixes a problem that caused Reflection running on
VISTA to crash when you opened a transfer request file (mto) with the
local folder pointing to a mapped drive.

* File transfer to the Mainframe via IND$FILE fails with TRANS13 error.

This service pack fixes a problem reported for transfers using
IND$FILE structured field file transfer. Transfers presented a Transfer
in Progress dialog box and the message, "Transfer failed: TRANS13 Error
writing file to host: file transfer canceled"

* Closing the Configure PKI dialog box enables "Use OCSP".

Closing the Configure PKI dialog box using the OK button enabled the
Use OCSP setting and caused connections to fail. This service pack
fixes this problem.

* Unable to perform a 5250 File Transfer over a secure connection when host name does not match certificate.

When attempting a 5250 file transfer over a secure connection, the
connection failed if the Host name did not match the Host name in the
certificate even when "Certificate host name must match host being
contacted" was not selected. This service pack fixes this problem.

* Reflection crashes with SQL transfer of variable length fields.

This service pack fixes a problem that caused Reflection to crash in
module r8xfrpcs.dll when transferring variable length fields.

* 5250 File Transfer download with physical file containing varchar fields creates an inaccurate .FDF file.

This service pack fixes this problem.

* Fixes previously released in [Reflection for IBM 14.0 SP3](#Reflection_for_IBM_14.0_SP3).

### Reflection for HP, UNIX and OpenVMS 14.0 SP4

New features in Reflection for HP, UNIX and OpenVMS 14.0 SP4:

* New event type: "Before a connection is made"

You can now configure Reflection to execute actions before a
connection is made. To do this, go to Setup > Events > New. Under
Event Type, select "Before a connection is made."

* New setting: "Copy Unicode to Clipboard in Addition To Text"

When this setting is True (the default) Reflection copies both
unicode and text to the clipboard. When it is False, Reflection copies
only the text of the display memory to the clipboard. Setting this to
False can speed up the copy command. To change this setting, use Setup
> View Settings.

Known issue in Reflection for HP, UNIX and Open VMS 14.0 SP4:

* If you are using VBA projects, refer to Technical Note [2364](https://support.microfocus.com/techdocs/2364.html).

Issues resolved in Reflection for HP, UNIX and OpenVMS 14.0 SP4:

* Reflection running on VISTA hangs during selection of text.

This service pack fixes this problem.

* Reflection crashes when closed by Windows Task Scheduler.

Reflection no longer crashes with an application error when closed
by the Windows Task Scheduler. Note: Even with this fix in place, the
best practice is to use Reflection commands to close the application
exit rather than using the Task Scheduler.

* Canceling the phone number prompt causes an error in rcom.dll.

This service pack fixes this problem.

* R2win.exe crashes when closing session connected to HP-Tru64 using VT420 mode.

This problems was caused by an off-by-one error in VT UDK escape sequence processing. This service pack fixes this problem.

* Host application problems during Secure Shell sessions due to extra window change messages.

This service pack fixes a problem that caused some host application
problems when running Secure Shell sessions in the Reflection terminal
window. In one reported case the host prompt was displayed before the
user pressed the Enter key, which resulted in an error message from the
server. The Reflection GUI client was sending an extra Secure Shell
window change message after connecting. With this fix, extra window
change messages are not sent.

* Edit > CopyTable command does not work properly.

This service pack fixes this problem.

* GetMacroList causes Reflection session to crash.

In settings files with a large number of subroutines, executing
GetMacroList could cause the Reflection session to crash. This service
pack fixes this problem.

* Possible Reflection crash in module GDI32.DLL on some German Operating Systems.

This service pack fixes this problem.

* Fixes previously released in [Reflection for HP, UNIX and OpenVMS 14.0 SP3](#Reflection_for_HP_UNIX_and_OpenVMS_14.0_SP3).

### Reflection X 14.0 SP4

New features in Reflection X 14.0 SP4:

* New Display setting: Ignore Windows taskbar.

This Service Pack contains a new setting called Ignore Windows
taskbar (Settings menu > Display). When this setting is disabled (the
default), Reflection X creates a root window that does not intersect
the Windows taskbar. When this setting is enabled, Reflection X creates a
root window that uses the entire area of the primary monitor (as long
as no virtual size is specified that would cause different dimensions to
be used). The size, location, and state of the Windows taskbar are
ignored.

* Warning dialog box enhancements.

Additional information has been added to the warning dialog box that
displays when certain types of system changes occur, such as a change
in the size of the desktop work area or a change in color depth. In
addition, when there's a change to desktop work area, the warning dialog
box that appears has a check box that enables the decision to be
remembered until Reflection X is shut down.

* GLX version 1.4 now supported.

This Service Pack adds support for GLX, version 1.4.

* Support added for 3D texture in the OpenGL extension.

Starting with this Service Pack, when you enable the GLX extension
(Settings menu > Server > Extensions), Reflection X advertises
GL\_EXT\_texture3d.

Issues resolved in Reflection X 14.0 SP4:

* Issue fixed with multiple, identically named .rxs files.

In previous versions of Reflection X, when two .rxs files with the
same base name in different locations were used with Reflection X
shortcuts, it was not clear to the user which .rxs file settings were in
effect. Both .rxs files were associated with the same Reflection X
server instance. A change provided with this Service Pack fixes this
issue. Now, there is a one-to-one mapping between .rxs files and server
instance names. In the case where there's an existing mapping and a
second .rxs file is introduced, the second .rxs file becomes associated
with the server instance and the association with the first .rxs file is
removed.

* Window name correctly displayed.

In earlier versions, Reflection failed to correctly show some window
names for CDE sessions whose locale was set to ja\_SP.SJIS. This issue
has been fixed.

* Interactions with unresponsive font server refined.

When a font server becomes unresponsive, Reflection X will no longer
wait indefinitely for a reply from the font server. Now, Reflection X
will sleep the client that is causing it to communicate with the font
server and intermittently check to see if it has become available. When
the font server becomes available, Reflection X will wake the client and
allow it to continue where it left off.

* Diagonal lines now correctly drawn when Perfect pixelization enabled.

Reflection X now consistently draws correct solid, zero-width
diagonal lines when Perfect pixelization (Settings menu > Speed) is
enabled.

* Hide button added to Host Response dialog box for SSH connections.

In earlier versions, closing the Host Response dialog box for an SSH
connection resulted in SSH connections being terminated. Now, for SSH
connections, there is a Hide button in the Show Host Response dialog
box. This allows users to remove the dialog box from view without
affecting the connection.

* DBE protocol output added.

To enhance protocol traces, DBE protocol processing has been added.

* Problem connecting to Sun OpenWindows desktop in MS Windows desktop mode fixed.

Previously, Reflection X was unable to iconify an olwm-managed
window while in Microsoft Desktop mode. This problem has been fixed.

* Issues with host-based security resolved.

In previous versions, Reflection X would disable Host-based security
if no valid hosts were listed in the host security file. Now, when this
situation occurs, Host-based security continues to be enabled.

* Font aliases added.

Font aliases have been added to enhance Reflection's compatibility with certain WindU/Bristol X-based applications.

* Support added for several OpenGL enumerants.

This Service Pack includes support for several OpenGL enumerants that were missing in earlier versions.

* Issue with disabled X Manager and multiple server instances resolved.

In previous versions, multiple server instances were not allowed to
start if the Reflection X Manager was disabled via the Profiler or the
"-nc" command line switch. Now, each subsequent server instance is
allowed to start and is given a notification tray icon for server
management functions.

* Problem related to shift key + number pad key fixed.

Starting with this Service Pack, when you use a shift key in
combination with a number pad key, extraneous Microsoft
Windows-generated key release and key press events are ignored.

* Fixes previously released in [Reflection X 14.0 SP3](#Reflection_X_14.0_SP3).

### Reflection FTP 14.0 SP4

New feature in Reflection FTP 14.0 SP4:

* Edit server files.

You can now edit server files directly from the server pane display.
To do this, right-click on a server file and select Edit. The FTP
Client downloads the file to your system and opens the associated
editor. When you save and close the file, the FTP Client uploads it back
to the server.

Issues resolved in Reflection FTP 14.0 SP4:

* Connection failure when using the Reflection for the Web security proxy.

The FTP Client can now connect correctly through the proxy server when client authorization is enabled on the proxy.

* FTP Client reports the security proxy thumbprint incorrectly.

The thumbprint of the Reflection for the Web security proxy server certificate is now correctly reported by the client.

* Double-clicking a server file overwrites an existing local copy of the same file.

When you double-click a server file to view it, the client downloads
a copy of file. Prior to this fix, this action would always overwrite
an existing local file with the same name regardless of the If File
Exists setting. With this fix, the client honors your If File Exists
setting. Note: Update and Unique are not used when downloading to view
server files. If either of these preferences is set, users are asked if
they want to download the server file if a file of the same name already
exists.

* Unable to connect to an HP3000 server via socks server.

This service pack fixes this problem by allowing passive mode connections to HP3000 servers.

* Problems navigating using double-click in the local pane.

On Windows 2000 systems, double-clicking in the local pane opened a
folder in a new Explorer window rather than navigating through the FTP
client local pane. This service pack fixes this problem.

* Fixes previously released in [Reflection FTP 14.0 SP3](#Reflection_FTP_14.0_SP3).

### Secure Shell 14.0 SP4

The following Secure Shell updates apply to these Reflection applications:

Reflection for HP

Reflection for UNIX and OpenVMS

Reflection for ReGIS Graphics

Reflection X

Reflection FTP Client

New feature in Reflection Secure Shell 14.0 SP4:

* Support for configuring key algorithms.

You can now specify which key exchange algorithms the client
supports, and the order of preference. To configure this, open the
Reflection Secure Shell Settings dialog box and use the Encryption tab.
The keyword used to configure this setting is KexAlgorithms.

* Error messages provide more information.

Secure Shell error messages now include much more detailed information that can be used to facilitate troubleshooting.

* sftp command-line support for getext and setext.

You can now use getext and setext with the sftp command line utility
to view and set file extensions that will use ascii transfer.

Issues resolved in Reflection Secure Shell 14.0 SP4:

* Command line utilities don't support input from a file.

You can now supply commands to command-line utilities using an input file as shown in this example:

`C:\> ssh -T joe@myhost < c:\filepath\demo.bat`

* Client crashes when the network connection is lost during an SFTP session.

This service pack improves the way the client handles loss of a network connection.

* sftp2 error: "Couldn't get handle: No such file or directory."

This service pack fixes a problem that led to the above error
message when putting files to a chroot account on HP-UX 11.1 using the
sftp2 command line utility.

* scp fails with some Japanese characters in file or folder name.

This service pack fixes this problem.

* scp transfers generate errors for every file when Windows server folder isn't found.

The client now displays only one error message when scp and scp2
transfers are directed to a folder that doesn't exist on the server.

* Reflection and F-Secure return codes are different.

The return codes displayed for the ssh2, scp2, and sftp2 command
line utilities now match those returned by prior version F-Secure
products.

* scp -u switch is now documented.

The scp -u switch can be used to remove a file after copying with
the scp or scp2 command line utility. Previously this switch was
supported but not documented. It is now included in the command line
usage you see when you enter "scp -h" or "scp2 -h".

* Client (ssh.exe) is not accepting all data from COM server (rssh.exe).

When attempting to connect from a WinCvs client to a CVS repository
via the client; the WinCvs client appeared to hang during the connection
process. The client could be interrupted, but never displayed the
archive. This problem has been resolved.

* Command line sessions display warning messages in popup windows.

In order to facilitate scripting, warning messages are now displayed
in the cmd.exe window rather than in popup windows that require user
interaction.

* ssh cannot correctly set the host character set.

The HostCharacterSet keyword now sets the specified host character set when code page support is available.

* Key upload feature does not recognize latest Tectia server.

Keys are now uploaded correctly to Tectia servers.

* Cannot pipe debug output to a file using the command line utilities.

The client now correctly handles redirection of debug output to a file on the command line, as shown here:

`ssh -vvv user@host > logfile.txt 2>&1`

* sftp and sftp2 don't return an exit code of 0 after successful transfer.

This service pack fixes a problem that caused the sftp quit command to set a non-zero return value.

* sftp batch file execution stops if one of the batch commands fails.

sftp batch file execution now continues even if one of the batch
commands fails. The exit code is 0 for successful execution of the batch
file, with no command failures. With command failures the exit code is
1.

* Fixes previously released in [Secure Shell 14.0 SP3](#Secure_Shell_14.0_SP3).

## New Features and What's Fixed in 14.0 SP3?

The following new features and fixes are included in the Reflection
14.0 Service Pack 3. To view features and fixes relevant to the
Reflection product you are using or evaluating, scroll to the
appropriate product name below or use these quick reference links.

### Reflection for IBM 14.0 SP3

New features in Reflection for IBM 14.0 SP3:

* Support for double-byte character input in an AS400 single-byte field.

A new setting is available to support double-byte character input in
an AS400 single-byte field. To enable this setting, go to Setup >
View Settings > 5250 Allow DBCS in SBCS field.

* Support for non-alpha leading character in the host file name for a CICS file transfer.

A new setting is available to support use of a non-alpha leading
character in the host file name. To enable this setting, go to Setup
> View Settings > Allow Leading Digit in CICS Host Filename.

* Support for IME mode changing depending on field attributes.

A new setting is available which enables the Reflection input method
editor (IME) to behave identically to the Korean Extra Universal Client
IME. When this setting is enabled, the IME changes mode depending on
the current field attributes. In a DBCS field, the IME switches to DB
Hangul; in a SBCS field, it switches to single byte English. To enable
this setting, go to Setup > View Settings > Korean EUCC IME
Behavior.

Issues resolved in Reflection for IBM 14.0 SP3:

* Adding a VBA reference to a settings file removes recorded macros.

Prior to this fix, adding a reference to a Reflection settings file
caused macros recorded in the referenced file to be removed if they had
the same name as macros saved in the local settings file.

* Reflection shuts down unexpectedly after you add a VBA reference.

This patch resolves a problem that caused Reflection to close down
unexpectedly when references were added to another Reflection settings
file.

* SSL connections fail with version 1 certificates.

Reflection now supports version 1 certificates.

* Problems with Level 2 password authentication in the file transfer dialog box.

With QPWDLVL=2 on the AS/400, a new, stronger algorithm for creating
passwords is used, which supports longer and case-sensitive passwords.
The Reflection Transfer utility now correctly handles these passwords.

* Fixes previously released in [Reflection for IBM 14.0 SP2](#Reflection_for_IBM_14.0_SP2).

### Reflection for HP, UNIX and OpenVMS 14.0 SP3

New features in Reflection for HP, UNIX and OpenVMS 14.0 SP3:

* FTPUseSftpStructuredListing setting.

This setting is relevant when you have established a Secure Shell
session and set the file transfer protocol to "FTP". (In this
configuration Reflection uses SFTP file transfer.) This setting
specifies which data list style Reflection uses to generate the
directory display. Changing the value of this setting may help
troubleshoot file transfer problems. When it is set to No (the default),
Reflection uses the standard UNIX-style data list. When it is set to
yes, Reflection uses the structured data list style. To change the value
of this setting, go to Setup > View Settings >
FTPUseSftpStructuredListing.

* SSHPassword property.

Use this new property to configure the password for Secure Shell
connections. It does not affect other connection types. For example, in a
Reflection session that is configured to connect to your host using
Secure Shell, the following macro connects to the host and sends the
specified password.

`Sub ConnectWithPassword()`

 `Session.SSHPassword = "mypassword"`

 `Session.Connect`

`End Sub`

Issues resolved in Reflection for HP, UNIX and OpenVMS 14.0 SP3:

* Euro character not available in the ISO Greek host character set.

Reflection now supports the Euro character (â¬) when Host character set is set to ISO Greek (8858-7).

* Reflection crashes with very long command line.

Reflection no longer crashes when started from the command line with an extremely long parameter list.

* Fixes previously released in [Reflection for HP, UNIX and OpenVMS 14.0 SP2](#Reflection_for_HP_UNIX_and_OpenVMS_14.0_SP2).

### Reflection X 14.0 SP3

New features in Reflection X 14.0 SP3:

* Exit behavior enhancement.

Reflection X will now fully exit from a CDE session that was
manually launched from a dtsession process (instead of from a dtlogin
process).

* X Screen Settings enhancement.

If you want Reflection X to handle the calculation of mmWidth and
mmHeight values, enter 0 (zero) for Width and Height in the Dimensions
(mm) area of the X Screen Settings dialog box (Settings menu > X
Screen). If you enter a value other than 0, Reflection X will use that
value when it responds to X clients. This affects the "resolution" field
( you can see this when you use a client like xdpyinfo).

Issues resolved in Reflection X 14.0 SP3:

* Duplicate mouse and keyboard events no longer sent.

Reflection X will no longer send mouse and keyboard events that are duplicates of the previous mouse or keyboard events

* Artifacts no longer left.

Reflection X will no longer leave artifacts in a window with a
PseudoColor visual that has been occluded and has save unders enabled.

* GLX issues fixed.

Reflection X will now perform correctly when a GLX render context is made current with a GLX pixmap.

* Timing enhanced for VMS host connections.

To resolve timeout issues, there is now a small but arbitrary amount
of time between when Reflection X sends a command to a VMS host and
when it reads the host's response while connecting via REXEC and RSH.

* X windows now redrawn correctly.

When Reflection X is in X terminal desktop mode, X windows that are
dragged off screen, then on screen, are now redrawn correctly.

* Reflection X 64-bit: problems related to XLFD look-ups resolved.

The 64-bit version of Reflection X will no longer crash when it
attempts to supply default resolution values while looking up an XLFD.

* Remote Assistance issue fixed.

You no longer need to reset or restart Reflection X when Remote Assistant attempts to connect.

* Korean characters now correctly displayed.

Strings that contain Korean characters are now correctly displayed
in window titles, the Windows taskbar icon, and on the Alt-Tab dialog.

* "Tunnel X11 connections" can now be disabled.

In earlier versions of Reflection X that used the Secure Shell
connection method, Tunnel X11 connections was enabled by default,
appeared to be editable, but in fact could not be changed. After this
patch is applied, the user interface will show the actual state of the
setting and the setting can be disabled. To change this setting: Secure
Shell connection method > Advanced button > Tunneling tab. Note
that clearing this setting means that Secure Shell is used for
authentication only; X11 data is sent in the clear.

* Excessive CPU usage with Secure Shell connections addressed.

Client connections that used the Secure Shell connection method
sometimes resulted in excessive CPU usage. This problem has been fixed.

* Enhancement for updating AIX "time\_last\_login" field.

On an IBM AIX X client host, if you need the "time\_last\_login" field
in /etc/security/lastlog updated on a successful login using the
SECURE\_SHELL method, then you will need to set a Reflection X registry
key.

To set the necessary registry key:

1. On the Reflection X Settings menu, click View Settings.
2. In the Search box, with Dialog
   format set to Registry keyname, type ssh and then click on SSHUsePty in
   the Reflection settings control.
3. Click Yes and then OK.

If the value for SSHUsePty key is the default (No), then a
successful login to IBM AIX hosts using the SECURE\_SHELL method will not
update the "time\_last\_login" field in /etc/security/lastlog.

* Fixes previously released in [Reflection X 14.0 SP2.1](#Reflection_X_14.0_SP2.1) and [Reflection X 14.0 SP2](#Reflection_X_14.0_SP2).

### Reflection FTP 14.0 SP3

New features in Reflection FTP 14.0 SP3:

* "Use IPV6" setting.

A new setting, Use IPV6, has been added to the Connection tab in the
Site Properties dialog box. Options are Always, Never, When Available.
The default is When Available. Previously IPV6 support was configurable
using the command window, and this technique is also still available.

* "Connect through NAT server" setting.

A new setting, Connect through NAT server, has been added to support
SSL/TLS connections through a NAT proxy server. To configure this
setting click the Security button, then click the SSL/TLS tab.

* New settings for forwarding FTP data through the SSH tunnel.

Three new settings are available for configuring Reflection to
forward FTP data through the SSH tunnel. Use these settings when the FTP
server is on a different host from the Secure Shell server. To
configure these settings, go to the Connect to FTP Site dialog box,
click Security, then click the Secure Shell tab. The new settings are:

+ FTP host is different than the Secure Shell host

This setting is available when Use Reflection Secure Shell and
Tunnel FTP using port forwarding are selected. When this setting is
selected, Reflection forwards all FTP communications securely through
the Secure Shell tunnel to the Secure Shell server, then forwards data
in the clear from the Secure Shell server to the FTP server.

+ SSH server address

This setting is available when FTP host is different than the Secure
Shell host is enabled. Use it to specify the host running your Secure
Shell server.

+ SSH user name

This setting is available when FTP host is different than the Secure
Shell host is enabled. If the user login name is different on the
Secure Shell and FTP servers, use this to specify the user name on the
Secure Shell server.

Configuring these settings is equivalent to using the following ssh command line:

`ssh -L FTP/<local port>:<FTP address>:21 <SSH user name>@<SSH server address>`

* The FTP Open method now supports Secure Shell passwords.

The FTP Open method now supports sending passwords for Secure Shell
sessions. The following sample configures a Secure Shell connection,
connects to the specified host, and sends the specified user name and
password.

`Sub SFTP_Password_Auth()`

`Dim FTP As New ReflectionFTP3`

`With FTP`

 `.UseSSH = True`

 `.UseSFTP = True`

 `.Open "myhost", "myusername", "mypassword"`

`End With`

Issues resolved in Reflection FTP 14.0 SP3:

* Unable to deselect Encrypt data stream setting with SSL/TLS.

The FTP Client now correctly remembers the state of the Encrypt data stream setting for SSL/TLS sessions.

* Intermittant connection problems in SSL/TLS connections.

This patch fixes a problem that caused intermittent connection
problems because the client was not correctly sending the AUTH TLS
message.

* Modifying "Cache directory listing" fails to enable the Apply button.

In the Directories tab of the FTP Client Site Properties dialog box,
modifying the Cache directory listing setting now correctly enables the
Apply button on this tab.

* "Failed to load resource file ... openssh.dll" when launching using Visual Basic.

This patch fixes a problem that led to a missing openssh.dll error
message when launching the FTP Client from a Visual Basic project.

* Improved local directory display performance.

This patch reduces the time it takes to display directory listings in the local pane.

* Improved remote directory display performance.

This patch reduces the time it takes to display directory listings in the server pane.

* File date is not preserved when configured for SFTP transfers.

The Preserve server file date option (available on the Transfer tab
of the site properties dialog box) now works as expected for SFTP
transfers.

* Fixes previously released in [Reflection FTP 14.0 SP2](#Reflection_FTP_14.0_SP2).

### Secure Shell 14.0 SP3

The following Secure Shell updates apply to these Reflection applications:

Reflection for HP

Reflection for UNIX and OpenVMS

Reflection for ReGIS Graphics

Reflection X

Reflection FTP Client

New feature in Reflection Secure Shell 14.0 SP3:

* New "NoShell" configuration keyword.

When NoShell is set to "Yes", the client creates a tunnel without
opening a terminal session. This option can be used in combination with
ConnectionReuse to create a tunnel that can be reused by other ssh
connections. You can configure this option in the Secure Shell
configuration file, or using the -o command-line option.

Issues resolved in Reflection Secure Shell 14.0 SP3:

* Improved file transfer performance.

This patch includes changes that support faster SFTP and SCP file transfers.

* Improved directory display performance.

This patch reduces the time it takes to display directory listing in SFTP sessions.

* Certificate validation fails due to an unknown extended key usage OID.

Prior to this patch, server certificate validation failed if the
certificate contained unknown extended key usage OIDs. These extensions
are now checked during intermediate certificate validation only if they
are marked as "Critical" or if you are running Reflection in DOD mode.

* Command line error messages sent to stdout.

Error messages for the ssh command-line utility are now sent to stderr.

* Additional information in sftp and sftp2 command line usage.

The sftp and sftp2 command line usage help now displays the
following additional syntax for uploading files to the server: sftp
[options] sourcefile [user@]host[#port]:[destination file]. This
information is displayed when you use the -h command-line option.

* Blank dialog box appears during keyboard interactive authentication.

Reflection no longer displays a blank "Reflection Secure Shell
Client" dialog box when you are configured to use keyboard-interactive
authentication. This dialog box was introduced by changes made to the
SP2 patch.

* Data display stops during Secure Shell sessions.

This patch fixes a problem that caused a halt in data display when
large chunks of data are being received. Prior to the fix it was
sometimes necessary to use the Enter key to view the entire display.

* Duplicate entries appear for the same user key.

This patch fixes a problem that caused Reflection to show multiple
entries for the same user key when both a user-specific config file and a
global ssh\_config file were present on the same computer.

* Fixes previously released in [Secure Shell 14.0 SP2](#Secure_Shell_14.0_SP2).

## What's Fixed in 14.0 SP2.1?

The following fixes are included in the Reflection 14.0 Service Pack 2.1 (SP2.1, also known as version 14.0.3558).

**Note:** This service pack is cumulative, and includes all of the fixes originally contained in 14.0 SP1 and SP2.

### Reflection X 14.0 SP2.1

Issues resolved in Reflection X 14.0 SP2.1:

* Fixed problems with excessive CPU usage when launching a client using SECURE SHELL.

features and fixes relevant to the Reflection product you are using or
evaluating, scroll to the appropriate product name below or use these
quick reference links.

## Works with Vista Logo

All of the Reflection applications listed above are now supported on
the Windows Vista platform and meet the requirements of the âWorks with
Windows Vista" logo specification.

**Note:** The Reflection NFS client, which ships with some
Reflection products, is not supported on the Windows Vista platform. If
the NFS client is already installed on an older Windows system that you
plan to upgrade to Vista, it is strongly recommended that you uninstall
the NFS client before upgrading the operating system.

### Reflection for IBM 14.0 SP2

New features in Reflection for IBM 14.0 SP2:

* New setting for specifying which version to use for SSL/TLS connections.

You can now specify which SSL or TLS version to use. The choices are
TLS Version 1.0 (this is the newer protocol and is the default) and SSL
version 3.0. To change this setting, go to Connection > Session
Setup > Security > SSL/TLS > SSL/TLS version.

* New setting for copying text from one screen to another.

You can now easily copy text from one region of a host screen to the
same region on another screen. To use this feature go to Setup >
View Settings. Set Retain selection to Yes. Also, set Clear selection on
screen when copied to No to ensure that the selection is not cleared
after the copy/append action.

Issue resolved in Reflection for IBM 14.0 SP2:

* Mainframe TSO File Transfer fails from ISPF Option 6.

Reflection was incorrectly sending a PA2 when the Show Host Files
button was used to upload a file with no host file name defined. This
problem has been resolved.

* Fixes previously released in [Reflection for IBM 14.0 SP1](#Reflection_for_IBM_14.0_SP1).

### Reflection for HP, UNIX and OpenVMS 14.0 SP2

New features in Reflection for HP, UNIX and OpenVMS 14.0 SP2:

* New setting for specifying which version to use for SSL/TLS connections.

You can now specify which SSL or TLS version to use. The choices are
TLS Version 1.0 (this is the newer protocol and is the default) and SSL
version 3.0. To change this setting, go to Connection > Connection
Setup > Security > SSL/TLS > SSL/TLS version.

Issues resolved in Reflection for HP, UNIX and OpenVMS 14.0 SP2:

* Reflection events don't work in .NET.

Reflection events now fire as expected when you add a reference to a Reflection session from a .NET environment.

* Reflection does not save partial screen clears to display memory.

Reflection can now save data to display memory that is cleared using
partial screen clear commands. To enable this functionality, go to
Setup > View Settings, and change the new setting Save On Partial
Clear to Yes.

* Incorrect Chinese character display.

Under some conditions Reflection was not displaying Chinese
characters correctly. This service pack corrects UTF8 display problems
with wide characters.

* Calling the StopRecordingMacro built-in function closes Reflection if recording is not in progress.

SP2 fixes a problem that caused Reflection to close unexpectedly
when the StopRecordingMacro built-in function was called when recording
was not in progress.

* SharedMacros error message displays when you open many sessions simultaneously.

When multiple instances of Reflection were launched at the same
time, or many settings files containing macros were opened
simultaneously, a message was displayed indicating that the SharedMacros
settings file could not be created. This problem has been resolved.

* Reflection for HP closes unexpectedly when you process a trace (.rev) file.

SP2 corrects a problem that caused Reflection for HP to close
unexpectedly when processing a trace that contained VT escape sequences.

* Fixes previously released in [Reflection for HP, UNIX and OpenVMS 14.0 SP1](#Reflection_for_HP_UNIX_and_OpenVMS_14.0_SP1).

### Reflection X 14.0 SP2

New features in Reflection X 14.0 SP2:

* Maximum number of clients increased to 256.

Reflection X now supports up to 256 client connections. Note that
the number of client connections is limited to the number of sockets
(also set to 256); each client connection requires a socket, and
Reflection uses sockets for other things such as font servers. For
example, if Reflection has two listen sockets configured for TCP and
DECnet and it's connected to three font servers, it can support 251
client connections (256 - 2 - 3 = 251).

* SHAPE server extension enhanced.

Reflection's SHAPE X server extension now supports version 1.1 and
has been enhanced to expose an Input region for windows. This newly
exposed region is a subset of the Bounding region that restricts which
portion of the window receives mouse events. With this enhancement,
portions of the window not in the Input region pass mouse events through
to underlying windows.

* XI Driver Client dialog box can now be minimized.

The XI Driver Client dialog box, which allows you to confirm your X
server display and 3D CAD/CAM client application profile, now has a
minimize control in its title bar.

* New registry keyword for disabling taskbar flashing.

Reflection X has a new registry keyname called
EnableFlashNotification (default: Yes). If EnableFlashNotification is
set to No and X terminal desktop is enabled, the root window's taskbar
entry will not flash when it appears in the taskbar and there is some X
Window activity. **Note:** Registry keynames can be changed by
clicking Settings > View Settings from the top menu bar in Reflection
X Manager (do not click the Setting button near the bottom on the
dialog box).

* New registry keyword for Citrix/Remote Desktop sessions.

Reflection X has a new registry keyword called AutoIncrementStart
(default value: 1; valid values: 0-1023). AutoIncrementStart is the
starting value that Reflection X uses to compute the dynamic display
number when Reflection X is running in a Citrix/Remote Desktop session. **Note:**
Registry keynames can be changed by clicking Settings > View
Settings from the top menu bar in Reflection X Manager (do not click the
Setting button near the bottom on the dialog box).

* Client and server template files available for download.

In addition to the client and server template files that install by
default, there are templates that you can download from Attachmate's web
site. For more information, see [KBÂ 7021798](doc.php?id=7021798).

Issues resolved in Reflection X 14.0 SP2:

* Font scaling issue resolved.

A problem was fixed that occurred when "Allow font scaling" was
enabled and an X client sent the protocol request ListFontWithInfo to
the X server, requesting iso10646-1 encoded fonts.

* Keycode display problem corrected.

After a DEL key was mapped to the RM key of a DEC keyboard, the
resulting keycode for the unshifted key was sometimes not displayed
correctly. This intermittent problem has been fixed.

* Entering a non-zero value for screen dimensions.

When 0 (zero) is entered in the Dimensions (mm) text boxes (Settings
menu > X Server > Configure X screen), Reflection relies on its
own internal screen size calculations, drawing from a variety of
sources, when responding to X clients. If non-zero values are entered in
the Dimensions (mm) text boxes, Reflection will use those values, among
others.

* Resized window issue fixed.

In previous versions, a window created with the PseudoColor visual
that was resized after being mapped sometimes resulted in the window not
being drawn. This problem has been fixed.

* Copy to Editor action now working correctly.

Previously, if a selection was in COMPOUND\_TEXT format, the Copy To
Editor action in the Copy Selection dialog only copied the first
character to your editor of choice. This behavior has been fixed.

* "Max char width" reporting now correct.

This Service Pack fixes a problem with how Reflection reported "max char width" for Windows fonts.

* Reported resolution values for wild-carded XLFD Windows fonts now correct.

Reflection will report server default values for point size and x
and y resolutions for a font in a ListFontWithInfo request if those
values are not specified in its XLFD. Reflection will no longer fail to
report information on a ListFontWithInfo request if the font can be
found.

* Client application taskbar icons now have unique text.

In earlier versions of Reflection, when Microsoft Windows desktop
was enabled as the Windows mode, the taskbar icons for each client
window displayed the same information. Now, each taskbar icon displays
unique information for easier identification.

* Reflection X now re-optimizes.

Reflection X will re-optimize objects that it de-optimized because
of resource limits that were exceeded as imposed by the resource control
in the X server's speed settings panel.

* "Enable mouse wheel scroll" available for remote desktop sessions.

In earlier versions of Reflection X, the Enable mouse wheel scroll
option was not available for remote desktop sessions; it is now enabled.

* CoordModePrevious lines now correctly drawn.

Reflection X now correctly draws CoordModePrevious lines to root in IncludeInferriors mode.

* Fixes previously released in [Reflection X 14.0 SP1](#Reflection_X_14.0_SP1).

### Reflection FTP 14.0 SP2

New features in Reflection FTP 14.0 SP2:

* New setting for specifying which version to use for SSL/TLS connections.

You can now specify which SSL/TLS version to use. The choices are
TLS Version 1.0 (this is the newer protocol and is the default) and SSL
version 3.0. To change this setting, select a site in the Connect to FTP
dialog box, then go to > Security > SSL/TLS > SSL/TLS version.

Issues resolved in Reflection FTP 14.0 SP2:

* Kerberized FTP connection failure.

This service pack resolves a problem that caused some FTP servers to
reject the connection when Reflection FTP was configured to use
Kerberos.

* Faster server file display.

Reflection FTP Client server file display has been optimized to
decrease the amount of time it takes to display and refresh the server
display pane.

* Difficulty disconnecting and closing the client when connected using SSL/TLS.

You can now disconnect from the server (the preferred way to
terminate network connections) or close the client when connected to a
site that is configured to use SSL/TLS. When you close a connected
session, the client now disconnects the SSL/TLS-secured FTP connection
before shutting down.

* Fixes previously released in [Reflection FTP 14.0 SP1](#Reflection_FTP_14.0_SP1).

### Secure Shell 14.0 SP2

The following Secure Shell updates apply to these Reflection applications:

Reflection for HP

Reflection for UNIX and OpenVMS

Reflection for ReGIS Graphics

Reflection X

Reflection FTP Client

New feature in Reflection Secure Shell 14.0 SP2:

* Specify the signature hash used during public key authentication.

You can now specify which hash algorithm the client uses in the
process of proving possession of the private key during public key user
authentication. To configure this, open the Reflection Secure Shell
Settings dialog box. On the Encryption tab, under Signature types,
select the hash you want to use for RSA and DSA keys.

Issues resolved in Reflection Secure Shell 14.0 SP2:

* Reflection Secure Shell sessions hang when transferring large amounts of data.

This service pack fixes a problem that would sometimes cause very
large (gigabyte) data transfers to hang when Reflection was configured
to use the Secure Shell protocol. This problem was seen with transfers
using the Reflection user interface and also using Reflection command
line utilities.

* Scp error message: "Cannot download non-regular fileâ¦"

This error message was displayed incorrectly when the Reflection scp
command line utility was used with the -r switch. This problem has been
resolved.

* Sftp transfer hangs when GET commands use wildcards.

Sftp file transfers that use wildcard GET commands now work as expected.

* Sftp and scp cannot simultaneously access the file.

In Reflection applications running with Service Pack 1 applied, the
sftp and scp clients could not simultaneously access the same local file
for uploading. This problem has been resolved.

* Error message: "Expected SSH2\_EXP\_DATA(103) packet, got 201".

This service pack corrects a problem in the Secure Shell protocol
that could cause this error message to be displayed for slow or bad
network connections.

* Fixes previously released in [Secure Shell 14.0 SP1](#Secure_Shell_14.0_SP1).

## What's Fixed in 14.0 SP1?

The following features and fixes are included in the Reflection 14.0
Service Pack 1 (SP1). To view features and fixes relevant to the
Reflection product you are using or evaluating, scroll to the
appropriate product name below or use these quick reference links.

### Reflection for IBM 14.0 SP1

Issues resolved in Reflection for IBM 14.0 SP1:

* Cursor skips valid input fields.

On some 3270 host screens with protected numeric fields, the cursor
skips valid available input fields when the user enters data that spans
multiple fields. This problem has been corrected.

* OpenSettings method fails to open partial settings files.

Macros that use the OpenSettings method to open partial settings
files now work correctly. For example, the command Session.OpenSettings
rcKeymap, "C:\temp\sample.map" now correctly opens the sample.map keymap
file.

* Error message display after selecting multiple files for file transfer.

This patch fixes a problem that caused the following error message
to display after selecting multiple files in the file transfer dialog
box: "Length of Transfer Remote Filenames (IND$FILE) entry (nnn) is too
long. Maximum length is 260."

### Reflection for HP, UNIX and OpenVMS 14.0 SP1

New features in Reflection for HP, UNIX and OpenVMS 14.0 SP1:

* Executing Host-Initiated Reflection Basic Commands Through VBA.

Reflection now supports executing host-initiated Reflection Basic
commands through the VBA command interpreter. This feature can be used
to resolve problems in which host-initiated Reflection Basic commands
fail to launch another application or do not return from the
GetSaveAsFileName method after previous execution of a Reflection Basic
script. See [KBÂ 7021486](doc.php?id=7021486) for details.

Issues resolved in Reflection for HP, UNIX and OpenVMS 14.0 SP1:

* Custom Toolbars use the wrong button images after export to XML.

Settings exported to XML now contain the correct data for customized
toolbars. Previously Reflection was not correctly storing data for
bitmap images assigned to customized toolbar buttons.

* Buttons created with DefineToolbarButton are greyed out.

Buttons created using the Reflection DefineToolbarButton method now work correctly.

* Japanese and Chinese characters display incorrectly.

Wide characters (such as Japanese or Chinese) now display correctly when the Reflection host character set is set to UTF8.

* Errors when UserData property contains a string greater that 261 characters.

Data assigned to the Reflection UserData property is now correctly
stored and recalled when it contains a string longer than 261 bytes.

* Password does not decrypt correctly with GetPassword and GetLogin methods.

This patch fixes a problem that was observed when the Transmit
method was invoked from a different session and the password was
retrieved with GetPassword or GetLogin using rcDecodePassword.
Reflection now correctly decodes encrypted passwords saved from a
different session. Note that this is not designed as a secure way to
store passwords: it is simply to obfuscate a password instead of storing
it in clear text.

### Reflection X 14.0 SP1

Issues resolved in Reflection X 14.0 SP1:

* Slow rendering when in Coarse or Fine pixelization mode.

This Service Pack addresses a rendering problem. Now, when
Reflection X is set to Coarse pixelization or Fine pixelization,
Reflection X will render wide outline rectangles at least as fast as
when it is set to Perfect pixelization.

* Black areas in Reflection X screen.

Reflection X no longer leaves unpainted areas when a complex
graphics expose event is delivered to a PseudoColor emulation window.

* Starting or stopping Remote Assistance forces a reset or restart.

Starting and stopping Remote Assistance no longer results in the X Manager resetting or restarting.

* Windows Clipboard issues.

Some users experience problems pasting items from the Windows
clipboard into a terminal window. One problem is characterized by
Reflection X not pasting items correctly if the paste occurs after a
previous client has exited (also known as a "last client exit reset").
Pasting an item after initial startup or after resetting Reflection X
from the user interface is successful. This and other related problems
have been fixed.

* Pixels drawn for 0 width, 0 length segments.

When Line, segment or arc drawing is set to Coarse or Fine
pixelization and a user draws a line segment with a length and width of 0
(zero), instead of drawing nothing in response to the polysegment
request, Reflection draws a pixel. This problem has been fixed.

* Problems with monitors in negative coordinates.

Several problems have been fixed in Reflection X when a second or
third monitor is the left or above monitor number one (in negative
coordinates). Reflection X does not support the display of X clients on
negative coordinate monitors.

* Problem with -c startup command line switch.

A problem introduced in Reflection 14.0 using the -c startup command
line switch has been fixed. Now, the client file name parameter that
follows -c does not need to be fully qualified if the client file is
located in the user's personal folder (typically, C:\Documents and
Settings\\My Documents\Attachmate\Reflection).

* Problems launching client application in window without control decorations.

In situations where a mapped window has been created with no control
decorations and Microsoft Windows is the Default local window manager,
Reflection X will still send a ReparentNotify event when the window is
mapped.

* Application controls suddenly inaccessible.

When Reflection X has Window mode set to X terminal desktop, the X
screen configuration set to Full size (no title bar), and a user clicks
near the border of the root window, the mouse pointer is repositioned.
This results in some application controls becoming inaccessible. This
problem has been fixed.

* Incorrect drawing behavior.

A problem involving drawing behavior was fixed. Now, when Coarse
pixelization is enabled and the last segment in a list of segments is
clipped out, Reflection X draws the segments that were not clipped out
to a window with backing store or to a window that uses a PseudoColor
emulation (PCE) visual.

* Problems with slow connections or connecting over VPNs.

If you are experiencing problems connecting over VPNs or if you have
a high latency connection, you may need to increase the values of the
Prompt timeout and Response timeout settings in your RXC file (Advanced
Client Connection settings dialog box). These settings control the speed
at which rsh/rexec connections send and receive data. Sometimes, extra
delays are necessary over slow connections or connections that go
through a VPN.

* Icons and buttons changing to incorrect color.

The icons and buttons in a customer's client application change to
an incorrect color. This is because the client application changes the
size of the terminal window to a negative value. While the fix provided
in this service pack delays the color change, it cannot fix the problem.
Only a change to the client application can fix the problem.

* Fonts not scaling correctly.

This service pack addresses a problem with font scaling.

* Unreachable monitor area.

This service pack fixes a problem that occurs when Reflection X is
in Microsoft Windows desktop mode, with one monitor and the Windows
taskbar on top or to the left of the screen. When Reflection is
configured this way, the mouse cannot be moved into the region on the
edge of the monitor opposite from the Windows taskbar (bottom or right).

* Keyboard event not sent.

When the Japanese 106/109 keyboard is used, Reflection X does not
send a keyboard event if the key pressed has no symbol assigned to it.
This problem has been fixed.

* Mouse wheel mappings using Alt not working.

In previous versions, mouse wheel mappings that used the Alt key modifier did not work as expected. This problem has been fixed.

* Reflection stops responding when a cursor is confined to a shaped window.

This service pack adds support to confine the cursor to a window with a non-rectangular shape.

* Problems with KDE and Windows screensaver.

A fix in this service pack addresses a problem in which KDE 3.3
desktop clients keep running after the Microsoft Windows screensaver is
dismissed.

* Issues with three-button mouse emulation.

Three-button mouse emulation now functions correctly.

* Copy Rectangle to Windows Clipboard not working.

If text is selected in an xterm window, performing a Copy Rectangle
to Windows Clipboard now overwrites the contents of Windows Clipboard
with the rectangle you copied. Previously, the rectangle would be
immediately overwritten by the string that was selected in the xterm
window.

* Colors with NULL terminators handled incorrectly.

Reflection X now correctly handles colors with NULL terminators.

### Reflection FTP 14.0 SP1

New features in Reflection FTP 14.0 SP1:

* New settings for handling uploads.

Two new settings have been added to the Transfer tab of the Site Properties dialog box:

+ Compute space on MVS

By default, Reflection computes and pre-allocates the number of
tracks on an MVS system based on the local file size. Clear this setting
to disable this feature. This setting applies to uploads to MVS hosts
only.

+ Send SITE command

Use this setting to specify a SITE command to be executed before a file is uploaded. This is supported for uploads to any host.

Issues resolved in Reflection FTP 14.0 SP1:

* Problems with very large files.

This patch fixes a number of problems that were seen when handling
files whose size is larger than 2 gigabytes. Problems included files
that could not be displayed, files that failed to transfer, and file
transfers that failed to resume properly. Note that some FTP or SFTP
servers still may not be able to display or transfer files greater than 4
gigabytes, in which case the Reflection client may also experience
problems.

* Error Message: Install a Reflection host access product to continue migrating profiles and keys.

The error message above displays if you attempt to install only the
FTP client on a system on which F-Secure was installed. This patch fixes
this problem; the Reflection F-Secure Migration wizard will not launch
when an installation doesn't include Reflection for HP, Reflection for
Unix and OpenVMS, or Reflection for ReGIS Graphics.

* FTP Client does not launch for some users with roaming profiles.

The FTP Client now launches successfully if your Desktop or My Documents folder is not in your roaming profile.

* Secure Shell configuration not exported correctly.

The SSH Config Scheme value is now written to properly when you
export your settings from the FTP Client. Previously the SSH Config
Scheme name was written out incorrectly in the exported XML and
consequently the value was not set when the xml was reimported into the
FTP Client.

* FTP Settings are not correctly imported when you
  deploy a settings.rfw file to a system that has no prior Reflection
  installation.

If the Reflection FTP client is installed and launched for the first
time on a system that already contains a file called "settings.rfw",
any existing settings in the registry are migrated to a file called
"settings0.rfw" and Reflection FTP loads the existing "settings.rfw"
file. Settings are now migrated only if a previous version of Reflection
FTP was installed on the system.

* Custom Rule "Include Suffix."

When the Directory Definition Wizard is used to create custom rules
for parsing directory listings, a manually added "Include Suffix" value
is now honored.

### Updated PKI Support

A Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is a system that helps facilitate
secure communications through the use of digital certificates.
Reflection supports the use of a PKI for host and user authentication
during Secure Shell and SSL/TLS sessions.

#### New PKI features in 14.0 SP1:

The following new features are available in all Reflection 14.0 SP1
applications. For additional information about these features, see "PKI"
in the Reflection application Help index after you've installed this
service pack.

* OCSP support for certificate revocation checking.

You can now configure Reflection Secure Shell and SSL/TLS
connections to use one or more OCSP responders to check if certificates
are still valid.

1. Set Certificate Revocation to Use
   OCSP. (This setting is new with this service pack.) For SSH connections,
   use the PKI tab of the Secure Shell settings dialog box. For SSL/TLS
   connections, use the PKI Configuration dialog box.
2. Open the Reflection Certificate Manager.
3. Click the OCSP tab. (This tab is new with this service pack.)
4. Click Add, then specify the server using the following URL format:

`URL:portnumber`

For example:

`http://ocspmachine.host.com:20080`

* DOD PKI mode to enforce DOD standards.

By default, Reflection applications allow some configurations that
do not meet DOD PKI requirements. Administrators can now use Reflection
Group Policies to configure all Reflection sessions to meet DOD PKI
requirements. To do this, you must first install the latest version of
the Reflection Administrator's Toolkit.

1. Run the Group Policy Editor.
2. Install the updated Reflection template (ReflectionPolicy.adm).
3. Under Local Computer Policy
   > User Configuration > Administrative Templates > Reflection
   Settings, disable the setting "Allow non-DoDPKI mode."

For additional information, see "DOD PKI information" in the
Reflection application Help index after you've installed this service
pack.

* Easier deployment of PKI settings.

Administrators can now use the Reflection Customization Manager to
create custom Reflection installations that include PKI settings. For
additional information, see "PKI, deploying PKI settings in a customized
install" in the Reflection application Help index after you've
installed this service pack.

### Secure Shell 14.0 SP1

The following Secure Shell updates apply to these Reflection applications:

Reflection for HP

Reflection for UNIX and OpenVMS

Reflection for ReGIS Graphics

Reflection X

Reflection FTP Client

New feature in Reflection Secure Shell 14.0 SP1:

* New features for exporting keys.

You can now choose to export the private key of a public private key
pair. To do this, open the User Keys tab of the Secure Shell Settings
dialog box, click Export, then select Export Private Key.

The Reflection Windows client now uses the SECSH file format by
default for exported keys. This matches the format used by other
Reflection for Secure IT applications. To configure Reflection to export
keys in OpenSSH format (the previous default), open the User Keys tab
of the Secure Shell Settings dialog box, click Export, then select Save
in OpenSSH format.

Issues resolved in Reflection Secure Shell 14.0 SP1:

* Fixed security vulnerability, US-Cert VU#845620.

Fixed security vulnerability, US-Cert VU#845620, <http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/845620>
-- Multiple RSA implementations fail to properly handle signatures. For
more details see the General Security Alerts and Advisories section of
<https://support.microfocus.com/security/>.

* Copying host files to the local root directory using sftp and sftp2.

The sftp and sftp2 command line utilities now accept syntax to copy
host files to the local root directory or to the root directory of
another local drive. Commands such as the following are now supported:

`sftp myname@myhost:myfile d:\`

`sftp myname@myhost:myfile \`

* Changing to an empty directory disconnects the SFTP session.

The Reflection session now remains connected if you attempt to
change to an empty directory. Previously either of the following
commands disconnected the session:

On the FTP command line: cd (with no directory specified)

Using the Reflection FTP Client API: .SetCurrentDirectory " "

* Reflection SFTP shuts down when disconnected from the network.

Reflection no longer closes unexpectedly when the network connection
goes down or the server terminates while the SFTP client is
transferring a file.

* Invalid option error when using -i switch with scp and scp2 command line utilities.

The scp and scp2 command line utilities now correctly support the -i
identity file switch. Commands like the following are now handled
correctly. Previously this would result in an invalid error option.

`scp2 -i keyfile <localfile> user@host:<destination file>`

* Reflection shuts down when configuring PKI if My Documents has been redirected to a network server.

Reflection now correctly creates the .pki folder when a user's My Documents folder is specified using a UNC path.

* Using Go to or cd at the command line fails when you use a OpenVMS file path.

This patch provides improved SFTP support for traversing directories on OpenVMS systems.

* Host key fingerprint is now displayed in multiple formats that are compatible with other vendors.

The Host Key Authenticity dialog box now displays the host key
fingerprint in both bubble-babble and hex format. The bubble-babble
format uses a SHA-1 hash for the fingerprint and the hex format uses an
MD5 hash.

* Intermittent failures in SSH1 connections.

A fix was made for SSH1 connections that were failing intermittently.

* Using sftp or sftp2 command line utility, ls -l does not display the day of the month.

The sftp and sftp2 command line utilities now display the day of the
month. Previously this part of the date was not included in the date
fields.

* Reflection display hangs during Secure Shell and SFTP connections.

A fix was added that prevents a Secure Shell or SFTP connection from hanging when downloading a large amount of data.

* Reflection unable to read SecSH format keys with longer passphrases.

Reflection now reads private keys created with F-Secure that have a passphrase with more than 23 characters.

### SSL/TLS 14.0 SP1

The following SSL/TLS updates apply to these Reflection applications:

Reflection for HP

Reflection for UNIX and OpenVMS

Reflection for ReGIS Graphics

Reflection for IBM

Reflection FTP Client

Issues resolved in SSL/TLS 14.0 SP1:

* Fixed security vulnerability, US-Cert VU#845620.

Fixed security vulnerability, US-Cert VU#845620, <http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/845620>
-- Multiple RSA implementations fail to properly handle signatures. For
more details, see the General Security Alerts and Advisories section of
<https://support.microfocus.com/security/>.

* Reflection shuts down when configuring PKI if My Documents has been redirected to a network server.

Reflection now correctly creates the .pki folder when a user's My Documents folder is specified using a UNC path.

### Kerberos 14.0 SP1

The following Kerberos updates apply to these Reflection applications:

Reflection for HP

Reflection for UNIX and OpenVMS

Reflection for ReGIS Graphics

Reflection X

Reflection FTP Client

Issue resolved in Kerberos 14.0 SP1:

* Authentication errors with "Use Windows logon value."

The last character of the default principal, default realm, and KDC
host name is no longer dropped when you have selected Use Windows logon
value in the Reflection Kerberos Initial Configuration dialog box.

## Multiple RSA implementations fail to properly handle signatures

#### Vulnerability Note VU#845620

Original Release Date: 2006-09-11 | Last Revised: 2007-02-08

---

### Overview

Multiple RSA implementations fail to properly handle RSA signatures. This vulnerability may allow an attacker to forge RSA signatures.

### Description

| RSA signatures are used to authenticate the source of a message. To prevent RSA signatures from being forged, messages are padded with data to ensure message hashes are adequately sized. One such padding scheme is specified in the Public-Key Cryptography Standard #1 (PKCS-1), which is defined in RFC [3447](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3447.txt).  Many RSA implementations may fail to properly verify signatures. Specifically, the verifier may incorrectly parse PKCS-1 padded signatures, ignoring data at the end of a signature. If this data is ignored and a RSA key with a public exponent of three is used, it may be possible to forge the signing key's signature.Note that any application that uses RSA signatures may be affected by this vulnerability. This includes, but is not limited to, SSH, SSL, PGP, and X.509 applications. This issue is further discussed on the [ietf-openpgp](http://www.imc.org/ietf-openpgp/mail-archive/msg14307.html) mailing list. |

### [F-Secure Corporation](#MIMG-6TFMRF) Not Affected

Notified:Â Â September 08, 2006  Updated:Â October 04, 2006

### Status

Not Affected

### Vendor Statement

F-Secure antivirus products are not vulnerable. The list of non-vulnerable products includes F-Secure Anti-Virus, F-Secure Internet Security, F-Secure Client Security, F-Secure Server Security, F-Secure Mobile Security, F-Secure Messaging Security Gateway, F-Secure Network Control, and all other products in F-Secure small business and corporate suites, also listed at <http://www.f-secure.com/enterprises/products/>.

F-Secure VPN+ versions up to version 6.12 are vulnerable in installations that use PKI CA issued certificates, which use third-party generated keys. The RSA key generator in F-Secure products has never allowed the generation of RSA keys with a public exponent of 3. This means that keys created with F-Secure tools cannot be used to mount an attack against F-Secure products or other systems.

The F-Secure SSH product line is exclusively distributed by Attachmate under the Reflection for Secure IT brand. Please see the vendor statement from Attachmate for more information.

### [PuTTY](#MIMG-6TFMY9) Not Affected

Notified:Â Â September 08, 2006  Updated:Â September 11, 2006

### Status

Not Affected

### Vendor Statement

I do not believe that any program in the PuTTY suite is, or has ever been, vulnerable to this attack.

The RSA verification code is in the function rsa2\_verifysig() in our source file sshrsa.c, and a quick inspection shows clearly that it rigorously enforces that the ASN.1 data and hash value must be at the very bottom of the PKCS#1 padded integer.

For good measure, our RSA key generator does not, and has never, generated keys with an exponent of 3. (This has nothing to do with whether we're vulnerable to the attack itself, of course, but it does mean we are also not generating keys which can be abused to mount the attack against other systems.)

### [Cryptlib](#MIMG-6TDHXM) Unknown

Notified:Â Â September 06, 2006  Updated:Â September 18, 2006

### Status

Unknown

### Vendor Statement

Although cryptlib shouldn't be vulnerable to the original Bleichenbacher attack, there is ongoing discussion about further attacks that affect any RSA keys with e=3. Because the security community currently doesn't know how serious the problem is, cryptlib users should disable the use of any RSA keys with e=3 by changing the check 'if( BN\_get\_word( e ) < 3 )' in initCheckRSAkey() in context/kg\_rsa.c to 'if( BN\_get\_word( e ) < 17 )'. Note that this will disable the use of a small number of existing keys that use e=3 (although cryptlib itself will never generate or use private keys with this

value), but until the exact nature of the problem is fully understood this is the only safe fix.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenât normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

FreeBSD-SA-06:19.openssl Security Advisory
The FreeBSD Project
Topic: Incorrect PKCS#1 v1.5 padding validation in crypto(3)
Category: contrib
Module: openssl
Announced: 2006-09-06
Affects: All FreeBSD releases.
Corrected: 2006-09-06 21:18:26 UTC (RELENG\_6, 6.1-STABLE)
2006-09-06 21:19:21 UTC (RELENG\_6\_1, 6.1-RELEASE-p6)

CVE Name: CVE-2006-4339
For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit
.
I. Background
FreeBSD includes software from the OpenSSL Project. The OpenSSL Project is
a collaborative effort to develop a robust, commercial-grade, full-featured,
and Open Source toolkit implementing the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3)
and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols as well as a full-strength
general purpose cryptography library.
PKCS#1 v1.5 is a standard for "padding" data before performing a
cryptographic operation using the RSA algorithm. PKCS#1 v1.5 signatures
are for example used in X.509 certificates.
RSA public keys may use a variety of public exponents, of which 3, 17, and
65537 are most common. As a result of a number of known attacks, most keys
generated recently use a public exponent of at least 65537.
II. Problem Description
When verifying a PKCS#1 v1.5 signature, OpenSSL ignores any bytes which
follow the cryptographic hash being signed. In a valid signature there
will be no such bytes.
III. Impact
OpenSSL will incorrectly report some invalid signatures as valid. When
an RSA public exponent of 3 is used, or more generally when a small public
exponent is used with a relatively large modulus (e.g., a public exponent
of 17 with a 4096-bit modulus), an attacker can construct a signature which
OpenSSL will accept as a valid PKCS#1 v1.5 signature.
IV. Workaround
No workaround is available.
V. Solution
Perform one of the following:
1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to 4-STABLE, 5-STABLE, or 6-STABLE,
or to the RELENG\_6\_1, RELENG\_6\_0, RELENG\_5\_5, RELENG\_5\_4, RELENG\_5\_3,
or RELENG\_4\_11 security branch dated after the correction date.
2) To patch your present system:
The following patches have been verified to apply to FreeBSD 4.11, 5.3,
5.4, 5.5, 6.0, and 6.1 systems.
a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-06:19/openssl.patch
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-06:19/openssl.patch.asc
b) Execute the following commands as root:
# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch
c) Recompile the operating system as described in
 and reboot the
system.
NOTE: Any third-party applications, including those installed from the
FreeBSD ports collection, which are statically linked to libcrypto(3)
should be recompiled in order to use the corrected code.
VI. Correction details
The following list contains the revision numbers of each file that was
corrected in FreeBSD.

# Attachmate Security Updates for US-CERT Vulnerability #845620: RSA Public Exponent 3

* **Document ID:***7021933*
* **Creation Date:**19-Oct-2006
* **Modified Date:**01-Apr-2018
* + **Micro Focus Products:**Extra!Reflection (legacy 14.1)Reflection DesktopReflection for Secure IT Client and Server for UNIXReflection for Secure IT Client for WindowsReflection for Secure IT Server for WindowsReflection X (legacy 14.1)

## Environment

 Reflection for Secure IT version 6.0 - 6.1

Reflection for UNIX and OpenVMS 2008 R1

Reflection for HP, UNIX and OpenVMS version 8.0 - 13.0.4, 14.0

Reflection for IBM 2008 R1

Reflection for IBM 2007

Reflection for IBM version 8.0 - 13.0.4, 14.0

Reflection X version 10.0 - 13.0.4, 14.0

Reflection FTP Client version 10.0 - 13.0.4, 14.0

EXTRA! X-treme version 9.0 SP1 or higher
## Situation

A flaw in the signature verification of RSA public keys or
certificates could cause Reflection and EXTRA! clients to accept forged
signatures from a server resulting in successful man-in-the-middle
attacks. This technical note describes the vulnerability (US-CERT
Vulnerability Note VU #845620), affected Reflection and EXTRA!
applications, and available solutions and workarounds.

## Resolution

## Vulnerability Details

There is a flaw in signature verification that affects RSA public
keys and digital certificates created with a public exponent of 3. This
flaw results from improper processing of the PKCS-1 padding before
generating the hash. This allows a remote attacker to forge the PKCS#1
v1.5 signature signed by the RSA key and attempt a man-in-the-middle
attack by masquerading as the valid server.

For details, see the CERT web site at <http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/845620>.

## Solution

Product patches and service packs are available to correct this
vulnerability in all affected applications. Maintained customers can
obtain all necessary product updates from the Attachmate Download
Library as directed below.

### Reflection for Secure IT Windows Client

Maintained users of Reflection for Secure IT Windows Client version
6.0 and 6.1 should upgrade to Reflection for Secure IT Windows Client
6.1 Service Pack 1 (SP1) or higher.

### Reflection for Secure IT Windows Server

Server version 6.0 and 6.1 should upgrade to Reflection for Secure IT
UNIX Client or UNIX Server 6.1 Service Pack 2 (SP2) or higher.

### Reflection 2008 and 2007 Products

Maintained users of the following Reflection 2008 products should
apply the Reflection service pack appropriate for their product:

Reflection for IBM 2008 R1 SP1 or higher

Reflection for UNIX and OpenVMS 2008 R1 SP1 or higher

Reflection Standard Suite R1 SP1 or higher

Maintained users of Reflection for IBM 2007 should upgrade to Reflection for IBM 2008 R1 SP1 or higher.

### Reflection 13.0 â 14.x Products

14.x) should apply the appropriate Reflection patch or service pack.

Reflection for HP

Reflection for UNIX and OpenVMS

Reflection for IBM

Reflection for Multi-Host Standard

Reflection X

Reflection Suite for X

Maintained users of Reflection 14.0 should upgrade to Reflection 14.0
SP1 or higher. For information about Reflection 14.0 SP1 or higher
(including file download details), see [KBÂ 7021762](doc.php?id=7021762).

Maintained users of Reflection 13.0â13.0.4 should upgrade to Reflection 13.0.5 or higher.

For Reflection Windows-based products version 8.0**â**12.0.X,
contact your sales representative for information about upgrading your
product to correct this vulnerability. For information about contacting
Attachmate, see <https://www.attachmate.com/Worldwide/>.

### EXTRA! 9.0 SP1 â SP2

Maintained EXTRA! users should upgrade to EXTRA! 9.1 or higher.

## Workaround

To workaround this security vulnerability, make sure that all RSA
keys are generated with a public exponent greater than 3. The Reflection
ssh-keygen utility has never generated RSA keys with public exponents
of 3, so any keys generated by this utility are not subject to this
vulnerability.

## Important Security Note

The security for all of the Reflection and EXTRA! products using the
Reflection and EXTRA! security features depends upon the security of the
operating system, host, and network environment. Attachmate strongly
recommends that you evaluate and implement all relevant security service
packs, updates, and patches recommended by your operating system, host,
and network manufacturers.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenât normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Opera: RSA signature forgery â GLSA **200609-18**

Opera fails to correctly verify certain signatures.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-client/opera** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **9.02** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **9.02** |

### Background

Opera is a multi-platform web browser.

### Description

Opera makes use of OpenSSL, which fails to correctly verify PKCS #1
v1.5 RSA signatures signed by a key with exponent 3. Some CAs in
Opera's list of trusted signers are using root certificates with
exponent 3.

### Impact

An attacker could forge certificates which will appear valid and signed
by a trusted CA.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Opera users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/opera-9.02"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenât normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

openssl security update (RHSA-2006-0661)

Original Release Date: September 12, 2006

Last Revised: September 14, 2007

Number: ASA-2006-188

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 3.0

Advisory Status: Interim

---

## 1. Overview:

OpenSSL is an open source toolkit that implements the Secure Socket Layer
(SSL) versions 2 and 3 protocols, the Transport Layer Security (TLS) version 1
protocol as well as a general use cryptography library.

An attack against the digital signatures of Public Key Cryptography Standards
(PKCS) #1 v1.5 was recently discussed by Daniel Bleichenbacher at the
CRYPTO-2006 conference. An attacker forging a PKCS #1 v1.5 signature on an RSA
key with exponent 3 could possibly cause some implementations of PKCS to believe
the key had a valid signature. OpenSSL was verified to have this issue with
X.509 certificates. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2006-4339](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4339) to this issue.

Avaya System Products utilize an RSA key exponent of 65537. Root access
would be necessary to change the settings to exploit this vulnerability.

More information about this vulnerability can be found in the security
advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2006-0661.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with openssl installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya S87XX/S8500/S8300 | All | Low | Upgrade to Communication Manager 3.1.4 or later. |
| Avaya Intuity LX | All | Low | Upgrade to Intuity LX 2.0 or later. |
| Avaya Message Networking | All | Low | Upgrade to MN 3.1 or later. |
| Avaya CCS/SES | All | Low | This issue will be addressed in accordance with [Avaya's Product Security Vulnerability Response Policy](http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/security_vulnerability_response.pdf) |
| Avaya Messaging Storage Server | All | Low | Upgrade to MSS 3.1 or later. |

**Recommended Actions:**
For all system products which use vulnerable
versions of openssl, Avaya recommends that customers restrict local and network
access to the server. This restriction should be enforced through the use of
physical security, firewalls, ACLs, VPNs, and other generally-accepted
networking practices until such time as an update becomes available and can be
installed.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating
system or applications that come with the operating system. These
vulnerabilities often do not impact the software-only product directly but may
threaten the integrity of the underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by
the vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be. Customers
should determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and
then follow that vendors guidance:

## 4. Software-Only Products:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Interactive Response(IR) | All | Low | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected packages may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IR application. The IR application does not require the software described in this advisory. |
| CVLAN | All | Low | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected packages may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. The CVLAN application does not require the software described in this advisory. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite(IMS) | All | Low | See recommended actions below. |

**Recommended Actions:**
Avaya recommends that customers follow
recommended actions supplied by the Operating System vendor (e.g. RedHat Linux)
or remove the affected packages.

## 5. Additional Information:

Additional information may also be available via the Avaya support [website](http://support.avaya.com/) and through your Avaya account
representative. Please contact your Avaya product support representative, or
dial 1-800-242-2121, with any questions.

# OpenSSL, AMD64 x86 emulation base libraries: RSA signature forgery â GLSA **200609-05**

OpenSSL fails to properly validate PKCS #1 v1.5 signatures.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-libs/openssl** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.9.7k** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.9.7k** |

| Package | **app-emulation/emul-linux-x86-baselibs** on the amd64 architecture |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.5.2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.5.2** |

### Background

OpenSSL is a toolkit implementing the Secure Sockets Layer, Transport
Layer Security protocols and a general-purpose cryptography library.
The x86 emulation base libraries for AMD64 contain a vulnerable version
of OpenSSL.

### Description

Daniel Bleichenbacher discovered that it might be possible to forge
signatures signed by RSA keys with the exponent of 3.

### Impact

Since several CAs are using an exponent of 3 it might be possible for
an attacker to create a key with a false CA signature.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All OpenSSL users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/openssl-0.9.7k"
```

All AMD64 x86 emulation base libraries users should upgrade to the
latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-emulation/emul-linux-x86-baselibs-2.5.2"
```

OpenVPN Change Log
Copyright (C) 2002-2010 OpenVPN Technologies, Inc. <
 sales@openvpn.net

2010.11.09 -- Version 2.1.4

* Fix problem with special case route targets ('remote_host')
  The init_route() function will leave &netlist untouched for
  get_special_addr() routes ("remote_host" being one of them).
  netlist is on stack,  contains random garbage, and
  netlist.len will not be 0 - thus, random stack data is copied from
  netlist.data[] until the route_list is full.
  Thanks to Teodo MICU and Gert Doering for finding and fixing this issue.

2010.08.20 -- Version 2.1.3

* Windows build fixes
  Attempt to fix issue where domake-win build system was not properly
  signing drivers and .exe files.  This change is only affecting the
  Windows build scripts and not the OpenVPN code base.

2010.08.09 -- Version 2.1.2

* Windows security issue:
  Fixed potential local privilege escalation vulnerability in
  Windows service. The Windows service did not properly quote the
  executable filename passed to CreateService.  A local attacker
  with write access to the root directory C:\ could create an
  executable that would be run with the same privilege level as
  the OpenVPN Windows service.  However, since non-Administrative
  users normally lack write permission on C:\, this vulnerability
  is generally not exploitable except on older versions of Windows
  (such as Win2K) where the default permissions on C:\ would allow
  any user to create files there.
  Credit:  Scott Laurie, MWR InfoSecurity

* Added Python-based based alternative build system for Windows using
  Visual Studio 2008 (in win directory).

* When aborting in a non-graceful way, try to execute do_close_tun in
  init.c prior to daemon exit to ensure that the tun/tap interface is
  closed and any added routes are deleted.

* Fixed an issue where AUTH_FAILED was not being properly delivered
  to the client when a bad password is given for mid-session reauth,
  causing the connection to fail without an error indication.

* Don't advance to the next connection profile on AUTH_FAILED errors.

* Fixed an issue in the Management Interface that could cause
  a process hang with 100% CPU utilization in --management-client
  mode if the management interface client disconnected at the
  point where credentials are queried.

* Fixed an issue where if reneg-sec was set to 0 on the client,
  so that the server-side value would take precedence,
  the auth_deferred_expire_window function would incorrectly
  return a window period of 0 seconds.  In this case, the
  correct window period should be the handshake window
  period.

* Modified ">PASSWORD:Verification Failed" management interface
  notification to include a client reason string:

    >PASSWORD:Verification Failed: 'AUTH_TYPE' ['REASON_STRING']

* Enable exponential backoff in reliability layer
  retransmits.

* Set socket buffers (SO_SNDBUF and SO_RCVBUF) immediately after
  socket is created rather than waiting until after connect/listen.

* Management interface performance optimizations:

  1. Added env-filter MI command to perform filtering on env vars
     passed through as a part of --management-client-auth

  2. man_write will now try to aggregate output into larger blocks
     (up to 1024 bytes) for more efficient i/o

* Fixed minor issue in Windows TAP driver DEBUG builds
  where non-null-terminated unicode strings were being
  printed incorrectly.

* Fixed issue on Windows with MSVC compiler, where TCP_NODELAY support
  was not being compiled in.

* Proxy improvements:

  Improved the ability of http-auth "auto" flag to dynamically detect
  the auth method required by the proxy.

  Added http-auth "auto-nct" flag to reject weak proxy auth methods.

  Added HTTP proxy digest authentication method.

  Removed extraneous openvpn_sleep calls from proxy.c.

* Implemented http-proxy-override and http-proxy-fallback directives to make it
  easier for OpenVPN client UIs to start a pre-existing client config file with
  proxy options, or to adaptively fall back to a proxy connection if a direct
  connection fails.

* Implemented a key/value auth channel from client to server.

* Fixed issue where bad creds provided by the management interface
  for HTTP Proxy Basic Authentication would go into an infinite
  retry-fail loop instead of requerying the management interface for
  new creds.

* Added support for MSVC debugging of openvpn.exe in settings.in:

  # Build debugging version of openvpn.exe
  !define PRODUCT_OPENVPN_DEBUG

* Implemented multi-address DNS expansion on the network field of route
  commands.

  When only a single IP address is desired from a multi-address DNS
  expansion, use the first address rather than a random selection.

* Added --register-dns option for Windows.

  Fixed some issues on Windows with --log, subprocess creation
  for command execution, and stdout/stderr redirection.

* Fixed an issue where application payload transmissions on the
  TLS control channel (such as AUTH_FAILED) that occur during
  or immediately after a TLS renegotiation might be dropped.

* Added warning about tls-remote option in man page.

2009.12.11 -- Version 2.1.1

* Fixed some breakage in openvpn.spec (which is required to build an
  RPM distribution) where it was referencing a non-existent
  subdirectory in the tarball, causing it to fail (patch from
  David Sommerseth).

2009.12.11 -- Version 2.1.0

* Fixed a couple issues in sample plugins auth-pam.c and down-root.c.
  (1) Fail gracefully rather than segfault if calloc returns NULL.
  (2) The openvpn_plugin_abort_v1 function can potentially be called
  with handle == NULL.  Add code to detect this case, and if  so, avoid
  dereferencing pointers derived from handle  (Thanks to David
  Sommerseth for finding this bug).

* Documented "multihome" option in the man page.

2009.11.20 -- Version 2.1_rc22

* Fixed a client-side bug on Windows that occurred when the
  "dhcp-pre-release" or "dhcp-renew" options were combined with
  "route-gateway dhcp".  The release/renew would not occur
  because the Windows DHCP renew function is blocking and
  therefore must be called from another process or thread
  so as not to stall the tunnel.

* Added a hard failure when peer provides a certificate chain
  with depth > 16.  Previously, a warning was issued.

2009.11.12 -- Version 2.1_rc21

* Rebuilt OpenVPN Windows installer with OpenSSL 0.9.8l to address
  CVE-2009-3555.  Note that OpenVPN has never relied on the session
  renegotiation capabilities that are built into the SSL/TLS protocol,
  therefore the fix in OpenSSL 0.9.8l (disable SSL/TLS renegotiation
  completely) will not adversely affect OpenVPN mid-session SSL/TLS
  renegotation or any other OpenVPN capabilities.

* Added additional session renegotiation hardening.  OpenVPN has always
  required that mid-session renegotiations build up a new SSL/TLS
  session from scratch.  While the client certificate common name is
  already locked against changes in mid-session TLS renegotiations, we
  now extend this locking to the auth-user-pass username as well as all
  certificate content in the full client certificate chain.

2009.10.01 -- Version 2.1_rc20

* Fixed a bug introduced in 2.1_rc17 (svn r4436) where using the
  redirect-gateway option by itself, without any extra parameters,
  would cause the option to be ignored.

* Fixed build problem when ./configure --disable-server is used.

* Fixed ifconfig command for "topology subnet" on FreeBSD (Stefan Bethke).

* Added --remote-random-hostname option.

* Added "load-stats" management interface command to get global server
  load statistics.

* Added new ./configure flags:

  --disable-def-auth      Disable deferred authentication
  --disable-pf            Disable internal packet filter

* Added "setcon" directive for interoperability with SELinux (Sebastien
  Raveau).

* Optimized PUSH_REQUEST handshake sequence to shave several seconds
  off of a typical client connection initiation.

* The maximum number of "route" directives (specified in the config
  file or pulled from a server) can now be configured via the new
  "max-routes" directive.

* Eliminated the limitation on the number of options that can be pushed
  to clients, including routes.  Previously, all pushed options needed
  to fit within a 1024 byte options string.

* Added --server-poll-timeout option : when polling possible remote
  servers to connect to in a round-robin fashion, spend no more than
  n seconds waiting for a response before trying the next server.

* Added the ability for the server to provide a custom reason string
  when an AUTH_FAILED message is returned to the client.  This
  string can be set by the server-side managment interface and read
  by the client-side management interface.

* client-kill management interface command, when issued on server, will
  now send a RESTART message to client.
  This feature is intended to make UDP clients respond the same as TCP
  clients in the case where the server issues a RESTART message in
  order to force the client to reconnect and pull a new options/route
  list.

2009.07.16 -- Version 2.1_rc19

* In Windows TAP driver, refactor DHCP/ARP packet injection code to
  use a DPC (deferred procedure call) to defer packet injection until
  IRQL < DISPATCH_LEVEL, rather than calling NdisMEthIndicateReceive
  in the context of AdapterTransmit.  This is an attempt to reduce kernel
  stack usage, and prevent EXCEPTION_DOUBLE_FAULT BSODs that have been
  observed on Vista.  Updated TAP driver version number to 9.6.

* In configure.ac, use datadir instead of datarootdir for compatibility
  with <autoconf-2.60.

2009.06.07 -- Version 2.1_rc18

* Fixed compile error on ./configure --enable-small

* Fixed issue introduced in r4475 (2.1-rc17) where cryptoapi.c change
  does not build on Windows on non-MINGW32.

2009.05.30 -- Version 2.1_rc17

* Reduce the debug level (--verb) at which received management interface
  commands are echoed from 7 to 3.  Passwords will be filtered.

* Fixed race condition in management interface recv code on
  Windows, where sending a set of several commands to the
  management interface in quick succession might cause the
  latter commands in the set to be ignored.

* Increased management interface input command buffer size
  from 256 to 1024 bytes.

* Minor tweaks to Windows build system.

* Added "redirect-private" option which allows private subnets
  to be pushed to the client in such a way that they don't accidently
  obscure critical local addresses such as the DHCP server address and
  DNS server addresses.

* Added new 'autolocal' redirect-gateway flag.  When enabled, the OpenVPN
  client will examine the routing table and determine whether (a) the
  OpenVPN server is reachable via a locally connected interface, or (b)
  traffic to the server must be forwarded through the default router.
  Only add a special bypass route for the OpenVPN server if (b) is true.
  If (a) is true, behave as if the 'local' flag is specified, and do not
  add a bypass route.

  The new 'autolocal' flag depends on the non-portable test_local_addr()
  function in route.c, which is currently only implemented for Windows.
  The 'autolocal' flag will act as a no-op on platforms that have not
  yet defined a test_local_addr() function.

* Increased TLS_CHANNEL_BUF_SIZE to 2048 from 1024 (this will allow for
  more option content to be pushed from server to client).

* Raised D_MULTI_DROPPED debug level to 4 from 3 to filter out (at debug
  levels <=3) a common and usually innocuous warning.

* Fixed issue of symbol conflicts interfering with Windows CryptoAPI
  functionality (Alon Bar-Lev).

* Fixed bug where the remote_X environmental variables were not being
  set correctly when the 'local' option is specifed.

2009.05.17 -- Version 2.1_rc16

* Windows installer changes:

  1. ifdefed out the check Windows version code which is causing
  problems on Windows 7

  2. don't define SF_SELECTED if it is already defined

  3. Use LZMA instead of BZIP2 compression for better compression

  4. Upgraded OpenSSL to 0.9.8k

* Added the ability to read the configuration file
  from stdin, when "stdin" is given as the config
  file name.

* Allow "management-client" directive to be used
  with unix domain sockets.

* Added errors-to-stderr option.  When enabled, fatal errors
  that result in the termination of the daemon will be written
  to stderr.

* Added optional "nogw" (no gateway) flag to --server-bridge
  to inhibit the pushing of the route-gateway parameter to
  clients.

* Added new management interface command "pid" to show the
  process ID of the current OpenVPN process (Angelo Laub).

* Fixed issue where SIGUSR1 restarts would fail if private
  key was specified as an inline file.

* Added daemon_start_time and daemon_pid environmental variables.

* In management interface, added new ">CLIENT:ESTABLISHED" notification.

* Build fixes:

  1. Fixed some issues with C++ style comments that leaked into the code.

  2. Updated configure.ac to work on MinGW64.

  3. Updated common.h types for _WIN64.

  4. Fixed issue involving an #ifdef in a macro reference that breaks early gcc
     compilers.

  5. In cryptoapi.c, renamed CryptAcquireCertificatePrivateKey to
     OpenVPNCryptAcquireCertificatePrivateKey to work around
     a symbol conflict in MinGW-5.1.4.

2008.11.19 -- Version 2.1_rc15

* Fixed issue introduced in 2.1_rc14 that may cause a
  segfault when a --plugin module is used.

* Added server-side --opt-verify option: clients that connect
  with options that are incompatible with those of the server
  will be disconnected (without this option, incompatible
  clients would trigger a warning message in the server log
  but would not be disconnected).

* Added --tcp-nodelay option: Macro that sets TCP_NODELAY socket
  flag on the server as well as pushes it to connecting clients.

* Minor options check fix: --no-name-remapping is a
  server-only option and should therefore generate an
  error when used on the client.

* Added --prng option to control PRNG (pseudo-random
  number generator) parameters.  In previous OpenVPN
  versions, the PRNG was hardcoded to use the SHA1
  hash.  Now any OpenSSL hash may be used.  This is
  part of an effort to remove hardcoded references to
  a specific cipher or cryptographic hash algorithm.

* Cleaned up man page synopsis.

2008.11.16 -- Version 2.1_rc14

* Added AC_GNU_SOURCE to configure.ac to enable struct ucred,
  with the goal of fixing a build issue on Fedora 9 that was
  introduced in 2.1_rc13.

* Added additional method parameter to --script-security to preserve
  backward compatibility with system() call semantics used in OpenVPN
  2.1_rc8 and earlier.  To preserve backward compatibility use:

    script-security 3 system

* Added additional warning messages about --script-security 2
  or higher being required to execute user-defined scripts or
  executables.

* Windows build system changes:

  Modified Windows domake-win build system to write all openvpn.nsi
  input files to gen, so that gen can be disconnected from
  the rest of the source tree and makensis openvpn.nsi will
  still function correctly.

  Added additional SAMPCONF_(CA|CRT|KEY) macros to settings.in
  (commented out by default).

  Added optional files SAMPCONF_CONF2 (second sample configuration
  file) and SAMPCONF_DH (Diffie-Helman parameters) to Windows
  build system, and may be defined in settings.in.

* Extended Management Interface "bytecount" command
  to work when OpenVPN is running as a server.
  Documented Management Interface "bytecount" command in
  management/management-notes.txt.

* Fixed informational message in ssl.c to properly indicate
  deferred authentication.

* Added server-side --auth-user-pass-optional directive, to allow
  connections by clients that do not specify a username/password, when a
  user-defined authentication script/module is in place (via
  --auth-user-pass-verify, --management-client-auth, or a plugin module).

* Changes to easy-rsa/2.0/pkitool and related openssl.cnf:

  Calling scripts can set the KEY_NAME environmental variable to set
  the "name" X509 subject field in generated certificates.

  Modified pkitool to allow flexibility in separating the Common Name
  convention from the cert/key filename convention.

  For example:

  KEY_CN="James's Laptop" KEY_NAME="james" ./pkitool james

  will create a client certificate/key pair of james.crt/james.key
  having a Common Name of "James's Laptop" and a Name of "james".

* Added --no-name-remapping option to allow Common Name, X509 Subject,
  and username strings to include any printable character including
  space, but excluding control characters such as tab, newline, and
  carriage-return (this is important for compatibility with external
  authentication systems).

  As a related change, added --status-version 3 format (and "status 3"
  in the management interface) which uses the version 2 format except
  that tabs are used as delimiters instead of commas so that there
  is no ambiguity when parsing a Common Name that contains a comma.

  Also, save X509 Subject fields to environment, using the naming
  convention:

  X509_{cert_depth}_{name}={value}

  This is to avoid ambiguities when parsing out the X509 subject string
  since "/" characters could potentially be used in the common name.

* Fixed some ifconfig-pool issues that precluded it from being combined
  with --server directive.

  Now, for example, we can configure thusly:

    server 10.8.0.0 255.255.255.0 nopool
    ifconfig-pool 10.8.0.2 10.8.0.99 255.255.255.0

  to have ifconfig-pool manage only a subset
  of the VPN subnet.

* Added config file option "setenv FORWARD_COMPATIBLE 1" to relax
  config file syntax checking to allow directives for future OpenVPN
  versions to be ignored.

2008.10.07 -- Version 2.1_rc13

* Bundled OpenSSL 0.9.8i with Windows installer.

* Management interface can now listen on a unix
  domain socket, for example:

    management /tmp/openvpn unix

  Also added management-client-user and management-client-group
  directives to control which processes are allowed to connect
  to the socket.

* Copyright change to OpenVPN Technologies, Inc.

2008.09.23 -- Version 2.1_rc12

* Patched Makefile.am so that the new t_cltsrv-down.sh script becomes
  part of the tarball (Matthias Andree).

* Fixed --lladdr bug introduced in 2.1-rc9 where input validation code
  was incorrectly expecting the lladdr parameter to be an IP address
  when it is actually a MAC address (HoverHell).

2008.09.14 -- Version 2.1_rc11

* Fixed a bug that can cause SSL/TLS negotiations in UDP mode
  to fail if UDP packets are dropped.

2008.09.10 -- Version 2.1_rc10

* Added "--server-bridge" (without parameters) to enable
  DHCP proxy mode:  Configure server mode for ethernet
  bridging using a DHCP-proxy, where clients talk to the
  OpenVPN server-side DHCP server to receive their IP address
  allocation and DNS server addresses.

* Added "--route-gateway dhcp", to enable the extraction
  of the gateway address from a DHCP negotiation with the
  OpenVPN server-side LAN.

* Fixed minor issue with --redirect-gateway bypass-dhcp or bypass-dns
  on Windows.  If the bypass IP address is 0.0.0.0 or 255.255.255.255,
  ignore it.

* Warn when ethernet bridging that the IP address of the bridge adapter
  is probably not the same address that the LAN adapter was set to
  previously.

* When running as a server, warn if the LAN network address is
  the all-popular 192.168.[0|1].x, since this condition commonly
  leads to subnet conflicts down the road.

* Primarily on the client, check for subnet conflicts between
  the local LAN and the VPN subnet.

* Added a 'netmask' parameter to get_default_gateway, to return
  the netmask of the adapter containing the default gateway.
  Only implemented on Windows so far.  Other platforms will
  return 255.255.255.0.  Currently the netmask information is
  only used to warn about subnet conflicts.

* Minor fix to cryptoapi.c to not compile itself unless USE_CRYPTO
  and USE_SSL flags are enabled (Alon Bar-Lev).

* Updated openvpn/t_cltsrv.sh (used by "make check") to conform to new
  --script-security rules.  Also adds retrying if the addresses are in
  use (Matthias Andree).

* Fixed build issue with ./configure --disable-socks --disable-http.

* Fixed separate compile errors in options.c and ntlm.c that occur
  on strict C compilers (such as old versions of gcc) that require
  that C variable declarations occur at the start of a {} block,
  not in the middle.

* Workaround bug in OpenSSL 0.9.6b ASN1_STRING_to_UTF8, which
  the new implementation of extract_x509_field_ssl depends on.

* LZO compression buffer overflow errors will now invalidate
  the packet rather than trigger a fatal assertion.

* Fixed minor compile issue in ntlm.c (mid-block declaration).

* Added --allow-pull-fqdn option which allows client to pull DNS names
  from server (rather than only IP address) for --ifconfig, --route, and
  --route-gateway.  OpenVPN versions 2.1_rc7 and earlier allowed DNS names
  for these options to be pulled and translated to IP addresses by default.
  Now --allow-pull-fqdn will be explicitly required on the client to enable
  DNS-name-to-IP-address translation of pulled options.

* 2.1_rc8 and earlier did implicit shell expansion on script
  arguments since all scripts were called by system().
  The security hardening changes made to 2.1_rc9 no longer
  use system(), but rather use the safer execve or CreateProcess
  system calls.  The security hardening also introduced a
  backward incompatibility with 2.1_rc8 and earlier in that
  script parameters were no longer shell-expanded, so
  for example:

    client-connect "docc CLIENT-CONNECT"

  would fail to work because execve would try to execute
  a script called "docc CLIENT-CONNECT" instead of "docc"
  with "CLIENT-CONNECT" as the first argument.

  This patch fixes the issue, bringing the script argument
  semantics back to pre 2.1_rc9 behavior in order to preserve
  backward compatibility while still using execve or CreateProcess
  to execute the script/executable.

* Modified ip_or_dns_addr_safe, which validates pulled DNS names,
  to more closely conform to RFC 3696:

  (1) DNS name length must not exceed 255 characters

  (2) DNS name characters must be limited to alphanumeric,
      dash ('-'), and dot ('.')

* Fixed bug in intra-session TLS key rollover that was introduced with
  deferred authentication features in 2.1_rc8.

2008.07.31 -- Version 2.1_rc9

* Security Fix -- affects non-Windows OpenVPN clients running
  OpenVPN 2.1-beta14 through 2.1-rc8 (OpenVPN 2.0.x clients are NOT
  vulnerable nor are any versions of the OpenVPN server vulnerable).
  An OpenVPN client connecting to a malicious or compromised
  server could potentially receive an "lladdr" or "iproute" configuration
  directive from the server which could cause arbitrary code execution on
  the client. A successful attack requires that (a) the client has agreed
  to allow the server to push configuration directives to it by including
  "pull" or the macro "client" in its configuration file, (b) the client
  successfully authenticates the server, (c) the server is malicious or has
  been compromised and is under the control of the attacker, and (d) the
  client is running a non-Windows OS.  Credit: David Wagner.
  CVE-2008-3459

* Miscellaneous defensive programming changes to multiple
  areas of the code.  In particular, use of the system() call
  for calling executables such as ifconfig, route, and
  user-defined scripts has been completely revamped in favor
  of execve() on unix and CreateProcess() on Windows.

* In Windows build, package a statically linked openssl.exe to work around
  observed instabilities in the dynamic build since the migration to
  OpenSSL 0.9.8h.

2008.06.11 -- Version 2.1_rc8

* Added client authentication and packet filtering capability
  to management interface.  In addition, allow OpenVPN plugins
  to take advantage of deferred authentication and packet
  filtering capability.

* Added support for client-side connection profiles.

* Fixed unbounded memory growth bug in environmental variable
  code that could have caused long-running OpenVPN sessions
  with many TLS renegotiations to incrementally
  increase memory usage over time.

* Windows release now packages openssl-0.9.8h.

* Build system changes -- allow building on Windows using
  autoconf/automake scripts (Alon Bar-Lev).

* Changes to Windows build system to make it easier to do
  partial builds, with a reduced set of prerequisites,
  where only a subset of OpenVPN installer
  components are built.  See ./domake-win comments.

* Cleanup IP address for persistence interfaces for tap and also
  using ifconfig, gentoo#209055 (Alon Bar-Lev).

* Fall back to old version of extract_x509_field for OpenSSL 0.9.6.

* Clarified tcp-queue-limit man page entry (Matti Linnanvuori).

* Added new OpenVPN icon and installer graphic.

* Minor pkitool changes.

* Added --pkcs11-id-management option, which will cause OpenVPN to
  query the management interface via the new NEED-STR asynchronous
  notification query to get additional PKCS#11 options (Alon Bar-Lev).

* Added NEED-STR management interface asynchronous query and
  "needstr" management interface command to respond to the query
  (Alon Bar-Lev).

* Added Dragonfly BSD support (Francis-Gudin).

* Quote device names before passing to up/down script (Josh Cepek).

* Bracketed struct openvpn_pktinfo with #pragma pack(1) to
  prevent structure padding from causing an incorrect length
  to be returned by sizeof (struct openvpn_pktinfo) on 64-bit
  platforms.

* On systems that support res_init, always call it
  before calling gethostbyname to ensure that
  resolver configuration state is current.

* Added NTLMv2 proxy support (Miroslav Zajic).

* Fixed an issue in extract_x509_field_ssl where the extraction
  would fail on the first field of the subject name, such as
  the common name in:  /CN=foo/emailAddress=
 foo@bar.com

* Made "Linux ip addr del failed" error nonfatal.

* Amplified --client-cert-not-required warning.

* Added #pragma pack to proto.h.

2008.01.29 -- Version 2.1_rc7

* Added a few extra files that exist in the svn repo but were
  not being copied into the tarball by make dist.

* Fixup null interface on close, don't use ip addr flush (Alon Bar-Lev).

2008.01.24 -- Version 2.1_rc6

* Fixed options checking bug introduced in rc5 where legitimate configuration
  files might elicit the error: "Options error: Parameter pkcs11_private_mode
  can only be specified in TLS-mode, i.e. where --tls-server or --tls-client
  is also specified."

2008.01.23 -- Version 2.1_rc5

* Fixed Win2K TAP driver bug that was introduced by Vista fixes,
  incremented driver version to 9.4.

* Windows build system changes:

  Incremented included OpenSSL version to openssl-0.9.7m.

  Updated openssl.patch for openssl-0.9.7m and added some
  brief usage comments to the head of the patch.

  Added build-pkcs11-helper.sh for building the pkcs11-helper
  library.

  Integrated inclusion of pkcs11-helper into Windows build
  system.

  Upgraded TAP build scripts to use WDK 6001.17121
  (Windows 2008 Server pre-RTM).

* Windows installer changes:

  Clean up the start menu folder.

  Allow for a site-specific sample configuration file and keys
  to be included in a custom installer (see SAMPCONF macros
  in settings.in).

  New icon (temporary).

* Added "forget-passwords" command to the management interface
  (Alon Bar-Lev).

* Added --management-signal option to signal SIGUSR1 when the
  management interface disconnects (Alon Bar-Lev).

* Modified command line and config file parser to allow
  quoted strings using single quotes ('') (Alon Bar-Lev).

* Use pkcs11-helper as external library, can be downloaded from
  https://www.opensc-project.org/pkcs11-helper (Alon Bar-Lev).

* Fixed interim memory growth issue in TCP connect loop where
  "TCP: connect to %s failed, will try again in %d seconds: %s"
  is output.

* Fixed bug in epoll driver in event.c, where the lack of a
  handler for EPOLLHUP could cause 99% CPU usage.

* Defined ALLOW_NON_CBC_CIPHERS for people who don't
  want to use a CBC cipher for OpenVPN's data channel.

* Added PLUGIN_LIBDIR preprocessor string to prepend a default
  plugin directory to the dlopen search list when the user
  specifies the basename of the plugin only (Marius Tomaschewski).

* Rewrote extract_x509_field and modified COMMON_NAME_CHAR_CLASS
  to allow forward slash characters ("/") in the X509 common name
  (Pavel Shramov).

* Allow OpenVPN to run completely unprivileged under Linux
  by allowing openvpn --mktun to be used with --user and --group
  to set the UID/GID of the tun device node.  Also added --iproute
  option to allow an alternative command to be executed in place
  of the default iproute2 command (Alon Bar-Lev).

* Fixed --disable-iproute2 in ./configure to actually disable
  iproute2 usage (Alon Bar-Lev).

* Added --management-forget-disconnect option -- forget
  passwords when management session disconnects (Alon Bar-Lev).

2007.04.25 -- Version 2.1_rc4

* Worked out remaining issues with TAP driver signing
  on Vista x64.  OpenVPN will now run on Vista x64
  with driver signing enforcement enabled.

* Fixed 64-bit portability bug in time_string function
  (Thomas Habets).

2007.04.22 -- Version 2.1_rc3

* Additional fixes to TAP driver for Windows x64.  Driver
  now runs successfully on Vista x64 if driver signing
  enforcement is disabled.

* The Windows Installer and TAP driver are now signed by
  OpenVPN Solutions LLC (in addition to the usual GnuPG
  signatures).

* Added OpenVPN GUI (Mathias Sundman version) as install
  option in Windows installer.

* Clean up configure on FreeBSD for recent autotool versions
  that require that all .h files have to be compiled.
  Also, FreeBSD install does not support GNU long options
  which the Makefile in easy-rsa/2.0 uses (not checked the
  others as we don't install those on Gentoo) (Roy Marples).

* Added additional scripts to easy-rsa/Windows for working
  with password-protected keys; also add -extensions server
  option when generating server cert via
  build-key-server-pass.bat (Daniel Zauft).

2007.02.27 -- Version 2.1_rc2

* auth-pam change:  link with -lpam rather
  than dlopen (Roy Marples).

* Prevent SIGUSR1 or SIGHUP from causing program
  exit from initial management hold.

* SO_REUSEADDR should not be set on Windows TCP sockets
  because it will cause bind to succeed on port conflicts.

* Added time_ascii, time_duration, and time_unix
  environmental variables for plugins and callback
  scripts.

* Fixed issue where OpenVPN does not apply the --txqueuelen option
  to persistent interfaces made with --mktun (Roy Marples).

* Attempt at rational signal handling when in the
  management hold state.  During management hold, ignore
  SIGUSR1/SIGHUP signals thrown with the "signal" command.
  Also, "signal" command will now apply remapping as
  specified with the --remap-usr1 option.
  When a signal entered using the "signal" command from a management
  hold is ignored, output: >HOLD:Waiting for hold release

* Fixed issue where struct env_set methods that
  change the value of an existing name=value pair
  would delay the freeing of the memory held by
  the previous name=value pair until the underlying
  client instance object is closed.
  This could cause a server that handles long-term
  client connections, resulting in many periodic calls
  to verify_callback, to needlessly grow the env_set
  memory allocation until the underlying client instance
  object is closed.

* Renamed TAP-Win32 driver from tap0801.sys to tap0901.sys
  to reflect the fact that Vista has blacklisted the tap0801.sys
  file name due to previous compatibility issues which have now
  been resolved.  TAP-Win32 major/minor version number is now 9/1.

* Windows installer will delete a previously installed
  tap0801.sys TAP driver before installing tap0901.sys.

* Added code to Windows installer to fail gracefully on 64 bit
  installs until 64-bit TAP driver issues can be resolved.

* Added code to Windows installer to fail gracefully on
  versions of Windows which are not explicitly supported.

* The Windows version will now use a default route-delay
  of 5 seconds to deal with an apparent routing table race
  condition on Vista.

* Worked around an incompatibility in the Windows Vista
  version of CreateIpForwardEntry as described in
[Debugging (or reverse engineeringâ¦) a real life Windows Vista compatibility problem: CreateIpForwardEntry in iphlpapi](http://www.nynaeve.net/?p=59)

  This issue would cause route additions using the
  IP Helper API to fail on Vista.

* On Windows, revert to "ip-win32 dynamic" as the default.

2006.10.31 -- Version 2.1_rc1

* Support recovery (return to hold) from signal at
  management password prompt.

* Added workaround for OpenSC PKCS#11 bug#108
  (Alon Bar-Lev).

2006.10.01 -- Version 2.1-beta16

* Windows installer updated with OpenSSL 0.9.7l DLLs to fix
  published vulnerabilities.

* Fixed TAP-Win32 bug that caused BSOD on Windows Vista
  (Henry Nestler).

* Autodetect 32/64 bit Windows in installer and install
  appropriate TAP driver (Mathias Sundman, Hypherion).

* Fixed bug in loopback self-test introduced
  in 2.1-beta15 where self test as invoked by
  "make check" would not properly exit after
  2 minutes (Paul Howarth).

2006.09.12 -- Version 2.1-beta15

* Windows installer updated with OpenSSL 0.9.7k DLLs to fix
  RSA Signature Forgery (CVE-2006-4339).

* Fixed bug introduced with the --port-share directive
  (back in 2.1-beta9 which causes TLS soft resets
  (1 per hour by default) in TCP server mode to force
  a blockage of tunnel packets and later time-out and
  restart the connection.

* easy-rsa update (Alon Bar-Lev)
  Makefile (install) is now available so that
  distribs will be able to install it safely.

* PKCS#11 changes: (Alon Bar-Lev)
  - Modified ssl.c to not FATAL and return to init.c
    so auth-retry will work.
  - Modifed pkcs11-helper.c to fix some problem with
    multiple providers.
  - Added retry counter to PKCS#11 PIN hook.
  - Modified PKCS#11 PIN retry loop to return correct error
    code when PIN is incorrect.
  - Fix handling (ignoring) zero sized attributes.
  - Fix gcc-2 issues.
  - Fix openssl 0.9.6 (first version) issues.

* Minor fixes of lladdr (Alon Bar-Lev)
  Updated makefile.w32-vc to include lladdr.*, updated
  linkage libraries.
  Modified lladdr.c to be compiled under visual C.

* Added two new management states:
   OPENVPN_STATE_RESOLVE      -- DNS lookup
   OPENVPN_STATE_TCP_CONNECT  -- Connecting to TCP server

* Echo management state change to log.

* Minor syshead.h change for NetBSD to allow
  TCP_NODELAY flag to work.

* Modified --port-share code to remove the assumption that
  CMSG_SPACE always evaluates to a constant, to enable
  compilation on NetBSD and possibly other BSDs as well.

* Eliminated gcc 3.3.3 warnings on NetBSD
  when ./configure --enable-strict is used.

* Added optional minimum-number-of-bytes parameter
  to --inactive directive.

2006.04.13 -- Version 2.1-beta14

* Fixed Windows server bug in time backtrack handling code which
  could cause TLS negotiation failures on legitimate clients.

* Rewrote gettimeofday function for Windows to be
  simpler and more efficient.

* Merged PKCS#11 extensions to easy-rsa/2.0  (Alon Bar-Lev).

* Added --route-metric option to set a default route metric
  for --route (Roy Marples).

* Added --lladdr option to specify the link layer (MAC) address
  for the tap interface on non-Windows platforms (Roy Marples).

2006.04.12 -- Version 2.1-beta13

* Code added in 2.1-beta7 and 2.0.6-rc1 to extend byte counters
  to 64 bits caused a bug in the Windows version which has now
  been fixed.  The bug could cause intermittent crashes.

2006.04.05 -- Version 2.1-beta12

* Security Vulnerability -- An OpenVPN client connecting to a
  malicious or compromised server could potentially receive
  "setenv" configuration directives from the server which could
  cause arbitrary code execution on the client via a LD_PRELOAD
  attack.  A successful attack appears to require that (a) the
  client has agreed to allow the server to push configuration
  directives to it by including "pull" or the macro "client" in
  its configuration file, (b) the client configuration file uses
  a scripting directive such as "up" or "down", (c) the client
  succesfully authenticates the server, (d) the server is
  malicious or has been compromised and is under the control of
  the attacker, and (e) the attacker has at least some level of
  pre-existing control over files on the client (this might be
  accomplished by having the server respond to a client web request
  with a specially crafted file).  Credit: Hendrik Weimer.
  CVE-2006-1629.

  The fix is to disallow "setenv" to be pushed to clients from
  the server, and to add a new directive "setenv-safe" which is
  pushable from the server, but which appends "OPENVPN_" to the
  name of each remotely set environmental variable.

* "topology subnet" fix for FreeBSD (Benoit Bourdin).

* PKCS11 fixes (Alon Bar-Lev).  For full description:
  svn log -r990 http://svn.openvpn.net/projects/openvpn/branches/BETA21

* When deleting routes under Linux, use the route metric
  as a differentiator to ensure that the route teardown
  process only deletes the identical route which was originally
  added via the "route" directive (Roy Marples).

* Fix the t_cltsrv.sh file in FreeBSD 4 jails
  (Matthias Andree, Dirk Meyer, Vasil Dimov).

* Extended tun device configure code to support ethernet
  bridging on NetBSD (Emmanuel Kasper).

2006.02.19 -- Version 2.1-beta11

* Fixed --port-share bug that caused premature closing
  of proxied sessions.

2006.02.17 -- Version 2.1-beta10

* Fixed --port-share breakage introduced in 2.1-beta9.

2006.02.16 -- Version 2.1-beta9

* Added --port-share option for allowing OpenVPN and HTTPS
  server to share the same port number.
* Added --management-client option to connect as a client
  to management GUI app rather than be connected to as a
  server.
* Added "bytecount" command to management interface.
* --remote-cert-tls fixes (Alon Bar-Lev).

2006.01.03 -- Version 2.1-beta8

* --remap-usr1 will now also remap signals thrown during
  initialization.
* Added --connect-timeout option to control the timeout
  on TCP client connection attempts (doesn't work on all
  OSes).  This patch also makes OpenVPN signalable during
  TCP connection attempts.
* Fixed bug in acinclude.m4 where capability of compiler
  to handle zero-length arrays in structs is tested
  (David Stipp).
* Fixed typo in manage.c where inline function declaration
  was declared without the "static" keyword (David Stipp).
* Patch to support --topology subnet on Mac OS X (Mathias Sundman).
* Added --auto-proxy directive to auto-detect HTTP or SOCKS
  proxy settings (currently Windows only).
* Removed redundant base64 code.
* Better sanity checking of --server and --server-bridge
  IP pool ranges, so as not to hit the assertion at
  pool.c:119 (2.0.5).
* Fixed bug where --daemon and --management-query-passwords
  used together would cause OpenVPN to block prior to
  daemonization.
* Fixed client/server race condition which could occur
  when --auth-retry interact is set and the initially
  provided auth-user-pass credentials are incorrect,
  forcing a username/password re-query.
* Fixed bug where if --daemon and --management-hold are
  used together, --user or --group options would be ignored.
* --ip-win32 adaptive is now the default.
* --ip-win32 netsh (or --ip-win32 adaptive when in netsh
  mode) can now set DNS/WINS addresses on the TAP-Win32
  adapter.
* Added new option --route-method adaptive (Win32)
  which tries IP helper API first, then falls back to
  route.exe.
* Made --route-method adaptive the default.

2005.11.12 -- Version 2.1-beta7

* Allow blank passwords to be passed via the management
  interface.
* Fixed bug where "make check" inside a FreeBSD "jail"
  would never complete (Matthias Andree).
* Fixed bug where --server directive in --dev tap mode
  claimed that it would support subnets of /30 or less
  but actually would only accept /29 or less.
* Extend byte counters to 64 bits (M. van Cuijk).
* Fixed bug in Linux get_default_gateway function
  introduced in 2.0.4, which would cause redirect-gateway
  on Linux clients to fail.
* Moved easy-rsa 2.0 scripts to easy-rsa/2.0 to
  be compatible with 2.0.x distribution.
* Documented --route-nopull.
* Documented --ip-win32 adaptive.
* Windows build now linked with LZO2.
* Allow ca, cert, key, and dh files to be specified
  inline via XML-like syntax without needing to
  reference an explicit file.
  For example:
  <ca>
	data here...
  </ca>
* Allow plugin and push directives to have multi-line
  parameter lists such as:
  <plugin>
    my-plugin.so
    parm1
    parm2
  </plugin>
* Added connect-retry-max option (Alon Bar-Lev).
* Fixed problems where signals thrown during initialization
  were not returning to a management-hold state.
* Added a backtrack-hardened system time algorithm.
* Added --remote-cert-ku, --remote-cert-eku, and
  --remote-cert-tls options for verifying certificate
  attributes (Alon Bar-Lev).
* For Windows, reverted --ip-win32 default back to "dynamic".
  To use new adaptive mode, set explicitly.

2005.11.01 -- Version 2.1-beta6

* Security fix (merged from 2.0.4) -- Affects non-Windows
  OpenVPN clients of version 2.0 or higher which connect to
  a malicious or compromised server.  A format string
  vulnerability in the foreign_option function in options.c
  could potentially allow a malicious or compromised server
  to execute arbitrary code on the client.  Only
  non-Windows clients are affected.  The vulnerability
  only exists if (a) the client's TLS negotiation with
  the server succeeds, (b) the server is malicious or
  has been compromised such that it is configured to
  push a maliciously crafted options string to the client,
  and (c) the client indicates its willingness to accept
  pushed options from the server by having "pull" or
  "client" in its configuration file (Credit: Vade79).
  CVE-2005-3393
* Security fix -- (merged from 2.0.4) Potential DoS
  vulnerability on the server in TCP mode.  If the TCP
  server accept() call returns an error status, the resulting
  exception handler may attempt to indirect through a NULL
  pointer, causing a segfault.  Affects all OpenVPN 2.0 versions.
  CVE-2005-3409
* Fix attempt of assertion at multi.c:1586 (note that
  this precise line number will vary across different
  versions of OpenVPN).
* Windows reliability changes:
  (a) Added code to make sure that the local PATH environmental
      variable points to the Windows system32 directory.
  (b) Added new --ip-win32 adaptive mode which tries 'dynamic'
      and then fails over to 'netsh' if the DHCP negotiation fails.
  (c) Made --ip-win32 adaptive the default.
* More PKCS#11 additions/changes (Alon Bar-Lev).
* Added ".PHONY: plugin" to Makefile.am to work around
  "make dist" issue.
* Fixed double fork issue that occurs when --management-hold
  is used.
* Moved TUN/TAP read/write log messages from --verb 8 to 6.
* Warn when multiple clients having the same common name or
  username usurp each other when --duplicate-cn is not used.
* Modified Windows and Linux versions of get_default_gateway
  to return the route with the smallest metric
  if multiple 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0 entries are present.
* Added ">NEED-OK" alert and "needok" command to management
  interface to provide a general interface for sending
  alerts to the end-user.  Used by the PKCS#11 code
  to send Token Insertion Requests to the user.
* Added actual remote address used to the ">STATE" alert
  in the management interface (Rolf Fokkens).

2005.10.17 -- Version 2.1-beta4

* Fixed bug introduced in 2.1-beta3 where management
  socket bind would fail.
* --capath fix in ssl.c (Zhuang Yuyao).
* Added ".PHONY: plugin" to Makefile.am, reverted
  location of "plugin" directory (thanks to
  Matthias Andree for figuring this out).

2005.10.16 -- Version 2.1-beta3

* Added PKCS#11 support (Alon Bar-Lev).
* Enable the use of --ca together with --pkcs12.  If --ca is
  used at the same time as --pkcs12, the CA certificate is loaded
  from the file specified by --ca regardless if the pkcs12 file
  contains a CA cert or not (Mathias Sundman).
* Merged --capath patch (Thomas Noel).
* Merged --multihome patch.
* Added --bind option for TCP client connections (Ewan Bhamrah
  Harley).
* Moved "plugin" directory to "plugins" to deal with strange
  automake problem that ended up being also fixable with
  ".PHONY: plugin" in Makefile.am.

2005.10.13 -- Version 2.1-beta2

* Made --sndbuf and --rcvbuf pushable.

2005.10.01 -- Version 2.1-beta1

* Made LZO setting pushable.
* Renamed sample-keys/tmp-ca.crt to ca.crt.
* Fixed bug where remove_iroutes_from_push_route_list
  was missing routes if those routes had
  an implied netmask (by omission) of 255.255.255.255.
* Merged with 2.0.3-rc1
* easy-rsa/2.0 moved to easy-rsa
* old easy-rsa moved to easy-rsa/1.0

2005.09.23 -- Version 2.0.2-TO4

* Added feature to TAP-Win32 adapter to allow it to be
  opened from non-administrator mode.  This feature
  is enabled by default, and can be enabled/disabled
  in the adapter advanced properties dialog.
* Added --allow-nonadmin standalone option for Windows to
  set TAP adapter to allow non-admin access.  This
  is a user-mode version of the code, and duplicates
  the same feature as the above entry.
* Added fix that attempts to solve corner case of tunnel not
  forwarding packets when system clock is reset to an earlier time.
* Added --redirect-gateway bypass-dns option.  (Developers:
  To add bypass-dhcp or bypass-dns support to other OSes,
  add a get_bypass_addresses function to route.c for
  your OS.)
* Added OPENVPN_PLUGIN_CLIENT_CONNECT_V2 plugin callback, which
  allows a client-connect plugin to return configuration text
  in memory, rather than via a file.
* Fixed a bug where --mode server --proto tcp-server --cipher none
  operation could cause tunnel packet truncation.
* openvpn --version will show [LZO1] or [LZO2], depending on
  version that was linked.

2005.09.07 -- Version 2.0.2-TO1

* Added --topology directive.  See man page.
* Added --redirect-gateway bypass-dhcp option to add a route
  allowing DHCP packets to bypass the tunnel, when the
  DHCP server is non-local.  Currently only implemented
  on Windows clients.
* Modified OpenVPN Service on Windows to declare the DHCP
  client service as a dependency.
* Extended the plugin interface to allow plugins to declare
  per-client constructor and destructor functions, to make
  it simpler for plugins to maintain per-client state.

2005.09.25 -- Version 2.0.3-rc1

* openvpn_plugin_abort_v1 function wasn't being properly
  registered on Windows.
* Fixed a bug where --mode server --proto tcp-server --cipher none
  operation could cause tunnel packet truncation.

2005.08.25 -- Version 2.0.2

* No change from 2.0.2-rc1.

2005.08.24 -- Version 2.0.2-rc1

* Fixed regression bug in Win32 installer, introduced in 2.0.1,
  which incorrectly set OpenVPN service to autostart.
* Don't package source code zip file in Windows installer
  in order to reduce the size of the installer.  The source
  zip file can always be downloaded separately if needed.
* Fixed bug in route.c in FreeBSD, Darwin, OpenBSD and NetBSD
  version of get_default_gateway.  Allocated socket for route
  manipulation is never freed so number of mbufs continuously
  grow and exhaust system resources after a while (Jaroslav Klaus).
* Fixed bug where "--proto tcp-server --mode p2p --management
  host port" would cause the management port to not respond until
  the OpenVPN peer connects.
* Modified pkitool script to be /bin/sh compatible (Johnny Lam).

2005.08.16 -- Version 2.0.1

* Security Fix -- DoS attack against server when run with "verb 0" and
  without "tls-auth".  If a client connection to the server fails
  certificate verification, the OpenSSL error queue is not properly
  flushed, which can result in another unrelated client instance on the
  server seeing the error and responding to it, resulting in disconnection
  of the unrelated client (CAN-2005-2531).
* Security Fix -- DoS attack against server by authenticated client.
  This bug presents a potential DoS attack vector against the server
  which can only be initiated by a connected and authenticated client.
  If the client sends a packet which fails to decrypt on the server,
  the OpenSSL error queue is not properly flushed, which can result in
  another unrelated client instance on the server seeing the error and
  responding to it, resulting in disconnection of the unrelated client
  (CAN-2005-2532).  Credit: Mike Ireton.
* Security Fix -- DoS attack against server by authenticated client.
  A malicious client in "dev tap" ethernet bridging mode could
  theoretically flood the server with packets appearing to come from
  hundreds of thousands of different MAC addresses, causing the OpenVPN
  process to deplete system virtual memory as it expands its internal
  routing table.  A --max-routes-per-client directive has been added
  (default=256) to limit the maximum number of routes in OpenVPN's
  internal routing table which can be associated with a given client
  (CAN-2005-2533).
* Security Fix -- DoS attack against server by authenticated client.
  If two or more client machines try to connect to the server at the
  same time via TCP, using the same client certificate, and when
  --duplicate-cn is not enabled on the server, a race condition can
  crash the server with "Assertion failed at mtcp.c:411"
  (CAN-2005-2534).
* Fixed server bug where under certain circumstances, the client instance
  object deletion function would try to delete iroutes which had never been
  added in the first place, triggering "Assertion failed at mroute.c:349".
* Added --auth-retry option to prevent auth errors from being fatal
  on the client side, and to permit username/password requeries in case
  of error.  Also controllable via new "auth-retry" management interface
  command.  See man page for more info.
* Added easy-rsa 2.0 scripts to the tarball in easy-rsa/2.0
* Fixed bug in openvpn.spec where rpmbuild --define 'without_pam 1'
  would fail to build.
* Implement "make check" to perform loopback tests (Matthias Andree).

2005.07.21 -- Version 2.0.1-rc7

* Support LZO 2.01 which renamed its library to lzo2 (Matthias Andree).
* Include linux/types.h before checking for linux/errqueue.h (Matthias
  Andree).

2005.07.15 -- Version 2.0.1-rc6

* Commented out "user nobody" and "group nobody" in sample
  client/server config files.
* Allow '@' character to be used in --client-config-dir
  file names.

2005.07.04 -- Version 2.0.1-rc5

* Windows version will log a for-further-info URL when
  initialization sequence is completed with errors.
* Added DLOPEN_PAM parameter to plugin/auth-pam/Makefile
  to control whether auth-pam plugin links to PAM via
  dlopen or -lpam.  By default, DLOPEN_PAM=1 so pre-existing
  behavior should be preserved.  DLOPEN_PAM=0 is the preferred
  setting to link via -lpam, but DLOPEN_PAM=1 works around
  a bug in SuSE 9.1 (and possibly other distros as well)
  where the PAM modules are not linked with -lpam.  See
  thread on openvpn-devel for more discussion about this
  patch (Simon Perreault).

2005.06.15 -- Version 2.0.1-rc4

* Support LZO 2.00, including changes to configure script to
  autodetect LZO version.

2005.06.12 -- Version 2.0.1-rc3

* Fixed a bug which caused standard file handles to not be closed
  after daemonization when --plugin and --daemon are used together,
  and if the plugin initialization function forks (as does auth-pam
  and down-root) (Simon Perreault).
* Added client-side up/down scripts in contrib/pull-resolv-conf
  for accepting server-pushed "dhcp-option DOMAIN" and "dhcp-option DNS"
  on Linux/Unix systems (Jesse Adelman).
* Fixed bug where if client-connect scripts/plugins were cascaded,
  and one (but not all) of them returned an error status, there might
  be cases where for an individual script/plugin, client-connect was
  called but not client-disconnect.  The goal of this fix is to
  ensure that if client-connect is called on a given client instance,
  then client-disconnect will definitely be called.  A potential
  complication of this fix is that when client-connect functions are
  cascaded, it's possible that the client-disconnect function would
  be called in cases where the related client-connect function returned
  an error status.  This fix should not alter OpenVPN behavior when
  scripts/plugins are not cascaded.
* Changed the hard-to-reproduce "Assertion failed at fragment.c:312"
  fatal error to a warning: "FRAG: outgoing buffer is not empty".
  Need more info on how to reproduce this one.
* When --duplicate-cn is used, the --ifconfig-pool allocation
  algorithm will now allocate the first available IP address.
* When --daemon and --management-hold are used together,
  OpenVPN will daemonize before it enters the management hold state.

2005.05.16 -- Version 2.0.1-rc2

* Modified vendor test in openvpn.spec file to match against
  "Mandrakesoft" in addition to "MandrakeSoft".
* Using --iroute in a --client-config-dir file while in --dev tap
  mode is not currently supported and will produce a warning
  message. Fixed bug where in certain cases, in addition to
  generating a warning message, this combination of options
  would also produce a fatal assertion in mroute.c.
* Pass --auth-user-pass username to server-side plugin without
  performing any string remapping (plugins, unlike scripts,
  don't get any security benefit from string remapping).
  This is intended to fix an issue with openvpn-auth-pam/pam_winbind
  where backslash characters in a username ('\') were being remapped
  to underscore ('_').
* Updated OpenSSL DLLs in Windows build to 0.9.7g.
* Documented --explicit-exit-notify in man page.
* --explicit-exit-notify seconds parameter defaults to 1 if
  unspecified.

2005.04.30 -- Version 2.0.1-rc1

* Fixed bug where certain kinds of fatal errors after
  initialization (such as port in use) would leave plugin
  processes (such as openvpn-auth-pam) still running.
* Added optional openvpn_plugin_abort_v1 plugin function for
  closing initialized plugin objects in the event of a fatal
  error by main OpenVPN process.
* When the --remote list is > 1, and --resolv-retry is not
  specified (meaning that it defaults to "infinite"), apply the
  infinite timeout to the --remote list as a whole, but try each
  list item only once before moving on to the next item.
* Added new --syslog directive which redirects output
  to syslog without requiring the use of the --daemon or --inetd
  directives.
* Added openvpn.spec option to allow RPM to be built with support
  for passwords read from a file:
  rpmbuild -tb [openvpn.x.tar.gz] --define 'with_password_save 1'

2005.04.17 -- Version 2.0

* Fixed minor options string typo in options.c.

2005.04.10 -- Version 2.0-rc21

* Change license description from "GPL Version 2 or (at your
  option) any later version" to just "GPL Version 2".

2005.04.04 -- Version 2.0-rc20

* Dag Wieers has put together an OpenVPN/LZO binary RPM set with
  excellent distro/version coverage for RH/EL/Fedora, though
  using his own SPEC.  I modified openvpn.spec to follow some of
  the same conventions such as putting sample scripts and doc
  files in %doc rather than /usr/share/openvpn.
* Minor change to init scripts to run the user-defined script
  /etc/openvpn/openvpn-startup (if it exists) before any OpenVPN
  configs are started, and to run /etc/openvpn/openvpn-shutdown
  after all OpenVPN configs have been stopped.  The
  openvpn-startup script can be used for stuff like
  insmod tun.o, setting up firewall rules, or starting
  ethernet bridges.

2005.03.29 -- Version 2.0-rc19

* Omit additions of routes where the network and
  gateway are equal and the netmask is 255.255.255.255.
  This can come up if you are using both
  server/ifconfig-pool and client-config-dir with
  ifconfig-push static addresses for some subset of clients
  which directly reference the server IP address as the
  remote endpoint.

2005.03.28 -- Version 2.0-rc18

* Packaged Windows installer with OpenSSL 0.9.7f.
* Built Windows installer with NSIS 2.06.

2005.03.12 -- Version 2.0-rc17

* "MANAGEMENT: CMD" log file output will now only occur
  at --verb 7 or greater.
* Added an optional name/value configuration list to
  the openvpn-auth-pam plugin module argument list.  See
  plugin/auth-pam/README for documentation. This is necessary
  in order for openvpn-auth-pam to work with queries generated
  by arbitrary PAM modules.
* In both auth-pam and down-root plugins, in the forked process,
  a read error on the parent process socket is no longer fatal.
* MandrakeSoft liblzo1 RPM only Provides for a 'liblzo1'.
  A conditional test of the vendor has been added to
  Require the appropriately named 'lzo' (liblzo1 / lzo).
  (Tom Walsh - http://openhardware.net)

2005.02.20 -- Version 2.0-rc16

* Fixed bug introduced in rc13 where Windows service wrapper
  would be installed with a startup type of Automatic.
  This fix restores the previous behavior of installing
  with a startup type of Manual.

2005.02.19 -- Version 2.0-rc15

* Added warning when --keepalive is not used in a server
  configuration.
* Don't include OpenSSL md4.h file if we are not building
  NTLM proxy support (Waldemar Brodkorb).
* Added easy-rsa/build-key-pkcs12 and
  easy-rsa/Windows/build-key-pkcs12.bat scripts
  (Mathias Sundman).

2005.02.16 -- Version 2.0-rc14

* Fixed small memory leak that occurs when --crl-verify
  is used.
* Upgraded Windows installer and .nsi script to NSIS 2.05
  (Mathias Sundman).
* Changed #include backslash usage in cryptoapi.c to use
  forward slashes instead (Gisle Vanem).
* Created easy-rsa/revoke-full to handle revocations in
  a single step: (a) revoke crt, (b) regenerate CRL, and
  (c) verify that revocation succeeded.
* Renamed easy-rsa/Windows/revoke-key to revoke-full so
  that both *nix and Windows scripts are equivalent.

2005.02.11 -- Version 2.0-rc13

* Improve human-readability of local/remote options
  diff, when inconsistencies are present.
* For Windows easy-rsa, distribute vars.bat.sample and
  openssl.cnf.sample, then copy them to their normal
  filenames (without the .sample) when init-config.bat
  is run.  This is to prevent OpenVPN upgrades from
  wiping out vars.bat and openssl.cnf edits.
* Modified service wrapper (Windows) to use a
  case-insensitive search when scanning for .ovpn files
  in \Program Files\OpenVPN\config.  Prior versions
  required an all-lower-case .ovpn file extension.
* Miscellaneous service wrapper code cleanup.
* If --user/--group is used on Windows, treat it
  as a no-op with a warning (this makes it easier to
  distribute the same client config file to Windows
  and *nix users).
* Warn if --ifconfig-pool-persist is used with
  --duplicate-cn.

2005.02.05 -- Version 2.0-rc12

* Removed some debugging code inadvertently included
  in rc11 which would print the --auth-user-pass
  username/password provided by clients in the server
  logfile.
* Client code for cycling through --remote list will
  retry the last address which successfully authenticated
  before moving on through the list.
* Windows installer will now install sample configuration
  files in \Program Files\OpenVPN\sample-configs as well
  as generate a start menu shortcut to this directory.
* Minor type change in buffer.[ch] to work around char-type
  ambiguity bug.  Caused management interface lock-ups on
  ARM when building with armv4b-hardhat-linux-gcc 2.95.3.

2005.02.03 -- Version 2.0-rc11

* Windows installer will now install easy-rsa directory
  in \Program Files\OpenVPN
* Allow syslog facility to be controlled at compile time,
  e.g. -DLOG_OPENVPN=LOG_LOCAL6 (P Kern).
* Changed certain shell scripts in distribution to use
  #!/bin/sh rather than #!/bin/bash for better portability.
* If --ifconfig-pool-persist seconds parameter is 0, treat
  persist file as an allocation of fixed IP addresses
  (previous versions took IP-to-common-name associations
  from this list as hints, not mandatory static allocations).
* Fixed bug on *nix where if --auth-user-pass and --log
  were used together, the username prompt would be sent to
  the log file rather than /dev/tty.
* Spurious text in openvpn.8 detected by doclifter
  (Eric S. Raymond).
* Call closelog later on daemon kill so that process
  exit message is written to syslog.

2005.01.27 -- Version 2.0-rc10

* When ./configure is run with plugins enabled (the default),
  check whether or not dlopen exists in libc before testing
  for libdl.  This is to fix an issue on FreeBSD and possibly
  other OSes which bundle libdl functions in libc.
* On Windows, filter initial WSAEINVAL warning which occurs
  on the initial read attempt of an unbound socket.
* The easy-rsa scripts build-key, build-key-pass, and
  build-key-server will now chmod the .key file
  to 0600.  This is in addition to the fact the generated
  keys directory has always been similarly protected
  (Pete Harlan).

2005.01.23 -- Version 2.0-rc9

* Fixed error "ROUTE: route addition failed using
  CreateIpForwardEntry ..." on Windows when --redirect-gateway
  is used over a RRAS internet link.
* When using --route-method exe on Windows, include the
  gateway parameter on route delete commands (Mathias Sundman).
* Try not to do a hard reset (i.e. SIGHUP) when two
  SIGUSR1 signals are received in close succession.
* If the push list tries to grow beyond its buffer capacity,
  the resulting error will be non-fatal.
* To increase the push list capacity (must be done on both
  client and server), increase TLS_CHANNEL_BUF_SIZE in
  common.h (default=1024).

2005.01.15 -- Version 2.0-rc8

* Fixed bug introduced in rc7 where options error
  "--auth-user-pass requires --pull" might occur even
  if --pull was correctly specified.
* Changed management interface code to bind once
  to TCP socket, rather than rebinding after every
  client disconnect.
* Added "disable" directive for client-config-dir
  files.
* Windows binary install is now distributed with
  OpenSSL 0.9.7e.
* Query the management interface for --http-proxy
  username/password if authfile is set to "stdin".
* Added current OpenVPN version number to "Unrecognized
  option or missing parameter" error message.
* Added "-extensions server" to "openssl req" command
  in easy-rsa/build-key-server (Nir Yeffet).

2005.01.10 -- Version 2.0-rc7

* Fixed bug in management interface which could cause
  100% CPU utilization in --proto tcp-server mode
  on all *nix OSes except for Linux 2.6.
* --ifconfig-push now accepts DNS names as well as
  IP addresses.
* Added sanity check errors when --pull or
  --auth-user-pass is used in an incorrect mode.
* Updated man page entries for --client-connect and
  --ifconfig-push.
* Added "String Types and Remapping" section to man
  page to consisely document the way which OpenVPN
  may convert certain types of characters in strings
  to ('_').
* Modified bridging description in HOWTO to emphasize
  the fact that bridging allows Windows file and print
  sharing without a WINS server (Charles Duffy).

2004.12.20 -- Version 2.0-rc6

* Improved checking for epoll support in ./configure
  to fix false positive on RH9 (Jan Just Keijser).
* Made the "MULTI TCP: I/O wait required blocking in
  multi_tcp_action, action=7" error nonfatal and replaced
  with "MULTI: Outgoing TUN queue full, dropped packet".
  So far the issue only seems to occur on Linux 2.2
  in --mode server --proto tcp mode.  It occurs when
  the TUN/TAP driver locks up and refuses to accept
  new packet writes for a second or more.
* Fixed bug where if a --client-config-dir file tried
  to include another file using "config", and if that
  include failed, OpenVPN would abort with a fatal
  error.  Now such inclusion failures will be logged
  but are no longer fatal.
* Global changes to the way that packet buffer alignment
  is handled.  Previously we didn't care about alignment
  and took care, when handling 16 and 32 bit words
  in buffers, to always use alignment-safe transfers.
  This approach appears to be inadequate on some
  architectures such as alpha.  The new approach is
  to initialize packet buffers in a way that anticipates
  how component structures will be allocated within
  them, to maintain correct alignment.
* Added --dhcp-option DISABLE-NBT to disable NetBIOS
  over TCP (Jan Just Keijser).
* Added --http-proxy-option directive for controlling
  miscellaneous HTTP proxy options.
* Management state will no longer transition to "WAIT"
  during TLS renegotiations.

2004.12.16 -- Version 2.0-rc5

* The --client-config-dir option will now try to open
  a default file called "DEFAULT" if no file matching
  the common name of the incoming client was found.
* The --client-connect script/plugin can now veto client
  authentication by returning a failure code.
* The --learn-address script/plugin can now prevent a
  client-instance/address association from being learned
  by returning a failure code.
* Changed RPM group in .spec file to Applications/Internet.

2004.12.14 -- Version 2.0-rc4

* SuSE only -- Fixed interaction between openvpn.spec and
  suse/openvpn.init where the .spec file was writing the
  OpenVPN binary to a different location than where the
  .init script was referencing it (Stefan Engel).
* Solaris only -- Split Solaris ifconfig command into two
  parts (Jan Just Keijser).
* Some cleanup in add_option().
* Better error checking on input dotted quad IP addresses.
* Verify that --push argument is quoted, if there is
  more than one.
* More miscellaneous option sanity checks.

2004.12.13 -- Version 2.0-rc3

* On Windows, when --log or --log-append is used,
  save the original stderr for username and password
  prompts.
* Fixed a bug introduced in the late 2.0 betas where
  if a "verb" parameter >= 16 was used, it would be
  ignored and the actual verb level would remain at 1.
* Fixed a bug mostly seen on OS X where --management-hold
  or --management-query-passwords would cause the management
  interface to be unresponsive to incoming client connections.
* Trigger an options error if one of the management-modifying
  options is used without "management" itself.

2004.12.12 -- Version 2.0-rc2

* Amplified warnings in documentation about possible
  man-in-the-middle attack when clients do not properly
  verify server certificate.  Changes to easy-rsa README,
  FAQ, HOWTO, man page, and sample client config file.
* Added a warning message if --tls-client or --client
  is used without also specifying one of either
  --ns-cert-type, --tls-remote, or --tls-verify.
* status_open() fixes for MSVC builds (Blaine Fleming).
* Fix attempt of "ntlm.c:55: error: `des_cblock' undeclared"
  compiler error which has been reported on some platforms.
* The openvpn.spec file for rpmbuild has several
  new build-time options.  See comments in the file.
* Plugins are now built and packaged in the RPM and
  will be saved in /usr/share/openvpn/plugin/lib.
* Added --management-hold directive to start OpenVPN
  in a hibernating state until released by the
  management interface.  Also added "hold" command
  to the management interface.

2004.12.07 -- Version 2.0-rc1

* openvpn.spec workaround for SuSE confusion regarding
  /etc/init.d vs. /etc/rc.d/init.d (Stefan Engel).

2004.12.05 -- Version 2.0-beta20

* The ability to read --askpass and --auth-user-pass
  passwords from a file has been disabled by default.
  To re-enable, use ./configure --enable-password-save.
* Added additional pre-connected states to management
  interface.  See management/management-notes.txt
  for more info.
* State history is now recorded by the management
  interface, and the "state" command now works like
  the log or echo commands.
* State history and real-time state change notifications
  are now prepended with an integer unix timestamp.
* Added --http-proxy-timeout option, previously
  the timeout was hardcoded to 5 seconds.

2004.12.02 -- Version 2.0-beta19

* Fixed bug in management interface line termination
  where output lines incorrectly contained a \00 char
  after the customary \0d \0a.
* Fixed bug introduced in beta18 where Windows version
  would segfault on options errors.
* Fixed bug in management interface where an empty
  quoted string ("") entered as a parameter would cause
  a segfault.
* Fixed bug where --resolv-retry was not working
  properly with multiple --remote hosts.
* Added additional ./configure options to reduce
  executable size for embedded applications.
  See ./configure --help.

2004.11.28 -- Version 2.0-beta18

* Added management interface.  See new --management-*
  options or the full management interface documentation
  in management/management-notes.txt in the tarball.
  Management interface inclusion can be disabled by
  ./configure --disable-management.
* Added two new plugin modules: auth-pam and down-root.
  Auth-pam supports pam-based authentication using a
  split privilege execution model, while down-root enables
  a down script to be executed with root privileges, even
  when --user/--group is used to drop root privileges.
  See the plugin directory in the tarball for READMEs,
  source code, and Makefiles.
* Plugin developers should note that some changes were
  made to the plugin interface since beta17.  See
  openvpn-plugin.h for details.
  Plugin interface inclusion can be disabled with
  ./configure --disable-plugins
* Added easy-rsa/build-key-server script which will
  build a certificate with with nsCertType=server.
* Added --ns-cert-type option for verification
  of nsCertType field in peer certificate.
* If --fragment n is specified and --mssfix is specified
  without a parameter, default --mssfix to n.  This restores
  the 1.6 behavior when using --mssfix without a parameter.
* Fixed SSL context initialization bug introduced in beta14
  where this error might occur on restarts: "Cannot load
  certificate chain ... PEM_read_bio:no start line".

2004.11.11 -- Version 2.0-beta17

* Changed default port number to 1194 per IANA official
  port number assignment.
* Added --plugin directive which allows compiled
  modules to intercept script callbacks.  See
  plugin folder in tarball for more info.
* Fixed bug introduced in beta12 where --key-method 1
  authentications which should have succeeded would fail.
* Ignore SIGUSR1 during DNS resolution.
* Added SuSE support to openvpn.spec (Umberto Nicoletti).
* Fixed --cryptoapicert SUBJ: parsing bug (Peter 'Luna'
  Runestig).

2004.11.07 -- Version 2.0-beta16

* Modified sample-scripts/auth-pam.pl to get username
  and password from OpenVPN via a file rather than
  via environmental variables.
* Added bytes_sent and bytes_received environmental
  variables to be set prior to client-disconnect script.
* Changed client virtual IP derivation precedence:
  (1) use --ifconfig-push directive from --client-connect
  script, (2) use --ifconfig-push directive from
  --client-config-dir, and (3) use --ifconfig-pool
  address.
* If a --client-config-dir file specifies --ifconfig-push,
  it will be visible to the --client-connect-script in
  the ifconfig_pool_remote_ip environmental variable.
* For tun-style tunnels, the ifconfig_pool_local_ip
  environmental variable will be set, while for
  tap-style tunnels, the ifconfig_pool_netmask variable
  will be set.
* Added intelligence to autoconf script to test
  compiler for the accepted form of zero-length arrays.
* Fixed a bug introduced in beta12 where --ip-win32
  netsh would fail if --dev-node was not explicitly
  specified.
* --ip-win32 netsh will now work on hidden adapters.
* Fix attempt of "Assertion failed at crypto.c:149".
  This assertion has also been reported on 1.x with a
  slightly different line number.  The fix is twofold:
  (1) In previous releases, --mtu-test may trigger this
  assertion -- this bug has been fixed.  (2) If something
  else causes the assertion to be thrown, don't panic,
  just output a nonfatal warning to the log and drop
  the packet which generated the error.
* Support TAP interfaces on Mac OS X (Waldemar Brodkorb).
* Added --echo directive.
* Added --auth-nocache directive.

2004.10.28 -- Version 2.0-beta15

* Changed environmental variable character classes
  so that names must consist of alphanumeric or
  underbar chars and values must consist of printable
  characters.  Illegal chars will be deleted.
  Versions prior to 2.0-beta12 were more restrictive
  and would map spaces to '.'.
* On Windows, when the TAP adapter fails to
  initialize with the correct IP address, output
  "Initialization Sequence Completed with Errors"
  to the console or log file.
* Added a warning when user/group/chroot is used
  without persist-tun and persist-key.
* Added cryptoapi.[ch] to tarball and source zip.
* --tls-remote option now works with common name
  prefixes as well as with the full X509 subject
  string.  This is a useful alternative to using
  a CRL on the client.
* common names associated with a static
  --ifconfig-push setting will no longer leave
  any state in the --ifconfig-pool-persist file.
* Hard TLS errors (TLS handshake failed) will now
  trigger either a SIGUSR1 signal by default
  or SIGTERM (if --tls-exit is specified).  In TCP
  mode, all TLS errors are considered to be hard.
  In server mode, the signal will be local to the
  client instance.
* Added method parameter to --auth-user-pass-verify
  directive to select whether username/password
  is passed to script via environment or a temporary
  file.
* Added --status-version option to control format
  of --status file.  The --mode server
  --status-version 2 format now includes a line
  type token, the virtual IP address is shown
  in the client list (even in --dev tap mode),
  and the integer time_t value is shown anywhere
  an ascii-formatted time/date is also shown.
* Added --remap-usr1 directive which can be used
  to control whether internally or externally
  generated SIGUSR1 signals are remapped to
  SIGHUP (restart without persisting state) or
  SIGTERM (exit).
* When running as a Windows service (using
  --service option), check the exit event before
  and after reading one line of input from
  stdin, when reading username/password info.
* For developers: Extended the --gremlin function
  to better stress-test the new 2.0 features,
  added Valgrind support on Linux and Dmalloc
  support on Windows.

2004.10.19 -- Version 2.0-beta14

* Fixed a bug introduced in Beta12 that would occur
  if you use a --client-connect script without also
  defining --tmp-dir.
* Fixed a bug introduced in Beta12 where a learn-address
  script might segfault on the delete method.
* Added Crypto API support in Windows version via
  the --cryptoapicert option (Peter 'Luna' Runestig).

2004.10.18 -- Version 2.0-beta13

* Fixed an issue introduced in Beta12 where the private
  key password would not be prompted for unless --askpass
  was explicitly specified in the config.

2004.10.17 -- Version 2.0-beta12

* Added support for username/password-based authentication.
  Clients can now authentication themselves with the server
  using either a certificate, a username/password, or both.
  New directives: --auth-user-pass, --auth-user-pass-verify,
  --client-cert-not-required, and --username-as-common-name.
* Added NTLM proxy patch (William Preston).
* Added --ifconfig-pool-linear server flag to allocate
  individual tun addresses for clients rather than /30
  subnets (won't work with Windows clients).
* Modified --http-proxy code to cache username/password
  across restarts.
* Modified --http-proxy code to read username/password
  from the console when the auth file is given as "stdin".
* Modified --askpass to take an optional filename argument.
* --persist-tun and --persist-key now work in client mode
  and can be pushed to clients as well.
* Added --ifconfig-pool-persist directive, to maintain
  ifconfig-pool info in a file which is persistent across
  daemon instantiations.
* --user and --group privilege downgrades as well as
  --chroot now also work in client mode (the
  dowgrade/chroot will be delayed until the initialization
  sequence is completed).
* Added --show-engines standalone directive to show
  available OpenSSL crypto accelerator engine support.
* --engine directive now accepts an optional engine-ID
  parameter to control which engine is used.
* "Connection reset, restarting" log message now shows
  which client is being reset.
* Added --dhcp-pre-release directive in Windows version.
* Second parm to --ip-win32 can be "default", e.g.
  --ip-win32 dynamic default 60.
* Fixed documentation bug regarding environmental
  variable settings for --ifconfig-pool IP addresses.
  The correct environmental variable names are:
  ifconfig_pool_local_ip and ifconfig_pool_remote_ip.
* ifconfig_pool_local_ip and ifconfig_pool_remote_ip
  environmental variables are now passed to the
  client-disconnect script.
* In server mode, environmental variables are now scoped
  according to the client they are associated with,
  to solve the problem of "crosstalk" between different
  client's environmental variable sets.
* Added --down-pre flag to cause --down script to be
  called before TUN/TAP close (rather than after).
* Added --tls-exit flag which will cause OpenVPN
  to exit on any TLS errors.
* Don't push a route to a client if it exactly
  matches an iroute (this lets you push routes to
  all clients, and OpenVPN will automatically remove
  the route from the route push list only for that client
  which the route actually belongs to).
* Made '--resolv-retry infinite' the default.
  --resolv-retry can be disabled by using a parameter of 0.
* For clients which plan to pull config info from server,
  set an initial default ping-restart of 60 seconds.
* Optimized mute code to lessen the load on the processor
  when messages are being muted at a higher frequency.
* Made route log messages non-mutable.
* Silence the Linux "No buffer space available" message.
* Added miscellaneous additional option sanity checks.
* Added Windows version of easy-rsa scripts in
  easy-rsa/Windows directory (Andrew J. Richardson).
* Added NetBSD route patch (Ed Ravin).
* Added OpenBSD patch for TAP + --redirect-gateway
  (Waldemar Brodkorb).
* Directives which prompt for a username and/or password
  will now work with --daemon (OpenVPN will prompt
  before forking).
* Warn if CRL is from a different issuer than the
  issuer of the peer certificate (Bernhard Weisshuhn).
* Changed init script chkconfig parameters to start
  OpenVPN daemon(s) before NFS.
* Bug fix attempt of "too many I/O wait events" which occurs
  on OSes which prefer select() over poll() such as Mac OS X.
* Added --ccd-exclusive flag.  This flag will require, as a
  condition of authentication, that a connecting client has
  a --client-config-dir file.
* TAP-Win32 open code will attempt to open a free adapter
  if --dev-node is not specified (Mathias Sundman).
* Resequenced --nice and --chroot ordering so that --nice
  occurs first.
* Added --suppress-timestamps flag (Charles Duffy).
* Source code changes to allow compilation by MSVC
  (Peter 'Luna' Runestig).
* Added experimental --fast-io flag which optimizes
  TUN/TAP/UDP writes on non-Windows systems.

2004.08.18 -- Version 2.0-beta11

* Added --server, --server-bridge, --client, and
  --keepalive helper directives.  See client.conf
  and server.conf in sample-config-files for sample
  configurations which use the new directives.
* On Windows, added --route-method to control
  whether IP Helper API or route.exe is used
  to add/delete routes.
* On Windows, added a second parameter to
  --route-delay to control the maximum time period
  to wait for the TAP-Win32 adapter to come up
  before adding routes.
* Fixed bug in Windows version where configurations
  which omit --ifconfig might fail to recognize when
  the TAP adapter is up.
* Proxy connection failures will now retry according
  to the --connect-retry parameter.
* Fixed --dev null handling on Windows so that TLS
  loopback test described in INSTALL file works
  correctly on Windows.
* Added "Initialization Sequence Completed" message
  after all initialization steps have been completed
  and the VPN can be considered "up".
* Better sanity-checking on --ifconfig-pool parameters.
* Added --tcp-queue-limit option to control
  TUN/TAP -> TCP socket overflow.
* --ifconfig-nowarn flag will now silence general
  warnings about possible --ifconfig address
  conflicts, including the warning about --ifconfig
  and --remote addresses being in same /24 subnet.
* Fixed case where server mode did not correctly
  identify certain types of ethernet multicast packets
  (Marcel de Kogel).
* Added --explicit-exit-notify option (experimental).

2004.08.02 -- Version 2.0-beta10

* Fixed possible reference after free of option strings
  after a restart, bug was introduced in beta8.
* Fixed segfault at route.c:919 in the beta9
  Windows version that was being caused by indirection
  through a NULL pointer.
* Mistakenly built debug version of TAP-Win32 driver
  for beta9.  Beta10 has correct release build.

2004.07.30 -- Version 2.0-beta9

* Fixed --route issue on Windows that was introduced with
  the new beta8 route implementation based on the
  IP Helper API.

2004.07.27 -- Version 2.0-beta8

* Added TCP support in server mode.
* Added PKCS #12 support (Mathias Sundman).
* Added patch to make revoke-crt and make-crl work
  seamlessly within the easy-rsa environment (Jan Kiszka).
* Modified --mode server ethernet bridge code to forward
  special IEEE 802.1d MAC Groups, i.e. 01:80:C2:XX:XX:XX.
* Added --dhcp-renew and --dhcp-release flags to Windows
  version.  Normally DHCP renewal and release on the TAP
  adapter occurs automatically under Windows, however
  if you set the TAP-Win32 adapter Media Status property
  to "Always Connected", you may need these flags.
* Added --show-net standalone flag to Windows version to
  show OpenVPN's view of the system adapter and routing
  tables.
* Added --show-net-up flag to Windows version to output
  the system routing table and network adapter list to
  the log file after the TAP-Win32 adapter has been brought
  up and any routes have been added.
* Modified Windows version to add routes using the IP Helper
  API rather than by calling route.exe.
* Fixed bug where --route-up script was not being called
  if no --route options were specified.
* Added --mute-replay-warnings to suppress packet replay
  warnings.  This is a common false alarm on WiFi nets.
* Added "def1" flag to --redirect-gateway option to override
  the default gateway by using 0.0.0.0/1 and 128.0.0.0/1
  rather than 0.0.0.0/0.  This has the benefit of overriding
  but not wiping out the original default gateway.
  (Thanks to Jim Carter for pointing out this idea).
* You can now run OpenVPN with a single config file argument.
  For example, you can now say "openvpn config.conf"
  rather than "openvpn --config config.conf".
* On Windows, made --route and --route-delay more adaptive
  with respect to waiting for interfaces referenced by the
  route destination to come up.  Routes added by --route
  should now be added as soon as the interface comes up,
  rather than after an obligatory 10 second delay.  The
  way this works internally is that --route-delay now
  defaults to 0 on Windows.  Previous versions would
  wait for --route-delay seconds then add the routes.
  This version will wait --route-delay seconds and then
  test the routing table at one second intervals for the
  next 30 seconds and will not add the routes until they
  can be added without errors.
* On Windows, don't setsockopt SO_SNDBUF or SO_RCVBUF by
  default on TCP/UDP socket in light of reports that this
  action can have undesirable global side effects on the
  MTU settings of other adapters.  These parameters can
  still be set, but you need to explicitly specify
  --sndbuf and/or --rcvbuf.
* Added --max-clients option to limit the maximum number
  of simultaneously connected clients in server mode.
* Added error message to illuminate shell escape gotcha when
  single backslashes are used in Windows path names.
* Added optional netmask parm to --ifconfig-pool.
* Fixed bug where http-proxy connect retry attempts were
  incorrectly going to the remote OpenVPN server,
  not to the HTTP proxy server.

2004.06.29 -- Version 2.0-beta7

* Fixed bug in link_socket_verify_incoming_addr() which
  under certain circumstances could have caused --float
  behavior even if --float was not specified.
* --tls-auth option now works with --mode server.
  All clients and the server should use the same
  --tls-auth key when operating in client/server mode.
* Added --engine option to make use of OpenSSL-supported
  crypto acceleration hardware.
* Fixed some high verbosity print format size issues
  in event.c for 64 bit platforms (Janne Johansson).
* Made failure to open --log or --log-append file
  a non-fatal error.

2004.06.23 -- Version 2.0-beta6

* Fixed Windows installer to intelligently put
  up a reboot dialog only if tapinstall tells
  us that it's really necessary.
* Fixed "Assertion failed at fragment.c:309"
  bug when --mode server and --fragment are used
  together.
* Ignore HUP, USR1, and USR2 signals during
  initialization.  Prior versions would abort.
* Fixed bug on OS X: "Assertion failed at event.c:406".
* Added --service option to Windows version, for use
  when OpenVPN is being programmatically instantiated
  by another process (see man page for info).
* --log and --log-append options now work on Windows.
* Update OpenBSD INSTALL notes (Janne Johansson).
* Enable multicast on tun interface when running on
  OpenBSD (Pavlin Radoslavov).
* Fixed recent --test-crypto breakage, where options
  such as --cipher were not being parsed correctly.
* Modified options compatibility string by removing
  ifconfig substring if it is empty.  Incremented
  options compatibility string version number to 4.
* Fixed typo in --tls-timeout option parsing
  (Mikael Lonnroth).

2004.06.13 -- Version 2.0-beta5

* Fixed rare --mode server crash that could occur
  if data was being routed to a client at
  high bandwidth at the precise moment that the
  client instance object on the server was being
  deleted.
* Fixed issue on machines which have epoll.h and
  the epoll_create glibc call defined, but which
  don't actually implement epoll in the kernel.
  OpenVPN will now gracefully fall back to the
  poll API in this case.
* Fixed Windows bug which would cause the following
  error in a --mode server --dev tap configuration:
  "resource limit WSA_MAXIMUM_WAIT_EVENTS has been
  exceeded".
* Added CRL (certificate revocation list) management
  scripts to easy-rsa directory (Jon Bendtsen).
* Do a better job of getting the ifconfig component
  of the options consistency check to work correctly
  when --up-delay is used.
* De-inlined some functions which were too complex
  to be inlined anyway with gcc.
* If a --dhcp-option option is pushed to a non-windows
  client, the option will be saved in the client's
  environment before the --up script is called, under
  the name "foreign_option_{n}".
* Added --learn-address script (see man page) which
  allows for firewall access through the VPN to be
  controlled based on the client common name.
* In mode --server mode, when a client connects to
  the server, the server will disconnect any
  still-active clients which use the same common
  name.  Use --duplicate-cn flag to revert to
  previous behavior of allowing multiple clients
  to concurrently connect with the same common name.

2004.06.08 -- Version 2.0-beta4

* Fixed issue with beta3 where Win32 service wrapper
  was keying off of old TAP HWID as a dependency.  To
  ensure that the new service wrapper is correctly
  installed, the Windows install script will uninstall
  the old wrapper before installing the new one,
  causing a reset of service properties.
* Fixed permissions issue on --status output file,
  with default access permissions of owner read/write
  only (default permissions can be changed of course with
  chmod).

2004.06.05 -- Version 2.0-beta3

* More changes to TAP-Win32 driver's INF file which
  affects the placement of the driver in the Windows
  device namespace.  This is done to work around an
  apparent bug in Windows when short HWIDs are used,
  and will also ease the upgrade from 1.x to 2.0 by
  reducing the chances that a reboot will be needed
  on upgrade.  Like beta2, this upgrade will
  delete existing TAP-Win32 interfaces, and reinstall
  a single new interface with default properties.
* Major rewrite of I/O event wait layer in the style
  of libevent.  This is a precursor to TCP support
  in --mode server.
* New feature: --status.  Outputs a SIGUSR2-like
  status summary to a given file, updated once
  per n seconds.  The status file is comma delimited
  for easy machine parsing.
* --ifconfig-pool now remembers common names and
  will try to assign a consistent IP to a given
  common name.  Still to do: persist --ifconfig-pool
  memory across restarts by saving state in file.
* Fixed bug in event timer queue which could cause
  recurring timer events such as --ping to not
  correctly schedule again after firing.  This in
  turn would cause spurrious ping restarts and possible
  connection outages.  Thanks to Denis Vlasenko for
  tracking this down.
* Possible fix to reported bug where --daemon argument
  was not printing to syslog correctly after restart.
* Fixed bug where pulling --route or --dhcp-option
  directives from a server would problematically
  interact with --persist-tun on the client.
* Updated contrib/multilevel-init.patch (Farkas Levente).
* Added RPM build option to .spec and .spec.in files
  to optionally disable LZO inclusion (Ian Pilcher).
* The latest MingW runtime and headers define
  'ssize_t', so a patch is needed (Gisle Vanem).

2004.05.14 -- Version 2.0-beta2

* Fixed signal handling bug in --mode server, where
  SIGHUP and SIGUSR1 were treated as SIGTERM.
* Changed the TAP-Win32 HWID from "TAP" to "TAPDEV".
  Apparently the larger string may work around
  a problem where the TAP adapter is sometimes missing
  from the network connections panel, especially under
  XP SP2. Also note that installing this upgrade will
  uninstall any pre-existing TAP-Win32 adapters, and then
  install a single new adapter, meaning that old adapter
  properties will be lost.  Thanks to Md5Chap for solving
  this one.
* For --mode server --dev tap, the options --ifconfig and
  --ifconfig-pool are now optional.  This allows address
  assignment via DHCP or use of a TAP VPN without
  IP support, as has always been possible with 1.x.
* Fixed bug where --ifconfig may not work correctly on
  Linux 2.2.
* Added 'local' flag to --redirect-gateway for use on
  networks where both OpenVPN daemons are connected
  to a shared subnet, such as wireless.

2004.05.09 -- Version 2.0-beta1

* Unchanged from test29 except for version number
  upgrade.

2004.05.08 -- Version 2.0-test29

* Modified --dev-node on Windows to accept a TAP-Win32
  GUID name.  In addition, --show-adapters will now
  display the high-level name and GUID of each adapter.
  This is an attempt to work around an issue in Windows
  where sometimes the TAP-Win32 adapter installs correctly
  but has no icon in the network connections control
  panel.  In such cases, being able to specify
  --dev-node {TAP-GUID} can work around the missing icon.

2004.05.07 -- Version 2.0-test28

* Fixed bug which could cause segfault on program
  shutdown if --route and --persist-tun are used
  together.

2004.05.06 -- Version 2.0-test27

* Fixed bug in close_instance() which might cause
  memory to be accessed after it had already been freed.
* Fixed bug in verify_callback() that might have
  caused uninitialized data to be referenced.
* --iroute now allows full CIDR subnet routing.
* In "--mode server --dev tun" usage, source addresses
  on VPN packets coming from a particular client must
  be associated with that client in the OpenVPN internal
  routing table.

2004.04.28 -- Version 2.0-test26

* Optimized broadcast path in multi-client mode.
* Added socket buffer size options --rcvbuf & --sndbuf.
* Configure Linux tun/tap driver to use a more sensible
  txqueuelen default.  Also allow explicit setting
  via --txqueuelen option (Harald Roelle).
* The --remote option now allows the port number
  to be specified as the second parameter.  If
  unspecified, the port number defaults to the
  --rport value.
* Multiple --remote options on the client can now be
  specified for load balancing and failover.  The
  --remote-random flag can be used to initially randomize
  the --remote list for basic load balancing.
* If a remote DNS name resolves to multiple DNS addresses,
  one will be chosen by random as a kind of basic
  load-balancing feature if --remote-random is used.
* Added --connect-freq option to control maximum
  new connection frequency in multi-client mode.
* In multi-client mode, all syslog messages associated
  with a specific client now include a client-ID prefix.
* For Windows, use a gettimeofday() function based
  on QueryPerformanceCounter (Derek Burdick).
* Fixed bug in interaction between --key-method 2
  and DES ciphers, where dynamic keys would be generated
  with bad parity and then be rejected.

2004.04.17 -- Version 2.0-test24

* Reworked multi-client broadcast handling.

2004.04.13 -- Version 2.0-test23

* Fixed bug in --dev tun --client-to-client routing.
* Fixed a potential deadlock in --pull.
* Fixed a problem with select() usage which could
  cause a repeating sequence of "select : Invalid
  argument (code=22)"

2004.04.11 -- Version 2.0-test22

* Fixed bug where --mode server + --daemon was
  prematurely closing syslog connection.
* Added support for --redirect-gateway on Mac OS X
  (Jeremy Apple).
* Minor changes to TAP-Win32 driver based on feedback
  from the NDISTest tool.

2004.04.11 -- Version 2.0-test21

* Optimizations in multi-client server event loop.

2004.04.10 -- Version 2.0-test20

* --mode server capability now works with either tun
  or tap interfaces.  When used with tap interfaces,
  OpenVPN will internally bridge all client tap
  interfaces with the server tap interface.
* Connecting clients can now have a client-specific
  configuration on the server, based on the client
  common name embedded in the client certificate.
  See --client-config-dir and --client-connect.
  These options can be used to configure client-specific
  routes.
* Added an option --client-to-client that enables
  internal client-to-client routing or bridging.
  Otherwise, clients will only "see" the server,
  not other connected clients.
* Fixed bug in route scheduling which would have caused
  --mode server to not work on Windows in test18
  and test19 with the sample config file.
* Man page is up to date with all new options.
* OpenVPN 2.0 release notes on web site updated
  with tap-style tunnel examples.

2004.04.02 -- Version 2.0-test19

* Fixed bug where routes pushed from server were
  not working correctly on Windows clients.
* Added Mac OS X route patch (Jeremy Apple).

2004.03.30 -- Version 2.0-test18

* Minor fixes + Windows self-install modified
  to use OpenSSL 0.9.7d.

2004.03.29 -- Version 2.0-test17

* Fixed some bugs related to instance timeout and deletion.

* Implemented hash-table lookup of client instances
  based either on remote UDP address/port or remote
  ifconfig endpoint.
* Implemented a randomized binary tree based
  scheduler for scalably scheduling a large number
  of client instance events.  Uses the treap
  data structure and node rotation algorithm
  to keep the tree balanced.
* Initial implementation of ifconfig-pool.
* Made --key-method 2 the default.

2004.03.20 -- Version 2.0-test14

* Added the key multi-client UDP server options,
  --mode, --push, --pull, and --ifconfig-pool.
* Revamped GC (garbage collection) code to not rely
  on any global data.
* Modifications to thread.[ch] to allow a more
  flexible thread model.

2004.03.16 -- Version 2.0-test11

* Moved all timer code to interval.h, added new file
  interval.c.
* Fixed missing include.

2004.03.16 -- Version 2.0-test10

* More TAP-Win32 fixes.
* Initial debugging and testing of multi.[ch].

2004.03.14 -- Version 2.0-test9

* Branch merge with 1.6-rc3
* More point-to-multipoint work in multi.[ch].
* Major TAP-Win32 driver restructuring to use
  NdisMRegisterDevice instead of
  IoCreateDevice/IoCreateSymbolicLink.
* Changed TAP-Win32 symbolic links to use \DosDevices\Global\
  pathname prefix.
* In the majority of cases, TAP-Win32 should now be
  able to install and uninstall on Win2K without requiring
  a reboot.

  called from forward.c.
* Moved verify statics from ssl.c into struct tls_session.
* Wrote multi.[ch] to handle top level of point-to-multipoint
  mode.
* Wrote some code to allow a struct link_socket in a child context
  to be slaved to the parent context.
* Broke up packet read and process functions in forward.c
  (from socket or tuntap) into separate functions for read
  and process, so that point-to-point and point-to-multipoint can
  share the same code.
* Expand TLS control channel to allow the passing of configuration
  commands.
* Wrote mroute.[ch] to handle internal packet routing for
  point-to-multipoint mode.

2004.02.22 -- Version 2.0-test3

* Initial work on UDP multi-client server.
* Branch merge of 1.6-beta7

2004.02.14 -- Version 2.0-test2

* Refactorization of openvpn.c into openvpn.[ch]
  init.[ch] forward.[ch] forward-inline.h
  occ.[ch] occ-inline.h  ping.[ch] ping-inline.h
  sig.[ch].  Created a master per-tunnel
  struct context in openvpn.h.
* Branch merge of 1.6-beta6.2

2003.11.06 -- Version 2.0-test1

* Initial testbed for 2.0.

2004.05.09 -- Version 1.6.0

* Unchanged from 1.6-rc4 except for version number
  upgrade.

2004.04.01 -- Version 1.6-rc4

* Made minor customizations to devcon and
  renamed as tapinstall.exe for Windows version.
* Fixed "storage size of `iv' isn't known" build
  problem on FreeBSD.
* OpenSSL 0.9.7d bundled with Windows self-install.

2004.03.13 -- Version 1.6-rc3

* Minor Windows fixes for --ip-win32 dynamic, relating to
  the way the TAP-Win32 driver responds to a DHCP request
  from the Windows DHCP client.
* The net_gateway environmental variable wasn't being
  set correctly for called scripts (Paul Zuber).
* Added code to determine the default gateway on FreeBSD,
  allowing the --redirect-gateway option to work
  (Juan Rodriguez Hervella).

2004.03.04 -- Version 1.6-rc2

* Fixed bug in Windows version where the NetBIOS node-type
  DHCP option might have been passed even if it was not
  specified.
* Fixed bug in Windows version introduced in 1.6-rc1, where
  DHCP timeout would be set to 0 seconds if --ifconfig option
  was used and --ip-win32 option was not explicitly specified.
* Added some new --dhcp-option types for Windows version.

2004.03.02 -- Version 1.6-rc1

* For Windows, make "--ip-win32 dynamic" the default.
* For Windows, make "--route-delay 10" the default
  unless --ip-win32 dynamic is not used or --route-delay
  is explicitly specified.
* L_TLS mutex could have been left in a locked state
  for certain kinds of TLS errors.

2004.02.22 -- Version 1.6-beta7

* Allow scheduling priority increase (--nice) together
  with UID/GID downgrade (--user/--group).
* Code that causes SIGUSR1 restart on TLS errors in TCP
  mode was not activated in pthread builds.
* Save the certificate serial number in an environmental
  variable called tls_serial_{n} prior to calling the
  --tls-verify script.  n is the current cert chain level.
* Added NetBSD IPv6 tunnel capability (also requires
  a kernel patch) (Horst Laschinsky).
* Fixed bug in checking the return value of the nice()
  function (Ian Pilcher).
* Bug fix in new FreeBSD IPv6 over TUN code which was
  originally added in 1.6-beta5 (Nathanael Rensen).
* More Socks5 fixes -- extended the struct frame
  infrastructure to accomodate proxy-based encapsulation
  overhead.
* Added --dhcp-option to Windows version for setting
  adapter properties such as WINS & DNS servers.
* Use a default route-delay of 5 seconds when
  --ip-win32 dynamic is specified (only applicable when
  --route-delay is not explicitly specified).
* Added "log_append" registry variable to control
  whether the OpenVPN service wrapper on Windows
  opens log files in append (log_append="1") or
  truncate (log_append="0") mode.  The default
  is truncate.

2004.02.05 -- Version 1.6-beta6

* UDP over Socks5 fix to accomodate Socks5 encapsulation
  overhead (Christof Meerwald).
* Minor --ip-win32 dynamic tweaks (use long lease time,
  invalidate existing lease with DHCPNAK).

2004.02.01 -- Version 1.6-beta5

* Added Socks5 proxy support (Christof Meerwald).
* IPv6 tun support for FreeBSD (Thomas Glanzmann).
* Special TAP-Win32 debug mode for Windows self-install that was
  enabled in beta4 is now turned off.
* Added some new Solaris notes to INSTALL (Koen Maris).
* More work on --ip-win32 dynamic.

2004.01.27 -- Version 1.6-beta4

* For this beta, the Windows self-install is a debug version
  and will run slower -- use only for testing.
* Reverted the --ip-win32 default back to 'ipapi'
  from 'dynamic'.
* Added the offset parameter to '--ip-win32 dynamic' which
  can be used to control the address of the masqueraded
  DHCP server which replies to Windows DHCP requests.
* Added a wait/nowait option to --inetd (nowait can only
  be used with TCP sockets, TLS authentication, and over
  a bridged configuration -- see FAQ for more info)
  (Stefan `Sec` Zehl).
* Added a build-time capability where TAP-Win32 driver
  debug messages can be output by OpenVPN at --verb 6
  or higher.

2004.01.20 -- Version 1.6-beta2

* Added ./configure --enable-iproute2 flag which
  uses iproute2 instead of route + ifconfig --
  this is necessary for the LEAF Linux distro
  (Martin Hejl).
* Added renewal-time and rebind-time to set of
  DHCP options returned by the TAP-Win32 driver when
  "--ip-win32 dynamic" is used.

2004.01.14 -- Version 1.6-beta1

* Fixed --proxy bug that sometimes caused plaintext
  control info generated by the proxy prior to http
  CONNECT method establishment to be incorrectly
  parsed as OpenVPN data.
* For Windows version, implemented the
  "--ip-win32 dynamic" method and made it the default.
  This method sets the TAP-Win32 adapter IP address
  and netmask by replying to the kernel's DHCP queries.
  See the man page for more detailed info.
* Added --connect-retry parameter which controls
  the time interval (in seconds) between connect()
  retries when --proto tcp-client is used.  Previously,
  this value was hardcoded to 5 seconds, and still
  defaults as such.
* --resolv-retry can now be used with a parameter
  of "infinite" to retry indefinitely.
* Added SSL_CTX_use_certificate_chain_file() to ssl.c
  for support of multi-level certificate chains
  (Sten Kalenda).
* Fixed --tls-auth incompatibility with 1.4.x and earlier
  versions of OpenVPN when the passphrase file is an
  OpenVPN static key file (as generated by --genkey).
* Added shell-escape support in config files using
  the backslash character ("\") so that (for example)
  double quotes can be passed to the shell.
* Added "contrib" subdirectory on tarball, source zip,
  and CVS containing user-submitted contributions.
* Added an optional patch to the Redhat init script to
  allow the configuration file directory to be a
  multi-level directory hierarchy (Farkas Levente).
  See contrib/multilevel-init.patch
* Added some scripts and documentation on using
  Linux "fwmark" iptables rules to enable
  fine-grained routing control over the VPN
  (Sean Reifschneider, <
 jafo@tummy.com>).
  See contrib/openvpn-fwmarkroute-1.00

2003.11.20 -- Version 1.5.0

* Minor documentation changes.

2003.11.04 -- Version 1.5-beta14

* Fixed build problem with ./configure --disable-ssl
  that was reported on Debian woody.
* Fixed bug where --redirect-gateway could not be used
  together with --resolv-retry.

2003.11.03 -- Version 1.5-beta13

* Added CRL (certificate revocation list) capability using
  --crl-verify option (Stefano Bracalenti).
* Added --replay-window option for variable replay-protection
  window sizes.
* Fixed --fragment bug which might have caused certain large
  packets to be sent unfragmented.
* Modified --secret and --tls-auth to permit different cipher and
  HMAC keys to be used for each data flow direction.  Also
  increased static key file size generated by --genkey from
  1024 to 2048 bits, where 512 bits each are reserved for
  send-HMAC, encrypt, receive-HMAC, and decrypt.  Key file forward
  and backward compatibility is maintained.  See --secret option
  documentation on the man page for more info.
* Added --tls-remote option (Teemu Kiviniemi).
* Fixed --tls-cipher documention regarding correct delimiter
  usage (Teemu Kiviniemi).
* Added --key-method option for selecting alternative data
  channel key negotiation methods.  Method 1 is the default.
  Method 2 has been added (see man page for more info).
* Added French translation of HOWTO to web site
  (Guillaume Lehmann).
* Fixed problem caused by late resolver library load on
  certain platforms when --resolv-retry and --chroot are
  used together (Teemu Kiviniemi).
* In TCP mode, all decryption or TLS errors will abort the current
  connection (this is not done in UDP mode because UDP is
  "connectionless").
* Fixed a TCP client reconnect bug that only occurs on the
  BSDs, where connect() fails with an invalid argument.  This
  bug was partially (but not completely) fixed in beta7.
* Added "route_net_gateway" environmental variable which contains
  the pre-existing default gateway address from the routing table
  (there's no standard API for getting the default gateway, so
  right now this feature only works on Windows or Linux).
* Renamed the "route_default_gateway" enviromental variable to
  "route_vpn_gateway" -- this is the remote VPN endpoint.
* The special keywords vpn_gateway, net_gateway, and remote_host
  can now be used for the network or gateway components of the
  --route option.  See the man page for more info.
* Added the --redirect-gateway option to configure the VPN
  as the default gateway (implemented on Linux and Windows only).
* Added the --http-proxy option with basic authentication
  support for use in TCP client mode.  Successfully tested
  using Squid as the HTTP proxy, with and without authentication.

2003.10.12 -- Version 1.5-beta12

* Fixed Linux-only bug in --mktun and --rmtun which was
  introduced around beta8 or so, which would cause
  an error such as "I don't recognize device tun0 as a
  tun or tap device1".
* Added --ifconfig-nowarn option to disable options
  consistency warnings about --ifconfig parameters.
* Don't allow any kind of sequence number backtracking or
  message reordering when in TCP mode.
* Changed beta naming convention to use '_' (underscore)
  rather than '-' (dash) to pacify rpmbuild.

2003.10.08 -- Version 1.5-beta11

* Modified code in the Windows version which sets the IP address
  and netmask of the TAP-Win32 adapter using the IP Helper API.
  Most of the changes involve better error recovery when
  the IP Helper API returns an error status.  See the
  manual page entry on --ip-win32 for more info.

2003.10.08 -- Version 1.5-beta10

* Added getpass() function for Windows version so that --askpass
  option works correctly (Stefano Bracalenti).
* Added reboot advisory to end of Win32 install script.
* Changed crypto code to use pseudo-random IVs rather than
  carrying forward the IV state from the previous packet.
  This is in response to item 2 in the following document:
  http://www.openssl.org/~bodo/tls-cbc.txt which points
  out weaknesses in TLS's use of the same IV carryforward
  approach.  This change does not break protocol compatibility
  with previous versions of OpenVPN.
* Made a change to the crypto replay protection code to also
  protect against certain kinds of packet reordering attacks.
  This change does not break protocol compatibility with
  previous versions of OpenVPN.
* Added --ip-win32 option to provide several choices for
  setting the IP address on the TAP-Win32 adapter.
* #ifdefed out non-CBC crypto modes by default.
* Added --up-delay option to delay TUN/TAP open and --up script
  execution until after connection establishment.  This option
  replaces the earlier windows-only option --tap-delay.

2003.10.01 -- Version 1.5-beta9

* Fixed --route-noexec bug where option was not parsed correctly.
* Complain if --dev tun is specified without --ifconfig on Windows.
* Fixed bug where TCP connections on windows would sometimes cause
  an assertion failure.
* Added a new flag to TAP-Win32 advanced properties that allows one
  to set the adapter to be always "connected" even when an OpenVPN
  process doesn't have it open.  The default behavior is to report
  a media status of connected only when an OpenVPN process has the
  adapter open.
* Rebuilt the Windows self-install distribution with OpenSSL 0.9.7c
  DLLs in response to an OpenSSL security advisory.

2003.09.30 -- Version 1.5-beta8

* Extended the --ifconfig option to work on tap devices as well
  as tun devices.
* Implemented the --ifconfig option for Windows, by calling the
  netsh tool.
* By default, do an "arp -d *" on Windows after TAP-Win32 open to
  refresh the MAC cache.  This behaviour can be disabled with
  --no-arp-del.
* On Windows, allow the --dev-node parameter (which specifies
  the name of the TAP-Win32 adapter) to be omitted in cases where
  there is a single TAP-Win32 adapter on the system which can be
  assumed to be the default.
* Modified the diagnostic --verb 5 debugging level to print 'R'
  for TCP/UDP read, 'W' for TCP/UDP write, 'r' for TUN/TAP read,
  and 'w' for TUN/TAP write.
* Conditionalize OpenBSD read_tun and write_tun based on tun or tap
  mode.
* Added IPv6 tun support to OpenBSD (Thomas Glanzmann).
* Make the --enable-mtu-dynamic ./configure option enabled by
  default.
* Deprecated the --mtu-dynamic run-time option, in favor of
  --fragment.
* DNS names can now be used as --ifconfig parameters.
* Significant work on TAP-Win32 driver to bring up to SMP standards.
* On Windows, fixed dangling IRP problem if TAP-Win32 driver is
  unloaded or disabled, while a user-space process has it open.
* On Windows, if --tun-mtu is not specified, it will be read from
  the TAP-Win32 driver via ioctl.
* On Windows, added TAP-Win32 driver status info to "F2" keyboard
  signal (only when run from a console window).
* Added --mssfix option to control TCP MSS size (YANO Hirokuni).
* Renamed --mtu-dynamic option to --fragment to more accurately
  reflect its function.  Fragment accepts a single parameter which
  is the upper limit on acceptable UDP packet size.
* Changed default --tun-mtu-extra parameter to 32 from 64.
* Eliminated reference to malloc.o in configure.ac.
* Added tun device emulation to the TAP-Win32 driver.
* Added --route and related options.
* Added init script for SuSE Linux (Frank Plohmann).
* Extended option consistency check between peers to function
  in all crypto modes, including static-key and cleartext modes.
  Previously only TLS mode was supported.  Disable with
  --disable-occ.
* Overall, increased the amount of configuration option sanity
  checking, especially of networking parameters.
* Added --mtu-test option for empirical MTU measurement.
* Added Windows-only option --tap-delay to not set the TAP-Win32
  adapter media state to 'connected' until TCP/UDP connection
  establishment with peer.
* Slightly modified --route/--route-delay semantics so that when
  --route is given without --route-delay, routes are added
  immediately after tun/tap device open.  When --route-delay is
  specified, routes will be added n seconds after connection
  initiation, where n is the --route-delay parameter (which
  can be set to 0).
* Made TCP framing error into a non-fatal error that triggers a
  connection reset.

2003.08.28 -- Version 1.5-beta7

* Fixed bug that caused OpenVPN not to respond to exit/restart
  signals when --resolv-retry is used and a local or remote DNS
  name cannot be resolved.
* Exported a series of environmental variables with useful
  info for scripts.  See man page for more info.  Based
  on a suggestion by Anthony Ciaravalo.
* Moved TCP/UDP socket bind to a point in the initialization
  before the --up script gets called.  This is desirable
  because (a) a socket bind failure will happen before
  daemonization, allowing an error status code to be returned
  to the shell and (b) the possibility is eliminated of a
  socket bind failure causing the --up script to be run
  but not the --down script.  This change has a side effect
  that --resolv-retry will no longer work with --local.
* Fixed bug where if an OpenVPN TCP server went down and back
  up again, Solaris or FreeBSD clients would fail to reconnect
  to it.
* Fixed bug that prevented OpenVPN from being run by
  inetd/xinetd in TCP mode.
* Added --log and --log-append options for logging messages to
  a file.
* On Windows, check that the current user is a member of the
  Administrator group before attempting install or uninstall.

2003.08.16 -- Version 1.5-beta6

* Fixed TAP-Win32 driver to properly increment the Rx/Tx count.

2003.08.14 -- Version 1.5-beta5

* Added user-configurability of the TAP-Win32 adapter MTU
  through the adapter advanced properties page.
* Added Windows Service support.
* On Windows, added file association and right-clickability
  for .ovpn files (OpenVPN config files).

2003.08.05 -- Version 1.5-beta4

* Extra refinements and error checking added to Windows
  NSIS install script.

2003.08.05 -- Version 1.5-beta3

* Added md5.h include to crypto.c to fix build problem on
  OpenBSD.
* Created a Win32 installer using NSIS.
* Removed DelService command from TAP-Win32 INF file.  It appears
  to be not necessary and it interfered with the ability to
  uninstall and reinstall the driver without needing to reboot.
* On Windows version, added "addtap" and "deltapall" batch
  files to add and delete TAP-Win32 adapter instances.

2003.07.31 -- Version 1.5-beta2

* Renamed INSTALL.w32 to INSTALL-win32.txt and reformatted
  in Windows ASCII so it's easier to click and view.
* Added postscript and PDF versions of the HOWTO to the web
  site (C R Zamana).
* Merged Michael Clarke's stability patch into TAP-Win32
  driver which appears to fix the suspend/resume driver bug
  and significantly improve driver stability.
* Added Christof Meerwald's Media Status patch to the
  TAP-Win32 driver which shows the TAP adapter to be
  disconnected when OpenVPN is not running.
* Moved socket connect and TCP server listen code to a later
  point in openvpn() function so that the TCP server listen
  state is entered after daemonization.
* Added keyboard shortcuts to simulate signals in the Windows
  version, see the window title bar for descriptions.

2003.07.24 -- Version 1.5-beta1

* Added TCP support via the new --proto option.
* Renamed udp-centric options such as --udp-mtu to
  --link-mtu (old option names preserved for compatibility).
* Ported to Windows 2000 + XP using mingw and a TAP driver
  derived from the Cipe-Win32 project by Damion K. Wilson.
* Added --show-adapters flag for windows version.
* Reworked the SSL/TLS packet acknowledge code to better
  handle certain corner cases.
* Turned off the default enabling of IP forwarding in the
  sample-scripts/openvpn.init script for Redhat.
  Forwarding can be enabled by users in their --up scripts
  or firewall config.
* Added --up-restart option based on suggestion from Sean
  Reifschneider.
* If --dev tap or --dev-type tap is specified, --tun-mtu
  defaults to 1500 and --tun-mtu-extra defaults to 64.
* Enabled --verb 5 debugging mode that prints 'R' and 'W'
  for each packet read or write on the TCP/UDP socket.

2003.08.04 -- Version 1.4.3

* Added md5.h include to crypto.c
  to fix build problem on OpenBSD.

2003.07.15 -- Version 1.4.2

* Removed adaptive bandwidth from
  --mtu-dynamic -- its absence appears
  to work better than its existence (1.4.1.2).
* Minor changes to --shaper to fix long
  retransmit timeouts at low bandwidth
  (1.4.1.2).
* Added LOG_RW flag to openvpn.h for
  debugging (1.4.1.2).
* Silenced spurious configure warnings (1.4.1.2).
* Backed out --dev-name patch, modified --dev
  to offer equivalent functionality (1.4.1.4).
* Added an optional parameter to --daemon and
  --inetd to support the passing of a custom
  program name to the system logger (1.4.1.5).
* Add compiled-in options to the program title
  (1.4.1.5).
* Coded the beginnings of a WIN32 port (1.4.1.5).
* Succeeded in porting to Win32 Mingw environment
  and running loopback tests (1.4.1.6).  Still
  need a kernel driver for full Win32
  functionality.
* Fixed a bug in error.h where
  HAVE_CPP_VARARG_MACRO_GCC was misspelled.
  This would have caused a significant slowdown
  of OpenVPN when built by compilers that
  lack ISO C99 vararg macros (1.4.1.6).
* Created an init script for Gentoo Linux
  in ./gentoo directory (1.4.1.6).

2003.05.15 -- Version 1.4.1

* Modified the Linux 2.4 TUN/TAP open code to
  fall back to the 2.2 TUN/TAP interface if the
  open or ioctl fails.
* Fixed bug when --verb is set to 0 and non-fatal
  socket errors occur, causing 100% CPU utilization.
  Occurs on platorms where
  EXTENDED_SOCKET_ERROR_CAPABILITY is defined,
  such as Linux 2.4.
* Fixed typo in tun.c that was preventing
  OpenBSD build.
* Added --enable-mtu-dynamic configure option
  to enable --mtu-dynamic experimental option.

2003.05.07 -- Version 1.4.0

* Added --replay-persist feature to allow replay
  protection across sessions.
* Fixed bug where --ifconfig could not be used
  with --tun-mtu.
* Added --tun-mtu-extra parameter to deal with
  the situation where a read on a TUN/TAP device
  returns more data than the device's MTU size.
* Fixed bug where some IPv6 support code for
  Linux was not being properly ifdefed out for
  Linux 2.2, causing compile errors.
* Added OPENVPN_EXIT_STATUS_x codes to
  openvpn.h to control which status value
  openvpn returns to its caller (such as
  a shell or inetd/xinetd) for various conditions.
* Added OPENVPN_DEBUG_COMMAND_LINE flag to
  openvpn.h to allow debugging in situations
  where stdout, stderr, and syslog cannot be used
  for message output, such as when OpenVPN is
  instantiated by inetd/xinetd.
* Removed owner-execute permission from file
  created by static key generator (Herbert Xu
  and Alberto Gonzalez Iniesta).
* Added --passtos option to allow IPv4 TOS bits
  to be passed from TUN/TAP input packets to
  the outgoing UDP socket (Craig Knox).
* Added code to prevent open socket file descriptors
  from being accessible to called scripts.
* Added --dev-name option (Christian Lademann).
* Added --mtu-disc option for manual control
  over MTU options.
* Show OS MTU value on UDP socket write failures
  (linux only).
* Numerous build system and portability
  fixes (Matthias Andree).
* Added better sensing of compiler support for
  variable argument macros, including (a) gcc
  style, (b) ISO C 1999 style, and (c) no support.
* Removed generated files from CVS.  Note INSTALL
  file for new CVS build commands.
* Changed certain internal symbol names
  for C standards compliance.
* Added TUN/TAP open code to cycle dynamically
  through unit numbers until it finds a free
  unit (based on code from Thomas Gielfeldt
  and VTun).
* Added dynamic MTU and fragmenting infrastructure
  (Experimental).  Rebuild with FRAGMENT_ENABLE
  defined to enable.
* Minor changes to SSL/TLS negotiation, use
  exponential backoff on retransmits, and use
  a smaller MTU size (note that no protocol
  changes have been made which would break
  compatibility with 1.3.x).
* Added --enable-strict-options flag
  to ./configure.  This option will cause
  a more strict check for options compatibility
  between peers when SSL/TLS negotiation is used,
  but should only be used when both OpenVPN peers
  are of the same version.
* Reorganization of debugging levels.
* Added a workaround in configure.ac for
  default SSL header location on Linux
  to fix RH9 build problem.
* Fixed potential deadlock when pthread support
  is used on OSes that allocate a small socketpair()
  message buffer.
* Fixed openvpn.init to be sh compliant
  (Bishop Clark).
* Changed --daemon to wait until all
  initialization is finished before becoming a
  daemon, for the benefit of initialization
  scripts that want a useful return status from
  the openvpn command.
* Made openvpn.init script more robust, including
  positive indication of initialization errors
  in the openvpn daemon and better sanity checks.
* Changed --chroot to wait until initialization
  is finished before calling chroot(), and allow
  the use of --user and --group with --chroot.
* When syslog logging is enabled (--daemon or
  --inetd), set stdin/stdout/stderr to point
  to /dev/null.
* For inetd instantiations, dup socket descriptor
  to a >2 value.
* Fixed bug in verify-cn script, where test would
  incorrectly fail if CN=x was the last component
  of the X509 composite string (Anonymous).
* Added Markus F.X.J. Oberhumer's special
  license exception to COPYING.

2002.10.23 -- Version 1.3.2

* Added SSL_CTX_set_client_CA_list call
  to follow the canonical form for TLS initialization
  recommended by the OpenSSL docs.  This change allows
  better support for intermediate CAs and has no impact
  on security.
* Added build-inter script to easy-rsa package, to
  facilitate the generation of intermediate CAs.
* Ported to NetBSD (Dimitri Goldin).
* Fixed minor bug in easy-rsa/sign-req.  It refers to
  openssl.cnf file, instead of $KEY_CONFIG, like all
  other scripts (Ernesto Baschny).
* Added --days 3650 to the root CA generation command
  in the HOWTO to override the woefully small 30 day
  default (Dominik 'Aeneas' Schnitzer).
* Fixed bug where --ping-restart would sometimes
  not re-resolve remote DNS hostname.
* Added --tun-ipv6 option and related infrastructure
  support for IPv6 over tun.
* Added IPv6 over tun support for Linux (Aaron Sethman).
* Added FreeBSD 4.1.1+ TUN/TAP driver notes to
  INSTALL (Matthias Andree).
* Added inetd/xinetd support (--inetd) including
  documentation in the HOWTO.
* Added "Important Note on the use of commercial certificate
  authorities (CAs) with OpenVPN" to HOWTO based on
  issues raised on the openvpn-users list.

2002.07.10 -- Version 1.3.1

* Fixed bug in openvpn.spec and openvpn.init
  which caused RPM upgrade to fail.

2002.07.10 -- Version 1.3.0

* Added --dev-node option to allow explicit selection of
  tun/tap device node.
* Removed mlockall call from child thread, as it doesn't
  appear to be necessary (child thread inherits mlockall
  state from parent).
* Added --ping-timer-rem which causes timer for --ping-exit
  and --ping-restart not to run unless we have a remote IP
  address.
* Added condrestart to openvpn.init and openvpn.spec
  (Bishop Clark).
* Added --ifconfig case for FreeBSD (Matthias Andree).
* Call openlog with facility=LOG_DAEMON (Matthias Andree).
* Changed LOG_INFO messages to LOG_NOTICE.
* Added warning when key files are group/others accessible.
* Added --single-session flag for TLS mode.
* Fixed bug where --writepid would segfault if used with
  an invalid filename.
* Fixed bug where --ipchange status message was formatted
  incorrectly.
* Print more concise error message when system() call
  fails.
* Added --disable-occ option.
* Added --local, --remote, and --ifconfig options sanity
  check.
* Changed default UDP MTU to 1300 and TUN/TAP MTU to
  1300.
* Successfully tested with OpenSSL 0.9.7 Beta 2.
* Broke out debug level definitions to errlevel.h
* Minor documentation and web site changes.
* All changes maintain protocol compatibility
  with OpenVPN versions since 1.1.0, however default
  MTU changes will require setting the MTU explicitly
  by command line option, if you want 1.3.0 to
  communicate with previous versions.

2002.06.12 -- Version 1.2.1

* Added --ping-restart option to restart
  connection on ping timeout using SIGUSR1
  logic (Matthias Andree).
* Added --persist-tun, --persist-key,
  --persist-local-ip, and --persist-remote-ip
  options for finer-grained control over SIGUSR1
  and --ping-restart restarts.  To
  replicate previous SIGUSR1 functionality,
  use --persist-remote-ip.
* Changed residual IV fetching code to take
  IV from tail of ciphertext.
* Added check to make sure that CFB or OFB
  cipher modes are only used with SSL/TLS
  authentication mode, and added a caveat
  to INSTALL.
* Changed signal handling during initialization
  (including re-initialization during restarts)
  to exit on SIGTERM or SIGINT and ignore other
  signals which would ordinarily be caught.
* Added --resolv-retry option to allow
  retries on hostname resolution.
* Expanded the --float option to also
  allow dynamic changes in source port number
  on incoming datagrams.
* Added --mute option to limit repetitive
  logging of similar message types.
* Added --group option to downgrade GID
  after initialization.
* Try to set ifconfig path automatically
  in configure.
* Added --ifconfig code for Mac OS X
  (Christoph Pfisterer).
* Moved "Peer Connection Initiated" message
  to --verb level 1.
* Successfully tested with
  OpenSSL 0.9.7 Beta 1 and AES cipher.
* Added RPM notes to INSTALL.
* Added ACX_PTHREAD (from the autoconf
  macro archive) to configure.ac
  to figure out the right pthread
  options for a given platform.
* Broke out macro definitions from
  configure.ac to acinclude.m4.
* Minor changes to docs and HOWTO.
* All changes maintain protocol compatibility
  with OpenVPN versions since 1.1.0.

2002.05.22 -- Version 1.2.0

* Added configuration file support via
  the --config option.
* Added pthread support to improve latency.
  With pthread support, OpenVPN
  will offload CPU-intensive tasks such as RSA
  key number crunching to a background thread
  to improve tunnel packet forwarding
  latency.  pthread support can be enabled
  with the --enable-pthread configure option.
  Pthread support is currently available
  only for Linux and Solaris.
* Added --dev-type option so that tun/tap
  device names don't need to begin with
  "tun" or "tap".
* Added --writepid option to write main
  process ID to a file.
* Numerous portability fixes to ease
  porting to other OSes including changing
  all network types to uint8_t and uint32_t,
  and not assuming that time_t is 32 bits.
* Backported to OpenSSL 0.9.5.
* Ported to Solaris.
* Finished OpenBSD port except for
  pthread support.
* Added initialization script:
  sample-scripts/openvpn.init
  (Douglas Keller)
* Ported to Mac OS X (Christoph Pfisterer).
* Improved resilience to DoS attacks when
  TLS mode is used without --remote or
  --tls-auth, or when --float is used
  with --remote.  Note however that the best
  defense against DoS attacks in TLS mode
  is to use --tls-auth.
* Eliminated automake/autoconf dependency
  for non-developers.
* Ported configure.in to configure.ac
  and autoconf 2.50+.
* SIGHUP signal now causes OpenVPN to restart
  and re-read command line and or config file,
  in conformance with canonical daemon behaviour.
* SIGUSR1 now does what SIGHUP did in
  version 1.1.1 and earlier -- close and reopen
  the UDP socket for use when DHCP changes
  host's IP address and preserve most recently
  authenticated peer address without rereading
  config file.
* SIGUSR2 added -- outputs current statistics,
  including compression statistics.
* All changes maintain protocol compatibility
  with 1.1.1 and 1.1.0.

2002.04.22 -- Version 1.1.1

* Added --ifconfig option to automatically configure
  TUN device.
* Added inactivity disconnect (--inactive
  and --ping-exit options).
* Added --ping option to keep stateful firewalls
  from timing out.
* Added sanity check to command line parser to
  err if any TLS options are used in non-TLS mode.
* Fixed build problem with compiler environments that
  define printf as a macro.
* Fixed build problem on linux systems that have
  an integrated TUN/TAP driver but lack the persistent
  tunnel feature (TUNSETPERSIST).  Some linux kernels
  >= 2.4.0 and < 2.4.7 fall into this category.
* Changed all calls to EVP_CipherInit to use explicit
  encrypt/decrypt mode in order to fix problem with
  IDEA-CBC and AES-256-CBC ciphers.
* Minor changes to control channel transmit limiter
  algorithm to fix problem where TLS control channel
  might not renegotiate within the default 60 second window.
* Simplified man page examples by taking advantage
  of the new --ifconfig option.
* Minor changes to configure.in to check more
  rigourously for OpenSSL 0.9.6 or greater.
* Put back openvpn.spec, eliminated
  openvpn.spec.in.
* Modified openvpn.spec to reflect new automake-based
  build environment (Bishop Clark).
* Other documentation changes.
* Added --test-crypto option for debugging.
* Added "missing" and "mkinstalldirs" automake
  support files.

2002.04.09 -- Version 1.1.0

* Strengthened replay protection and IV handling,
  extending it fully to both static key and
  TLS dynamic key exchange modes.
* Added --mlock option to disable paging and ensure that key
  material and tunnel data is never paged to disk.
* Added optional traffic shaping feature to cap the maximum
  data rate of the tunnel.
* Converted to automake (The Platypus Brothers 2002-04-01).
* Ported to OpenBSD by Janne Johansson.
* Added --tun-af-inet option to work around an incompatibility
  between Linux and BSD tun drivers.
* Sequence number-based replay protection using the
  IPSec sliding window model is now the default,
  disable with --no-replay.
* Explicit IV is now the default, disable with --no-iv.
* Disabled all cipher modes except CBC, CFB, and OFB.
* In CBC mode, use explicit IV and carry forward residuals,
  using IPSec model.
* In CFB/OFB mode, IV is timestamp, sequence number.
* Eliminated --packet-id, --timestamp, and max-delta parameter to
  the --tls-auth option as they are now supplanted by improved
  replay code which is enabled by default.
* Eliminated --rand-iv as it is now obsolete with improved
  IV code.
* Eliminated --reneg-err option as it increases vulnerability
  to DoS attacks.
* Added weak key check for DES ciphers.
* --tls-freq option is no longer specified on the command line,
  instead it now inherits its parameter from the
  --tls-timeout option.
* Fixed bug that would try to free memory on exit that was
  never malloced if --comp-lzo was not specified.
* Errata fixed in the man page examples: "test-ca" should be
  "tmp-ca".
* Updated manual page.
* Preliminary work in porting to OpenSSL 0.9.7.
* Changed license to allowing linking with OpenSSL.

2002.03.29 -- Version 1.0.3

* Fixed a problem in configure with library ordering on the
  command line.

2002.03.28 -- Version 1.0.2

* Improved the efficiency of the inner event loop.
* Fixed a minor bug with timeout handling.
* Improved the build system to build on RH 6.2 through 7.2.
* Added an openvpn.spec file for RPM builders (Bishop Clark).

2002.03.23 -- Version 1.0

* Added TLS-based authentication and key exchange.
* Added gremlin mode to stress test.
* Wrote man page.

2001.12.26 -- Version 0.91

* Added any choice of cipher or HMAC digest.

2001.5.13 -- Version 0.90

* Initial release.
* IP tunnel over UDP, with blowfish cipher and SHA1 HMAC signature.

## SUSE Security

# A Process That Never Ends

### SUSE is committed to delivering best effort security to its customers and to the Open Source community. We believe that trust in Open Source Software security in general, and the user's privacy in particular, are both indispensable and indefeasible.

We treat software security as a process that never ends. This means we:

* Promptly react to security incidents and deliver premium quality security updates
* Continuously improve the security-related functionality in SUSE products
* Continuously contribute to the rapidly growing maturity of Open Source Software
* Respect the Open Source Software security principles of openness, transparency and traceability

Software security is a complex challenge. Software can provide many of its own security features, such as authentication methods, encryption, intrusion prevention and detection, and backup.

At the same time, it can also contain errors (both deliberate and accidental) that can affect the system's security, including design flaws, programming errors, and backdoors.

The SUSE Security Team addresses all of these aspects of software security, on an ongoing basis. Software security cannot be thought of as a state you can achieve at a specific point in time. Instead, it is a process that must be executed with professional expertise and continuous development. This persistent focus is what has given Open Source Software, Linux and SUSE such an excellent reputation for security.

 CVE-2008-1340
##### 1. Summary

Several critical security vulnerabilities have been addressed in the newest releases of VMware's hosted product line.

#####

##### 2. Relevant releases

VMware Workstation 6.0.2 and earlier
VMware Workstation 5.5.4 and earlier
VMware Player 2.0.2 and earlier
VMware Player 1.0.4 and earlier
VMware ACE 2.0.2 and earlier
VMware ACE 1.0.2 and earlier
VMware Server 1.0.4 and earlier
VMware Fusion 1.1.1 and earlier

##### 3. Problem description

a. Host to guest shared folder (HGFS) traversal vulnerability
On Windows hosts, if you have configured a VMware host to guest shared folder (HGFS), it is possible for a program running in the guest to gain access to the host's file system and create or modify executable files in sensitive locations.

NOTE: VMware Server is not affected because it doesn't use host to guest shared folders. No versions of ESX Server, including ESX Server 3i, are affected by this vulnerability. Because ESX Server is based on a bare-metal hypervisor architecture and not a hosted architecture, and it doesn't include any shared folder abilities. Fusion and Linux based hosted products are unaffected.

VMware would like to thank CORE Security Technologies for working with us on this issue. This addresses advisory CORE-2007-0930.

The Common Vulnerabilities and exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2008-0923 to this issue.

#####

b. Insecure named pipes
An internal security audit determined that a malicious Windows user could attain and exploit LocalSystem privileges by causing the authd process to connect to a named pipe that is opened and controlled by the malicious user.

The same internal security audit determined that a malicious Windows user could exploit an insecurely created named pipe object to escalate privileges or create a denial of service attack. In this situation, the malicious user could successfully impersonate authd and attain privileges under which Authd is executing.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names CVE-2008-1361, CVE-2008-1362 to these issues.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenât normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Mozilla Network Security Service (NSS): RSA signature forgery â GLSA **200610-06**

NSS fails to properly validate PKCS #1 v1.5 signatures.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-libs/nss** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.11.3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.11.3** |

### Background

The Mozilla Network Security Service is a library implementing security
features like SSL v.2/v.3, TLS, PKCS #5, PKCS #7, PKCS #11, PKCS #12,
S/MIME and X.509 certificates.

### Description

Daniel Bleichenbacher discovered that it might be possible to forge
signatures signed by RSA keys with the exponent of 3. This affects a
number of RSA signature implementations, including Mozilla's NSS.

### Impact

Since several Certificate Authorities (CAs) are using an exponent of 3
it might be possible for an attacker to create a key with a false CA
signature. This impacts any software using the NSS library, like the
Mozilla products Firefox, Thunderbird and Seamonkey.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All NSS users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/nss-3.11.3"
```

Note: As usual after updating a library, you should run
'revdep-rebuild' (from the app-portage/gentoolkit package) to ensure
that all applications linked to it are properly rebuilt.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenât normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenât normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### Background

OpenOffice is the open source version of StarOffice, a full office
productivity suite. LibreOffice is a fork of OpenOffice.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenOffice and
Libreoffice. Please review the CVE identifiers referenced below for
details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted file
using OpenOffice, possibly resulting in execution of arbitrary code with
the privileges of the process, a Denial of Service condition, execution
of arbitrary Python code, authentication bypass, or reading and writing
of arbitrary files.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All OpenOffice (binary) users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
 ">=app-office/openoffice-bin-3.5.5.3"

```

All LibreOffice users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-office/libreoffice-4.2.5.2"

```

All LibreOffice (binary) users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
 ">=app-office/libreoffice-bin-4.2.5.2"

```

We recommend that users unmerge OpenOffice:

```
 # emerge --unmerge "app-office/openoffice"

```

### a) When visiting the website

#### Log files

When you visit our websites ([full list of domains](/policies/asf-domains.html)) or one of our subdomains,
the browser on your device automatically sends information to the server of our website.
This information is temporarily stored in a log file.
The following information is being collected without your intervention and stored until automated deletion:

* The IP address of the requesting computer
* The date and time of access
* The name and URL of the retrieved file
* The website from which access is made (referrer URL)
* Geo information of the location from which access is made
* The browser used and, if applicable, the operating system of your computer and the name of your access provider

The data mentioned are processed by us for the following purposes:

* Ensuring connectivity of our website
* Ensuring a use of our website, of which we think is comfortable for you
* Evaluation of system security and stability
* Other administrative purposes

The retention time for this data is 90 days.

The legal basis for data processing is Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f GDPR.
Our legitimate interest follows from the data collection purposes listed above.
In no case do we use the collected data for the purpose of drawing conclusions about you.
In addition, we use cookies and analysis services when you visit our website.
Further details can be found under no. 4 and 5 of this privacy policy.

#### Matomo

In addition to log files, some of our websites use Matomo to understand what parts of the
website are important to our users, what features are most frequently accessed,
where users get lost in the documentation, etc.
This data allows us to better understand how users use the system, the website,
and the docs and where to focus improvements next.

The collected information consists of the following:

* The IP address from which you access the website
* The type of browser and operating system you use to access our site
* The date and time you access our site
* The pages you visit
* If you click on any of the file download links on our website
* The addresses of pages from where you followed a link to our site
* The addresses of pages you go to from our site
* The search terms you use on the website

This information is gathered and stored using the open source software Matomo. We donÃ¢ÂÂt
use any cookies to collect this information. An IP address is anonymized by removing
the last two octets from the IP address. That means that if your IP is 192.168.100.50,

### b) When registering for our newsletter and mailing lists

If, pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a GDPR, you have expressly consented,
we use your e-mail address to periodically send you our newsletter.
For the receipt of the newsletter the indication of an e-mail address is sufficient.

We inform our visitors at regular intervals through newsletters about news and offers from The Apache Software Foundation.

The newsletter of our Foundation can only be received if (1) the data subject has a valid e-mail address and (2) the person concerned registers for the newsletter.
For legal reasons, a confirmation e-mail will be sent to the e-mail address entered by an affected person before the first time of sending the newsletter, using the double-opt-in procedure.
This confirmation email is used to check whether the owner of the e-mail address is the person who authorized the receipt of the newsletter.

When you subscribe to the newsletter, we store the date and time of registration and the email address.
The collection of this data is necessary for us to understand the (possible) misuse of an affected personÃ¢ÂÂs e-mail address at a later date and therefore serves as legal safeguards for the controller.

The personal data collected in the context of registering for the newsletter is used exclusively to send our newsletter.

Subscribers may also be notified by e-mail if this is necessary for the operation of the newsletter service or registration, as might be the case in the event of changes to the newsletter/mailing list or technical changes.

There will be no transfer to third parties of the personal data collected as part of the newsletter service.

Subscription to our newsletter may be terminated by the person concerned at any time.
Consent to the storage of personal data that the person has given us for the newsletter dispatch can be revoked at any time.
For the purpose of revoking the consent, instructions are given by the end of each newsletter email.

### c) When registering for our mailing lists

If, pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a GDPR, you have expressly consented, we use your e-mail address to send you messages arriving at our mailing lists.
For the receipt of the mailing list message the indication of an e-mail address is sufficient.

Visitors may communicate with us through our mailing lists.

The mailing list messages of our organisation can only be received if (1) the person concerned has a valid e-mail address and (2) the person concerned registers for the mailing list.
For legal reasons, a confirmation e-mail will be sent to the e-mail address entered by an affected person for the first time using the double-opt-in procedure.
This confirmation email is used to check whether the owner of the e-mail address authorized the receipt of the mailing list messages.

When you subscribe to a mailing list, we store the date and time of registration and the email address.
The collection of this data is necessary for us to understand the (possible) misuse of an affected personÃ¢ÂÂs e-mail address at a later date and therefore serves as legal safeguards for the controller.
When a mailing list is archived, the log file will be deleted.

The personal data collected in the context of registering for a mailing list will be used exclusively to send messages arriving at that mailing list.

Subscribers may also be notified by e-mail if this is necessary for the operation of the mailing list service or registration, as might be the case in the event of changes to the mailing list or other technical changes.

We will not actively transfer to third parties any personal data as part of the mailing list service.
However, almost all of our mailing lists are of a public nature.

This means, your name and email may be exposed to the public.
Also, all information you send to a mailing list will be exposed to the public.
Third parties may collect this information and process it separately.
The sender of messages is responsible if they expose their personal data to the public.

All content sent to mailing lists is archived indefinitely.
By using our mailing list service, you agree that any content is archived in that way.

Subscription to our mailing lists may be terminated by the person concerned at any time.
The consent to the storage of personal data that a person has given us for the mailing list dispatch can be revoked at any time.
For the purpose of revoking the consent, instructions are given by the end of every email.

## 3. Disclosure of data

Transfer of your personal data to third parties for purposes other than those listed below does not take place.
We only share your personal information with third parties if:

* You, in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. a GDPR, have given express consent to this.
* Disclosure pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR is required to assert, exercise or defend legal claims and there is no reason to assume that you have a predominantly legitimate interest in not disclosing your data.
* Disclosure pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. c GDPR is a legal obligation.
* As permitted by law and according to Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b GDPR, disclosure is required for the settlement of contractual relationships with you.

## 4. External service providers

The Apache Software Foundation uses the following external service providers who help to optimize its services.
Insofar as these service providers process data on behalf of The Apache Software Foundation, agreements have been concluded with them which set the European data protection standards as binding and, in particular, prohibit the use of the data for other purposes.
If we commission third parties to process data on the basis of a so-called Ã¢ÂÂcontract processing contractÃ¢ÂÂ, this is done on the basis of Art. 28 GDPR.

## 5. Social Media Plug-ins

We rely on our website on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR social plug-ins from the social networks Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to make our company better known.
The underlying commercial purpose is to be regarded as a legitimate interest within the meaning of the GDPR.
Responsibility for operation compliant with data protection is to be guaranteed by the respective providers.
The integration of these plug-ins by us is done by means of the so-called two-click method to protect visitors to our website in the best possible way.

### a) YouTube

On our website we have integrated components from YouTube.
YouTube is an internet video portal that allows video publishers to freely watch video clips provided by other users for free viewing, rating and commenting.
YouTube allows the publication of all types of videos, so that both complete film and television broadcasts, music videos, trailers and user-made videos uploaded via the YouTube internet portal are available.

YouTubeÃ¢ÂÂs operating company is YouTube, LLC, 901 Cherry Ave., San Bruno, CA 94066, USA.
YouTube, LLC is a subsidiary of Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, USA.

Each visit to one of the pages of this site operated by the controller and incorporating a YouTube component (YouTube video) will automatically cause the Internet browser on the subjectÃ¢ÂÂs information technology system to download an illustration of the corresponding YouTube component from YouTube.
More information about YouTube can be found at https://www.youtube.com/yt/about/en/.
As part of this technical process, YouTube and Google are aware of the specific location of our site visited by the person concerned.
If the person visiting our site is logged in to YouTube at the same time, YouTube calls a sub-page containing a YouTube video for the person visiting our site.
This information is collected by YouTube and Google and associated with the individual YouTube account.

YouTube and Google will always receive information through the YouTube component that a person has visited our website if the person is logged into YouTube at the time of access to our website; this happens regardless of whether the person clicks on a YouTube video or not.
If such transmission of this information to YouTube and Google is not wanted by the person visiting our site, they can prevent the transmission by logging out of their YouTube account before visiting our website.

YouTubeÃ¢ÂÂs privacy policy, available at https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/, identifies the collection, processing, and use of personally identifiable information by YouTube and Google.

## 7. Affected rights

You have the right:

* in accordance with Art. 15 GDPR, to request information about your personal data processed by us. In particular, you can request information on the processing purposes, the category of personal data, the categories of recipients to whom your data has been disclosed, the planned retention period, the right to rectification, deletion, limitation of processing or opposition, the existence of a right to complain, the source of your data, if not collected from us, and the existence of automated decision-making including profiling and, where appropriate, meaningful information about your data.
* in accordance with Art. 16 GDPR, to demand the immediate correction of incorrect or complete personal data stored with us.
* in accordance with Art. 17 GDPR, to demand the deletion of your personal data stored by us, unless the processing is required for the exercise of the right to freedom of expression and information, for the fulfillment of a legal obligation, for reasons of public interest or for the assertion, exercise or defense of Legal claims.
* to demand the restriction of the processing of your personal data according to Art. 18 GDPR, as far as the accuracy of the data is disputed by you, the processing is unlawful, but you reject its deletion and we no longer need the data, but you assert this, in the exercise or defense of legal claims or you have objected to the processing in accordance with Art. 21 GDPR.
* in accordance with Art. 20 GDPR, to receive your personal data provided to us in a structured, standard and machine-readable format or to request transmission to another person.
* according to Art. 7 para. 3 GDPR, to revoke your once-given consent to us at any time. As a result, we are not allowed to continue processing of data based on this consent for the future.
* to complain to a supervisory authority pursuant to Art. 77 GDPR. As a rule, you can contact the supervisory authority of your usual place of residence or work or our office.

## 8. Right to object

If our retention of your personal data is based on legitimate interests in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR, you have the right to file an objection against the processing of your personal data in accordance with Art. 21 GDPR, provided that there are reasons for this arising from your particular situation or the objection is directed against direct mail.
In the latter case, you have a general right of objection, which is implemented by us without specifying any particular situation.
If you would like to exercise your right of revocation or objection, please send an e-mail to vp-privacy@apache.org.

## 9. Data security

We use the popular SSL (Secure Socket Layer) method during your site visit, in conjunction with the highest level of encryption supported by your browser.
In general, this is a 256-bit encryption.
If your browser does not support 256-bit encryption, we use 128-bit v3 technology instead.
Whether a single page of our website is encrypted is shown by the closed representation of the key or lock icon in the lower status bar of your browser.

We also take appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect your data against accidental or intentional manipulation, partial or total loss, destruction or unauthorized access by third parties.
Our security measures are continuously improved in line with technological developments.

## 10. Updating and changing this privacy policy

This privacy policy is currently valid and is valid as of 2025-01-16.

As a result of the further development of our website and offers thereof, or due to changed legal or official requirements, it may be necessary to change this privacy policy.
The current privacy policy can be viewed and printed by you at any time on the website at https://privacy.apache.org/policies/privacy-policy-public.html.

# USN-339-1: OpenSSL vulnerability

5 September 2006

OpenSSL vulnerability

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)
* [Ubuntu 5.10](/security/notices?release=breezy)
* [Ubuntu 5.04](/security/notices?release=hoary)

## Details

Philip Mackenzie, Marius Schilder, Jason Waddle and Ben Laurie of

Google Security discovered that the OpenSSL library did not

sufficiently check the padding of PKCS #1 v1.5 signatures if the

exponent of the public key is 3 (which is widely used for CAs). This

could be exploited to forge signatures without the need of the secret

	     and 9.4.0b2

Severity: Moderate (see below)
Exploitable: Remotely

Description:

	Because of OpenSSL's recently announced vulnerabilities
	(CAN-2006-4339, CVE-2006-2937 and CVE-2006-2940) which affect named,
	we are announcing this workaround and releasing patches.  A proof of
	concept attack on OpenSSL has been demonstrated for CAN-2006-4339.

	OpenSSL is required to use DNSSEC with BIND.  ISC had included
        the OpenSSL library in the BIND distribution, and in more recent
	versions, the OpenSSL library was required, but no longer a part
	of the distribution.

Workaround:

	Recompile named with a known good version of OpenSSL.
	OpenSSL 0.9.8d and 0.9.7l or greater are known to be good
	versions.

	For both KEY and DNSKEY resource record types, Generate
	RSASHA1 and RSAMD5 keys using the -e option to dnssec-keygen
	if the current keys were generated using the default exponent
	of 3.  You can determine if a key is vulnerable by looking
	at the algorithm (1 or 5) and the first three characters
	of the base64 encoded RSA key.

	RSASHA1 (5) and RSAMD5 (1) keys that start with AQM, AQN, AQO
        or AQP are vulnerable.

	For example, this RSASHA1 (5) key is vulnerable and needs to be
	replaced as the base64 encoded RSA key starts with AQP.

	DNSKEY 256 3 5 ( AQPGP80zt8pQS5xVaaaD054XBet8sCKaYZ9WrnYyuznqNX
			 kS91j6qqHuw7Y9kKAVsFoWfNw0CpahdIJIhUPFM1JRJtXh
		         Ny1cg9Ok3kBnN+fwCe2LY3qOtweFbL9bSjgolQWr42AlFO
		         jZnJVW1cECgVBfinKHBIEIIwIdHGGuLyIQaQ== )

	Note: the use of RSAMD5 (1) is no longer recommended.

	Once you have generated new keys, use the key rollover
	process of your choice to put them into production. We
	expect your normal (non-emergency) processes to be adequate,
	however, you should do your own risk analysis against the
	costs of exploitation of weak keys and proceed accordingly.

Fix:

	Upgrade to BIND 9.2.6-P2, BIND 9.3.2-P2, BIND 9.2.7rc3,
	BIND 9.3.3rc3 or BIND 9.4.0b3 then generate new RSASHA1 and
	RSAMD5 keys for all old keys using the old default exponent
	and perform a key rollover to these new keys.  See above
	for how to determine if you are using the old default exponent.

	These new versions of named check that the OpenSSL version meet
	the mininum revision levels at configure time -- for Windows,
	compile time.

	These versions also change the default RSA exponent to be
	65537 which is not vulnerable to the attacks described in
	CAN-2006-4339.

Revision History:

	20061102: Corrected fixed version number from BIND 9.2.3-P2
	to BIND 9.3.2-P2.

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenât normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
