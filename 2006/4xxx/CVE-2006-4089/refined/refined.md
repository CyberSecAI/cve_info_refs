{
  "CVE-2006-4089": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "Multiple buffer overflows due to insufficient bounds checking when handling data from various sources.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
        "Buffer overflow in HTTP redirect handling (`reconnect` function): The `sscanf` function copies the URL from the `Location` field of an HTTP response into a fixed-size buffer without checking the length of the URL.",
        "Buffer overflow in GTK playlist handling (`new_list_item` and `CbUpdated` functions): When adding items to the playlist, a long URL can overflow buffers used by these functions in the GTK interface.",
        "Buffer overflow in CDDB lookup (`cddb_lookup` function): The function which queries the CDDB server copies data into fixed-size buffers for category and ID strings without validating the length of the data received from the server."
      ],
      "Impact of exploitation": "Remote attackers can cause a denial of service (application crash) and potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running AlsaPlayer.",
      "Attack vectors": [
        "A malicious HTTP server sending a crafted `Location` field in a redirect response.",
        "A malicious web server providing a long URL when AlsaPlayer is seeking media for a playlist.",
          "A malicious CDDB server that sends an oversized category or ID string in response to a query."
      ],
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
        "For HTTP redirect and playlist overflows, the attacker needs a web server and can be remote.",
        "For the CDDB overflow, the attacker needs control over the CDDB server specified in AlsaPlayer's configuration."
