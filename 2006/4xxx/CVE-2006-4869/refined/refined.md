{
  "CVE-2006-4869": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "The phpunity.postcard application is vulnerable to Remote File Inclusion (RFI) due to the insecure usage of the `gallery_path` variable.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The `$gallery_path` variable is not properly initialized or sanitized before being used in an `include` statement, allowing an attacker to inject a malicious URL.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)"
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server by including a malicious file from a remote server.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "By setting the 'plgallery_epost' parameter in the query string to 1, and providing a malicious URL through the 'gallery_path' parameter, an attacker can force the application to include and execute the malicious code."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application, and must host a malicious file on a server that is accessible by the vulnerable application.",
      "additional_notes": "The exploit does not work with c99-php shells due to the loss of the 'plgallery_epost=1' parameter after certain actions with the shell, which would unload the included malicious code."
    }
