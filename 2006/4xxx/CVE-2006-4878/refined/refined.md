      "cve_id": "CVE-2006-4878",
      "is_related": true,
      "details": {
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper sanitization of the 'template' parameter in the 'footer.php' file, which allows an attacker to include arbitrary files using a null byte injection.",
        "vulnerabilities": [
          "Remote Code Execution",
          "File Inclusion",
          "Null Byte Injection"
        ],
         "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server by uploading a malicious GIF file containing PHP code and then including that file through the vulnerable 'template' parameter. This can lead to complete compromise of the affected system.",
        "attack_vectors": [
          "HTTP POST request to register.php to register a user.",
           "HTTP POST request to avatar.php to upload a malicious GIF file with embedded PHP code.",
          "HTTP GET request to footer.php to include the uploaded malicious GIF via the template parameter and a null byte injection."
        ],
        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and have knowledge of the vulnerable parameter. No authentication is needed to exploit the vulnerability.",
        "additional_information": "The exploit uses a multi-stage approach. First registering a user, then uploading an avatar, then exploiting the inclusion vulnerability. The uploaded GIF is crafted to contain PHP code that will be executed when included."
