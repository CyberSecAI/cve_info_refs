Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with Cybozu Garoon 2, as described in the vuln.sg advisory:

**Root Cause:**
- The primary root cause is the failure to properly sanitize user-supplied input within various parameters of the Cybozu Garoon 2 application before using it in SQL queries. This lack of input sanitization allows for SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** Multiple instances of SQL injection vulnerabilities are identified within the application in different modules like:
  - **TODO List View/Modify:** The "tid" parameter is vulnerable.
  - **Workflow View/Print:** The "pid" parameter is vulnerable.
  - **Other areas:**  Vulnerabilities exist in `cid`, `tid`, `uid`, `gid`, `iid`, and `event` parameters in various modules including todo, schedule, phonemessage, and memo.
- Vulnerable parameters are used directly within SQL queries, without proper sanitization which allows the attacker to inject malicious SQL code to be executed against the database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can use SQL injection to extract sensitive information from the database, including user password hashes.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploiting certain SQL injection points can lead to excessive CPU resource consumption on the backend MySQL database, potentially resulting in a denial-of-service condition.
- **Arbitrary data retrieval:** It is possible to retrieve data from arbitrary tables in the database, using `UNION SELECT` statements.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Requests:** Attackers exploit the vulnerabilities via crafted HTTP GET requests. By manipulating parameters within URLs, they inject malicious SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Logon User:** The attacker needs to be a logged-in user to exploit the vulnerabilities in the TODO and Workflow modules.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Cybozu Garoon 2 application.
- **Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs to understand SQL injection techniques in order to craft the exploit URLs.

**Additional Details:**
- The advisory provides specific examples of how to exploit these vulnerabilities using crafted URLs to extract the administrator's password hash.
- The advisory provides original and manipulated SQL queries, showcasing the SQL injection points.
- It lists multiple vulnerable modules and parameters, suggesting a wide scope of potential exploits.
- It identifies that some vulnerabilities may cause a Denial of Service due to intensive CPU utilization by the database server.
- The advisory also includes a timeline of vulnerability discovery, vendor notification and disclosure.
- Patch information is provided.
