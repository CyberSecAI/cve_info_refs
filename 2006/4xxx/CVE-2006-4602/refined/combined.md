# [Tiki under attack](article136-Tiki-under-attack)

 Oliver Hertel - 04 Sep 2006 06:44 GMT-0000

 [![Security](article_image.php?image_type=topic&id=4)](tiki-view_articles.php?topic=4 "List all articles of the same topic (Security)")

Maybe you already found this domain partially unavailable this weekend. Some russian hackers are attacking tiki installations currently, trying to install spam and/or DoS bots. We are working at it and hope to have solved the problems soon.

Sorry for the inconveniences.

[Details and quick fix here!](/tiki-read_article.php?articleId=136)

# How you can make your system more secure against those attacks

* Remove the file jhot.php. JGraphPad will be dysfunctional afterwards until we provide a fixed version. You can grab it from current CVS (BRANCH-1-9 or HEAD) already.
* Edit file tiki-editpage.php. If the line

Copy to clipboard
```
chmod("$wiki_up/$picname", 0755); // seems necessary on some system (see move_uploaded_file doc on php.net
```

exists, remove it!

* Enable [.htaccess files](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/howto/htaccess.html "External link"). Tiki comes with them already, you just have to [rename them](ScriptEnableHtaccess) from \_htaccess to .htaccess. Check first, if your webserver is supporting this!
* Fix permissions of files in the docroot. Run tiki's fixperms.sh. We're working on an improvement of that script.
* Use tiki-install.php or mysql client to import the script tiki-secdb\_1.9\_mysql.sql into the tiki database. With Menu / Admin security / Check all files you can run a job that validates all existing php files in tiki dir against checksums. Tiki will complain if there are more or modified files. Check those files.
* add this line to php.ini and restart apache:

Copy to clipboard
```
disable_functions passthru, system, shell_exec, popen, proc_open, exec, eval
```

That's what can be quickly done. If you want more:

* [chroot](http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ap-chroot-apache-env.en.html "External link") your apache. The attacks use perl, wget, curl... if you chroot your apache into a more or less empty tree of directories, those tries will fail.
* Maybe use [hardened php](http://www.hardened-php.net/ "External link") to make your system even more secure.

We can't guarantee that all this is enough. But it's a start.

# How you can detect if your system is corrupted already

* Another application is running on port 443. If you try to restart apache, it will complain about the port being locked. Check with ps what's running with apache userid, then go kill it.
* There might be a file img/wiki/tiki-config.php available. Thats no tiki file! If you find tmp.php, temp.php, mail.php, b9.php, vb.php, tiki-lang.php, mod\_wiki.php or lang/lang.php, those are hacks, too, none of them original tiki code. Delete them! There might be other files too that are not coming with tiki.

# Appendix

* [howto .htaccess files](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/howto/htaccess.html "External link")
* [script](ScriptEnableHtaccess "Script for enabling/disabling .htaccess files") to enable/disable .htaccess files

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Tikiwiki: Arbitrary command execution — GLSA **200609-16**

Tikiwiki contains a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability as well as a
second vulnerability which may allow remote execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-apps/tikiwiki** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.9.5** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.9.5** |

### Background

Tikiwiki is a web-based groupware and content management system,
developed with PHP, ADOdb and Smarty.

### Description

A vulnerability in jhot.php allows for an unrestricted file upload to
the img/wiki/ directory. Additionally, an XSS exists in the highlight
parameter of tiki-searchindex.php.

### Impact

An attacker could execute arbitrary code with the rights of the user
running the web server by uploading a file and executing it via a
filepath parameter. The XSS could be exploited to inject and execute
malicious script code or to steal cookie-based authentication
credentials, potentially compromising the victim's browser.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Tikiwiki users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --oneshot --verbose --ask ">=www-apps/tikiwiki-1.9.5"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
