How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Description:
I know this is probably gonna be a hard one to reproduce and fix, but I still thought I'd post a bug report after losing both my replication slaves tonight at the same time due to the same segfault. The slaves run on different hardware and different linux kernels, which probably rules out hardware/os bugs. As this is a production system, I was mainly concerned with getting it up and running again as fast as possible, but still tried to gather as much information as possible for the bug report.

Resolved stack on both of the servers (mysql2 and mysql3) was exactly the same:

0x82dc72c pthread_start_thread + 220
0x83060ba thread_start + 4

After the crash the servers both got in an endless loop, being restarted and crashing again all the time. I will attach this part of the mysqld logs.

Some facts:
* All machines (master and slaves) run mysql-standard-4.1.11-pc-linux-gnu-i686
* The master was not affected and is still running perfectly
* Uptime of mysqld on both slaves was about one to three weeks before the crash (not exactly the same uptime on both of the slaves)
* The exact same query that probably crashed the slaves has been run many times before (executed on a daily basis since last year)
* This query from the relay log executed fine when fed manually via mysql command line client to the servers after deleting master.info and restarting the servers
* I could get both slaves running again after deleting master.info and a new CHANGE MASTER TO one query after the one that seemed to crash the slaves
* I did a table check on all the tables after the crash and didn't find any errors
* mysql2 (runs on dedicated hardware): Linux version 2.4.21-231-default (root@i386.suse.de) (gcc version 3.2.2) #1 Mon Jun 28 15:00:49 UTC 2004
* mysql3 (runs on VMWare): Linux version 2.4.21-273-smp4G (root@i386.suse.de) (gcc version 3.3.1 (SuSE Linux)) #1 SMP Mon Jan 17 13:19:07 UTC 2005

The query that seemed to crash the servers (last to be executed from the relay logs):
# at 260193316
#050507 19:00:01 server id 101  log_pos 260193316       Query   thread_id=2662841       exec_time=0     error_code=0

 *
 *  Kopiert die aktuellsten Immissions-Daten von met_data.nabel
 *  nach MSSQL.immissionen, wird täglich um 19 UTC aufgerufen.
 *
 */

UPDATE  MSSQL.immissionen,
        (       SELECT          nabel.nabel_id AS id,
                                ROUND(IFNULL(nabel.O3, -99)) AS o3,
                                ROUND(IFNULL(nabel.NO2, -99)) AS no2,
                                ROUND(IFNULL(nabel.SO2, -99)) AS so2,
                                NOW()+0 AS bearbeitet
                FROM            met_data.nabel
                WHERE           nabel.date = ( SELECT MAX(date) FROM met_data.nabel)
        ) AS t
SET     immissionen.o3 = t.o3,
        immissionen.no2 = t.no2,
        immissionen.so2 = t.so2,
        immissionen.bearbeitet = t.bearbeitet
WHERE   immissionen.id = t.id;

I will run this query again on the master tomorrow morning after the slaves will have catched up and see what happens.

How to repeat:
Difficult, as this happened in a production system with some tens to hundreds of queries per second on the master and a little bit less on the slaves. The query that possibly crashed the slaves normally runs without any problems. So I don't really have a neat test case. If it should happen again I will further investigate on that and probably post all the data from the affected tables.

Suggested fix:
none

Okay, it happened again. On exactly the same query (see above) both my slaves crashed tonight at exactly the same time.

What I verified: It's really the query above crashing the servers (I set the slaves again to the same query using CHANGE MASTER TO and they crashed again, but not if I skipped that query.). The query only crashes the servers if fed to them via replication, NOT if executed directly:

    -> WHERE   immissionen.id = t.id;
Query OK, 16 rows affected (0.06 sec)

Both tables involved seem to be fine (just to prove):

mysql3:/var/lib/mysql # myisamchk -eT MSSQL/immissionen
Checking MyISAM file: MSSQL/immissionen
Data records:      16   Deleted blocks:       0

- check record delete-chain
- check key delete-chain
- check index reference
- check data record references index: 1
- check records and index references
mysql3:/var/lib/mysql # myisamchk -eT met_data/nabel
Checking MyISAM file: met_data/nabel
Data records:    4896   Deleted blocks:       0
- check file-size

I'll have to set up a dedicated test environment with one master and one slave tomorrow with just the two tables involved and only this single query running to see if I can reproduce this.

I finally found some time to reproduce this in a testing environment: I just set up two clean new machines with mysql-standard-4.1.11 and used the default tables (with database 'test') and my-small.cnf for these tests (just uncommented 'log-bin' on the master and set 'server-id = 2' on the slave, no more changes).

On master:

mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'root'@'%';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)

On slave:

mysql> CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_HOST='master', MASTER_USER='root', MASTER_LOG_FILE='mysql4-bin.000001';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> START SLAVE;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

On master:
mysql> use test
Database changed
mysql> source ~/crash_dump.sql
Query OK, 16 rows affected (0.01 sec)
Records: 16  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0

Query OK, 17 rows affected (0.01 sec)
Records: 17  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0

mysql> source ~/crash_query.sql
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)
Rows matched: 1  Changed: 1  Warnings: 0

At this point the slave will crash, verify on slave:

mysql> SHOW SLAVE STATUS\G
ERROR 2006 (HY000): MySQL server has gone away
No connection. Trying to reconnect...
ERROR 2013 (HY000): Lost connection to MySQL server during query
ERROR:
Can't connect to the server

Thanks for the bugfix!

Maybe this exact bug doesn't exist in 5.0.x - but I just posted a very similar one in 5.0.x one week ago (replication slaves crashing on certain queries). See #11354. Unfortunately other than with this bug, I wasn't yet able to find a test case that can easily reproduce that (if I just execute the exact same query that crashed the server under full load again in a clean test environment the problem doesn't appear). Maybe you can give me some hints on how to succeed with that...
```

Since the fix is already documented for 4.1.x and the fixed bug is not an issue in 5.0, I have closed the bug.
