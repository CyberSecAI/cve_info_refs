Airscanner Mobile Security Advisory #05081701:
IM+ v3.10 Local Password Plaintext Exposure
Product:
Shape Services IM+ Mobile Instant Messenger for Pocket PC v3.10
Platform:
Tested on Windows Mobile Pocket PC 2003
Requirements:
Mobile device running Windows Mobile Pocket PC with IM+ v3.10 installed.

August 17, 2005
Risk Level:
Medium &#8211; Exposes email address and password combinations
Summary:
Shape Services IM+ is instant messaging software that allows a user to connect to multiple instant messaging accounts at once. It supports AOL, Yahoo!, MSN and ICQ on a Pocket PC device. http://www.shapeservices.com/eng/im/implus.php
Details:
IM+ does not use any sort of security or encryption to protect the usernames and passwords of the instant messaging accounts.
A malicious user can navigate to Program FilesIMPlus and grab the implus.cfg file. This file simply needs to be opened using a text editor to view all the account details, including user names and passwords, in plain text.
Workaround:
Possibly fixed in later versions (we have not checked).
