  "CVE-2006-4321": {
    "description": "Mambo Component CopperminePhotoGalery is vulnerable to Remote File Inclusion (RFI). The vulnerability exists due to the insecure inclusion of the `config.cpg.php` file.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The application uses a `require` statement with a variable that is controllable by the user via the `mosConfig_absolute_path` parameter. This allows an attacker to include arbitrary remote files.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)",
          "Unsanitized input",
          "Insecure use of require statement"

      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server running the vulnerable application. This can lead to complete compromise of the system, including access to sensitive data, modification of files, and further attacks on the network.",
      "attack_vectors": [
          "HTTP GET request with crafted `mosConfig_absolute_path` parameter.",
         "Remote file inclusion via a malicious URL"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable web application. No authentication is required for exploitation.",
       "additional_notes": "The exploit requires crafting a URL using the vulnerable `cpg.php` file and setting the  `mosConfig_absolute_path` parameter to point to a malicious remote file, for example,  `http://evil.xxx/shell.txt?`."
