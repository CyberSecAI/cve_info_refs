    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2006-4004",
      "source": "www.exploit-db.com_b56b45de_20250124_170338.html",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-controlled input passed via the 'bbvbplang' cookie, which is then used in a file inclusion statement within vbPortal. Specifically, the application does not properly validate the file path provided within the cookie. This allows an attacker to inject a path to a malicious file, which will then be included and executed by the PHP engine.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Remote Code Execution",
        "Unrestricted file inclusion vulnerability."
      ],
       "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server hosting the vbPortal application. This can lead to complete compromise of the server, allowing the attacker to steal data, modify the application, or use it as a base for further attacks.",
      "attack_vector": "The attacker sends a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable server, injecting a malicious file path via the 'bbvbplang' cookie. This file path is then used in an include statement, and if the server is configured with `magic_quotes_gpc` turned off, the included file will execute malicious PHP code.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the target server. This can be done remotely via the internet, provided the vulnerable server is exposed. No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability."
