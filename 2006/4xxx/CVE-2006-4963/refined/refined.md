```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability stems from an insecure method of including files in the Exponent CMS application. By manipulating the 'view' parameter, an attacker can force the application to include arbitrary files, leading to remote command execution.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Arbitrary file inclusion, remote command execution. The vulnerability is located in the handling of the 'view' parameter within the 'calendarmodule' module. The application does not properly sanitize the input, allowing an attacker to include files located anywhere accessible to the web server.
- Impact of exploitation: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting the vulnerable Exponent CMS application. This can lead to complete compromise of the server, including data theft, modification, or denial of service.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability is exploited through HTTP GET requests. The attacker crafts a malicious URL that injects PHP code into a session file. Then, the attacker sends another HTTP GET request to the vulnerable 'calendarmodule' including the generated session file using a directory traversal technique in the 'view' parameter. The injected PHP code is then executed when the session file is included.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server, specifically to the 'index.php' script with a modified ‘view’ parameter. No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
