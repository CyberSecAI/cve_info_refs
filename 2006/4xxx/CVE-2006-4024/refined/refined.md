Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability is caused by an integer overflow in the calculation of the destination address for a memory copy operation. Specifically, the program checks if the sum of `LoadAddr` (offset) and `LoadSize` (size of data to copy) exceeds 0x100000, but it does not check if `LoadAddr` is negative. This allows an attacker to provide a negative value for `LoadAddr`, which when added to `LoadSize` can still pass the check, but results in writing data to memory locations before the allocated buffer.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Heap-based buffer overflow
- Integer overflow leading to out-of-bounds write

Impact of exploitation:
- Memory corruption, possibly leading to arbitrary code execution when free() is called. The vulnerability occurs when the program terminates and `free()` is called on the corrupted heap.

Attack vectors:
- Maliciously crafted .hes file. The vulnerability can be triggered by loading a specially crafted .hes file containing negative `LoadAddr` values.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker needs to provide a crafted .hes file to the application.
