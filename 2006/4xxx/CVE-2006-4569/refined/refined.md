{
  "CVE-2006-4569": {
    "description": "Firefox did not load manually opened, blocked popups in the right domain context, which could lead to cross-site scripting attacks. In order to exploit this issue an attacker would need to find a site which would frame their malicious page and convince the user to manually open a blocked popup.",
    "root_cause": "Firefox was incorrectly using the top-level document's security context when opening manually unblocked popups from the blocked popups icon in the status bar instead of the subframe's context which initiated the popup.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
      "Incorrect Security Context"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially perform cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks against a framing website.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Malicious website framed by a target site.",
      "User interaction required (manually opening a blocked popup)."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs to control a website that can be framed by a target website and convince the user to manually open a blocked popup."
