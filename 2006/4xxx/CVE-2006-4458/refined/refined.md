{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `class.holidaycalc.inc.php` file where the `country` parameter from the `GLOBALS['phpgw_info']['user']['preferences']['common']['country']` variable is used to construct a file path without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to control which file is included, leading to arbitrary code execution.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unsanitized input",
      "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)",
      "Use of GLOBALS array",
      "Lack of input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution on the server.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable script, injecting a path traversal sequence in the `GLOBALS[phpgw_info][user][preferences][common][country]` parameter, combined with a null byte to truncate the path to a log file which contains php code.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to send a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable script."
