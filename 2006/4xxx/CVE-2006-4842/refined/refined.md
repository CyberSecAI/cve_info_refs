{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Netscape Portable Runtime library (libnspr) allows users to specify a log file path via the `NSPR_LOG_FILE` environment variable. This log file is created with the privileges of the running process.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Arbitrary file write vulnerability. By setting the `NSPR_LOG_FILE` environment variable to a file path within a privileged directory, an attacker can create or overwrite a file with the privileges of the SUID executable.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Privilege escalation to root. An attacker can write a malicious shared object to a trusted library directory, then force a SUID executable to load this library, resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with root privileges.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local exploitation by a user who has access to a vulnerable SUID executable.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must have access to a user account on a vulnerable Solaris system and be able to execute SUID binaries linked to a vulnerable libnspr version.  The attacker also needs to be able to write to a directory, typically `/tmp`."
