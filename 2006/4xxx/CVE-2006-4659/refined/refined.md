  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2006-4659",
      "root_cause": "Insecure file permissions and insecure design of the SPAM filtering control engine.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insecure file permissions on the installation folder, allowing any user to modify service executables.",
         "Insecure design of the SPAM filtering control engine, which uses a local web server accessible through a predictable URL."
      ],
      "impact": "Local privilege escalation to SYSTEM level by replacing service executables, and remote control of SPAM filtering.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Local: Replacing service executables.",
        "Remote: Triggering a web request to the local spam filter control server through malicious web pages."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "Local: Unprivileged user. Remote: Attacker can control victim's web browser, potentially through a malicious website.",
       "additional_details": "The local privilege escalation vulnerability is due to the 'Everyone:Full Control' permission on the Panda installation folder allowing an unprivileged user to replace a service executable (e.g., WebProxy.exe for Panda Platinum 2006, or PAVSRV51.EXE for Panda Platinum 2007) with a malicious file, which will be executed with SYSTEM privileges upon reboot. The remote vulnerability is caused by a local web server at 127.0.0.1:6083, used to manage spam filtering through HTTP requests; this allows a remote attacker to force spam classification of messages by using malicious IMG tags in websites, thereby manipulating the Bayesian filter."
