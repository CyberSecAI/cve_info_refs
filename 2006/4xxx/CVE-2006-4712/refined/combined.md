It’s just data

### Attack Delivery TestSuite

---

2006-08-09T14:14:12Z

It is just a matter of time.  One of these days, some hacker will deface a [popular site](http://www.technorati.com/pop/blogs/) like [Engadget](http://www.engadget.com/).  But instead of putting something visible on the site, they will put something invisible in the feed.

By the magic of syndication, that data will then be distributed like spores to untold thousands of locations.  In the process it will be transported from a relatively untrusted location (like [BoingBoing](http://www.boingboing.net/)) to a place of equal or greater trust.  Places like popular portal sites, or just perhaps, to your very own hard drive.

From there, it will lie in wait until you check for news.  Invisibly it will spring into action.  You won’t even notice it running.  It will be able to do things that vary from uploading your preferences and passwords to a remote location, to downloading [malware](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware) onto your machine.  Shortly thereafter, this entry will be marked as read, or scroll off the bottom of your river of news, and you will never know how you just got [p0wned](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=p0wned).

Last week, [SPI Dynamics](http://www.spidynamics.com/) presented a [whitepaper](http://www.spidynamics.com/assets/documents/HackingFeeds.pdf) on this topic.  Underreported at the time was the cooperation and dedication that a number of authors of popular feed reader software have demonstrated to date.  Also underreported is the difficulty of reliably detecting the presence of JavaScript in feeds.

As a first step, [James Holderness](http://www.詹姆斯.com/) devised 85 tests for [Snarfer](http://www.snarfware.com/).  None of these tests attempt to do anything malicious, instead they simply attempt to produce a popup identifying the source of the exposure.  I’ve tried these tests against the latest [Universal Feed Parser](http://www.feedparser.org/), and in each case the javascript was either outright removed or otherwise rendered harmless.

Sometime in November (i.e., in about 90 days), and with James’s consent, I will commit these tests as a part of the Feed Parser [regression test suite](http://www.feedparser.org/tests/).  At which point, they will be open source, and easy to find by friend and foe alike.

Meanwhile, if you are developing software that consumes feeds, please get ahold of either James or myself and we will share these tests with you.  Contributions of additional tests are also welcome.

# Cross Context Scripting with Sage

> This month we have a guest blogger and his name is David Kierznowski, the founder of [Operation n - the adventures of Michaels Daw](http://michaeldaw.org/). David and I have been working together on various security related projects. He currently works as a security analyst and researcher. David contacted me after he found interesting anomaly with Sage Firefox Extension. These are his words:

I would often keep abreast of new vulnerabilities and exploits via my RSS feeds. Visiting page after page was just never fun. RSS allowed me to categorise, organise and track the security mayhem on the Internet. What was the point of employing a security analyst who was outdated and outgunned?

I decided to play with [Sage](http://sage.mozdev.org), which is a popular RSS extension for Mozilla Firefox. It had a friendly interface and a nice option to turn HTML tags on and off. This was a feature I was certainly interested in. It meant I could prevent a number of attacks outlined by SPI Dynamic's recent [RSS Injection whitepaper](http://www.spidynamics.com/assets/documents/HackingFeeds.pdf). The recommendation given in this paper was the typical recommendation given to XSS attacks. Escape `<>` to `&lt;&gt;`.

I turned off HTML tags and continued on as normal. However, something odd happened. When rendering my whitepaper [Awakening the Sleeping Giant](http://michaeldaw.org/projects/awakening-the-sleeping-giant-v10/) an insert of JavaScript was executed in my browser. How bazaar I thought. The security enabled feature makes me vulnerable. Sage was vulnerable to XSS! I immediately contacted pdp. We worked on it for 30 minutes and for those 30 minutes all you could hear were sinister laughs.

* **First**: Sage rendered `&lt;&gt;` as `<>`. This means JavaScript can be executed when HTML tags are turned off (not the default).
* **Second**: Logical mental progression put forward the question, what if we reversed it? `&lt;`, `&gt;` became `<>` when HTML tags were turned on (THE DEFAULT). This means we can effectively hack the latest version of Sage via RSS Injection regardless of which mode is set.
* **Thirdly**: Sage converts the feed into an HTML file and stores it on the local system. This means we were now in the browser's local zone policy. From here we could read any file from the local system.

The proof of concept feed can be downloaded from the following [URL](/files/2006/09/sage-feed-poc.xml).

PlasserThe feed did not work for me, so I looked closer and saw that request.send() throughs exceptions (which try catches). I simply added null as parameter to send: request.send(null). Then it worked.![pdp](//gravatar.com/avatar/c4db4e65c9f09f2a373fcaefa5e2bfb4?s=256&d=retro)pdpAlthough the original feed works in my browser, using the send method the way you are suggesting is more accurate so I fixed the feed. Thanks for that.![robert](//gravatar.com/avatar/558ede802d0fd782b5d41bc6205b88f5?s=256&d=retro)robertHello I am the author of the whitepaper, and blackhat presentation of which you speak.
