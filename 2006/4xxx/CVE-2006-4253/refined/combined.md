How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# USN-350-1: Thunderbird vulnerabilities

22 September 2006

Thunderbird vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 5.10](/security/notices?release=breezy)

## Details

This update upgrades Thunderbird from 1.0.8 to 1.5.0.7. This step was

necessary since the 1.0.x series is not supported by upstream any

more.

Various flaws have been reported that allow an attacker to execute

arbitrary code with user privileges by tricking the user into opening

a malicious email containing JavaScript. Please note that JavaScript

is disabled by default for emails, and it is not recommended to enable

it. ([CVE-2006-3113](/security/CVE-2006-3113), [CVE-2006-3802](/security/CVE-2006-3802), [CVE-2006-3803](/security/CVE-2006-3803), [CVE-2006-3805](/security/CVE-2006-3805),

[CVE-2006-3806](/security/CVE-2006-3806), [CVE-2006-3807](/security/CVE-2006-3807), [CVE-2006-3809](/security/CVE-2006-3809), [CVE-2006-3810](/security/CVE-2006-3810),

[CVE-2006-3811](/security/CVE-2006-3811), [CVE-2006-3812](/security/CVE-2006-3812), [CVE-2006-4253](/security/CVE-2006-4253), [CVE-2006-4565](/security/CVE-2006-4565),

[CVE-2006-4566](/security/CVE-2006-4566), [CVE-2006-4571](/security/CVE-2006-4571))

A buffer overflow has been discovered in the handling of .vcard files.

By tricking a user into importing a malicious vcard into his contacts,

this could be exploited to execute arbitrary code with the user's

privileges. ([CVE-2006-3804](/security/CVE-2006-3804))

The NSS library did not sufficiently check the padding of PKCS #1 v1.5

signatures if the exponent of the public key is 3 (which is widely

used for CAs). This could be exploited to forge valid signatures

without the need of the secret key. ([CVE-2006-4340](/security/CVE-2006-4340))

Jon Oberheide reported a way how a remote attacker could trick users

into downloading arbitrary extensions with circumventing the normal

SSL certificate check. The attacker would have to be in a position to

spoof the victim's DNS, causing them to connect to sites of the

attacker's choosing rather than the sites intended by the victim. If

they gained that control and the victim accepted the attacker's cert

for the Mozilla update site, then the next update check could be

hijacked and redirected to the attacker's site without detection.

([CVE-2006-4567](/security/CVE-2006-4567))

Georgi Guninski discovered that even with JavaScript disabled, a

malicous email could still execute JavaScript when the message is

viewed, replied to, or forwarded by putting the script in a remote XBL

file loaded by the message. ([CVE-2006-4570](/security/CVE-2006-4570))

The "enigmail" plugin and the translation packages have been updated

to work with the new Thunderbird version.

### Reduce your security exposure

these problems. An update will be provided shortly.

# USN-352-1: Thunderbird vulnerabilities

25 September 2006

Thunderbird vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Details

Various flaws have been reported that allow an attacker to execute

arbitrary code with user privileges by tricking the user into opening

a malicious email containing JavaScript. Please note that JavaScript

is disabled by default for emails, and it is not recommended to enable

it. ([CVE-2006-4253](/security/CVE-2006-4253), [CVE-2006-4565](/security/CVE-2006-4565), [CVE-2006-4566](/security/CVE-2006-4566), [CVE-2006-4571](/security/CVE-2006-4571))

The NSS library did not sufficiently check the padding of PKCS #1 v1.5

signatures if the exponent of the public key is 3 (which is widely

used for CAs). This could be exploited to forge valid signatures

without the need of the secret key. ([CVE-2006-4340](/security/CVE-2006-4340))

Jon Oberheide reported a way how a remote attacker could trick users

into downloading arbitrary extensions with circumventing the normal

SSL certificate check. The attacker would have to be in a position to

spoof the victim's DNS, causing them to connect to sites of the

attacker's choosing rather than the sites intended by the victim. If

they gained that control and the victim accepted the attacker's cert

for the Mozilla update site, then the next update check could be

hijacked and redirected to the attacker's site without

detection. ([CVE-2006-4567](/security/CVE-2006-4567))

Georgi Guninski discovered that even with JavaScript disabled, a

malicous email could still execute JavaScript when the message is

viewed, replied to, or forwarded by putting the script in a remote XBL

file loaded by the message. ([CVE-2006-4570](/security/CVE-2006-4570))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 6.06

* mozilla-thunderbird
  -
  1.5.0.7-0ubuntu0.6.06

After a standard system upgrade you need to restart Thunderbird to

effect the necessary changes.

[VULNERABILITY MANAGEMENT](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/products/besecure)

## Simplified network and application security testing

[### BeSTORM

A black box fuzzer, a method of dynamic application security testing, that uncovers unknown security weaknesses during the product development stage, so fixes can be made before a product is launched. This chaos testing style requires no source code to run and offers more than 250 pre-built protocols and modules or the option for custom protocols.](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/products/bestorm)

[### BeSECURE

A vulnerability assessment and management solution.  It enables your security team to accurately identify known vulnerabilities, using threat intelligence to prioritize them by risk. This allows the team to focus on the vulnerabilities that pose the highest risk to your infrastructure and cut through the false positives and low-priority weaknesses.](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/products/besecure)

Together, these solutions strengthen a product’s cybersecurity by adding SecOps into DevOps and through continual, automated vulnerability management and security posture reporting.

## **Vulnerability Management for a Variety of Industries**

Nearly every industry relies on applications and networks to conduct business, though some have more stringent security requirements than others. Organizations in the aviation, automotive, healthcare, and financial sectors have some of the strongest security regulations. Layers of security during software and application development as well as after product deployment are necessary to keep consumers safe and organizations compliant.

![airplane icon](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilitiesaviation.png)

### [Aviation](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guides/aviation-software-testing-guide)

Cybersecurity is crucial to the aviation industry. Travelers in the sky need to be protected from any attacks that can prevent airlines from operating normally. Those same customers need to have their payment and sensitive data protected when purchasing a ticket.

### [Automotive](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guide/how-fuzz-testing-helps-secure-automotive-industry)

Wireless connectivity is becoming commonplace inside of new vehicles. Automotive connectivity to WIFI and Bluetooth are making vehicles a bigger target for cybercriminals. One vulnerability can take down any vehicle with that technology. DAST, Black Box Fuzzing, and SAST during development are a solid foundation of security to prevent these attacks.

### [Healthcare and Medical](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guides/security-testing-for-networked-medical-devices)

Wireless technology and application software are being used more in medical devices to automate and monitor individual healthcare needs. Device security is the utmost priority, preventing risks that can directly endanger lives. Application security is needed to prevent cyber attackers from tampering with devices and stealing private healthcare data. SAST and DAST during development can help find vulnerabilities that can compromise these devices.

### Critical Infrastructure and Industrial Facilities

Water, power, and gas are some prime targets for large scale attacks. The best way to keep cyberattackers from taking down an entire city’s water supply is to create a layered cybersecurity portfolio. From the start, vulnerabilities need to be identified, remediated, and constantly monitored to prevent a mass standstill of public utilities.

### Discrete Manufacturers

Manufacturing industries keep building and assembling essential pieces for everyday life. Any attack on that automation would create a bottleneck in multiple industries that rely on these products. A disruption in manufacturing has been proven to drive up prices and create a negative workflow ripple worldwide. Using layered security solutions prior to deployment and scanning afterwards will help prevent any shutdown.

### Financial

Financial institutions are still top cyberattacker targets. Monetary apps for banks, credit unions, investment, and retirement firms need the highest cybersecurity measures. Security that prevents cyberattacks should be implemented during development and embedded directly into these applications. Compliance for this industry is only growing with each reported breach.

# USN-351-1: firefox vulnerabilities

23 September 2006

firefox vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Details

Various flaws have been reported that allow an attacker to execute

arbitrary code with user privileges by tricking the user into opening

a malicious web page containing JavaScript. ([CVE-2006-4253](/security/CVE-2006-4253),

[CVE-2006-4565](/security/CVE-2006-4565), [CVE-2006-4566](/security/CVE-2006-4566), [CVE-2006-4568](/security/CVE-2006-4568), [CVE-2006-4569](/security/CVE-2006-4569)

[CVE-2006-4571](/security/CVE-2006-4571))

The NSS library did not sufficiently check the padding of PKCS #1 v1.5

signatures if the exponent of the public key is 3 (which is widely

used for CAs). This could be exploited to forge valid signatures

without the need of the secret key. ([CVE-2006-4340](/security/CVE-2006-4340))

Jon Oberheide reported a way how a remote attacker could trick users

into downloading arbitrary extensions with circumventing the normal

SSL certificate check. The attacker would have to be in a position to

spoof the victim's DNS, causing them to connect to sites of the

attacker's choosing rather than the sites intended by the victim. If

they gained that control and the victim accepted the attacker's cert

for the Mozilla update site, then the next update check could be

hijacked and redirected to the attacker's site without

detection. ([CVE-2006-4567](/security/CVE-2006-4567))

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 6.06

* firefox
  -
  1.5.dfsg+1.5.0.7-ubuntu0.6.06
* libnss3
  -
  1.5.dfsg+1.5.0.7-ubuntu0.6.06

After a standard system upgrade you need to restart Firefox to effect

the necessary changes.

Please note that Firefox 1.0.8 in Ubuntu 5.10 and Ubuntu 5.04 are also

affected by these problems. Updates for these Ubuntu releases will be

delayed due to upstream dropping support for this Firefox version. We

strongly advise that you disable JavaScript to disable the attack

vectors for most vulnerabilities if you use one of these Ubuntu

versions. An update is currently in progress.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

That's (a) pretty much incompatible with remote code execution and (b) a sign that what's on the very top of the stack is irrelevant. Unfortunately talkback doesn't show anything else useful.

On Mac OS X I see a stack overflow (too-much-recursion crash).
...
45 nsCSSFrameConstructor::ConstructFrameInternal + 1500
46 nsCSSFrameConstructor::ConstructFrame + 252
47 nsCSSFrameConstructor::ProcessInlineChildren + 412
48 nsCSSFrameConstructor::ConstructInline + 172
49 nsCSSFrameConstructor::ConstructFrameByDisplayType + 1468
50 nsCSSFrameConstructor::ConstructFrameInternal + 1500
...
The Windows Talkback report also says this is a stack overflow.
From looking at part of the testcase I'd guess this is a dup of [bug 323394](/show_bug.cgi?id=323394 "RESOLVED INCOMPLETE - Crash due to too much recursion in frame construction (ffoxdie)").
I don't know what to make of Michal Zalewski's claim that there is a concurrency issue allowing JavaScript to interrupt the XML parser and cause a memory safety violation. It's hard to tell with the stack overflow crash getting in the way ;)

My bad - on a sufficiently fast link and test machine, the version provided on the website may reach a separate stack overflow condition before it gets to the actual problem. In other words, rendering <http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/ffoxdie.xml> alone will crash the browser due to a stack overflow, given enough time.
<http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/ffoxdie2.html> should be a version that works better with systems that crash with ffoxdie.html (in this example, ffoxdie2.xml is not considerably shorter). The caveat is that the attack window for Javascript-triggered reload action is shorter.

Is the frame in ffoxdie2.html supposed to be showing an XML parsing error? (the last x element is incomplete: "<x") I'm not crashing, that's eventually replaced with a "Congratulations" frame, but maybe the testcase is not working properly?
In the ffoxdie.html case I crash immediately with the stack overflow, before any XML parsing error is shown.Flags: blocking1.8.1?Flags: blocking1.8.0.7?

The behavior of the testcases I supplied is admittably quite weird - I can see no particular pattern, but they do cause a call stack overflow on some systems, and a more interesting crash on others.
Here's a slightly different on-reload issue that should give more predictable results: <http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/ffoxdie3.html> .

With this URL I don't crash anywhere (on Mac OS X, SuSE Linux or
Windows XP Pro, all using Firefox 1.5.0.6), even after repeated
reloads, and even if some of the reloads interrupt previous reloads
(in other words, if I click again on the reload button before the
script has finished running).
It might help, Michal, if you posted one of your own crash logs :-)

You seem to be in the minority as far as I'm concerned - I did test it on three separate platforms, and asked a couple folks at random to run a test for me. You might want to try ffoxdie3\_max.html, which tests a wider set of timings.

Does Firefox trunk crash on ffoxdie3.html / ffoxdie3\_max.html? Or does the trunk only suffer from the stack overflow on the other URLs?
Can you reproduce the crash in a clean profile (with no extensions)?
Do you have Talkback stack traces that show something other than random hex addresses? Random hex addresses do suggest the presence of a security hole but a stack trace showing \*only\* random hex addresses doesn't help much in diagnosing the bug.

That looks like the talkback server doesn't have the symbols for the build you're using. (The addresses look perfectly good, though.) Could you try with a newer build?

We don't need more confirmation of the stack overflow crash. We do need confirmation / a useful stack / a reduced testcase for the other crash.

I get the same results with this as with ffoxdie3.html -- no crashes.
(Once again I tested with Firefox 1.5.0.6.)
This time, in addition to sometimes clicking randomly on the reload
button while the script was running, I also sometimes randomly clicked
on the stop button, or closed the tab and/or the window before the
script had finished. (I did, of course, also try running the script
to its conclusion and then reloading.)
As I mentioned above, I have a ~1.3 megabit ADSL connection. And
though my Linux box is pretty fancy, that's not true of either my Mac
or my Windows "box" (which is actually a VMWare session running on top
of my Linux box).
For the record, I have:
1) A Linux box (running SuSE Linux 9.2) built around a Tyan Thunder
K8W motherboard with two 2GHz AMD Opteron CPUs (64-bit) and 2 gigs
or RAM.
2) Windows XP Pro running in a VMWare session on the Linux box with
256 megs of RAM.
3) A dual 1GHz PowerPC G4 Macintosh desktop with 512 megs of RAM, on
which I can run either Mac OS X 10.4.7 or 10.3.9 (I tested in both).
It may be relevant that I have very plain-vanilla installations of
Firefox on all three of these "machines" -- for example, none of them
have any extensions.

Of all unique IPs in my access-log with "Firefox" in User-Agent who visited ffoxdie3\_i.html subpage (which contains the Javascript-loaded payload, indicative that the test has started), 60% (about a hundred) did not load ffoxdie3\_ok.html (the "congratulations" page), suggesting a crash (not the stack overflow that frequently shows up in previous examples due to excessive nesting of XML tags).
This leds me to believe that this is really not that hard to reproduce, and that I'm not a lone bozo.
It really does not seem to be something that can't be reproduced; and I'm testing it with a vanilla installation of 1.5.0.6 on three separate machines, with no extensions installed.

I find that Mac OS X's crashreporterd's crash logs are much more
informative than those produced by Talkback. If you know of anyone
who has crashed on Mac OS X (excluding the stack overflow crashes that
have already been reported here), please encourage them to attach one
or more crashreporterd crash logs here.
They are quite long, so people who want to "post" their crashreporterd
crash logs here should choose "Create a New Attachment", instead of
just pasting the logs into a comment.
With each new crash, crashreporterd appends a new log to an
application-specific file in ~/Library/Logs/CrashReporter. Firefox
crashes get appended to firefox-bin.crash.log.

I think so. On the face of it, it looks like a window has received a
PAINT message for an object that (at least partially) no longer
exists. I suspect this could be a concurrency issue ... but I'm not
familiar with that part of the Mozilla.org codebase.

Trust me, no one thinks you're lone bozo.
Is there some systematic difference between your systems and ours? Old machines, fast machines, dual-processors, slow or fast network to the testcase site? For instance you probably hit it immediately over an in-house network.
I get 200 ms ping times to lcamtuf.coredump.cx, DSL, just tested the connection speed to be 1201/319 kbps.

Following your suggestions, my most recent crash log (I have had a few crashes before int he log) is nothing like them, and actually contains no stack info at all. I put it in the pastebin since it's worthless: <http://pastebin.mozilla.org/76>

Yes, I agree that it's worthless. They're usually a lot better --
they include stacks for all threads and the names of all loaded shared
libraries.
> TB22230962X
Also worthless -- it's just the stack overflow that's already been
reported.

with ffoxdie3\_max.html modified so the iframe is serverd by cgi (probably to avoid caching) i crash reliably (both locally and over the internet) on linux 1.5 and 2.0-latest but don't crash on trunk.
on 1.5 the stack always involves free() and on 2.0 the crash is in different places, but showing signs of memory corruption.
didn't hit the infinite recursion case.

in ffoxdie3\_max.html change:
document.getElementById('foo').src = "<http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/ffoxdie3_i.html>?" +Math.random();
to
document.getElementById('foo').src ="<http://somewhere/cgi/ffox.pl>?"+Math.random();
where ffox.pl is cgi:
#!/usr/bin/perl
print "Content-type: text/html\r\n\r\n";
print << 'EOF'

EOF
this crashes \*reliably\* 1.5 on linux and 1.5 && 2.0-latest on linux and macosx ppc.
trunk didn't crash.

Thank you very much for your detailed instructions. I followed them
very carefully ... and still no crashes :-( All my tests were with
Firefox 1.5.0.6. Later I'll try some other versions.
I served my edited ffoxdie3\_max.html and ffox.pl from Apache2 running
on my Linux box (i.e. I had a local, fast connection for both of those
files). I even was careful not to disturb the long, strange string in
ffoxdie3\_i.html -- I copied that file, changed its name to ffox.pl,
and edited around the string (rather than taking the chance of
changing it by copying and pasting).
I have \_no\_ idea what I'm doing "wrong" ... or "right" as the case may
be.
If you have some crash logs, please "attach" a selection of them
(using "Create a New Attachment"). As I've said above, Mac OS X
crashreporterd logs are particularly informative. Maybe someone will
be able to glean something from them.
Daniel, did you have any better luck than I did?

This one is more interesting, since it makes your other one and the ones in [comment 26](/show_bug.cgi?id=348514#c26 "RESOLVED FIXED - Crash at http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/ffoxdie.html (NOT due to too-much-recursion) [@ nsTextFrame::PrepareUnicodeText] [@ nsAutoIndexBuffer::~nsAutoIndexBuffer] (CVE-2006-4253)") make a little more sense -- showing what are probably some omitted frames in those, perhaps because it crashes earlier within PaintUnicodeText.

crashes:
linux: 1.5-latest, 2.0-latest
macosx: 2.0 (1.5 crashed at most once iirc, so 1.5 on mac eventually may be safe).
the stacks seem of little to me - imho the crash is quite after the bug.

Could this be the same thing as [bug 345071](/show_bug.cgi?id=345071 "VERIFIED FIXED - Crash [@ nsTextFrame::PrepareUnicodeText]")? My crashes in nsTextFrame::PrepareUnicodeText happen a bit before the spot patched in that bug (which looks like it involves BIDI text). Now that I can reproduce this reliably on my own machine I'll try trunk builds bracketing that checkin and see.

valgrind may help debug this.
timings that work for me on lan with static iframe:
if (counter < 3) {
...
setTimeout('foo()', 2150 \* counter);
^^dependent on machine speed.
valgrind detects invlid write and exits due to "the 'impossible' happened".
don't have debug branch ATM

That's the assertion from roc's [bug 345071](/show_bug.cgi?id=345071 "VERIFIED FIXED - Crash [@ nsTextFrame::PrepareUnicodeText]") I mentioned in [comment 40](/show_bug.cgi?id=348514#c40 "RESOLVED FIXED - Crash at http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/ffoxdie.html (NOT due to too-much-recursion) [@ nsTextFrame::PrepareUnicodeText] [@ nsAutoIndexBuffer::~nsAutoIndexBuffer] (CVE-2006-4253)"). Maybe they are the same. I couldn't reproduce this bug on the trunk just prior to that patch, I guess I'll have to try porting the patch to a branch and do a non-debug build (since I can't reproduce the timing in a debug build either).

On an optimized-with-symbols FF1.5.0.7 I get a completely different stack. Its possible the heap was already trashed by the nsTextFrame bug and I simply randomly crashed somewhere else, so I'm still going to try applying roc's patch.

for me the crashes are with different stack, which is consistent with screwed heap.
debug branch crashes with default timings over the internet, but not on the lan.
not sure if trunk is safe - with longer string and different timings trunk crashed once in free(), but couldn't reproduce it later.
is it sure that the warning about overwriting memory indeed causes the problem?

> is it sure that the warning about overwriting memory indeed causes the problem?
Not sure, no, but it's a reasonable guess given the symptoms.
Starting with a build that consistently reproduced the crash (the stack in [comment 46](/show_bug.cgi?id=348514#c46 "RESOLVED FIXED - Crash at http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/ffoxdie.html (NOT due to too-much-recursion) [@ nsTextFrame::PrepareUnicodeText] [@ nsAutoIndexBuffer::~nsAutoIndexBuffer] (CVE-2006-4253)") and others that looked like [comment 8](/show_bug.cgi?id=348514#c8 "RESOLVED FIXED - Crash at http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/ffoxdie.html (NOT due to too-much-recursion) [@ nsTextFrame::PrepareUnicodeText] [@ nsAutoIndexBuffer::~nsAutoIndexBuffer] (CVE-2006-4253)")) I no longer crashed on the testcase after applying the patch from [bug 345071](/show_bug.cgi?id=345071 "VERIFIED FIXED - Crash [@ nsTextFrame::PrepareUnicodeText]"). I think we've nailed it.
The one nagging doubt is that the [bug 345071](/show_bug.cgi?id=345071 "VERIFIED FIXED - Crash [@ nsTextFrame::PrepareUnicodeText]") heap overflow should have been entirely reproduceable, it should not have required reload timing games.Assignee: nobody → dveditzDepends on: [345071](/show_bug.cgi?id=345071 "VERIFIED FIXED - Crash [@ nsTextFrame::PrepareUnicodeText]")Flags: blocking1.8.1?Flags: blocking1.8.1-Flags: blocking1.8.0.7?Flags: blocking1.8.0.7+Whiteboard: apears fixed by 345071

can't see [bug 345071](/show_bug.cgi?id=345071 "VERIFIED FIXED - Crash [@ nsTextFrame::PrepareUnicodeText]") so can't comment on it.
believe that the indexp issue can be easily fixed with 2 macros - one for the condition in the loop and one checking for overflow. this may be a kludge.
just informing for overflow and then continuing execution is strange coding practice.

[bug 345071](/show_bug.cgi?id=345071 "VERIFIED FIXED - Crash [@ nsTextFrame::PrepareUnicodeText]") has been checked into the branch, available as "1.5.0.7" builds at <http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/latest-mozilla1.8.0/> (or go up a directory and pick an explicit date Aug 26 or later).
The patch resolves the problem \*I\* see, but I've never been quite sure I'm seeing the same thing Michal is reporting. In addition his posts to Bugtraq seemed to indicate he saw a different problem with ffoxdie3 than the original ffoxdie, and [bug 345071](/show_bug.cgi?id=345071 "VERIFIED FIXED - Crash [@ nsTextFrame::PrepareUnicodeText]") addresses what I saw with ffoxdie3.
Michal: does this resolve the original problem, or are you still seeing it even after that fix.

i crashed before (no recursion), but don't crash after the patch.
note that this may mean that the timings/lengths after the patch are different (tried different lengths/timings without crash).

I see both testcases crashing in FF beta2 on Windows - Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1b2) Gecko/20060821 Firefox/2.0b2. On the Mac I crashed both testcases using today's Bon Echo nightly.

Those are both the less interesting stack-overflow problem. Is there a bug filed on limiting the recursion levels and giving up at a sane point?

We try to avoid this kind of stack overflow by limiting the depth of the content tree. At least, the HTML parser tries to. Dunno about XML.

What you see here is the too-deep-recursion crash which is dealt with in [bug 323394](/show_bug.cgi?id=323394 "RESOLVED INCOMPLETE - Crash due to too much recursion in frame construction (ffoxdie)").
This bug is for the "NOT due to too-much-recursion" (See bug title) issue, which the reporter intended to show.

It certainly doesn't happen here in firefox 2 final, current edgy version, any of the three exploits (ffdie.html, ffdie2.html, ffdie3.html) seem to do anything

Just because you crash on the testcase doesn't mean you're seeing \*this\* bug. You're probably seeing [bug 323394](/show_bug.cgi?id=323394 "RESOLVED INCOMPLETE - Crash due to too much recursion in frame construction (ffoxdie)"), which does not have the potential for remote code execution.

firefox security update (RHSA-2006-0675)

Original Release Date: October 12, 2006

Last Revised: October 12, 2006

Number: ASA-2006-224

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 1.0

Advisory Status: Interim

---

## 1. Overview:

Firefox is a popular open source Web browser.

Vulnerable versions of Firefox were found to contain bugs in the
regular
expression parsing routines. When viewing a malformed and/or
malicious
webpage, Firefox could possibly crash or arbitrary code could be
executed
as the user running Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures
project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names
[CVE-2006-4565](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4565) and
[CVE-2006-4566](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4566) to these issues.

Numerous unspecified vulnerabilities were found in Firefox which
could allow
a malicious web page to crash Firefox or possibly execute arbitrary
code as
the user running Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2006-4571](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4571) to this issue.

Firefox's handling of timed Javascript events was found to contain a
security
vulnerability. If Firefox viewed a malformed webpage, it could crash
or
arbitrary code could be executed as the user running Firefox. The
Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned
the name
[CVE-2006-4253](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4253) to this issue.

The NSS library Firefox bundles internally was found to contain a bug
in its
implementation of RSA signature verification. If an RSA key had an
exponent
of 3, an attacker could possibly craft a digital signature that would
appear
to be from a Certificate Authority that hadn't actually signed the
certificate. A small number of the root Certificate Authority RSA
keys
Firefox shipped with contained an exponent of 3. The Common
Vulnerabilities
and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2006-4340](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4340) to this issue.

The auto-update verification mechanism in Firefox was found to
contain a
security vulnerability. If a malicious attacker could get a user to
accept
an unverifiable certificate and then get the user to read spoofed DNS
entries, the attacker could get Firefox to download and install
arbitrary
code. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the name
[CVE-2006-4567](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4567) to this issue.

A cross-site scripting issue was found in Firefox's handling of
sub-frames
when the sub-frame belonged to a different domain than the main
frame. A
frame could possibly inject content into the sub-frame belonging to
another
domain. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the name
[CVE-2006-4568](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4568) to this issue.

Due to a flaw in Firefox's handling of blocked popups that were
manually
blocked, a cross-site scripting attack was possible where a malicious
attacker could possibly get a user to manually open a blocked popup.
The
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the
name
[CVE-2006-4569](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4569) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the
security
advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2006-0675.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with Firefox installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Messaging Storage Server | MSS 3.0 | Low | See recommended actions below.  This issue will be addressed in accordance with [Avaya's Product Security Vulnerability Response Policy](http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/security_vulnerability_response.pdf) |

**Recommended Actions:**
For all system products which use
vulnerable
versions of Firefox, Avaya recommends that customers restrict local
and
network access to the server. This restriction should be enforced
through the
use of physical security, firewalls, ACLs, VPNs, and other
generally-accepted
networking practices until such time as an update becomes available
and can
be installed.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating
systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying
operating
system or applications that come with the operating system. These
vulnerabilities often do not impact the software-only product
directly but
may threaten the integrity of the underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not
affected by
the vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be.
Customers should determine on which Linux operating system the
product was
installed and then follow that vendors guidance:

## 4. Software-Only Products:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CVLAN | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. The CVLAN application does not require the software described in this advisory. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite(IMS) | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. The IMS application does not require the software described in this advisory. |

**Recommended Actions:**
Avaya recommends that customers follow
recommended actions supplied by the Operating System vendor (e.g.
RedHat
Linux) or remove the affected package.

## 5. Additional Information:

Additional information may also be available via the Avaya support
[website](http://support.avaya.com) and through your Avaya
account
representative. Please contact your Avaya product support
representative, or

# Mozilla Firefox: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200609-19**

The Mozilla Foundation has reported numerous vulnerabilities in Mozilla
Firefox, including one that may allow execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-client/mozilla-firefox** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.5.0.7** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.5.0.7** |

| Package | **www-client/mozilla-firefox-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.5.0.7** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.5.0.7** |

### Background

Mozilla Firefox is a redesign of the Mozilla Navigator component. The
goal is to produce a cross-platform, stand-alone browser application.

### Description

A number of vulnerabilities were found and fixed in Mozilla Firefox.
For details please consult the references below.

### Impact

The most severe vulnerability involves enticing a user to visit a
malicious website, crashing the browser and executing arbitrary code
with the rights of the user running the application.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Mozilla Firefox users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-1.5.0.7"
```

Users of the binary package should upgrade as well:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-bin-1.5.0.7"
```

| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=345071#c0)• 19 years ago |
|  | |

I've encountered an html page that will crash ff1.5 (downloaded from mozilla.org way back when) and current trunk (a debug build I've built myself using vc8). The page is very large, and only crashes if you keep hitting the End key on your keyboard while the page is loading. Testing on the debug trunk build, most of the time the firefox process just disappears. There's no warning, no prompt to open the debugger. Nothing. Sometimes I get the exception:
###!!! ASSERTION: yikes - we just overwrote memory: 'indexp <= aIndexBuffer->mBuffer + aIndexBuffer->mBufferLen', file c:/mozilla/trees/trunk/mozilla/layout/generic/nsTextFrame.cpp, line 2375

and on entering the debugger from there the stack is:

I then get a considerable number (~50) of these assertions:
###!!! ASSERTION: recursive painting not permitted: '!IsPainting()', file c:/mozilla/trees/trunk/mozilla/view/src/nsViewManager.cpp, line 505
before I get a VS window that says something about heap corruption and buffer overflow/overrun. Continuing from that I get a crash. The times I've managed to get the debugger up \*and\* get to this VS window I've had to kill VS because I keep running out of memory. Therefore I haven't got a stack from a the crash that follows this series of events, but some of the time I get a crash without any assertions and VS window. One such stack is below. The message I got with this stack was "an unhandled win32 exception occured in firefox.exe [5152]".

Could you attach the page causing this? (compress it if it's too big)
Or put it up on a web server somewhere?

Mats: sorry, I forgot to mention that the file isn't something I can share at this point - hence why I'm trying to provide as much info as possible. I'm seeking permission from my boss to give access to at least some people, and I'll do some more testing to see if I can't reproduce on a modified or alternative file tomorrow.

[reduced build log that causes crash (7-zipped)](attachment.cgi?id=231017)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=231017&action=edit)

Here's the offending log. We believe all potentially sensitive lines have been removed, but please still treat this as confidential and limited to the security group.
The crash seems like it may be slightly harder to reproduce now that there are fewer lines in the log, but the pattern to reproduce it is still the same: as soon as the page starts loading hit the End button rapidly and it will crash. The faster you hit the End button, the more likely it is to crash and the more likely it is that the process will die without you even being asked if you want to open a debugger. Slightly slower and you are more likely to be asked if you want to open a debugger. Too slow and it will load without crashing.

[automatic testcase](attachment.cgi?id=232543)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=232543&action=edit)

This testcase 'automatically hits' the End key, and I've made the text more unreadable by replacing a lot of characters with 'x'.
Maybe this is useful, it only works locally (and current trunk build), because of the use of enhanced privileges.

Yes, that's correct, it's a very large html file, I'm not sure if it can be made much smaller and still crash.

This is an overflow of nsAutoIndexBuffer. We get into PaintUnicodeText with the frame mapping 55 characters starting at offset 1796 (the entire textnode is 5947 characters). I'm not sure how we get into this state, something to do with incremental parsing/reflow or something. Anyway, it's not necessarily wrong.
The problem is that PaintUnicodeText sets up the nsAutoIndexBuffer to have enough entries for mContentLen, 55 characters. But PrepareUnicodeText calls nsTextTransformer::GetNextWord starting at offset 1796 and finds a word 582 characters long. It then proceeds to fill the nsAutoIndexBuffer with 582 entries which wipes out the stack.

We just need to extend these checks that already exist.
I'm not 100% sure about this, there could be some unexpected situation where we rely on going past the frame bounds, perhaps. I doubt it. This needs to bake on trunk before we think about branches, although it is needed on branches.Assignee: nobody → rocStatus: NEW → ASSIGNED

fwiw, except that i don't understand what it means by automatic, i had to manually press end repeatedly to get it to crash.
note that trunk builds will let you build these urls youself just do

That bothers me too. Or maybe we don't rely on going past the frame bounds but we really should, e.g. if there are combining characters split between two frames, which we tend to mess up.
As you say, let's bake this on the trunk with the intention of getting it on the branches as a bandaid and doing something smarter on the trunk in the long term.

This fixes a serious maybe-potentially-exploitable stack overflow.
See [comment #16](/show_bug.cgi?id=345071#c16 "VERIFIED FIXED - Crash [@ nsTextFrame::PrepareUnicodeText]"); we're not 100% confident of the correctness. If it does cause problems, they should only occur in very rare cases where this would already have overflowed with unpredictable results.

The reason I ask about the 1.8.0 branch is because this patch appears to fix [bug 348514](/show_bug.cgi?id=348514 "RESOLVED FIXED - Crash at http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/ffoxdie.html (NOT due to too-much-recursion) [@ nsTextFrame::PrepareUnicodeText] [@ nsAutoIndexBuffer::~nsAutoIndexBuffer] (CVE-2006-4253)"), reported to Bugtraq/Full-Disclosure by Michal Zalewski. It would be really nice to get it into 1.8.0.7 if it's not unduly risky.

i am not sure this is effective - race conditions are difficult to debug and timing dependent.
modification of lcamtuf's bug crashed trunk only once with this patch, so i may have the timings wrong.
what about checking that |indexp| doesn't overflow and if tries to overflow just return - probably will be easy with 2 macros - one conditional and one warning and returning?
just warning about overflow and continuing execution is quite strange coding practice.

There are legitimate cases where the condition happens -- where we deliberate want to chop the text. The catch-22 is to identify the illegimate cases (of real overflow).

is there a testcase where the condition happens, i.e. the romantic assertion is hit?

You seem to be referring to something else (the painting?). I was referring to the patch (and its vicinity -- see also [comment 13](/show_bug.cgi?id=345071#c13 "VERIFIED FIXED - Crash [@ nsTextFrame::PrepareUnicodeText]")).
It seems unlikely to hit the 'yikes' assertion at this point (with this patch), if we do, it would mean that there is a bad caller who didn't .Grow() a large enough buffer. Looking a the call sites, they seemed to be fine to me. But we can add a further protection:
PRInt32 n = mContentLength;
+ if (aIndexBuffer) {
+ NS\_ASSERTION(n < aIndexBuffer->mBufferLen, "bad caller");
+ n = PR\_MAX(n, aIndexBuffer->mBufferLen-1);
+ }

yes, i meant the 'yikes' assertion - believe that if it is hit, memory is overwritten - exploitable state.
to clarify what i meant - add the condition of the 'yikes' assertion in the loops where indexp is written to. after the loop check if it exited due to indexp too large, warn and return() - probably via macros.
note that just abort()ing on the assertion leaves another race and may not be safe for other reasons.

+ n = PR\_MAX(n, aIndexBuffer->mBufferLen-1);
s/PR\_MAX/PR\_MIN/
If we still hit the assertion, that code should really be re-audited to see it is scanning pass the maximum given length (n).

asynchronous events make auditing really difficult. both testcases (this one and lcamtuf's bug) that trigger the assertion relied on timing afaik.
though the problem may be somewhere else, not in nsTextFrame.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2006-59

## Concurrency-related vulnerability

Announced
September 14, 2006
Reporter
Jonathan Watt, Michal Zalewski
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox 1.5.0.7
* SeaMonkey 1.0.5
* Thunderbird 1.5.0.7

### Description

Jonathan Watt and Michal Zalewski independently reported timing dependent
testcases that trigger crashes at the same place during text display.
We have seen no demonstration that these crashes could be reliably
exploited, but they do show evidence of memory corruption so we presume
they could be.

Thunderbird shares the browser engine with Firefox
and could be vulnerable if JavaScript were to be enabled in mail. This is not
the default setting and we strongly discourage users from enabling
JavaScript in mail.

### Workaround

Disable JavaScript until you can upgrade to a fixed version. Do not enable
JavaScript in mail clients such as Thunderbird.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
