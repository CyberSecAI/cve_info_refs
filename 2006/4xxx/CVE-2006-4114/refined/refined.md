Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of sanitization of the `$idsite` parameter in the `view_com.php` script of PHPMyRing. This parameter is directly used in an SQL query without proper escaping or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- SQL Injection: The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. An attacker can manipulate the `$idsite` parameter to inject arbitrary SQL code into the database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: An attacker can use SQL injection to extract sensitive data from the database, such as admin login credentials (username and password).

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP GET Request: The attack is performed by sending a specially crafted GET request to `view_com.php`, including the malicious SQL injection in the `idsite` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Remote Access: The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- Knowledge of Vulnerable Application: The attacker needs to know the application path and the vulnerable parameter name (`idsite`).
- No Authentication Required: The vulnerability can be exploited without prior authentication.

**Technical Details:**
- Vulnerable Code: The vulnerable code is located within the `view_com.php` file, specifically in the following SQL query:
```php
$row=mysql_fetch_array(requete("SELECT site_nom FROM webring WHERE idsite=$idsite"));
```
- Exploitation Technique: The attacker injects malicious SQL code into the `$idsite` parameter, such as `-1 UNION SELECT passadm FROM webring_adm` to retrieve admin passwords or `-1 UNION SELECT loginadm FROM webring_adm` to retrieve admin usernames.
- The provided perl script automates the exploitation process, crafting the malicious HTTP GET requests and parsing the responses to extract the admin credentials.
