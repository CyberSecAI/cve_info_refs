  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the PASV response handling of Ipswitch WS_FTP LE 5.08.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer overflow in PASV response handling."
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution on the server.",
    "attack_vectors": "Remote attack via a crafted PASV response.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to send a crafted PASV response to the vulnerable FTP server. The provided exploit demonstrates the server component, the attacker is connecting to the vulnerable client software which is parsing the malformed response and thus triggering the overflow.",
    "additional_details": "The provided exploit code targets different Windows versions by using specific return addresses. The exploit overwrites the return address in the stack with the address of a jmp esi instruction in order to gain control of the execution flow."
