## Releases

* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Details

A flaw was discovered in dvb ULE decapsulation. A remote attacker could

send a specially crafted message and cause a denial of service.

([CVE-2006-4623](/security/CVE-2006-4623))

The compat\_sys\_mount function allowed local users to cause a denial of

service when mounting a smbfs filesystem in compatibility mode.

([CVE-2006-7203](/security/CVE-2006-7203))

The Omnikey CardMan 4040 driver (cm4040\_cs) did not limit the size of

buffers passed to read() and write(). A local attacker could exploit

this to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges. ([CVE-2007-0005](/security/CVE-2007-0005))

Due to an variable handling flaw in the ipv6\_getsockopt\_sticky()

function a local attacker could exploit the getsockopt() calls to read

arbitrary kernel memory. This could disclose sensitive data.

([CVE-2007-1000](/security/CVE-2007-1000))

Ilja van Sprundel discovered that Bluetooth setsockopt calls could

leak kernel memory contents via an uninitialized stack buffer. A local

attacker could exploit this flaw to view sensitive kernel information.

([CVE-2007-1353](/security/CVE-2007-1353))

A flaw was discovered in the handling of netlink messages. Local

attackers could cause infinite recursion leading to a denial of service.

([CVE-2007-1861](/security/CVE-2007-1861))

The random number generator was hashing a subset of the available entropy,

leading to slightly less random numbers. Additionally, systems without

an entropy source would be seeded with the same inputs at boot time,

leading to a repeatable series of random numbers. ([CVE-2007-2453](/security/CVE-2007-2453))

A flaw was discovered in the PPP over Ethernet implementation. Local

attackers could manipulate ioctls and cause kernel memory consumption

leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2007-2525](/security/CVE-2007-2525))

An integer underflow was discovered in the cpuset filesystem. If mounted,

local attackers could obtain kernel memory using large file offsets

while reading the tasks file. This could disclose sensitive data.

([CVE-2007-2875](/security/CVE-2007-2875))

Vilmos Nebehaj discovered that the SCTP netfilter code did not correctly

validate certain states. A remote attacker could send a specially

crafted packet causing a denial of service. ([CVE-2007-2876](/security/CVE-2007-2876))

Luca Tettamanti discovered a flaw in the VFAT compat ioctls on 64-bit

systems. A local attacker could corrupt a kernel\_dirent struct and

cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2007-2878](/security/CVE-2007-2878))

A flaw was discovered in the cluster manager. A remote attacker could

connect to the DLM port and block further DLM operations.

([CVE-2007-3380](/security/CVE-2007-3380))

A flaw was discovered in the usblcd driver. A local attacker could

cause large amounts of kernel memory consumption, leading to a denial

of service. ([CVE-2007-3513](/security/CVE-2007-3513))

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

kernel security update (RHSA-2006-0689)

Original Release Date: November 16, 2006

Last Revised: November 16, 2006

Number: ASA-2006-249

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 1.0

Advisory Status: Interim

---

## 1. Overview:

The Linux kernel manages the communication between software and
hardware as
well as the hardware resources of a computer running the Linux
operating
system.

Red Hat has issued an updated version of the kernel packages for
Enterprise
Linux 4. Below is a list of the security issues fixed in the update
as
reported by Red Hat:

* a flaw in the SCTP support that allowed a local user to cause a
  denial
  of service (crash) with a specific SO\_LINGER value.
* a flaw in the hugepage table support that allowed a local
  user to cause
  a denial of service (crash).
* a flaw in the hugepage table support that allowed a local
  user to cause
  a denial of service (crash).
* a flaw in the mprotect system call that allowed setting
  write permission
  for a read-only attachment of shared memory.
* a flaw in HID0[31] (en\_attn) register handling on PowerPC
  970 systems
  that allowed a local user to cause a denial of service.
  (crash)
* a flaw in the perfmon support of Itanium systems that
  allowed a local
  user to cause a denial of service by consuming all file
  descriptors.
* a flaw in the ATM subsystem. On systems with installed ATM
  hardware and
  configured ATM support, a remote user could cause a denial of
  service
  (panic) by accessing socket buffers memory after freeing
  them.
* a flaw in the DVB subsystem. On systems with installed DVB
  hardware and
  configured DVB support, a remote user could cause a denial of
  service
  (panic) by sending a ULE SNDU packet with length of 0.
* an information leak in the network subsystem that possibly
  allowed a
  local user to read sensitive data from kernel memory.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned
the names
[CVE-2006-4535](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4535),
[CVE-2005-4811](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-4811),
[CVE-2006-2071](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-2071),
[CVE-2006-4093](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4093),
[CVE-2006-3741](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-3741),
[CVE-2006-4997](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4997),
[CVE-2006-4623](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4623), and
[CVE-2006-0039](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-0039) to these issues.

security
advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2006-0689.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with kernel installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya S87XX/S8500/S8300 | CM 2.x and 3.x | Low | See recommended actions below.  This issue will be addressed in accordance with [Avaya's Product Security Vulnerability Response Policy](http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/security_vulnerability_response.pdf) |
| Avaya Messaging Storage Server | MSS 3.0 | Low | See recommended actions below.  This issue will be addressed in accordance with [Avaya's Product Security Vulnerability Response Policy](http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/security_vulnerability_response.pdf) |
| Avaya CCS/SES | 2.x and 3.x | Low | See recommended actions below.  This issue will be addressed in accordance with [Avaya's Product Security Vulnerability Response Policy](http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/security_vulnerability_response.pdf) |

**Recommended Actions:**
For all system products which use
vulnerable
versions of the kernel, Avaya recommends that customers restrict
local and
network access to the server. This restriction should be enforced
through the
use of physical security, firewalls, ACLs, VPNs, and other
generally-accepted
networking practices until such time as an update becomes available
and can
be installed.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating
systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying
operating
system or applications that come with the operating system. These
vulnerabilities often do not impact the software-only product
directly but
may threaten the integrity of the underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not
affected by
the vulnerabilities directly but the underlying Linux platform may
be.
Customers should determine on which Linux operating system the
product was
installed and then follow that vendors guidance.

## 4. Software-Only Products:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CVLAN | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. The CVLAN application does not require the software described in this advisory. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite(IMS) | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. The IMS application does not require the software described in this advisory. |

**Recommended Actions:**
Avaya recommends that customers follow
recommended actions supplied by RedHat Linux.

## SUSE Security

# A Process That Never Ends

### SUSE is committed to delivering best effort security to its customers and to the Open Source community. We believe that trust in Open Source Software security in general, and the user's privacy in particular, are both indispensable and indefeasible.

We treat software security as a process that never ends. This means we:

* Promptly react to security incidents and deliver premium quality security updates
* Continuously improve the security-related functionality in SUSE products
* Continuously contribute to the rapidly growing maturity of Open Source Software
* Respect the Open Source Software security principles of openness, transparency and traceability

Software security is a complex challenge. Software can provide many of its own security features, such as authentication methods, encryption, intrusion prevention and detection, and backup.

At the same time, it can also contain errors (both deliberate and accidental) that can affect the system's security, including design flaws, programming errors, and backdoors.

The SUSE Security Team addresses all of these aspects of software security, on an ongoing basis. Software security cannot be thought of as a state you can achieve at a specific point in time. Instead, it is a process that must be executed with professional expertise and continuous development. This persistent focus is what has given Open Source Software, Linux and SUSE such an excellent reputation for security.
