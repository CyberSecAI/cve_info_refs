```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the 'torrents.php' file when processing the 'cat' parameter, which allows for SQL injection.

- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL Injection vulnerability.

- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, including usernames, passwords, and emails.

- Attack vectors: The attacker sends a crafted HTTP GET request to `torrents.php` with a malicious SQL payload in the `cat` parameter.

- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
