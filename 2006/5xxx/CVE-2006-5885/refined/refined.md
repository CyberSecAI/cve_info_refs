      "description": "NuStore 1.0 is vulnerable to SQL injection in the Products.asp page. By manipulating the CategoryID and SubCatagoryID parameters, an attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code.",
      "impact": "Successful exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to sensitive data disclosure (e.g., passwords from the 'customers' or 'customeremail' tables).",
      "attack_vector": "The attacker crafts a malicious URL with SQL code injected into the CategoryID and SubCatagoryID parameters of the Products.asp page.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker only needs a web browser to send a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable page. No authentication is required.",
      "technical_details": "The vulnerability exists due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the CategoryID and SubCatagoryID parameters before using it in a SQL query. The exploit uses a 'UNION SELECT' statement to extract data from the database.",
