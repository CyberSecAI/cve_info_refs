**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from improper handling of the `XML.prototype.hasOwnProperty()` JavaScript method in Mozilla products using the ECMAScript for XML (E4X) specification. This improper handling can lead to memory corruption.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Memory Corruption:** The core issue is that the method could corrupt memory leading to crashes or arbitrary code execution.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.
    *   **Application Crash:** The vulnerable application may crash.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Remote, unauthenticated:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
    *  **Malicious Web Pages/Email:** Attackers could use specially crafted web pages or emails containing malicious JavaScript code to trigger the vulnerability.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to induce a user to visit a malicious web page or open a specially crafted email.
   *   No specific user interaction apart from opening/visiting the malicious content.

**3. Additional Details from the Bugzilla Entries (Bug 355569):**

*   The bug was initially reported with a proof of concept exploit.
*   The crash could be triggered by manipulating the `XML.prototype.hasOwnProperty` method with a specific number.
*   The fix involved addressing a crash related to E4X and `hasOwnProperty`.
*   The vulnerability is related to the E4X implementation.

**4. Additional Details from the Bugzilla Entries (Bug 349527):**

* This bug describes a Garbage Collection (GC) hazard in the handling of JavaScript error reports.
*   The vulnerability resides in the function `exn_newPrivate` in `js/src/jsexn.c`, specifically how it handles `linebuf` and `tokenptr` (which are pointers to cached deflated strings).
*   A `finally` block, with an inner `try-catch` block, calling `gc()`, can trigger GC before the error is reported. This would free the string cache leading to a segmentation fault when the error handler accesses the freed memory.
* The fix for this involved making a copy of the necessary strings using a single buffer to avoid multiple malloc/free calls. There were multiple iterations of the fix to address related issues.
* The fix was eventually backported to the 1.8.0 branch as well.

**5.  Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Disable JavaScript:** The vulnerability can be mitigated by disabling JavaScript. However, this may impact usability.
*   **Apply Patches/Updates:**  The primary solution is to update to the patched versions of the software, as listed in the provided sources (Firefox 1.5.0.8, Thunderbird 1.5.0.8, and SeaMonkey 1.0.6).
*   **Restrict Network Access:**  Restrict local and network access to affected servers through firewalls, ACLs, etc.

**6.  Red Hat Specific Information (RHSA-2006:0733, RHSA-2006:0734, RHSA-2006:0735):**

*   Red Hat issued security advisories (RHSA-2006:0733, RHSA-2006:0734 and RHSA-2006:0735) to address CVE-2006-5462, CVE-2006-5463, CVE-2006-5464, CVE-2006-5747, and CVE-2006-5748.
*   These advisories provide specific package updates for Firefox, SeaMonkey, and Thunderbird, respectively on Red Hat Enterprise Linux systems.

**7. Ubuntu Specific Information (USN-381-1 and USN-382-1):**

* Ubuntu Security Notices (USN-381-1 for Firefox and USN-382-1 for Thunderbird) were issued, which also address CVE-2006-5462, CVE-2006-5463, CVE-2006-5464, CVE-2006-5747, and CVE-2006-5748.
* These notices provide specific package updates for Firefox and Thunderbird on Ubuntu systems.

**8. Gentoo Specific Information (GLSA 200612-06 & GLSA 200612-08):**
*  Gentoo Linux issued security advisories to address the vulnerabilities in Thunderbird and SeaMonkey.

**Summary:**

CVE-2006-5747 describes a critical memory corruption vulnerability in the `XML.prototype.hasOwnProperty()` method of Mozilla products' JavaScript implementation. The vulnerability could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service via a specially crafted webpage or email. Patches for this vulnerability are available in Firefox 1.5.0.8, Thunderbird 1.5.0.8, SeaMonkey 1.0.6, as well as through updates to these programs via Red Hat, Ubuntu and Gentoo Linux.
