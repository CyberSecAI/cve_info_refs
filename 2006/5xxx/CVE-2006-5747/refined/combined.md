User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20061010 Firefox/2.0
Build Identifier: Thunderbird/1.5.0.8 (as well as the Trunk nightly builds)
After upgrading from 1.5.0.7 to 1.5.0.8, I determined that \*certain\* new mail (specifically, new mail sent by the X-Mailer "Chilkat Software Inc (<http://www.chilkatsoft.com>)") did not appear in either the Inbox, or in the subfolder where it was sent by my filter (even though the subfolder had an "arrow" indicating new mail). I also found that mail previously (pre-upgrade) received from a Chilkat X-Mailer \*or\* from an X-Mailer of either "JMail 4.4 by Dimac" or "JMail 4.5 by Dimac" was no longer visible in 1.5.0.8 (I haven't received any mail sent via JMail post-upgrade, so I haven't been able to test that). So far, I have only seen the problem affect mail sent from one of these 2 X-Mailers, though my testing is by no means exhaustive.
It seems that the crux of the problem is an inability to process the headers of e-mail generated by these 2 X-Mailers, and that inability results in a corrupt \*.msf file (which then causes the messages to be invisible and/or lost).
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1 Close TB 1.5.0.8.
2. Copy the attached "test5" file (created in 1.5.0.7, by copying 6 messages into a new folder called "Test5") into the Inbox.sbd folder. The Test5 file contains 6 e-mail messages, 3 generated by the JMail X-Mailer, and 3 generated by the Chilkat X-Mailer. FOR THIS TEST, DO NOT COPY THE INCLUDED TEST5.MSF FILE.
3. Restart Thunderbird (which will cause generation of a new .msf file), and navigate to the Test5 folder, under Inbox.
4. Look to see how many messages appear (there should be 6; I see 1).
5. Attempt to copy/move the file(s) in the Test 5 folder to another folder.
Actual Results:
Although the Test5 folder should display 6 messages, it displays only 1. Attempts to copy/move that message result in a perpetual hourglass. There is no way to access/see the other 5 messages in the file/folder. There is no way to "manage" any of the messages in the file/folder. If the folder is compacted, the missing messages will be permanently lost.
Expected Results:
I expect 1.5.0.8 to behave in the same manner as 1.5.0.7. After restarting TB, I expect to see all 6 messages in the Test5 folder, and I expect to be able to copy/move them easily and without incident. I do not expect compaction to cause mail database corruption.
The attached file (TB1.5.0.7.zip) contain the Test5 file (6 messages), and the related Test5.msf file ... both created in TB 1.5.0.7.
As a reference point, copy \*both\* files into Inbox.sbd in TB 1.5.0.7. Restart TB. You will see 6 messages, and they can be copied, moved, managed, etc. as one would expect.
Now copy both files into Inbox.sbd in TB 1.5.0.8. Restart TB. You will see the same 6 messages. However, if you attempt to copy/move all 6 of them, it will appear that only 1 message was copied/moved (and the operation will generate a perpetual hourglass). If you look at the underlying data files, you will see that all of the selected messages were, in fact, copied, but that the \*.msf file in the destination folder is corrupt, so it appears that but a single message was copied (and, if a "move" operation is performed, the files in the source folder will \*not\* be deleted). If you delete the \*.msf file in the Test5 folder, and allow TB 1.5.0.8 to regenerate it, only a single message will appear in the folder (though if you look at the data file, you will see that it contains all 6 messages).
If you copy the Test5.msf file generated in TB 1.5.0.8 into the Inbox.sbd folder in 1.5.0.7 (overwriting the equivalent file generated by 1.5.0.7), and then restart TB, you will see but a single message in the folder (though the data file contains all 6). If you then delete the Test5.msf file in TB 1.5.0.7, and restart TB, allowing TB to regenerate the file, you will see all 6 messages again.
More details of the problem, together with comments/experiences of others, can be found in the thread: <http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=485752> I created the topic, and the analysis (a bit rough at first) becomes much more focused as the testing progresses.

Attached file
[Test5 folder (6 problematic messages), plus related .msf file](attachment.cgi?id=245365)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=245365&action=edit)

The attachment contains 2 files, (i) Test5 ... a message folder with 6 messages, 3 generated by the Chilket X-Mailer, and 3 generated by the JMail X-Mailer, and (ii) Test5.msf, the related .msf file. Both files were created in TB 1.5.0.7, by copying the 6 selected messages to a new folder called "Test5".

My interim solution for this bug has been to reinstall TB 1.5.0.7, and disable all automatic program upgrades.Version: unspecified → 1.5

As clarification, not only does this problem occur in TB 1.5.0.8, I have also been able to reproduce it in TB version 2.0, beta 1 (20061111).

All the messages that do not show up have Message-ID, References, Resent-Message-ID set to the same value, like
Message-ID: <CRID\_7bbabaab57ba41e69a354d392b2d6e74@centercode.com>
References: <CRID\_7bbabaab57ba41e69a354d392b2d6e74@centercode.com>

Regarding David's comment about "most users", when he reduced the severity from "blocker" to "critical".
I didn't report this bug as an intellectual exercise, or a contrived test case. I reported it because one of my mail folders contained 343 messages in 1.5.0.7, and the number was immediately reduced to 271 (a loss of 72 messages) upon installing 1.5.0.8. Further, all \*new\* messages from a particular major software house where immediately lost in 1.5.0.8 ... without being displayed in TB at all (and permanently lost if you compact the folders ... which I did).
I was able to debug this issue because all of my mail now traverses GMail before going to TB, and GMail retains an archive. Fortunately, my drive is imaged every night, so I was also able to recover all of the older lost messages that didn't go through GMail.
How nasty is it, and should it be a blocker? I guess that depends upon whether it is your mail that is being lost ... or mine.No longer blocks: [332883](/show_bug.cgi?id=332883 "RESOLVED FIXED - Thunderbird freezes while searching in a folder with lots of messages ( search bar )")Severity: blocker → criticalDepends on: [332883](/show_bug.cgi?id=332883 "RESOLVED FIXED - Thunderbird freezes while searching in a folder with lots of messages ( search bar )")Flags: blocking1.8.0.9+ → blocking1.8.0.9?

I had the same problem.. i could still see the affected messages when viewing the Inbox file using a text editor, but not in TB. Tried compacting, and that didn't help, neither did deleting the msf file. Below you can see the header for one of the affected messages, directly copied from the 'Inbox' file. I'm afraid compacting actually deleted the messages, because after downgrading to TB .7, i only got back a few of them that were dated today, i think from after my last 'compact'.
In other words: this makes TB completely useless, and i can't believe that this version is still being distributed, because it must be hurting many people. I had messages disappear almost every time i got new messages, probably at least 30% of them. Not sure if they were all spam, because i only started really investigating after compacting to see if this would fix it, and that process seems to have deleted most of them.
I just hope it has something to do with spam filtering, because in that case at least i know that i probably didn't lose any important messages. Can anyone confirm this?
Anyway, when i get Vista, i'll be sure not to use TB again - and i'm sure many others will feel the same way. I've been using it for years, but it's unacceptable to lose mail, and i completely lost my confidence with TB, especially since it's still being distributed, when it clearly shouldn't be. The bug report makes it look like this is some isolated issue having to do with a few obscure mail agents, which obviously isn't the case (look below, X-Mailer: Microsoft Outlook Express 6.00.2900.2869)
Good luck everyone, and at least downgrade for now, as a quick fix! (and switch off Automatic updates)
If this is not a "blocker", i don't know what is... (you'll feel the same way if you're waiting for an important email, your mail program says "new mail!", and you discover an empty inbox...)

I'm sorry for that regression, and I fixed it as quickly as I could while I was on vacation. Compacting was not related to this bug, since compaction ignores message threading...
I did not realize that Outlook Express was so broken...
If you sort by date, or any other column, and are non-threaded, you will see all your messages (you have to be in a flat sort when you open the folder, so if you're threaded, you have to sort by date, and then click away from the folder, and back).

Re: [Comment 9](/show_bug.cgi?id=360409#c9 "RESOLVED FIXED - mails with messed up references seem to disappear"), suggesting that the problem is the result of Message-ID, References, Resent-Message-ID set to the same value (and someone changed the description of the bug accordingly), and the proposed fix in [Comment 14](/show_bug.cgi?id=360409#c14 "RESOLVED FIXED - mails with messed up references seem to disappear"). Please look at [Comment 13](/show_bug.cgi?id=360409#c13 "RESOLVED FIXED - mails with messed up references seem to disappear"), where there is but a Message-ID (i.e., the message is not purporting to be a reply to itself).
I'm not a software developer, but I am able to discern the factual inconsistency, and therefore question the conclusion set forth in [Comment 9](/show_bug.cgi?id=360409#c9 "RESOLVED FIXED - mails with messed up references seem to disappear"), and the related change in the description of this bug.
Of course, there may be more than a single issue involved here.

David, what do you mean with "If you sort by date, or any other column, and are non-threaded, you will see all your messages". My messages weren't threaded, and they were sorted by date, and i could not see all my messages. (View -> Sort by -> Date / Descending / Unthreaded). The only thing i could do to make them show up was downgrade to 1.5.0.7 and delete the msf file.
By the way: why is this bug's status still "NEW"?

With the attached test folder, if you're threaded, you only see one message. If you sort by date, then click away and click back, you'll see all six messages again.
If you were ever threaded in the folder, you'll miss messages until you open the folder such that it opens non-threaded (i.e., it was sorted, flat, when you closed the folder, before you re-opened it). That's the case for this test case, at least. Perhaps other test cases behave differently - are you saying the folder was never threaded? In that case, we might want a new test case that demonstrates that...Status: NEW → ASSIGNED

Example in [Bug 360252](/show_bug.cgi?id=360252 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - matching 'message-id' and 'references' headers cause message not to be listed") has "Exhibit B" never showing. I always work unthreaded (View > Sort By > Unthreaded) and sorted by date (View > Sort By > Date). Descending, for what it's worth.
I have now downgraded to 1.5.0.7 (can't very well have e-mail be there but not showing up!) so I can't do any further testing.

By the way, again: i'm pretty sure that compacting deleted the invisible messages, even after returning to 1.5.0.7. The only messages i got back were the few (3) that i received after my last 'compact' action.
Please read the following threads for some more user experiences, also referring to the compacting effect:
<http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=487248>
<http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?p=2594779>
These two threads seem to be \*by far\* the most active ones in their respective categories over the last couple of days, suggesting the problem is far bigger than some of you would want to think. Which again warrants a "blocker" rating, i would hope...
As for being threaded or not: as far as i remember, my inbox was never threaded. But i might have tested this option a year ago or so, i don't know. At least i haven't made any changes to the sorting/threading in the last couple of months: it has always been the way i described it (View ->
Sort by -> Date / Descending / Unthreaded) although i sometimes click on 'date' again to sort the other way, or click on the View -> Unread tab when i get spam with an old date and i want to quickly find and delete it.

I did not mean to set the severity to "Blocker", which is reserved for bugs that stop development or testing (<https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/page.cgi?id=fields.html#bug_severity>). I don't think this bug qualifies, critical is more accurate.
However it does appear to be a significant regression and should "block" the next release (which is a flag, not a severity).Severity: blocker → critical

Ok - i just meant to say that it should "block" the next release. In my opinion, it should even block the 1.5.0.8 release: this will affect many people. Just look at how these are by far the most popular items in both the Mozilla Bugs and the Support categories (see links i provided earlier). And those are just the people who were \*\*\*\* enough to Google the problem and write about it - most users probably don't even notice, since it happens almost invisibly (you never see the mails come in). I only noticed it after a few days, when i happened to pay attention to how many mails it was downloading, and how many it actually displayed (and considering usually at least 50% is spam, you aren't always very surprised if you don't see all the mails that are downloaded because they're automatically redirected to Junk). After realizing it, i noticed it happened almost every time i downloaded a few mails...

Ok, so does this patch fix the issue of the disappearing messages? Your patch seems to be related mostly to threading issues (?), but please note again that it doesn't seem to have much to do with that. At least, in my case, i never used threading, and the messages still disappeared. Also clearly, this should be a bug that was introduced in 1.5.0.8, and wasn't there in earlier versions (at least not any recent ones).

This bug manifests itself differently on the trunk and 2.0 branch, vs the 1.5.0.x branch. Unfortunately, it's much worse on the 1.5.0.x branch - on that branch, when you get multiple messages that have the same message id, and the same reference id, and claim to be replies to themselves, the subsequent msg hdrs don't actually get added to the db. (on the trunk, they get added, but don't get displayed when in threaded view).
So, for the 1.5.0.x branch, this fix only fixes the problem for new incoming messages, or if you delete the .msf file. To fix it for the 1.5.0.x branch, we'd need to force the regeneration of all local folder .msf files. This is a big yuck. But I can't think of any other way around it, other than perhaps to detect the case where an existing msg hdr claims to be a reply to itself, and only regenerate the db in that case. I'll try to come up with a patch for that.

The bug may manifest itself differently (from a technical standpoint) on the trunk, branches, etc. However, before I filed the bug, I tested it on the 2.0 nightly, and I got the same results that I got in 1.5.0.8 (of the 6 test messages, when the nightly generated the .msf file, only 1 message displayed ... the first one). The important point I want to make is that I NEVER used/tested threaded view (I only have 6 messages in the test file ... and they aren't threaded anyway), so I am a bit troubled by the distinction between flat and threaded view, and the subsequent attribution of bug manifestation to threaded view.

Kent, I'm not sure - when I tried it with a 2.0 build, I saw the six messages when in flat view, and only one when in threaded view. I can try it again later, but it's really not that important right now - if you delete your .msf file, and open the folder with tomorrow's 2.0 nightly build, it should work fine. The really critical thing is fixing 1.5.0.8 builds right now, and somehow regenerating .msf files when we detect this problem.

... as for 1.5.0.8 ... if you delete all of the .msf files, you get all of the messages back (assuming they haven't been lost permanently via compaction), but you also lose all of the folder-by-folder sort customizations. That's gonna be hella confusing to peeps like my mom, me thinks (though I don't have an alternate solution).

David, just out of curiosity, and to get a better idea of what i (and others) lost after compacting: do you think these 'self-replying' messages are mostly spam? Or do you know of any legitimate email programs / websites (Outlook, Yahoo mail, etc.) that create messages like this? Is this even legal according to the RFC's in question? The issue would be slightly less damaging if you know that the disappearing messages are mainly spam and/or generated by some poorly written mailer.
Thanks.

Niek, it's definitely illegal. I had never encountered messages like this before. Some are definitely spam (I suspect that having a reference header decreases the spam score with some spam filters, so they just stick one in, and the message-id happens to be handy).
However, in the Test5 folder attachment, there are several messages with the same problem that don't seem to be spam. They have a "Resent-From" header, and all the message-ids are from centercode.com - this makes me think there's some server-side software rewriting the message-ids - I don't think it's the original sending program generating the bad message-id+reference combination.

When I created the Test5 folder, I selected 6 messages out of a total of 72 that "disappeared" from one of my folders when I upgraded to 1.5.0.8 from 1.5.0.7. None was spam. All were received from a very large Silicon Valley-based software vendor in connection with beta testing (mass mails to all of the beta group, or personalized e-mails generated by their bug reporting system).

I can confirm Kent's finding ([comment #42](/show_bug.cgi?id=360409#c42 "RESOLVED FIXED - mails with messed up references seem to disappear")). No spam, just beta test group messages.
Essentially two things were happening:
1) In builds before 1.5.0.8, (1.5.0.7 for example), using the sort by thread command in a folder with messages sent using the Chilkat X-mailer (from another large California-based software company for beta testing) resulted in all but the first message disappearing. This could only be fixed by deleting the relevant .msf file
2) In build 1.5.0.8, all messages moved to the folder using a filter would disappear. [I did not leave any of these messages in the Inbox so I can't confirm them missing there also]. Removing the .msf file would not reconstitute the message index list.
ie the problems (probably the same problem) appeared to become more extreme with 1.5.0.8
I didn't compact the folder with the hidden messages, so I lost no messages, but I cannot upgrade to 1.5.0.8 or later unless this bug is killed because I need to read the incoming list messages. Other users on the same beta test list as me have reported the same problem with the list messages. Worked around by reinstalling 1.5.0.7.

will the "one time detection" occur only if the upgrade is from 1.5.0.8, or will it run on any installed version of TB?
will any user preferences (such as sort order) be captured and programmed into the newly-generated .msf file?

any installed version of TB that has the patch in it will run the run-time check, if it hasn't been run before. The one-time-ness is stored in the .msf files, and new msf files are created knowing they don't need to do the one time check.

This bug affects SeaMonkey as well, including SeaMonkey 1.1b. It is not present in the latest 1.1 nightlies, though, due to the checkin for the patch in [comment #14](/show_bug.cgi?id=360409#c14 "RESOLVED FIXED - mails with messed up references seem to disappear") (Tested using Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20061115 SeaMonkey/1.1b).

I'd really like to get this onto the trunk soon, in order to get it into 1.5.0.9, so switching review to Seth.

Is there an estimated time on getting this fix made into a .exe file? Is there a way to escalate this? I have been without email for a week now (won't move down to 1.5.0.7 as there is a security bug in it per 1.5.0.8 release notes). Thanks much!

I need to get it reviewed; then I need to get approval to check it in; then it needs to be released in a build. After I check it in, you could pull a nightly 1.5.0.9 build before it's actually released...the 1.5.0.9 release is supposed to be in December, afaik.

Sorry, but i don't understand why you guys are waiting until December for such a critical problem. In the mean time, most of your users will have emails disappear (probably without even realizing until their contacts get upset at them because they haven't replied to something), and if they adhere to TB's suggested 'good practice' of compacting their inbox on a 'regular basis', this means that those emails will be lost forever. This should be totally unacceptable, and on equal footing (if not higher) with whatever security updates you may distribute from time to time. If i were still using 1.5.0.8, and i found out a month from now that you guys knew about this problem for over a month, and i happened to have lost several important emails, i would be seriously \*\*\*\* off and sure never to use TB again. If this leaks to the media, i'm sure you'll get a lot of seriously bad press...

I'm inclined to agree with Niek. This bug has the potential to do TB a lot of damage and the patched version should be released outside the standard sequence eg as 1.5.0.8a

And for another anecdotal case: I would be hit by this issue every. single. day.
Does it really matter if 100,000 , 10,000, or 1,000 users are hit by this? An e-mail application that fails to show some e-mail, and worse yet -deletes- it without chance of recovery after the user performs an operation (compacting) that is recommended by the authors? Unacceptable.
Perhaps the powers that be do indeed deem this insignificant enough to warrant an immediate new release - but perhaps one of the following could at least take place:
- 1.5.0.8 pulled
- a warning placed on the download page
- a warning issued through the automatic updates (is this possible?)
- an advisory issued through select media; Slashdot, ZDnet, the usual.
This problem should, at the very least, not be silently lingering in this bug report (and its dupes) as if nothing is wrong, while users may be missing and completely losing e-mails, for no good reason, every single day. It's bad enough that there's a whole page on "Missing Mails" as it is (why should mail -ever- go missing?), it's much worse that it does not address this issue.
( I notice it's a wiki - if anybody has editing rights; <http://kb.mozillazine.org/Disappearing_mail> )
Just my 2cts - sticking with 1.5.0.7 here.. I'll take my chances with the vulnerabilities.

I was alerted to this problem by my wife who noticed that the number of emails being downloaded appeared to be different to the number of new messages received. Messages coming from a Yahoo Groups! mail alias were being lost. She knows how to google to find the problem but was unable to resolve it (downgrading to 1.5.0.7 does require some skill and, more importantly, confidence).
So I believe that this bug could be affecting anyone using Yahoo Groups! and a lot of them may not realise. The impact of this bug could be devastating to the Thunderbird project and I vote for getting a fix out as soon as possible.

Also, could you please list the name and email (I would have to open a yahoo / gmail account though) or contact method of the person who has the authority to release this fix out-of-schedule.

Builds which contain this fix are available here:

Ignore the version number, which hasn't been updated yet, just look at the date. The fix was checked in on the relevant 1.8.0 branch on 2006-11-21 13:04 PST. So any builds made after that contain the fix.

Hi Frank
the fix is downgrading to TB 1.5.0.7 and deleting of all .msf files in your mailbox. TB will create them new and the hidden mails re-appear (as long you have not compacted your mail folders). Make a backup of all you mail database before doing this!
Here you can get the older TB:

What odd for me is that neither deleting the .msf files and downgrading to 1.5.0.7 or using the nightly build brought back the non-spam messages in my Inbox. However the non-spam messages are still in the Inbox file itself, as I can see them by using mbox-viewer from <http://sourceforge.net/projects/mbox-viewer> to look at the Inbox file. Is anyone else experiencing a similar situation?
Is there some other file I need to delete besides the .msf files? For me, several hundred megs of non-spam still do not show up. Thanks.

You might try ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/thunderbird/nightly/2006-11-25-12-mozilla1.8.0-l10n/thunderbird-1.5.0.8.de.win32.installer.exe
The time of the build indicates that it was compiled after the patch landed (even though it still says 1.5.0.8).
Of course, back up your mail data first, and then uninstall your present TB, and install this one (i.e., don't install this on top of your existing installation).

I found a way to bring the missing non-spam back:
qgrep -v -X "^X-Mozilla-" Inbox
Qgrep is a free downloadable Microsoft utility similar to the UNIX "grep" command that with the command line arguments above will remove the extra mail header lines.
The darn thing is that I will have to run this manually on all my mail files to make sure messages haven't disappeared that I don't know about. But, at least I will have my old email messages back :)

OK, folks, I can live with the December update, since I haven't compacted folders for a year or so and I have many folders with >300MB and TB is running smoothly.
But I'd really appreciate a procedure on how to proceed when the update is out:
\* just update ?
\* delete the MSF files ? What do I lose by deleting the MSF files ?
\* something else ?
Thanks,
Jose.

most likely, just update - we do a one-time check of your .msf file to see if you have at least one instance of a message with identical message-id and reference headers - if so, we regenerate the .msf file automatically. The idea is that if you ever got a message like that before 1.5.0.8, you might have gotten more since 1.5.0.8.
If you delete the .msf file yourself, you will lose settings like the current sort order for the folder, but it's not a big deal - people delete .msf files all the time.

I can't agree with this point. No-one deletes .msf files regularly except some developers. And you also lose any label you set before. So in my opinion it's a really big deal to come back (if you really can do that) to the former state.
It's nice to hear that we rebuild the summary file automatically. That is the only way for people who are just users of a software. Thanks.

David, thanks for the info.
As for MSF file deleting/regeneration:
Does that mean I just lose sort order, BUT NOT read/unread/label flags ?
That is actually the most important thing for me. If I lose sort order,
I don't care, but if read/unread/label flags are lost, that is a big
problem for me and I bet for the majority of other users aswell.
Thanks,

The read or unread status won't be affected by deleting the mail summary file because it is stored inside the MBOX file (X-Mozilla-Status). But as I already described in [comment 77](/show_bug.cgi?id=360409#c77 "RESOLVED FIXED - mails with messed up references seem to disappear") you will lose any of your labels. You can have a try. But remember to make a backup of the msf first. Afterwards you can restore the old state by copying it back.

Erh, I'm new to the bugzilla forum, so maybe I've missed something. I spent a good few hours searching this and other relevant sites for information about this reference header problem.
However, I'm at a total loss here, what do I get if I install Thunderbird 1.5.0.8? Information is abound, but not very consistent. This report says the bug is fixed (albeit with regression); still the current version number has no indication of this - almost makes you wonder if there is something to hide? The release notes do address the issue, but settles it with a recommendation to "not compact your folder" until the 1.5.0.9 release. Clearly this indicates that you should not expect the bug to be fixed.

- does this mean a patch has been included in the current Thunderbird build (1.5.0.8)?
Sorry if what I just wrote is a boring drag of messed up information, but this is what you get when you search the forums and the official web site. I won't ever dare to use rel 1.5.0.8, unless I am certain the reference header problem has been dealt with. After all, having mails deleted spontaniously is just about the worst kind of error you can come up with in an email client - and for the Microsoft clan this is just the kind of story they'd love to have a good laugh at with their clients.
Right now, it would be great to know that you don't risk loosing your emails if you install the current TB version. If this is not possible, I think people should be advised to install 1.5.0.7 until a proper fix has been included in the release.
And thanks for providing a great open source program!

The 1.5.0.8 release notes were changed to say that the bug exists in 1.5.0.8. The bugzilla status of FIXED means the bug is fixed in the latest code in our CVS repository. It has nothing to do with whether the bug is fixed in any particular release, though of course many many people get confused about that.

Oh no, I hoped this was not the case. As I read your reply, the current available release may actually delete some of your mail (!), still it is being offered for download (!!).
I understand this is not an end-user site - consider me a tester then ;-) The reason for my being here, is that this is where it happens, and sadly I cannot rely on information about Thunderbird from the product page or the user forums. Did you know there are still moderator posts in the forums advisning people to compact folders in order to solve the problem? Not new ones but still. This is like a recipe for disaster if you are trying out Mozilla and installing a fresh copy...
For the TB project I really, really, really hope this bug does not lead to widespread dataloss among end users, as this way of patching-without-reversioning could lead to a major loss of credibility.
I think, most people can accept that a system might be marked by some bugs, provided they can trust that at least their data is not being corrupted. As was posted before, if loosing the data of an IT system is not a blocker, then what is? Data loss corrupts confidence like nothing else. Crash the system, freeze the computer etc., users will put up with this as long as you can 'fix it' and get back to normal. But data loss? Ouch.
Hope you understand my concern. Personally, I will consider always running (at least) one version below current release, but this can hardly be a satisfying strategy for the Mozilla project. Maybe some bugs are even worse (like?), but several people have noted here that this kind of bug never occurred before. With this in mind, I think maybe the development team should reconsider the strategy for addressing data loss bugs. All said in great respect for a cool product made by some cool people ;-)

Rasmus, i totally agree with you, and so do most people i think. For some reason the guys in charge of Mozilla don't think this is a very serious situation. They seem to take the Microsoft approach of shipping the patch on their pre-determined schedule, rather than fixing it right away. This MS late-patch thing was exactly the incentive that made me start using Firefox rather than IE, but now i'm sure i will at least not use Thunderbird anymore once i install Vista and get the new Windows Mail or Outlook. You're right: losing mail is probably the worst thing that an email program can do, and i would rate it much higher than the usual security issues, which you often rarely run into. Also, i think many users will get really upset once they do upgrade to 1.5.0.9, because suddenly a lot of mail will re-appear from out of nowhere (provided they haven't compacted their mailbox), making the problem very visible. So at that point i'm sure many users like you and me will lose all confidence in this product, and rightly so. I already wrote a story on slashdot.org about this in the hope that it would get some more publicity and users would be warned so that hopefully they could prevent their own mail from disappearing. Unfortunately it wasn't published, i assume because either it had already been talked about before, or because an opensource-fanatic was reviewing it. (A similar issue in a Microsoft product usually gets lots of attention there, so it does at least make you wonder.) Feel free to post your experiences there too, maybe you'll be more successful.
By the way: i have nothing against Mozilla - i've been a happy user of their products for at least a year, and of course it is to be expected that there are bugs in any software product from time to time. However, i think they handled this whole thing extremely poorly. I can't think of a situation where users wouldn't lose their confidence after losing their mail while the issue was known by the developers... :(

niek: go away.
this is not the way we work. you're apparently not actually permanently losing data, just not being able to see it. for this, i'm sorry. when you upgrade to 1.5.0.9, your problems should be automatically corrected.
note that the "forums" for the most part are not designed to delete things, including bad/outdated advice. we can't and won't "fix" problems by deleting references to them. just as we can't and won't remove your objectionable comment from bugzilla.
please be aware that releasing a new version of any product is complicated. and releasing a version of our branch releases requires us to have satisfied whatever security concerns we have, not just non dataloss bugfixes. if we release with the wrong set of security fixes, we get a lot of bad press and hurt our users substantially more.
politics of any sort do not belong in bugs. and hopefully you'll leave them in the bitbucket instead of tryiing to air them anywhere else.

"go away"? That's a little harsh, isn't it?
This isn't a forum, so it's certainly not the right venue for either of you to vent your opinions on/of either side of the argument. But I do share Niek's concern; I won't re-iterate why, just read above.
However, you do state that..
"you're apparently not actually permanently losing
data, just not being able to see it."
In the interest of the bug description's integrity it should be noted that although the direct effect of this bug does not cause data loss, effects from another common action taken does. Compacting folders is a recommended practice by 'Mozilla', on pages at MozillaZine -and- is often the answer even by ThunderBird developers for the description of "I can't see my e-mail".
So stating that a person is not actually permanently losing data is based on the assumption that those affected by this bug would not compact their folders, which is an assumption which, given the aforementioned, is horribly flawed.
I think we all understand that updating any program with the scope of ThunderBird requires great care to be taken, including taking the interest of security at heart. However, I'm not sure why you do fear bad press from any security issues but do not fear bad press from losing e-mail; In fact, 'ThunderBird' as a project is very lucky that the press has, so far, not picked up on this ( Tweakers.net aside ). Moreover, and back on topic, there have been other suggestions made that do not involve updating the program at all, but simply warn the users that they may currently be losing e-mail. Is that truly too much to ask? If not - who, exactly, do we ask who is (apparently) not monitoring this bug? I suppose it is December and we may see the official update pretty soon anyway, making it a moot question.
Just my, last, 2cts in this bug / discussion.

Timeless Anonymous:
"niek: go away."
Always a great way of starting a discussion ;)
"you're apparently not actually permanently losing
data"
I'm sorry to say, but you apparently don't understand what this bug is about. Yes, i have permanently lost data, and so have many others. Please read this bug report (including its comments) before you write something like this, especially when you start your ramblings the way you started them.
"when you upgrade to 1.5.0.9, your problems should be automatically corrected"
No. Not when you follow Mozilla's recommended practice.
"politics of any sort do not belong in bugs."
I agree, but i didn't see another way of getting the attention of the Mozilla's in charge of this situation, and i was trying to do something in order to prevent others from facing data loss. I think i (and others) pointed out some valid suggestions that would prevent alienating a lot of users down the road. This is in everyone's interest. Ignoring the end user is never a good thing. The simple fact that everyone who knows about this issue seems to have downgraded to 1.5.0.7 should tell you that this is generally considered a lot more serious than whatever security bug may have been fixed in .8, and so this bug can "get a lot of bad press and hurt our users substantially more", to put it in your own words. Especially by not warning about it. Also, this suggests that distributing 1.5.0.8 is probably not a thing that users would want if they knew the details, and distributing 1.5.0.7 would be the best thing to do until it's properly fixed. And you already have 1.5.0.7, so there's nothing complicated about that. Also, being a software developer myself, i fail to see why 1.5.0.8 can't simply be updated with just this fix, and shipped out. Give me one good reason why this hasn't been done.
"note that the "forums" for the most part are not designed to delete things, including bad/outdated advice. we can't and won't "fix" problems by deleting references to them. just as we can't and won't remove your objectionable comment from bugzilla."
Again, this shows you haven't read this bug report. But, could you tell me what you found so 'objectionable' about my comments? You know, even when you really like a product and are passionate about it (like you seem to be), that doesn't mean you shouldn't be allowed to criticize, in order to improve. Or does it?

I am still experiencing this issue on nightly 1.5.0.9 2006-12-04-14-mozilla1.8.0-l10n
If anything it has become even worse.
Moderators are still advising people to compact their folders over in the forum.
I have lost all faith in Mozilla - you can no longer ensure the integrity of my mail, and you have shown contempt for your users by leaving this bug in the open. Shame on you Mozilla.

I was affected by the original bug in 1.5.0.8. I subsequently installed a nightly.
Sorry I cant answer that - all I know is that email is being downloaded, I receive notification that new mail has arrived, and I can find no new mail in any folder. This has hapened multiple times since installing the nightly.
If you can offer some guidance on how to test I will try to test properly. I am on a deadline at the minute and cannot test currently.

I went back and verified that a 1.5.0.9 build handles parsing the Test5 folder attached to this bug, such that all the messages show up. That's pretty much the test case I have since I haven't found a way to get the problematic type of messages sent to me via a mail server. If anyone has subscription instructions for a mailing list that exhibits the problem, that would be helpful.
First, you should double check that you're really running the 1.5.0.9 build using help | about.
Next, if you haven't already, check that the mail isn't ending up in the junk folder.
Then, you should open your Inbox in a text editor, scroll to the bottom, and look for messages that you haven't seen in the message list - if you find any, you could copy+paste the headers and e-mail them to me, or attach them to the bug. You'll also see deleted messages in the text editor, but they'll usually have an x-mozilla-status header line with a value of 8 or 9 (the last hex byte will have the high bit set, indicating it was deleted)

David: why couldn't you guys update 1.5.0.8 with \*just this fix\*, immediately after you made it? The way you stick to your update schedule seems worse than Microsoft's patch-tuesday scheduling. This episode has really made me dislike this product, when to me it seems that it could have been so easily prevented. Not only did i lose trust in Thunderbird after permanently losing mail, but i now also lost trust in the way Mozilla handles these kinds of issues. What's your opinion? It'll be interesting to see what happens when the update does arrive, and users suddenly see their inbox stuffed with mail from a month ago.

Thanks Magnus!
Now I'd be most grateful, and I'm sure a bunch of other users too,
if someone (preferably from the Mozilla team) could post a brief
"guide" for upgrading to 1.5.0.9:
I.e. is it possible to just upgrade and possible hidden mails
just appear ? Or what must we do to make possible hidden mails
appear ? I'm sure, deleting the MSF files is no option for many
users, since the flags are lost, so is there a way without deleting
the MSF files or is this handled automatically ?
Thanks a lot!

One other thing to try: I had the same issue, I chalked it up to possibly a weird side effect of the bug (?) with normal usage of the corrupt Inbox. Since then I fixed it as per message #73/#74: [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=360409#c73](/show_bug.cgi?id=360409#c73 "RESOLVED FIXED - mails with messed up references seem to disappear") . Qgrep is available if you go to microsoft.com and type in "qgrep" in their search box. Make a backup copy of your Inbox first! Of course, this is a shotgun approach which deletes some other message settings and brings back all other deleted mail too.

It was something I tried that worked for me after I upgraded to the daily build that had the fix applied, and manually deleting the .msf files didn't bring my regular mail back. The intent on my part was that if the invisible message got marked as deleted (one of the X-Mozilla- line features) somehow unknown to me after they became invisible (don't know how but figured it might be a side effect - with previous normal mail usage in the buggy version / other message range deletions?). Unfortunately my Inbox was way too big (hundreds of megs) to view/edit with Microsoft text-based tools, so I couldn't do further analysis, but it did fix the issue for my Inbox so I offered it up as a suggestion if all else failed.

After rebuilding the .msf files I still have no new mail re-appearing. I was under the impression that this fix would rebuild my mailboxes and automatically fix this issue?
I am quite certain that I have been affected by this bug. I am quickly losing confidence in TB. I do not feel that I should have to use other tools to affect the required changes.
I will try to manually look through the inbox files to look for messages that may be affected by this and report back here.

I was affected by 1.5.0.8. Messages re-appeared on downgrade. Since moving to nightly I have seen a variance between reported new messages in system tray Vs actual new messages in TB.
I did compact previously (as per the dreadful advice still being given in the TB forums). But I have not compacted for many weeks now to avoid any further potential loss.
Is there any simple way to check for common headers without manual inspection?

I just verified it and it is actually a false detection.
It is a return receipt, where the original mail headers are attached.
I try to circumvent this, but better have a few false detections than
reviewing a half-gig mailbox by hand.

Hi Hannes,

So do you mean that the updated Thunderbird (1.5.0.9) still suffers from the disappearing message issue? Or did you write the script for 1.5.0.8 only? In other words, should i update from my current 1.5.0.7 (which i downgraded to) to 1.5.0.9, or not yet? I want to make triple sure this time that my messages won't be disappearing again. Richard still seems to be having problems?
Thanks,

Hi Niek!
I don't know...
I have not tried 1.5.0.9 yet. I will probably clone my Inbox (with the
SPAMs that have those headers and are hidden) and give it a try with
1.5.0.9 on another machine. I keep ya'll posted about the result.
My script is only to check mailboxes for mails with problematic headers.
It is basically TB-version independent. You can run the script on any
MBOX, whether it is a TB mailbox or not. The script just shows basic
information about emails with equal "Message-ID" and "References" headers.

For what it's worth, I had written a similar script (in a whole different language, though), and since 2006/Nov/07\* I would have lost 792 e-mails. The vast majority of those would be from our mailing system, 29 of them however woulc come from outside mailing systems. 8 of which came from a Packard Bell mail server, which seems to be fixed since at least 2006/Nov/19.
(\* Note that this excludes e-mail received since 2006/Jan/01. E-mail prior to that date is archived away and no longer in the mailbox files, so wouldn't be affected.)
I'll be installing 1.5.0.9 shortly.. if there's still some manner of issue, I'll find out soon enough - the hard way :)
I'd like to express my disappointment that this issue is not explicitly mentioned in the release notes, though. Although I am confident that it is addressed (why claim otherwise?), it does mean that the general public will remain unaware that they may have lost e-mail due to this bug. Perhaps it is better that way. Time to get paranoid yet?

Richard,
do you mean that the hidden mails automatically appeared after
upgrading to 1.5.0.9 ?

I should have made myself clearer :)
I don't know if it makes the previously invisible e-mails visible again, as I have been using 1.5.0.7 while waiting for a bugfix.
However, none of the e-mails that would automatically be 'invisible' with 1.5.0.8 are invisible now.
--
What I was referring to, however, was more with new malformed e-mails coming in not automatically disappearing - which was my primary concern.

Richard,
thanks for the clarification.
I guess we can conclude:
\* bug fixed in 1.5.0.9
\* hidden emails in 1.5.0.8 do not automatically appear in 1.5.0.9
As for hidden mails I'd suggest the following (without losing
any flags or whatsoever by deleting the MSF file):
In 1.5.0.9: Just copy the affected mailbox and give it another name.
So it will have no MSF file, and TB 1.5.0.9 will rebuild the MSF for
the "new" mailbox.
Look for the emails detected with
Thunderbird Mailbox Checker
<http://www.captain.at/howto-thunderbird-mailbox-checker.php>
in the "new" folder and move them to the original mailbox.
WARNING: Only try this with 1.5.0.9! TB 1.5.0.8 will hang when moving
such mails to the original mailbox.

This bug does still exist in TB 2.0.0.0.
<http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=542398>
When I move (or copy) certain messages manually or by means of a filter from the inbox to a subfolder, sometimes these messages disappear, sometimes not.

I use Windows 2000 And discovererd this bug in 2.0.0.3
It seemd (but I am not 100% sure) that the new Thunderbird viewed some messages as spam, I uncheck the spam-marker and put the mails back in the Inbox.
Rusult the mails were gone!?
These were importand mails for me.. it scared the hell out of me, that mails could get completely lost.. I made a backup of my inbox and looked for the lost mails.
They were still there then I did a compact folders => the mails were REALY gone. Then I restored the backup, resulting in a rebuild of the MSF-file, and the mails were back!
I thought returning to my previous version (1.5.0.4) would solve the problem, but what I have read here, it looks like the problem may exist in that version also? :( I will keep an eye out, checking if mails in this version (1.5.0.4) also get lost..
My preliminary conclusion, there is something wrong with the msf-file-structure...
Concluding.. reading this thread, it looks like this problem had been going on for some time, without beeing solved.. this scares the hell out of me, I have an internet company, and need to be able to rely on mails NOT disappearing :(
This realy needs to get resolved! I have been a loyal user since Netscape Messenger 4.something, but this isn't just a bug, this bug is huge and verry scarry!

What you see is [bug 368112](/show_bug.cgi?id=368112 "RESOLVED FIXED - Messages lost when multiple messages moved between local mail folders (not only move/drag&drop but also copy/thru menu)"). This is already fixed in current branch nighlies.

Do I read it correctly that this should be fixed with 2.0.0.4?

Yes, TB 2.0.0.4 will be the next official release where the issue from [bug 368112](/show_bug.cgi?id=368112 "RESOLVED FIXED - Messages lost when multiple messages moved between local mail folders (not only move/drag&drop but also copy/thru menu)") will be fixed. So let's stop us here.

I don't think it's been decided it will be called "2.0.0.4", it might be time to let Thunderbird go it's own numbering way and call it "2.0.0.1" since 2.0 was just released.
But yeah, the "next release" will have the fix.

Question, it is said here that with version 2.0.0.4 this problem would be fixed. Where can I see if this problem has been fixed in the latest version, I can only find version 2.0.0.0 ?

## Mozilla XML.prototype.hasOwnProperty() method memory corruption vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#815432

Original Release Date: 2006-11-08 | Last Revised: 2006-12-21

### Overview

Mozilla products fail to properly handle the XML.prototype.hasOwnProperty() method. This vulnerability may allow a remote attacker execute arbitrary code.

### Description

| The [ECMAScript for XML (E4X) Specification](http://www.mozilla.org/js/language/ECMA-357.pdf) defines the XML.prototype.hasOwnProperty() as a JavaScript method used to determine if an object contains a specific property. Mozilla products fail to properly handle the XML.prototype.hasOwnProperty() method, which can lead to memory corruption.  For more information refer to Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory [2006-65](http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2006/mfsa2006-65.html). |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system. The attacker could also cause the vulnerable application to crash. |

## Topic

Updated firefox packages that fix several security bugs are now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

Mozilla Firefox is an open source Web browser.

Several flaws were found in the way Firefox processes certain malformed
Javascript code. A malicious web page could cause the execution of
Javascript code in such a way that could cause Firefox to crash or execute
arbitrary code as the user running Firefox. (CVE-2006-5463, CVE-2006-5747,
CVE-2006-5748)

Several flaws were found in the way Firefox renders web pages. A malicious
web page could cause the browser to crash or possibly execute arbitrary
code as the user running Firefox. (CVE-2006-5464)

A flaw was found in the way Firefox verifies RSA signatures. For RSA keys
with exponent 3 it is possible for an attacker to forge a signature that
would be incorrectly verified by the NSS library. Firefox as shipped trusts
several root Certificate Authorities that use exponent 3. An attacker could
have created a carefully crafted SSL certificate which be incorrectly
trusted when their site was visited by a victim. This flaw was previously
thought to be fixed in Firefox 1.5.0.7, however Ulrich Kuehn discovered the
fix was incomplete (CVE-2006-5462)

Users of Firefox are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages, which
contain Firefox version 1.5.0.8 that corrects these issues.

## Solution

# Mozilla Thunderbird: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200612-06**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been identified in Mozilla Thunderbird.

### Affected packages

| Package | **mail-client/mozilla-thunderbird** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.5.0.8** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.5.0.8** |

| Package | **mail-client/mozilla-thunderbird-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.5.0.8** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.5.0.8** |

### Background

Mozilla Thunderbird is a popular open-source email client from the
Mozilla Project.

### Description

It has been identified that Mozilla Thunderbird improperly handles
Script objects while they are being executed, allowing them to be
modified during execution. JavaScript is disabled in Mozilla
Thunderbird by default. Mozilla Thunderbird has also been found to be
vulnerable to various potential buffer overflows. Lastly, the binary
release of Mozilla Thunderbird is vulnerable to a low exponent RSA
signature forgery issue because it is bundled with a vulnerable version
of NSS.

### Impact

An attacker could entice a user to view a specially crafted email that
causes a buffer overflow and again executes arbitrary code or causes a
Denial of Service. An attacker could also entice a user to view an
email containing specially crafted JavaScript and execute arbitrary
code with the rights of the user running Mozilla Thunderbird. It is
important to note that JavaScript is off by default in Mozilla
Thunderbird, and enabling it is strongly discouraged. It is also
possible for an attacker to create SSL/TLS or email certificates that
would not be detected as invalid by the binary release of Mozilla
Thunderbird, raising the possibility for Man-in-the-Middle attacks.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

Users upgrading to the following releases of Mozilla Thunderbird should
note that this version of Mozilla Thunderbird has been found to not
display certain messages in some cases.

 All Mozilla Thunderbird users should upgrade to the
latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-client/mozilla-thunderbird-1.5.0.8"
```

All Mozilla Thunderbird binary release users should upgrade to the
latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-client/mozilla-thunderbird-bin-1.5.0.8"
```

I had a proof of concept exploit for this vulnerability a month ago,
but it was lost due to HDD crash. [bug 355478](/show_bug.cgi?id=355478 "VERIFIED FIXED - Crash with E4X, hasOwnProperty") have reminded me of it.

# USN-382-1: Thunderbird vulnerabilities

21 November 2006

Thunderbird vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 6.10](/security/notices?release=edgy)
* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)
* [Ubuntu 5.10](/security/notices?release=breezy)

## Details

USN-352-1 fixed a flaw in the verification of PKCS certificate

signatures. Ulrich Kuehn discovered a variant of the original attack

which the original fix did not cover. ([CVE-2006-5462](/security/CVE-2006-5462))

Various flaws have been reported that allow an attacker to execute

arbitrary code with user privileges by tricking the user into opening a

malicious email containing JavaScript. Please note that JavaScript is

disabled by default for emails, and it is not recommended to enable it.

([CVE-2006-5463](/security/CVE-2006-5463), [CVE-2006-5464](/security/CVE-2006-5464), [CVE-2006-5747](/security/CVE-2006-5747), [CVE-2006-5748](/security/CVE-2006-5748))

### Reduce your security exposure

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 6.10

* mozilla-thunderbird
  -
  1.5.0.8-0ubuntu0.6.10

##### Ubuntu 6.06

* mozilla-thunderbird
  -
  1.5.0.8-0ubuntu0.6.06

##### Ubuntu 5.10

* mozilla-thunderbird
  -
  1.5.0.8-0ubuntu0.5.10

After a standard system upgrade you need to restart Thunderbird to

effect the necessary changes.

## Topic

Updated seamonkey packages that fix several security bugs are now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1, 3, and 4.

This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

SeaMonkey is an open source Web browser, advanced email and newsgroup
client, IRC chat client, and HTML editor.

Several flaws were found in the way SeaMonkey processes certain malformed
Javascript code. A malicious web page could cause the execution of
Javascript code in such a way that could cause SeaMonkey to crash or
execute arbitrary code as the user running SeaMonkey. (CVE-2006-5463,
CVE-2006-5747, CVE-2006-5748)

Several flaws were found in the way SeaMonkey renders web pages. A
malicious web page could cause the browser to crash or possibly execute
arbitrary code as the user running SeaMonkey. (CVE-2006-5464)

A flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey verifies RSA signatures. For RSA keys
with exponent 3 it is possible for an attacker to forge a signature that
would be incorrectly verified by the NSS library. SeaMonkey as shipped
trusts several root Certificate Authorities that use exponent 3. An
attacker could have created a carefully crafted SSL certificate which be
incorrectly trusted when their site was visited by a victim. This flaw was
previously thought to be fixed in SeaMonkey 1.0.5, however Ulrich Kuehn
discovered the fix was incomplete (CVE-2006-5462)

Users of SeaMonkey are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages, which
contains SeaMonkey version 1.0.6 that corrects these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=349527#c0)• 18 years ago |
|  | |

exn\_newPrivate from js/src/jsexn.c contains the following code:
/\*
\* We don't need to copy linebuf and tokenptr, because they
\* point into the deflated string cache. (currently?)
\*/
newReport->linebuf = report->linebuf;
newReport->tokenptr = report->tokenptr;
This is wrong since, for example, any finally block can trigger GC before the error is reported. GC then releases the cache leading later to accessing of freed memory in the error handler.
For example, consider the following example for JS shell:
var invalid\_script = Array(1<<12).join('\n')+"bad!bad!bad";
try {
Function(invalid\_script);
} finally {
try {
Function(invalid\_script);
} catch (e) {
}
gc();
}
When the line gc(); is commented out, the shell prints:
~/m/trunk/mozilla/js/src> ./Linux\_All\_DBG.OBJ/js ~/s/x.js
/home/igor/s/x.js:4099: SyntaxError: missing ; before statement:
/home/igor/s/x.js:4099: bad!bad!bad
/home/igor/s/x.js:4099: ...^
With gc() call present the result is:
~/m/trunk/mozilla/js/src> ./Linux\_All\_DBG.OBJ/js ~/s/x.js
before 9232, after 9232, break 0819c000
/home/igor/s/x.js:4099: SyntaxError: missing ; before statement:
/home/igor/s/x.js:4099:
/home/igor/s/x.js:4099: ...^
I.e. the shell is accessing freed memory when it prints the error report.

Looping is cool, since macros help keep sizing and copying/allocating code together, but I probably would have just open-coded it, for slight code size savings over loop-containing-ifs. If you can, or I can make time, prove that there is no size savings to open-coding, and I'll be completely in favor.

This can't be right.
Thanks for taking this on -- it's looking a lot better.

My previous patch was broken besides being to generic and over paranoid: there is no overflow there and no alignment padding is necessary with a proper layout. So this version just explicitly calculates sizes and then do copy in separated parts.
For easier reviewing here is the new version of CopyErrorReport:
static JSErrorReport \*
CopyErrorReport(JSContext \*cx, JSErrorReport \*report)
{
/\*
\* We use a single malloc block to make a deep copy of JSErrorReport with
\* the following layout:
\* JSErrorReport
\* array of copies of report->messageArgs
\* jschar array with all characters from report->messageArgs
\* jschar array with characters for ucmessage
\* jschar array with characters uclinebuf and uctokenptr
\* char array with characters for linebuf and tokenptr
\* char array with characters for filename
\* Such layout together with the properties enforced by the following
\* asserts does not need any extra alignment padding.

Fix v2
That's the ticket -- non-increasing size order sorts into aligned segments, for power-of-two-aligned segment sizes.
>+ linebufSize = (report->linebuf) ? strlen(report->linebuf) + 1 : 0;

Nit: usual style doesn't parenthesize ?: condition unless it has lower-predence operators with spaces around them -- more of a visual thing to help see the condition than anything else.

I will try to modify the test case to crash. It must be a way to cause segfault while reading freed memory.

Need a fix for [bug 350393](/show_bug.cgi?id=350393 "VERIFIED FIXED - Crash in [@ exn_newPrivate msvcrt.dll + 0x378c0]") before landing a consolidated 1.8 branch patch.
The patch that did land introduced a gcc warning:
jsexn.c:164: warning: comparison between signed and unsigned
Igor, can you fix that and include it in the branch patch? Thanks.

Note that this has nothing to do with [bug 350393](/show_bug.cgi?id=350393 "VERIFIED FIXED - Crash in [@ exn_newPrivate msvcrt.dll + 0x378c0]"). That is elusive. Perhaps different malloc size expose latent problem?

Attached patch

[Full patch for 1.8.0 branch](attachment.cgi?id=240216&action=diff)

— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=349527&attachment=240216)

I was wrong when wrote that the patch applies to 1.8.0 as is.
It uses JS\_STATIC\_ASSERT macro from js/src/jsutil.h that exists only on 1.8.1 and later. Since the macro uses some C-language trickery that once proved to be problematic with older MSVC in a particular usage, I prefer not to add the macro to 1.8.0 branch. So here is a patch without compilation-time asserts.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2006-65

## Crashes with evidence of memory corruption (rv:1.8.0.8)

Announced
November 7, 2006
Reporter
Mozilla Developers
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox 1.5.0.8
* SeaMonkey 1.0.6
* Thunderbird 1.5.0.8

### Description

As part of the Firefox 1.5.0.8 release we fixed several bugs to
improve the stability of the product. Some of these were crashes
that showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code
with enough effort.

Thunderbird shares the browser engine with Firefox
and could be vulnerable if JavaScript were to be enabled in
mail. This is not the default setting and we strongly discourage users from
running JavaScript in mail. Without further investigation we cannot rule out
the possibility that for some of these an attacker might be able to prepare
memory for exploitation through some means other than JavaScript, such as
large images or plugin data.

The Firefox 2.0 release is not affected by these flaws; some of these
affected pre-release versions and were fixed prior to final release.

### Workaround

Upgrade to the fixed versions. Do not enable JavaScript in Thunderbird
or the mail portions of SeaMonkey.

# SeaMonkey: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200612-08**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been identified in the SeaMonkey project.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-client/seamonkey** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.0.6** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.0.6** |

### Background

The SeaMonkey project is a community effort to deliver
production-quality releases of code derived from the application
formerly known as 'Mozilla Application Suite'.

### Description

The SeaMonkey project is vulnerable to arbitrary JavaScript bytecode
execution and arbitrary code execution.

### Impact

An attacker could entice a user to load malicious JavaScript or a
malicious web page with a SeaMonkey application and execute arbitrary
code with the rights of the user running those products. It is
important to note that in the SeaMonkey email client, JavaScript is
disabled by default.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All SeaMonkey users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/seamonkey-1.0.6"
```

## Topic

Updated thunderbird packages that fix several security bugs are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

Mozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client.

Several flaws were found in the way Thunderbird processes certain malformed
Javascript code. A malicious HTML mail message could cause the execution of
Javascript code in such a way that could cause Thunderbird to crash or
execute arbitrary code as the user running Thunderbird. (CVE-2006-5463,
CVE-2006-5747, CVE-2006-5748)

Several flaws were found in the way Thunderbird renders HTML mail messages.
A malicious HTML mail message could cause the mail client to crash or
possibly execute arbitrary code as the user running Thunderbird.
(CVE-2006-5464)

A flaw was found in the way Thunderbird verifies RSA signatures. For RSA
keys with exponent 3 it is possible for an attacker to forge a signature
that would be incorrectly verified by the NSS library. Thunderbird as
shipped trusts several root Certificate Authorities that use exponent 3. An
attacker could have created a carefully crafted SSL certificate which would
be incorrectly trusted when their site was visited by a victim. This flaw
was previously thought to be fixed in Thunderbird 1.5.0.7, however Ulrich
Kuehn discovered the fix was incomplete (CVE-2006-5462)

Users of Thunderbird are advised to upgrade to this update, which contains
Thunderbird version 1.5.0.8 that corrects these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

| [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=214445#c2)  Josh Bressers    2006-11-07 22:08:09 UTC  ``` The Mozilla project is releasing Firefox 1.5.0.8 to fix a number of security flaws (Text taken from the upstream advisories):  mfsa2006-66 [CVE-2006-5462](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-5462) impact=important,reported=20061107,public=20061107,source=mozilla      MFSA 2006-60 reported that RSA digital signatures with a low exponent     (typically 3) could be forged, and that this flaw was corrected in the      Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS) library version 3.11.3 used by      Firefox 2.0 and current development versions of Mozilla clients.      Ulrich Kuehn reported that Firefox 1.5.0.7, which incorporated NSS version      3.10.2, was incompletely patched and remained vulnerable to a variant of      this attack.  mfsa2006-67 [CVE-2006-5463](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-5463)  impact=critical,reported=20061107,public=20061107,source=mozilla      shutdown demonstrated that it was possible to modify a Script object while      it was executing, potentially leading to the execution of arbitrary      JavaScript bytecode.  mfsa2006-65 impact=critical,reported=20061107,public=20061107,source=mozilla      As part of the Firefox 1.5.0.8 release we fixed several bugs to improve the      stability of the product. Some of these were crashes that showed evidence of      memory corruption and we presume that at least some of these could be      exploited to run arbitrary code with enough effort.      [CVE-2006-5464](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-5464)         Jesse Ruderman and Martijn Wargers reported crashes in the layout engine      [CVE-2006-5747](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-5747)         shutdown demonstrated that a crash in XML.prototype.hasOwnProperty was          exploitable      [CVE-2006-5748](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-5748)         Igor Bukanov and Jesse Ruderman reported potential memory corruption in          the JavaScript engine   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=214445#c3)  Mark J. Cox    2006-11-08 07:57:34 UTC  ``` removing embargo, now public at <http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=214445#c4)  Red Hat Bugzilla    2006-11-08 08:31:05 UTC  ```  An advisory has been issued which should help the problem described in this bug report. This report is therefore being closed with a resolution of ERRATA. For more information on the solution and/or where to find the updated files, please follow the link below.

firefox security update (RHSA-2006-0733)

Original Release Date: November 16, 2006

Last Revised: November 16, 2006

Number: ASA-2006-246

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 1.0

Advisory Status: Interim

---

## 1. Overview:

Firefox is a popular open source Web browser.

Firefox was found to contain vulnerabilities in how it processed
select types
of malformed Javascript code. An attacker could possibly take
advantage of
this when Firefox viewed a malicious web page, possibly causing
Firefox to
crash or execute arbitrary code as the user running Firefox. The
Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned
the names
[CVE-2006-5463](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-5463),
[CVE-2006-5747](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-5747), and
[CVE-2006-5748](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-5748) to these issues.

The parsing engine for Firefox was discovered to contain numerous
parsing
flaws when processing web pages, which could lead to Firefox crashing
or
executing arbitrary code as the user running Firefox. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned
the name
[CVE-2006-5464](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-5464) to this issue.

The previous fix put into Firefox for verifying RSA signatures when
the RSA
key had an exponent of 3 was found to be incomplete. This allowed
for
Firefox to potentially believe that a website's SSL certificate was
signed
by a Certificate Authority that it wasn't. The Common
Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2006-5462](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-5462) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the
security
advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2006-0733.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with firefox installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Messaging Storage Server | MSS 3.0 | Low | See recommended actions below.  This issue will be addressed in accordance with [Avaya's Product Security Vulnerability Response Policy](http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/security_vulnerability_response.pdf) |

**Recommended Actions:**
For all system products which use
vulnerable
versions of Firefox, Avaya recommends that customers restrict local
and
network access to the server. This restriction should be enforced
through the
use of physical security, firewalls, ACLs, VPNs, and other
generally-accepted
networking practices until such time as an update becomes available
and can
be installed.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating
systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying
operating
system or applications that come with the operating system. These
vulnerabilities often do not impact the software-only product
directly but
may threaten the integrity of the underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not
affected by
the vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be.
Customers should determine on which Linux operating system the
product was
installed and then follow that vendors guidance.

## 4. Software-Only Products:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CVLAN | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. The CVLAN application does not require the software described in this advisory. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite(IMS) | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. The IMS application does not require the software described in this advisory. |

**Recommended Actions:**
Avaya recommends that customers follow
recommended actions supplied by RedHat Linux or remove the affected
package.

## 5. Additional Information:

Additional information may also be available via the Avaya support
[website](http://support.avaya.com) and through your Avaya
account
representative. Please contact your Avaya product support
representative, or
dial 1-800-242-2121, with any questions.

See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions

This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **defect** | regression, crash, hang, security vulnerability and any other general issue. |
| **enhancement** | new feature, improvement in UI, performance, etc. and any other request for user-facing changes and enhancements in the product; not engineering changes |
| **task** | refactoring, removal, replacement, enabling or disabling of functionality and any other engineering task |

URL
Bugs can have a URL associated with them - for example, a pointer to a web site where the problem is seen.Version
The version field defines the version of the software the bug was found in.Votes
Some bugs can be voted for, and you can limit your search to bugs with more than a certain number of votes. Votes are not used by Mozilla developers to set priorities.Whiteboard

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Mozilla Firefox: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200612-07**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in Mozilla Firefox.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-client/mozilla-firefox** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.5.0.8** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.5.0.8** |

| Package | **www-client/mozilla-firefox-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.5.0.8** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.5.0.8** |

### Background

Mozilla Firefox is a popular open-source web browser from the Mozilla
Project.

### Description

Mozilla Firefox improperly handles Script objects while they are being
executed. Mozilla Firefox has also been found to be vulnerable to
various possible buffer overflows. Lastly, the binary release of
Mozilla Firefox is vulnerable to a low exponent RSA signature forgery
issue because it is bundled with a vulnerable version of NSS.

### Impact

An attacker could entice a user to view specially crafted JavaScript
and execute arbitrary code with the rights of the user running Mozilla
Firefox. An attacker could also entice a user to view a specially
crafted web page that causes a buffer overflow and again executes
arbitrary code. It is also possible for an attacker to make up SSL/TLS
certificates that would not be detected as invalid by the binary
release of Mozilla Firefox, raising the possibility for
Man-in-the-Middle attacks.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Mozilla Firefox users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-1.5.0.8"
```

All Mozilla Firefox binary release users should upgrade to the latest
version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-bin-1.5.0.8"
```

signatures. Ulrich Kuehn discovered a variant of the original attack

which the original fix did not cover. ([CVE-2006-5462](/security/CVE-2006-5462))

Various flaws have been reported that allow an attacker to execute

arbitrary code with user privileges by tricking the user into opening

a malicious web page containing JavaScript. ([CVE-2006-5463](/security/CVE-2006-5463),

[CVE-2006-5464](/security/CVE-2006-5464), [CVE-2006-5747](/security/CVE-2006-5747), [CVE-2006-5748](/security/CVE-2006-5748))

|  | |

Created by Michael Gordon (mfg@ee.ed.ac.uk) on Wednesday, May 13, 1998 6:15:17 AM PDT
Additional Details :
There's a segmentation fault in strlen() at line 4915
of cmd/xfe/mozilla.c if the previous getcwd() fails.
Is setting 'string' to '.' if getcwd() fails acceptable?

I put an assert in here for now, yeah there's a segfault possibility.
Do you have a case where this happens so I can test this?
Sorry it took so long for me to get to this bug.

[from mfg]
Just do
mkdir /tmp/foo
mkdir /tmp/foo/foo2
chmod 111 /tmp/foo
cd /tmp/foo/foo2
moz-export
I discovered this when other people tried to run the mozilla binary I'd
compiled under my home directory, which is mode 711. I don't know how
likely it is that this bug would be triggered in normal use.
