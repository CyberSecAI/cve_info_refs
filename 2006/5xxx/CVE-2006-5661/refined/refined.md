**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of a user's browser.
- This could lead to:
    - Spoofing the website content.
    - Creating fake login menus to steal user credentials.

- The `nquser.php` script then includes this unfiltered header in the response HTML, thus executing the JavaScript.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
- The affected versions include e107, Postnuke, Xaraya, and Xoops editions.
- Standalone and Fusion editions are not vulnerable.
- The advisory also provides a Proof of Concept (POC) of how the attack can be carried out.
- The CVSS base score for this vulnerability is 6.8/10, with an exploitability subscore of 8.6/10, highlighting that it is easy to exploit.
