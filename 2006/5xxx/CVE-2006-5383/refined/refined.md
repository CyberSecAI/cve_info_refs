Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2006-5383:

**1. Verification:**

*   The exploit-db.com content explicitly mentions "CVE-2006-5383" and provides details about a SQL injection vulnerability in "Def-Blog 1.0.3", which aligns with the CVE ID.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the `comadd.php` file of Def-Blog.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   SQL Injection: The application fails to properly sanitize user input when querying the database, leading to SQL injection. Specifically, the `article` parameter in `comadd.php` is vulnerable.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
*   The primary impact of this vulnerability is the ability to extract sensitive information from the database by crafting malicious SQL queries.
*   Specifically, the provided exploit shows how to extract usernames (`pseudo`) and passwords (`mdp`) from the `def_user` table.
*   The severity of the vulnerability is described as "Dangerous".

**5. Attack Vectors:**
*   Remote exploitation via HTTP GET request to the `comadd.php` script.
*   The attacker manipulates the `article` parameter in the URL.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server hosting the Def-Blog application.
*   No specific user account is required; the vulnerability can be exploited anonymously.

**Technical Details:**

*   The exploit uses `UNION SELECT` SQL injection technique to retrieve data from the database.
    *   `comadd.php?article=-1%20union%20select%20null,pseudo%20from%20def_user` retrieves usernames.
    *   `comadd.php?article=-1%20union%20select%20null,mdp%20from%20def_user` retrieves passwords.
*   The `-1` in the `article` parameter is used to ensure that no legitimate results are returned and only the attacker-injected `UNION SELECT` query is executed.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability is in Def-Blog version 1.0.1, according to the exploit code.
* The exploit was published on milw0rm.com on 2006-10-15.
