      "source": "www.exploit-db.com_ef75a66a_20250125_195235.html",
      "root_cause": "The `txt.inc.php` script in phpPowerCards 2.10 does not initialize the `$file` variable before using it in the `fopen()` function. Subsequently, it writes uninitialized variables to the opened file using `fputs()`.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Uninitialized variable usage",
        "Improper handling of user-supplied input"
      ],
       "impact": "Remote code execution. By manipulating the uninitialized variables in the query string, an attacker can write arbitrary PHP code to a file on the server, leading to full control over the server.",
      "attack_vectors": "HTTP GET requests with crafted query string parameters.",
      "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server, with `register_globals` set to `on`."
