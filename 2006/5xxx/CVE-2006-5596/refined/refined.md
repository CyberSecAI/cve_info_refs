      "is_related": true,
      "summary": "AEP SmartGate 4.3b is vulnerable to an arbitrary file download via a GET request to the SSL server (port 443). By sending a crafted request with directory traversal sequences, an attacker can download arbitrary files from the server.",

      "weaknesses": [
        "Path traversal vulnerability",
          "Insufficient input validation"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can download arbitrary files from the server, which may include sensitive data such as configuration files, password hashes, and other confidential information.",
      "attack_vector": "A remote attacker sends a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable server's SSL port (default 443).",
