RELATED: CVE-2006-5161
```

**Root Cause:** The IBM Client Security Password Manager authenticates users by mapping profiles against the "window name" property of the application. The application is vulnerable because it uses the window title to map profiles.

**Vulnerability:** The bank dynamically changed the window title to the current date. Since the IBM Client Security Password Manager authenticates by mapping the window title information, a malicious user could trick another user into sending his credentials (by phishing, XSS, or other simple methods).

**Impact:** A malicious user could trick a user into sending his credentials.

**Attack Vector:**
*   Phishing
*   XSS
*   Other simple methods.

**Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker can create a fake website with the same window title as a legitimate site and trick the user into authenticating against it.
