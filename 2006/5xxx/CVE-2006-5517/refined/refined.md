{
  "cve": "CVE-2006-5517",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application uses a variable, `$PROJECT_ROOT`, to construct include paths for PHP files, but this variable is not properly sanitized and can be manipulated via HTTP GET parameters. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary URLs into the include_once function.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)",
      "Lack of input sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can include and execute arbitrary PHP code from a remote server, leading to complete compromise of the vulnerable application and server. This can include data theft, defacement, or further attacks on the network.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "HTTP GET parameter injection via `PROJECT_ROOT`"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application, and must control a server hosting malicious PHP code that can be included and executed by the vulnerable application. No authentication is required."
