{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `change_pass.php` script in Ig-shop version 1.4 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to improper handling of user-supplied input in the `id` and `action` parameters.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability",
    "Improper sanitization/encoding of user-controlled data"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web page, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, or redirection to malicious websites.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "The `id` parameter in the query string is directly inserted into the `value` attribute of a hidden input field.",
    "The `action` parameter (if not equal to '1') causes the query string to be included in the form's `action` attribute."
  ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to craft a malicious URL containing the vulnerable parameters (`id` or `action`) and entice a user to visit that URL. The user must be logged into the Ig-shop application for the XSS to be potentially impactful"
