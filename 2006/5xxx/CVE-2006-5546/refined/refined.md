  {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from the use of the `__autoload` function in PHP5 within the OTSCMS application. This function, intended for automatic class loading, uses a path constructed from user-supplied data (`$class`) appended to a base directory taken from the application's configuration, creating a direct file inclusion vulnerability.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)",
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject arbitrary PHP code into the application by manipulating the class name, leading to complete compromise of the web server. This could allow for actions such as data theft, defacement, or further attacks on the server or network.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request. Specifically, by manipulating the `GLOBALS[config][directories][classes]` (for versions 2.0.0-2.1.3) or `GLOBALS[config][otscms][directories][classes]` (for versions 1.3.0-1.4.1) or `GLOBALS[config][otscms][directories][includes]` (for versions 1.0.0 - 1.0.3 ) parameters in the URL, the attacker can specify a malicious remote file to be included and executed by the `require_once` statement.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No prior authentication or specific privileges are required beyond accessing the web application's URL."
