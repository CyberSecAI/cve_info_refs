{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to the insecure use of the 'path' parameter in the 'track.php' and 'connect.php' files, which allows remote file inclusion.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include and execute arbitrary code from a remote server on the vulnerable system.",
  "Attack vectors": "By manipulating the 'path' parameter in the 'track.php' or 'connect.php' files via a crafted URL.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have a web server with a malicious PHP file to include. They need to know the path to vulnerable scripts on the target server."
