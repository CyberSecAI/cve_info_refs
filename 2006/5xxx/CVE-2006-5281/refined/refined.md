```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The n@board application's naboard_pnr.php file includes the content of a file specified via the 'skin' parameter without proper sanitization.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can include and execute arbitrary code from a remote server, potentially leading to complete compromise of the server.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability is exploited by manipulating the 'skin' parameter in the naboard_pnr.php file, pointing it to a malicious file hosted on a remote server.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and host a malicious PHP file on a reachable server.
