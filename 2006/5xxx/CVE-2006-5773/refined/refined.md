    "exploit_db": {
      "content": "The provided content from Exploit Database details multiple vulnerabilities in FreeWebShop.org version 2.2.2, possibly lower.\n\n**Vulnerabilities:**\n\n*   **Login Bypass:**  The application is vulnerable to a login bypass using the username `admin` and a password of `' or 'a'='a`.\n*   **Arbitrary File Read:** A vulnerability allows reading arbitrary files on the server using path traversal in the `page` parameter e.g., `/index.php?page=info&action=../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00`.\n*   **Password Listing:** An SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `prod` parameter of `/index.php?page=details`. This can be exploited to list passwords from the customer database using a UNION SELECT query.\n*   **Path Disclosure:** The application discloses the full path to the web root when requesting a non-existent file using path traversal e.g., `/index.php?page=info&action=../../1337inexistant`.\n*   **Arbitrary File Creation:**  An attacker can create files on the server, by leveraging path disclosure to determine the correct location for file creation. The example shows how to write a PHP shell using SQL injection to an arbitrary path, then execute commands via GET paramter: \n`/index.php?page=details&prod=1337%20UNION%20SELECT%201,2,3,%22%3C?php%20passthru($_GET['cmd'])%20?%3E%22,5,6,7,8%20FROM%20customer%20INTO%20OUTFILE%20'[NEWPATH]/fork.php'`\n`/langs/uk/fork.php?cmd=ls`\n\n**Impact:**\n\n*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can bypass login authentication.\n*   **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive information like server files and database passwords can be accessed.\n*   **Code Execution:**  Attackers can create and execute arbitrary PHP code, gaining full control of the server.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **HTTP GET Requests:** All attacks can be performed via crafted GET requests.\n\n**Required Capabilities:**\n\n*   **Remote Access:** Attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server."
