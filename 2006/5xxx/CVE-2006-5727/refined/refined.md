```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The application uses user-supplied input to construct a file path for inclusion using the `include()` function. Specifically, the `$_saz['settings']['shippingfolder']` parameter is vulnerable to manipulation, allowing an attacker to specify an arbitrary file to be included.

- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
  - Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability
  - Unsanitized user input used in `include()` function.
  - Insecure use of the `$_saz` array, allowing an attacker to inject a malicious URL in the `shippingfolder` index.

- Impact of exploitation:
  - Arbitrary code execution on the server. By injecting a URL pointing to a malicious PHP file, the attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the vulnerable server with the privileges of the webserver user.
  - Complete compromise of the web server and potentially the underlying system.

- Attack vectors:
  - HTTP GET request to the vulnerable script (`admin/controls/cart.php`).
  - Manipulation of the `_saz[settings][shippingfolder]` parameter in the URL.

- Required attacker capabilities/position:
  - Ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
  - Knowledge of the vulnerable script's location and vulnerable parameter.
