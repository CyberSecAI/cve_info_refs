Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2006-5239:

**Vulnerability Details:**
*   **Software:** eXpBlog <= 0.3.5
*   **Vulnerability Type:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
*   **Root Cause:** Improper sanitization of user-supplied input.

**Specific Vulnerabilities:**
1.  **`kalender.php`:** The `$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']` variable is not sanitized before being used, allowing for injection of arbitrary HTML and script code.
2.  **`pre_details.php`:** The `$_POST["captcha_session_code"]` variable is not sanitized before being used in `details.php`. This can also affect the captcha class, as it might allow opening a special file (`captcha_class.php`).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Attackers can inject malicious HTML and script code.
*   The injected scripts execute within a user's browser session in the context of the vulnerable site. This allows the attacker to potentially:
    *   Steal cookies
    *   Redirect users to malicious websites
    *   Perform actions on behalf of the user
    *   Deface the web page
    *   Other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **`kalender.php`:** The vulnerability can be triggered by manipulating the URL, specifically the `PHP_SELF` variable.
*   **`pre_details.php`:** The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the `captcha_session_code` POST parameter when submitting comments or other form data.

**Attacker Capabilities:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send specially crafted requests to the vulnerable application.
*   The attacker does not need any special permissions on the vulnerable server.

**Technical Details:**
*   The advisory mentions specific vulnerable lines in the source code.
*   It points out that PHP's `htmlentities()` function should be used for sanitization.
*   It also provides example proof of concepts for each vulnerable file.
