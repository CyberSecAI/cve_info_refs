How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package: pstotext

Severity: grave
Justification: user security hole

exit_group(3)                           = ?

You can see that I correctly quoted the parameter in the invoking shell, and
pstotext passes the parameter to the nested sh as 'a'b.ps' which obviously gets
it confused.

This could be a security issue, if you can run pstotext with an
arbitrary filename (eg. via swish++ running on some untrusted source).
eg:

ivt@ivtintranet:/tmp/data$ strace -s 256 -e trace=process -ff "pstotext" "hi.txt'; id>/tmp/abc.key; echo 'silly"
execve("/usr/bin/pstotext", ["pstotext", "hi.txt\'; id>/tmp/abc.key; echo \'silly"], [/* 19 vars */]) = 0

You can clearly see that I tricked pstotext into running id and outputing the
result into a temp file.

If I do the following:

ivt@ivtintranet:/tmp/data$ touch "hi.txt'; id>abc.key; echo 'silly.ps"

ivt@ivtintranet:/tmp/data$ rm abc.key
ivt@ivtintranet:/tmp/data$ ls -l
total 0
-rw-r--r--  1 ivt ivt 0 2006-03-15 16:50 hi.txt'; id>abc.key; echo 'silly.ps

I can trick swish++ into running an arbitrary command by passing
the filename through pstotext:

ivt@ivtintranet:/tmp/data$ 'index++' -v4 '--config-file' '/usr/share/sitebuilder/core/indexing.conf' '--index-file' /tmp/abcd /tmp/data

/tmp/data:
  hi.txt'; id>abc.key; echo 'silly.psESP Ghostscript 7.07.1: Unrecoverable error, exit code 1
 (skipped: can not open)

index++: done:
  00:01 (min:sec) elapsed time
  1 files, 0 indexed
  0 words, 0 indexed, 0 unique

ivt@ivtintranet:/tmp/data$ ls -l
total 4
-rw-r--r--  1 ivt ivt 162 2006-03-15 16:51 abc.key
-rw-r--r--  1 ivt ivt   0 2006-03-15 16:50 hi.txt'; id>abc.key; echo 'silly.ps
ivt@ivtintranet:/tmp/data$ cat abc.key

pstotext currently popen(3)s a command containing a filename supplied by its
caller. The only way to secure it against nasty filenames would be to
rewrite it not to use popen(3). The attached patch seems to do the trick but
should be reviewed - I'm not sure I've done the fork'n'pipe completely
right; there may be some cleanup missing and it breaks the VMS build (though
I doubt someone cares about that). Oh well, it's a start.

Hello,

I noticed your patch to this problem, so I decided to review it.

It looks good to me. Other solutions are also possible, but your
solution looks better.

However, I notice the cleanup() routine still calls pclose(...). This
has me puzzled because no errors are generated, so maybe the cleanup
code isn't being called for some reason (it looks like gs==null???).

I think pclose (which is documented only to work with popen) needs to be
replaced with waitpid(...). This function should also perform the
cleanup you were concerned about (not really a major issue with pstotext
because it exits so quickly anyway - but it seems like a good idea to
get the exit status). For this to work, you will need to save the PID
returned by fork so cleanup can access it.

As for VMS, this is something I have no idea what-so-ever about. I would
assume it should work, but I have never been near a VMS system so I have
no idea.

(disclaimer: I am no expert at this either).

Please CC responses to me, thanks.

I'm attaching an updated version of my patch. Note that I'm not explicitly
saving the child PID yet, but it might just do the trick.

Frankly, I don't think anyone cares about the VMS port. I'm just trying to
make minimal changes at this point to make it easier to integrate this
upstream.

Hi security team,

this bug wasn't tagged security, so I don't know whether you are aware
of it. I think a DSA might be appropriate.

Hi,

The current patch does not work with input from stdin.
See the gentoo bug report: <https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=132662>

I have attached a modified patch that fixes the security issue and still
works with stdin.
