{
  "CVE-2006-5399": {
    "Description": "PHPRecipeBook 2.35 is vulnerable to remote file inclusion. The 'g_rb_basedir' parameter in classes/Import_MM.class.php allows remote attackers to include arbitrary files via a URL.",
    "Root cause": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the 'g_rb_basedir' parameter, allowing it to be used in an include statement without validation.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)",
      "Lack of input sanitization"
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to include and execute arbitrary PHP code from a remote server. This can lead to complete compromise of the web server, allowing for data theft, defacement, or denial of service.",
    "Attack vectors": "A remote attacker sends a crafted HTTP GET request to classes/Import_MM.class.php with the 'g_rb_basedir' parameter containing a URL to a malicious PHP file.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests and host a malicious PHP file on a publicly accessible server. The application also needs to have register_globals enabled and magic_quotes_gpc off.",
        "Additional details": "The provided exploit script demonstrates a method to perform remote file inclusion by setting the `g_rb_basedir` parameter to a remote URL, and also allows the attacker to pass commands to the shell for execution. It also provides an option for a patch attempt which, if not correctly handled can cause the application to stop working."
