RELATED: CVE-2006-5226

Vulnerability:
Remote File Inclusion

Root cause:
The vulnerability exists due to the lack of proper input validation in the "chemin" parameter of the "moteur.php" script. The script uses the "chemin" parameter in include statements without sufficient sanitization, allowing remote file inclusion.

Weakness:
The code includes files based on user-supplied input without proper validation.

Impact:
An attacker can include arbitrary remote files, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.

Attack vector:
By manipulating the "chemin" parameter in the URL, an attacker can specify a remote file to be included in the script's execution.

Required attacker capabilities:
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and have access to a remote file that they want to include.
