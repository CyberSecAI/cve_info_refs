## [Run Your Internet Radio Station With Campcaster](https://www.campware.org/en/camp/campcaster_news/818/)

Campcaster can be an excellent system for managing your internet radio broadcasts, but it doesn’t handle Internet streams itself. You will need a couple of other tools as well to make everything work as you wish. Those streaming tools can be a bit technical, but the good news is that once they’re up and running, they’re quite stable, so it makes it well worth the effort. Read on for more information.

“Campsite is our first choice for publishing magazines on the web. Our youth magazine fluter.de has been running on Campsite since 2001. Ever since, we could rely on it`s stability and have been impressed with the ongoing development of new features over the years. Most noticably, the automated publishing scheduler – which buys us a lot of spare time while pre-produced material is automatically going online.” [casino en español](https://es.twin.com/)
