  "CVE-2006-5379": {
    "description": "The NVIDIA Binary Graphics Driver for Linux is vulnerable to a buffer overflow that allows an attacker to run arbitrary code as root. This bug can be exploited both locally or remotely (via a remote X client or an X client which visits a malicious web page). The NVIDIA drivers for Solaris and FreeBSD are also likely to be vulnerable.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the NVIDIA binary blob driver when rendering glyphs (text character data). The driver calculates the bounding box for glyph data and allocates memory based on the width and height of the glyphs. However, it does not properly validate the calculated destination position within the buffer when copying the glyph data, leading to an out-of-bounds write.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Buffer Overflow",
         "Improper bounds checking"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution with root privileges on the affected system. The vulnerability can also lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) by crashing the X server. ",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "Local exploitation via a malicious X client.",
        "Remote exploitation via a malicious X client or an X client that visits a malicious webpage.",
        "Remote DoS by rendering a long text string within an existing X client."

       "attacker_position": [
        "Locally, by running a malicious X client.",
        "Remotely, by controlling a remote X client or by enticing a user to visit a malicious web page using an existing X client (e.g., Firefox)."

It can be avoided by disabling Render acceleration via the \"RenderAccel\" X configuration option. The vulnerability was fixed in driver version 1.0-8776 and is not present in older versions (e.g., 1.0-8178 or 1.0-7184).",
