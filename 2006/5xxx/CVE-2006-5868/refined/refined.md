  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2006-5868",
    "description": "Daniel Kobras discovered multiple buffer overflows in ImageMagick's SGI file format decoder. By tricking a user or an automated system into processing a specially crafted SGI image, this could be exploited to execute arbitrary code with the user's privileges.",
    "affected_components": [
      "ImageMagick"
    ],
    "root_cause": "Multiple buffer overflows in ImageMagick's SGI file format decoder.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "Execution of arbitrary code with the user's privileges.",
    "attack_vector": "By tricking a user or an automated system into processing a specially crafted SGI image.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a specially crafted SGI image file. The user or an automated system must then process this crafted image, which may require social engineering or other means of delivering the crafted image to a vulnerable target.",
    "remediation": "Update the system to the following package versions:\n\nUbuntu 6.06:\nlibmagick9 - 6:6.2.4.5-0.6ubuntu0.4\n\nUbuntu 5.10:\nlibmagick6 - 6:6.2.3.4-1ubuntu1.5"
