Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2006-5958:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The identified vulnerability is a combination of SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issues within the Infinicart product.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Multiple GET parameters are vulnerable to SQL injection. These parameters are found in the following files:
    *   `/infinicart-demo/browse_group.asp?groupid=[sql]`
    *   `/infinicart-demo/added_to_cart.asp?productid=[sql]`
    *   `/infinicart-demo/browsesubcat.asp?catid=[sql]`
    *   `/infinicart-demo/browsesubcat.asp?catid=13&subid=[sql]`
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Multiple POST parameters are vulnerable to XSS. The vulnerable parameters are:
    *   `/infinicart-demo/login.asp`: username and password fields
    *   `/infinicart-demo/search.asp`: search field
    *   `/infinicart-demo/sendpassword.asp`: email field

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to:
    *   Gain unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the database.
    *   Modify or delete data, potentially causing data integrity issues.
    *   Potentially gain control over the underlying server if the database user has sufficient privileges.
*   **XSS:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to:
    *   Inject malicious scripts into the web pages, potentially redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Steal session cookies, leading to account hijacking.
    *   Modify displayed content to deface the website.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The attack vectors are GET requests with manipulated parameters.
*   **XSS:** The attack vectors are POST requests with crafted payloads in specific input fields.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker must have knowledge of the vulnerable parameters and the application structure.
*   The attacker can be remote, since vulnerabilities are accessible through HTTP requests to the web application.
*   The attacker must be able to craft malicious SQL queries and XSS payloads.
