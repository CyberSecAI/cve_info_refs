When a user's account is locked out, xscreensaver allows access for that user with *any* password.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):  This has only been noticed in xscreensaver-4.18-5.rhel4.11.  We have not tried any prior versions supplied with RHEL 4.  How reproducible:  Always  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Configure system to authenticate against Fedora Directory Server. 2. Log in as a user and start xscreensaver 3. Lockout the account (in this case, 3 bad passwords causes a lockout) 4. Enter any password into the xscreensaver login prompt    Actual results:  Xscreensaver does not deny access to locked out accounts.  Expected results:  Xscreensaver should not allow access to a locked out account.

Your pam configuration looks fine, I think.  The problem is probably because of this bit in xscreensaver's source code:         /* We don't actually care if the account modules fail or succeed,        * but we need to run them anyway because certain pam modules        * depend on side effects of the account modules getting run.        */       status2 = pam_acct_mgmt (pamh, 0);  I think the reason we don't care if it fails or succeeds is so that a system doesn't end up in a situation where the screen can't be unlocked.  I'm not 100% sure this is a compelling rationale though.  I'm going to add some other people to this bug report to get opinions on which behavior is right. Tomas, Nalin, what do you guys think?   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=207286#c4)  Tomas Mraz    2006-09-20 17:00:06 UTC  ``` I think it's OK as is, as the user had the access before the screen was locked and the screensaver is probably not the right place for disallowing him to login.  It wouldn't work for users from /etc/shadow anyway.    ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=207286#c5)  Ray Strode [halfline]    2006-09-20 17:24:03 UTC  ``` That sounds reasonable to me. Another point is, if the screen doesn't happen to be locked when the user is revoked, the user still has full access to the machine.  Steve, we're going to close this out.  If you'd like to request a future feature for more immediate lock down of revoked credentials, please log on at <https://www.redhat.com/apps/support/> and file a ticket there.  Thanks!   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=207286#c6)  Steve Rigler    2006-09-21 12:40:52 UTC  ``` I'm confused about the rationale for keeping this as-is.  By implementing  account lockouts we're (obviously) trying to prevent brute force attacks.   They way it works now I don't even have to worry about guessing the user's  password.  I can just walk into their office, put x number of bad passwords  into xscreensaver's password dialog until their account locks and then the  screensaver will let me in.  From our perspective this is extremely  undesirable.  If I have to file a feature request to get this working how long will we have  to wait for the functionality we need?   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=207286#c7)  Tomas Mraz    2006-09-21 12:49:27 UTC  ``` Well this would be certainly undesirable behaviour and I don't think it works that way. At least with non-buggy LDAP server.  Are you really sure, that when the account locks the authentication starts succeeding without proper password? That seems like a major security bug in either the LDAP server or pam_ldap.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=207286#c8)  Steve Rigler    2006-09-21 12:59:16 UTC  ``` I'm testing a mix of services on RHEL 3 and RHEL 4.  So far, when an account  is locked every single service I've tested disallows access to a locked  account except for xscreensaver on RHEL 4 U4 (I haven't checked U3 yet, but  it's on my list for today).  On RHEL 3 xscreensaver disallows access as  expected.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=207286#c9)  Ray Strode [halfline]    2006-09-21 14:28:20 UTC  ``` Hi Steve,  There was a misunderstanding on my part regarding the severity of this issue.  I thought the problem being reported was that a user can unlock the screen with their correct password even after their accounted is locked.  You're saying that the user can log in with ANY password after their account is locked.  That's a much more severe problem and I'm reopening the bug report.  I'm sorry for the misunderstanding.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=207286#c10)  Nalin Dahyabhai    2006-09-22 05:17:13 UTC  ``` I'm looking at the pam_ldap sources, and it looks to me as though, when the directory server responds with a PasswordPolicyResponse control, the error for the bind request itself is suppressed so that it can be reported later from the pam_acct_mgmt() callback.  So in this case, xscreensaver gets a success result from pam_authenticate().  It calls pam_acct_mgmt(), gets the error code which pam_ldap reports, and discards it.  Steve, if you can attach a dump of the traffic between the client and the directory server (without SSL, using 'tcpdump -s 0'), we can verify that this is indeed what's happening in your setup.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=207286#c11)  Tomas Mraz    2006-09-22 06:13:42 UTC  ``` I'm really curious why it was implemented this way in pam_ldap. It doesn't seem to be right behaviour at all. Regardless missing pam_acct_mgmt() result check in screensaver.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=207286#c12)  Steve Rigler    2006-09-22 12:29:29 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 136939](attachment.cgi?id=136939 \"tcpdump output\") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=136939&action=edit \"tcpdump output\") tcpdump output  I set the lockout threshold down to 1 bad password attempt.  This tcpdump is of the initial bad password and then a second attempt using the same bad password where xscreensaver allows access.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=207286#c13)  Nalin Dahyabhai    2006-09-22 20:59:15 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #11](show_bug.cgi?id=207286#c11)) > I'm really curious why it was implemented this way in pam_ldap. It > doesn't seem to be right behaviour at all. Regardless missing > pam_acct_mgmt() result check in screensaver.  I think the intent is to keep track of failure status which was received as part of the authentication response from the server, so that it can be reported from the account management phase, which is when the PAM spec says the application will expect it.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=207286#c14)  Nalin Dahyabhai    2006-09-22 22:01:04 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 136980](attachment.cgi?id=136980 \"updated source package with proposed patch\") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=136980&action=edit \"updated source package with proposed patch\") updated source package with proposed patch  Steve, can you rebuild the attached package and give it a try?	I think the patch is correct, and will solve the problem, but I don't have a suitable test environment at the moment.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=207286#c15)  Steve Rigler    2006-09-22 22:26:00 UTC  ``` This package clears up the immediate issue with xscreensaver.  I can now lockout the user's account and xscreensaver won't let me back in no matter what password I give it.  The only side-affect I've noticed is that other services (gdm and telnet) don't provide a notification that the account is locked.  This isn't a show-stopper for us in any way and it might even be debatable (from a security perspective) whether it's really necessary to provide that much information for a login failure.  Thanks for the quick turn around!   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=207286#c16)  Josh Bressers    2006-09-27 20:33:20 UTC  ``` Nalin,  Does this bug affect all ldap servers, or only Fedora/RHDS?   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=207286#c17)  Nalin Dahyabhai    2006-09-27 21:18:59 UTC  ``` It's triggered by servers which implement the control.

If an LDAP server responded to an\nauthentication request with a PasswordPolicyResponse control, it was\npossible for an application using nss_ldap to improperly authenticate\ncertain users. (CVE-2006-5170)\n\nThis flaw was only exploitable within applications which did not properly\nprocess nss_ldap error messages. Only xscreensaver is currently known to\nexhibit this behavior.\n\nAll users of nss_ldap should upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain a backported patch that resolves this issue.\n\n## Solution\n\nBefore applying this update, make sure all previously released errata\nrelevant to your system have been applied.\n\nThis update is available via Red Hat Network. To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\n\nup2date\n\nThis will start an
