# pam\_ldap: Authentication bypass vulnerability — GLSA **200612-19**

pam\_ldap contains a vulnerability that may allow a remote user with a
locked account to gain unauthorized system access.

### Affected packages

| Package | **sys-auth/pam\_ldap** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **183** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **183** |

### Background

pam\_ldap is a Pluggable Authentication Module which allows
authentication against LDAP directories.

### Description

Steve Rigler discovered that pam\_ldap does not correctly handle
"PasswordPolicyResponse" control responses from an LDAP directory. This
causes the pam\_authenticate() function to always succeed, even if the
previous authentication failed.

### Impact

A locked user may exploit this vulnerability to bypass the LDAP
authentication mechanism, possibly gaining unauthorized access to the
system.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All pam\_ldap users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sys-auth/pam_ldap-183"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=207286#c0)  Steve Rigler    2006-09-20 14:27:40 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  We are using Fedora Directory Server for authentication with password policies configured.  When a user's account is locked out, xscreensaver allows access for that user with *any* password.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):  This has only been noticed in xscreensaver-4.18-5.rhel4.11.  We have not tried any prior versions supplied with RHEL 4.  How reproducible:  Always  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Configure system to authenticate against Fedora Directory Server. 2. Log in as a user and start xscreensaver 3. Lockout the account (in this case, 3 bad passwords causes a lockout) 4.

Your pam configuration looks fine, I think.  The problem is probably because of this bit in xscreensaver's source code:         /* We don't actually care if the account modules fail or succeed,        * but we need to run them anyway because certain pam modules        * depend on side effects of the account modules getting run.        */       status2 = pam_acct_mgmt (pamh, 0);  I think the reason we don't care if it fails or succeeds is so that a system doesn't end up in a situation where the screen can't be unlocked.  I'm not 100% sure this is a compelling rationale though.  I'm going to add some other people to this bug report to get opinions on which behavior is right. Tomas, Nalin, what do you guys think?   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=207286#c4)  Tomas Mraz    2006-09-20 17:00:06 UTC  ``` I think it's OK as is, as the user had the access before the screen was locked and the screensaver is probably not the right place for disallowing him to login.  It wouldn't work for users from /etc/shadow anyway.    ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=207286#c5)  Ray Strode [halfline]    2006-09-20 17:24:03 UTC  ``` That sounds reasonable to me. Another point is, if the screen doesn't happen to be locked when the user is revoked, the user still has full access to the machine.  Steve, we're going to close this out.  If you'd like to request a future feature for more immediate lock down of revoked credentials, please log on at <https://www.redhat.com/apps/support/> and file a ticket there.  Thanks!   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=207286#c6)  Steve Rigler    2006-09-21 12:40:52 UTC  ``` I'm confused about the rationale for keeping this as-is.  By implementing  account lockouts we're (obviously) trying to prevent brute force attacks.   They way it works now I don't even have to worry about guessing the user's  password.  I can just walk into their office, put x number of bad passwords  into xscreensaver's password dialog until their account locks and then the  screensaver will let me in.  From our perspective this is extremely  undesirable.  If I have to file a feature request to get this working how long will we have  to wait for the functionality we need?   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=207286#c7)  Tomas Mraz    2006-09-21 12:49:27 UTC  ``` Well this would be certainly undesirable behaviour and I don't think it works that way. At least with non-buggy LDAP server.  Are you really sure, that when the account locks the authentication starts succeeding without proper password? That seems like a major security bug in either the LDAP server or pam_ldap.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=207286#c8)  Steve Rigler    2006-09-21 12:59:16 UTC  ``` I'm testing a mix of services on RHEL 3 and RHEL 4.  So far, when an account  is locked every single service I've tested disallows access to a locked  account except for xscreensaver on RHEL 4 U4 (I haven't checked U3 yet, but  it's on my list for today).  On RHEL 3 xscreensaver disallows access as  expected.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=207286#c9)  Ray Strode [halfline]    2006-09-21 14:28:20 UTC  ``` Hi Steve,  There was a misunderstanding on my part regarding the severity of this issue.  I thought the problem being reported was that a user can unlock the screen with their correct password even after their accounted is locked.  You're saying that the user can log in with ANY password after their account is locked.  That's a much more severe problem and I'm reopening the bug report.  I'm sorry for the misunderstanding.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=207286#c10)  Nalin Dahyabhai    2006-09-22 05:17:13 UTC  ``` I'm looking at the pam_ldap sources, and it looks to me as though, when the directory server responds with a PasswordPolicyResponse control, the error for the bind request itself is suppressed so that it can be reported later from the pam_acct_mgmt() callback.  So in this case, xscreensaver gets a success result from pam_authenticate().  It calls pam_acct_mgmt(), gets the error code which pam_ldap reports, and discards it.  Steve, if you can attach a dump of the traffic between the client and the directory server (without SSL, using 'tcpdump -s 0'), we can verify that this is indeed what's happening in your setup.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=207286#c11)  Tomas Mraz    2006-09-22 06:13:42 UTC  ``` I'm really curious why it was implemented this way in pam_ldap. It doesn't seem to be right behaviour at all. Regardless missing pam_acct_mgmt() result check in screensaver.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=207286#c12)  Steve Rigler    2006-09-22 12:29:29 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 136939](attachment.cgi?id=136939 "tcpdump output") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=136939&action=edit "tcpdump output") tcpdump output  I set the lockout threshold down to 1 bad password attempt.  This tcpdump is of the initial bad password and then a second attempt using the same bad password where xscreensaver allows access.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=207286#c13)  Nalin Dahyabhai    2006-09-22 20:59:15 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #11](show_bug.cgi?id=207286#c11)) > I'm really curious why it was implemented this way in pam_ldap. It > doesn't seem to be right behaviour at all. Regardless missing > pam_acct_mgmt() result check in screensaver.  I think the intent is to keep track of failure status which was received as part of the authentication response from the server, so that it can be reported from the account management phase, which is when the PAM spec says the application will expect it.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=207286#c14)  Nalin Dahyabhai    2006-09-22 22:01:04 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 136980](attachment.cgi?id=136980 "updated source package with proposed patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=136980&action=edit "updated source package with proposed patch") updated source package with proposed patch  Steve, can you rebuild the attached package and give it a try?	I think the patch is correct, and will solve the problem, but I don't have a suitable test environment at the moment.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=207286#c15)  Steve Rigler    2006-09-22 22:26:00 UTC  ``` This package clears up the immediate issue with xscreensaver.  I can now lockout the user's account and xscreensaver won't let me back in no matter what password I give it.  The only side-affect I've noticed is that other services (gdm and telnet) don't provide a notification that the account is locked.  This isn't a show-stopper for us in any way and it might even be debatable (from a security perspective) whether it's really necessary to provide that much information for a login failure.  Thanks for the quick turn around!   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=207286#c16)  Josh Bressers    2006-09-27 20:33:20 UTC  ``` Nalin,  Does this bug affect all ldap servers, or only Fedora/RHDS?   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=207286#c17)  Nalin Dahyabhai    2006-09-27 21:18:59 UTC  ``` It's triggered by servers which implement the control.  I don't really know how common it is, but my understanding is that current versions of OpenLDAP also implement it.  A web search for the control's OID (1.3.6.1.4.1.42.2.27.8.5.1) suggests that IBM/Tivoli and Sun (of course) also implement it.   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=207286#c18)  Josh Bressers    2006-09-29 14:26:59 UTC  ``` Nalin,  I'm under the impression we shold call this a secuirty issue and get a CVE id.

Package        : libpam-ldap
Vulnerability  : programming error
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2006-5170
Debian Bug     : 392984

Steve Rigler discovered that the PAM module for authentication against
LDAP servers processes PasswordPolicyReponse control messages incorrectly,
which might lead to an attacker being able to login into a suspended
system account.

For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 178-1sarge3. Due to technical problems with the security
buildd infrastructure this update lacks a build for the Sun Sparc
architecture. It will be released as soon as the problems are resolved.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 180-1.2.

We recommend that you upgrade your libpam-ldap package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# RHSA-2006:0719 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Moderate: nss\_ldap security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2006%3A0719)

## Topic

Updated nss\_ldap packages that fix a security flaw are now available for
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red Hat
Security Response Team.

## Description

nss\_ldap is a set of C library extensions that allow X.500 and LDAP
directory servers to be used as primary sources for aliases, ethers,
groups, hosts, networks, protocols, users, RPCs, services, and shadow
passwords.

A flaw was found in the way nss\_ldap handled a PasswordPolicyResponse
control sent by an LDAP server. If an LDAP server responded to an
authentication request with a PasswordPolicyResponse control, it was
possible for an application using nss\_ldap to improperly authenticate
certain users. (CVE-2006-5170)

This flaw was only exploitable within applications which did not properly
process nss\_ldap error messages. Only xscreensaver is currently known to
exhibit this behavior.

All users of nss\_ldap should upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain a backported patch that resolves this issue.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

## Affected Products

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server 4 x86\_64
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server 4 ia64
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server 4 i386
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux Workstation 4 x86\_64
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux Workstation 4 ia64
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux Workstation 4 i386
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux Desktop 4 x86\_64
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux Desktop 4 i386
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux for IBM z Systems 4 s390x
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux for IBM z Systems 4 s390
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux for Power, big endian 4 ppc

## Fixes

* [BZ - 207286](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=207286)
  - CVE-2006-5170 When using LDAP for authentication, xscreensaver allows access if account locked out.
