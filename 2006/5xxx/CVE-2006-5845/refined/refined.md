Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The Speedwiki 2.0 CMS lacks proper input sanitization when handling file uploads, specifically in the `/speedywiki/index.php?upload=1` path. This allows a logged-in user to upload arbitrary files, including PHP scripts, to the server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of any filtering or validation on file uploads, allowing for the upload of any file type.
-   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The system is also vulnerable to XSS via the `showRevisions` parameter in `index.php`.
-  **Full Path Disclosure:**  The system discloses the full path of the application when parameters `showRevisions`, `searchText`, and `upload.php` are accessed without values.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By uploading a PHP script, an attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution on the server. This allows an attacker to potentially take complete control of the server, steal sensitive data, deface the website, or use the server as a launching point for other attacks.
- **Cross-Site Scripting:** Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking or other malicious activities.
- **Information Disclosure**: The disclosure of the full path to files can aid in further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **File Upload:** An attacker, after gaining valid user access to the Speedwiki CMS, can upload a malicious PHP file through the upload functionality at `/speedywiki/index.php?upload=1`.
-   **XSS:** The attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code through the `showRevisions` parameter `/index.php?showRevisions=</textarea>'"><script>alert(document.cookie)</script>` which will execute when a user views the page.
-  **Full Path Disclosure:** An attacker can access the following URLs to reveal the file paths: `/speedywiki/index.php?showRevisions[]=`, `/speedywiki/index.php?searchText[]=`, and `/speedywiki/upload.php`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Authentication:** The attacker must have a valid user account on the Speedwiki 2.0 system to use the upload functionality.
-   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to reach the web server hosting the vulnerable Speedwiki installation via HTTP.
-   **For XSS:** The attacker can potentially leverage other methods for a user to view the manipulated URL

**Additional details not in the CVE:**
- The content provides specific vulnerable paths and attack vectors to use for exploitation.
- The content explicitly states the lack of upload filtering as the root cause for arbitrary file upload.
- The content provides additional vulnerability such as XSS and path disclosure.

**Summary:**

The Speedwiki 2.0 CMS suffers from a critical vulnerability that allows a logged-in user to upload arbitrary files, including PHP scripts, due to a lack of input validation. This, coupled with an XSS vulnerability, and path disclosure vulnerability, presents a severe security risk. This allows for remote arbitrary code execution, and further malicious activities.
