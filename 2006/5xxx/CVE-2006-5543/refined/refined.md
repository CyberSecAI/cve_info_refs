{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application uses an unsanitized `$path` variable in an `include` statement within `function.php3`, allowing for remote file inclusion.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include and execute arbitrary code from a remote server, potentially leading to complete compromise of the affected system.",
  "Attack vectors": "By manipulating the `path` parameter in a GET request to the vulnerable `function.php3` script, an attacker can specify a URL pointing to a malicious file to be included.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable server and have a malicious PHP file hosted on a server accessible to the victim."
