AFFECTED PRODUCTS
=================
OneOrZero Helpdesk v1.6.0 - v1.6.4
OVERVIEW
========
From the website: "The OneOrZero Open Source Task Management and Help Desk
System is a powerful task management and help desk application,
based to 'get the job done'."
http://www.oneorzero.com/
An insecure password reset allows external knowledge of what the
password is set to.
DETAILS
=======
1. Information Disclosure
The forgot password function will reset the password after a security question
is answered. However, the admin user has this password left blank by default
and is often left that way after the program is installed. By
attempting to reset
the admin password and leaving the answer blank one can force a reset of the
password. However, since the password reset function sets the password based
only on the username and the time on the server, the password that it is set
to can be determine easily. Once the time of a server is discovered determining
what the password is set to becomes trivial.
POC
===
1.
------
The password is generated with the following code:
$password = time().$\_POST[username];
Quite often web servers will return the date on the servers for when
the request is
processed. For example "Date: Thu, 12 Oct 2006 01:11:21 GMT"
The following command on a linux will return the unix time for the
system for when
the request was processed.
bash$ date --date="Thu, 12 Oct 2006 01:11:21 GMT" "+%s"
1160615001
Which allows us to deduce the return password of 1160615001admin
