Subject: Re: Announce: OpenSSH 9.8 released

Some nitpicks:

CVE-2006-5051 found by Mark Dowd, which was the original bug that got
relatively recently reintroduced as CVE-2024-6387, still has in its
description an erroneous reference to GSSAPI:

> Signal handler race condition in OpenSSH before 4.4 allows remote
> attackers to cause a denial of service (crash), and possibly execute
> arbitrary code if GSSAPI authentication is enabled, via unspecified
> vectors that lead to a double-free.

It was understood back in 2006 that this bug's exposure did not in fact
depend on GSSAPI:

I suggest removing " if GSSAPI authentication is enabled" from
CVE-2006-5051 description.  Maybe someone reading this can correct that.

Maybe I pay too much attention to historical detail, but this error in
CVE-2006-5051 did cause the question of GSSAPI (ir)relevance to come up
in CVE-2024-6387 discussions at least twice (that I know of).

Dug Song and I designed the original fake keystroke echo packets
mitigation, and per our advisory/article back then this was "initially
applied to OpenSSH starting with version 2.5.0.  OpenSSH 2.5.2 contains
the more complete versions of the fixes and solves certain
interoperability issues associated with the earlier versions."

<https://www.openwall.com/articles/SSH-Traffic-Analysis>

After the 9.8 release, I've added an update (clearly marked as such) to
the article above to refer to the issue reintroduction and the new fix.
I was also surprised by the reference to 2.9.9 above, so I checked
OpenSSH-portable commits.  To me, our original references to 2.5.x look
correct, and I have no idea where 2.9.9 came from.

Luckily, those old version references are not part of the CVE-2024-39894
description, so nothing to correct there.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# OpenSSH: Multiple Denial of Service vulnerabilities — GLSA **200611-06**

Several Denial of Service vulnerabilities have been identified in OpenSSH.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-misc/openssh** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.4\_p1-r5** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.4\_p1-r5** |

### Background

OpenSSH is a complete SSH protocol version 1.3, 1.5 and 2.0
implementation and includes sftp client and server support.

### Description

Tavis Ormandy of the Google Security Team has discovered a
pre-authentication vulnerability, causing sshd to spin until the login
grace time has been expired. Mark Dowd found an unsafe signal handler
that was vulnerable to a race condition. It has also been discovered
that when GSSAPI authentication is enabled, GSSAPI will in certain
cases incorrectly abort.

### Impact

The pre-authentication and signal handler vulnerabilities can cause a
Denial of Service in OpenSSH. The vulnerability in the GSSAPI
authentication abort could be used to determine the validity of
usernames on some platforms.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All OpenSSH users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/openssh-4.4_p1-r5"
```

The OpenSSH 4.4 release announcement says that, actually:

 * Fix an unsafe signal hander reported by Mark Dowd. The signal
   handler was vulnerable to a race condition that could be exploited
   to perform a pre-authentication denial of service. On portable
   OpenSSH, this vulnerability could theoretically lead to
            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   pre-authentication remote code execution if GSSAPI authentication
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   is enabled, but the likelihood of successful exploitation appears

OpenSSH 4.4 was released on 2006-09-27. It is available from the
mirrors listed at https://www.openssh.com/.
OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol version 1.3, 1.5 and 2.0
implementation and includes sftp client and server support.
Once again, we would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their
continued support of the project, especially those who contributed
code or patches, reported bugs, tested snapshots and purchased
T-shirts or posters.
T-shirt, poster and CD sales directly support the project. Pictures

Changes since OpenSSH 4.3:
============================
Security bugs resolved in this release:
\* Fix a pre-authentication denial of service found by Tavis Ormandy,
that would cause sshd(8) to spin until the login grace time
expired.
\* Fix an unsafe signal hander reported by Mark Dowd. The signal
handler was vulnerable to a race condition that could be exploited
to perform a pre-authentication denial of service. On portable
OpenSSH, this vulnerability could theoretically lead to
pre-authentication remote code execution if GSSAPI authentication
is enabled, but the likelihood of successful exploitation appears
remote.
\* On portable OpenSSH, fix a GSSAPI authentication abort that could
be used to determine the validity of usernames on some platforms.
This release includes the following new functionality and fixes:
\* Implemented conditional configuration in sshd\_config(5) using the
"Match" directive. This allows some configuration options to be
selectively overridden if specific criteria (based on user, group,
hostname and/or address) are met. So far a useful subset of post-
authentication options are supported and more are expected to be
added in future releases.
\* Add support for Diffie-Hellman group exchange key agreement with a
final hash of SHA256.
\* Added a "ForceCommand" directive to sshd\_config(5). Similar to the
command="..." option accepted in ~/.ssh/authorized\_keys, this forces
the execution of the specified command regardless of what the user
requested. This is very useful in conjunction with the new "Match"
option.
\* Add a "PermitOpen" directive to sshd\_config(5). This mirrors the
permitopen="..." authorized\_keys option, allowing fine-grained
control over the port-forwardings that a user is allowed to
establish.
\* Add optional logging of transactions to sftp-server(8).
\* ssh(1) will now record port numbers for hosts stored in
~/.ssh/authorized\_keys when a non-standard port has been requested.
\* Add an "ExitOnForwardFailure" option to cause ssh(1) to exit (with
a non-zero exit code) when requested port forwardings could not be
established.
\* Extend sshd\_config(5) "SubSystem" declarations to allow the
specification of command-line arguments.
\* Replacement of all integer overflow susceptible invocations of
malloc(3) and realloc(3) with overflow-checking equivalents.
\* Many manpage fixes and improvements
\* New portable OpenSSH-specific features:
- Add optional support for SELinux, controlled using the
--with-selinux configure option (experimental)
- Add optional support for Solaris process contracts, enabled
using the --with-solaris-contracts configure option (experimental)
This option will also include SMF metadata in Solaris packages
built using the "make package" target
- Add optional support for OpenSSL hardware accelerators (engines),
enabled using the --with-ssl-engine configure option.
\* Bugs from http://bugzilla.mindrot.org fixed:
#482 - readconf doesn't accept paths with spaces in them.
#906 - syslog messages from sshd [net] lost.
#975 - Kerberos authentication timing can leak information
about account validity.
#981 - Flow stop in SSH2.
#1102 - C program 'write' with zero length hangs.
#1129 - sshd hangs for command-only invocations due to
fork/child signals.
#1131 - error "buffer\_append\_space:alloc not supported"
#1138 - Passphrase asked for (but ignored) if key file permissions
too liberal..
#1156 - Closes connection after C-c is pressed on QNX.
#1157 - ssh-keygen doesn't handle DOS line breaks.
#1159 - %u and %h not handled in IdentityFile.
#1161 - scp -r fails.
#1162 - Inappropriate sequence of syslog messages.
#1166 - openssh-4.3p1 has some issues compiling.
#1171 - configure can't always figure out LLONG\_MAX..
#1173 - scp reports lost connection for very large files.
#1177 - Incorrect sshrc file location in Makefile.in.
#1179 - sshd incorrectly rejects connections due to IP options.
#1181 - configure should detect when openssl-0.9.8x needs -ldl.
#1186 - ssh tries multiple times to open unprotected keys.
#1188 - keyboard-interactive should not allow retry after
pam\_acct\_mgmt fails.
#1193 - Open ssh will not allow changing of passwords on usernames
greater than 8 characters..
#1201 - Bind address information is not specified in command line
help messages.
#1203 - configure.ac is missing an open [.
#1207 - sshd does not clear unsuccessful login count on
non-interactive logins.
#1218 - GSSAPI client code permits SPNEGO usage.
#1221 - Banner only suppressed at log level = QUIET (used to be
at log level < INFO).
\* Fixes to memory and file descriptor leaks reported by the Coverity
static analysis tool
\* Fixes to inconsistent pointer checks reported by the Stanford
SATURN tool
Thanks to everyone who has contributed patches, reported bugs and
tested releases.

Summary
========================================================================

    All it takes is a leap of faith
        -- The Interrupters, "Leap of Faith"

Preliminary note: OpenSSH is one of the most secure software in the
world; this vulnerability is one slip-up in an otherwise near-flawless
implementation. Its defense-in-depth design and code are a model and an
inspiration, and we thank OpenSSH's developers for their exemplary work.

We discovered a vulnerability (a signal handler race condition) in
OpenSSH's server (sshd): if a client does not authenticate within
LoginGraceTime seconds (120 by default, 600 in old OpenSSH versions),
then sshd's SIGALRM handler is called asynchronously, but this signal
handler calls various functions that are not async-signal-safe (for
example, syslog()). This race condition affects sshd in its default
configuration.

On investigation, we realized that this vulnerability is in fact a
regression of CVE-2006-5051 ("Signal handler race condition in OpenSSH
before 4.4 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash),
and possibly execute arbitrary code"), which was reported in 2006 by
Mark Dowd.

This regression was introduced in October 2020 (OpenSSH 8.5p1) by commit
752250c ("revised log infrastructure for OpenSSH"), which accidentally
removed an "#ifdef DO_LOG_SAFE_IN_SIGHAND" from sigdie(), a function
that is directly called by sshd's SIGALRM handler. In other words:

- OpenSSH < 4.4p1 is vulnerable to this signal handler race condition,
  if not backport-patched against CVE-2006-5051, or not patched against
  CVE-2008-4109, which was an incorrect fix for CVE-2006-5051;

- 4.4p1 <= OpenSSH < 8.5p1 is not vulnerable to this signal handler race
  condition (because the "#ifdef DO_LOG_SAFE_IN_SIGHAND" that was added
  to sigdie() by the patch for CVE-2006-5051 transformed this unsafe
  function into a safe _exit(1) call);

- 8.5p1 <= OpenSSH < 9.8p1 is vulnerable again to this signal handler
  race condition (because the "#ifdef DO_LOG_SAFE_IN_SIGHAND" was
  accidentally removed from sigdie()).

This vulnerability is exploitable remotely on glibc-based Linux systems,
where syslog() itself calls async-signal-unsafe functions (for example,
malloc() and free()): an unauthenticated remote code execution as root,
because it affects sshd's privileged code, which is not sandboxed and
runs with full privileges. We have not investigated any other libc or
operating system; but OpenBSD is notably not vulnerable, because its
SIGALRM handler calls syslog_r(), an async-signal-safer version of
syslog() that was invented by OpenBSD in 2001.

To exploit this vulnerability remotely (to the best of our knowledge,
CVE-2006-5051 has never been successfully exploited before), we drew
inspiration from a visionary paper, "Delivering Signals for Fun and
Profit", which was published in 2001 by Michal Zalewski:

  <https://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/signals.txt>

Nevertheless, we immediately faced three major problems:

- From a theoretical point of view, we must find a useful code path
  that, if interrupted at the right time by SIGALRM, leaves sshd in an
  inconsistent state, and we must then exploit this inconsistent state
  inside the SIGALRM handler.

- From a practical point of view, we must find a way to reach this
  useful code path in sshd, and maximize our chances of interrupting it
  at the right time.

- From a timing point of view, we must find a way to further increase
  our chances of interrupting this useful code path at the right time,
  remotely.

To focus on these three problems without having to immediately fight
against all the modern operating system protections (in particular, ASLR
and NX), we decided to exploit old OpenSSH versions first, on i386, and
then, based on this experience, recent versions:

- First, "SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_3.4p1 Debian 1:3.4p1-1.woody.3", from
  "debian-30r6-dvd-i386-binary-1_NONUS.iso": this is the first Debian
  version that has privilege separation enabled by default and that is
  patched against all the critical vulnerabilities of that era (in
  particular, CVE-2003-0693 and CVE-2002-0640).

  To remotely exploit this version, we interrupt a call to free() with
  SIGALRM (inside sshd's public-key parsing code), leave the heap in an
  inconsistent state, and exploit this inconsistent state during another
  call to free(), inside the SIGALRM handler.

  In our experiments, it takes ~10,000 tries on average to win this race
  condition; i.e., with 10 connections (MaxStartups) accepted per 600
  seconds (LoginGraceTime), it takes ~1 week on average to obtain a
  remote root shell.

- Second, "SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_4.2p1 Debian-7ubuntu3", from
  "ubuntu-6.06.1-server-i386.iso": this is the last Ubuntu version that
  is still vulnerable to CVE-2006-5051 ("Signal handler race condition
  in OpenSSH before 4.4").

  To remotely exploit this version, we interrupt a call to pam_start()
  with SIGALRM, leave one of PAM's structures in an inconsistent state,
  and exploit this inconsistent state during a call to pam_end(), inside
  the SIGALRM handler.

  In our experiments, it takes ~10,000 tries on average to win this race
  condition; i.e., with 10 connections (MaxStartups) accepted per 120
  seconds (LoginGraceTime), it takes ~1-2 days on average to obtain a
  remote root shell.

- Finally, "SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_9.2p1 Debian-2+deb12u2", from
  "debian-12.5.0-i386-DVD-1.iso": this is the current Debian stable
  version, and it is vulnerable to the regression of CVE-2006-5051.

  To remotely exploit this version, we interrupt a call to malloc() with
  SIGALRM (inside sshd's public-key parsing code), leave the heap in an
  inconsistent state, and exploit this inconsistent state during another
  call to malloc(), inside the SIGALRM handler (more precisely, inside
  syslog()).

  In our experiments, it takes ~10,000 tries on average to win this race
  condition, so ~3-4 hours with 100 connections (MaxStartups) accepted
  per 120 seconds (LoginGraceTime). Ultimately, it takes ~6-8 hours on
  average to obtain a remote root shell, because we can only guess the
  glibc's address correctly half of the time (because of ASLR).

This research is still a work in progress:

- we have targeted virtual machines only, not bare-metal servers, on a
  mostly stable network link (~10ms packet jitter);

- we are convinced that various aspects of our exploits can be greatly
  improved;

- we have started to work on an amd64 exploit, which is much harder
  because of the stronger ASLR.

A few days after we started our work on amd64, we noticed the following
bug report (in OpenSSH's public Bugzilla), about a deadlock in sshd's
SIGALRM handler:

  <https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3690>

We therefore decided to contact OpenSSH's developers immediately (to let
them know that this deadlock is caused by an exploitable vulnerability),
we put our amd64 work on hold, and we started to write this advisory.

Theory
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    But that's not like me, I'm breaking free
        -- The Interrupters, "Haven't Seen the Last of Me"

The SIGALRM handler of this OpenSSH version calls packet_close(), which
calls buffer_free(), which calls xfree() and hence free(), which is not
async-signal-safe:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 302 grace_alarm_handler(int sig)
 303 {
 ...
 307         packet_close();
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 329 packet_close(void)
 330 {
 ...
 341         buffer_free(&input);
 342         buffer_free(&output);
 343         buffer_free(&outgoing_packet);
 344         buffer_free(&incoming_packet);
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 35 buffer_free(Buffer *buffer)
 36 {
 37         memset(buffer->buf, 0, buffer->alloc);
 38         xfree(buffer->buf);
 39 }
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 51 xfree(void *ptr)
 52 {
 53         if (ptr == NULL)
 54                 fatal("xfree: NULL pointer given as argument");
 55         free(ptr);
 56 }
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Consequently, we started to read the malloc code of this Debian's glibc
(2.2.5), to see if a first call to free() can be interrupted by SIGALRM
and exploited during a second call to free() inside the SIGALRM handler
(at lines 341-344, above). Because this glibc's malloc is not hardened
against the unlink() technique pioneered by Solar Designer in 2000, we
quickly spotted an interesting code path in chunk_free() (which is
called internally by free()):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
1028 struct malloc_chunk
1029 {
1030   INTERNAL_SIZE_T prev_size; /* Size of previous chunk (if free). */
1031   INTERNAL_SIZE_T size;      /* Size in bytes, including overhead. */
1032   struct malloc_chunk* fd;   /* double links -- used only if free. */
1033   struct malloc_chunk* bk;
1034 };
------------------------------------------------------------------------
2516 #define unlink(P, BK, FD)                                           \
2517 {                                                                   \
2518   BK = P->bk;                                                       \
2519   FD = P->fd;                                                       \
2520   FD->bk = BK;                                                      \
2521   BK->fd = FD;                                                      \
2522 }                                                                   \
------------------------------------------------------------------------
3160 chunk_free(arena *ar_ptr, mchunkptr p)
....
3164 {
3165   INTERNAL_SIZE_T hd = p->size; /* its head field */
....
3177   sz = hd & ~PREV_INUSE;
3178   next = chunk_at_offset(p, sz);
3179   nextsz = chunksize(next);
....
3230   if (!(inuse_bit_at_offset(next, nextsz)))   /* consolidate forward */
3231   {
....
3241       unlink(next, bck, fwd);
....
3244   }
3245   else
3246     set_head(next, nextsz);                  /* clear inuse bit */
....
3251     frontlink(ar_ptr, p, sz, idx, bck, fwd);
------------------------------------------------------------------------

To exploit this code path, we arrange for sshd's heap to have the
following layout (chunk_X, chunk_Y, and chunk_Z are malloc()ated chunks
of memory, and p, s, f, b are their prev_size, size, fd, and bk fields):

-----|---+---------------|---+---------------|---+---------------|-----
 ... |p|s|f|b|  chunk_X  |p|s|f|b|  chunk_Y  |p|s|f|b|  chunk_Z  | ...
-----|---+---------------|---+---------------|---+---------------|-----
                             |<------------->|
                                 user data

- First, if a call to free(chunk_Y) is interrupted by SIGALRM *after*
  line 3246 but *before* line 3251, then chunk_Y is already marked as
  free (because chunk_Z's PREV_INUSE bit is cleared at line 3246) but it
  is not yet linked into its doubly-linked list (at line 3251): in other
  words, chunk_Y's fd and bk pointers still contain user data (attacker-
  controlled data).

- Second, if (inside the SIGALRM handler) packet_close() calls
  free(chunk_X), then the code block at lines 3230-3244 is entered
  (because chunk_Y is marked as free) and chunk_Y is unlink()ed (at line
  3241): a so-called aa4bmo primitive (almost arbitrary 4 bytes mirrored
  overwrite), because chunk_Y's fd and bk pointers are still attacker-
  controlled. For more information on the unlink() technique and the
  aa4bmo primitive:

  <https://www.openwall.com/articles/JPEG-COM-Marker-Vulnerability#exploit>
  <http://phrack.org/issues/61/6.html#article>

- Last, with this aa4bmo primitive we overwrite the glibc's __free_hook
  function pointer (this old Debian version does not have ASLR, nor NX)
  with the address of our shellcode in the heap, thus achieving remote
  code execution during the next call to free() in packet_close().

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Practice
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Now they're taking over and they got complete control
        -- The Interrupters, "Liberty"

To mount this attack against sshd, we interrupt a call to free() inside
sshd's parsing code of a DSA public key (i.e., line 144 below is our
free(chunk_Y)) and exploit it during one of the free() calls in
packet_close() (i.e., one of the lines 341-344 above is our
free(chunk_X)):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
136 buffer_get_bignum2(Buffer *buffer, BIGNUM *value)
137 {
138         u_int len;
139         u_char *bin = buffer_get_string(buffer, &len);
...
143         BN_bin2bn(bin, len, value);
144         xfree(bin);
145 }
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Initially, however, we were never able to win this race condition (i.e.,
interrupt the free() call at line 144 at the right time). Eventually, we
realized that we could greatly improve our chances of winning this race:
the DSA public-key parsing code allows us to call free() four times (at
lines 704-707 below), and furthermore sshd allows us to attempt six user
authentications (AUTH_FAIL_MAX); if any one of these 24 free() calls is
interrupted at the right time, then we later achieve remote code
execution inside the SIGALRM handler.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
678 key_from_blob(u_char *blob, int blen)
679 {
...
693         switch (type) {
...
702         case KEY_DSA:
703                 key = key_new(type);
704                 buffer_get_bignum2(&b, key->dsa->p);
705                 buffer_get_bignum2(&b, key->dsa->q);
706                 buffer_get_bignum2(&b, key->dsa->g);
707                 buffer_get_bignum2(&b, key->dsa->pub_key);
------------------------------------------------------------------------

With this improvement, we finally won the race condition after ~1 month:
we were happy (and did a root-shell dance), but we also felt that there
was still room for improvement.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timing
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Don't worry, just wait and see
        -- The Interrupters, "Haven't Seen the Last of Me"

We therefore implemented the following threefold timing strategy:

- We do not wait until the last moment to send our (rather large) DSA
  public-key packet to sshd: instead, we send the entire packet minus
  one byte (the last byte) long before the LoginGraceTime, and send the
  very last byte at the very last moment, to minimize the effects of
  network delays. (And we disable the Nagle algorithm.)

- We keep track of the median round-trip time (by regularly sending
  packets that produce a response from sshd), and keep track of the
  difference between the moment we are expecting our connection to be
  closed by sshd (essentially the moment we receive the first byte of
  sshd's banner, plus LoginGraceTime) and the moment our connection is
  really closed by sshd, and accordingly adjust our timing (i.e., the
  moment when we send the last byte of our DSA packet).

  These time differences allow us to track clock skews and network
  delays, which show predictable patterns over time: we experimented
  with linear and spline regressions, but in the end, nothing worked
  better than simply re-using the most recent measurement. Possibly,
  deep learning might yield even better results; this is left as an
  exercise for the interested reader.

- More importantly, we further increase our chances of winning this race
  condition by slowly adjusting our timing through involuntary feedback
  from sshd:

  - if we receive a response (SSH2_MSG_USERAUTH_FAILURE) to our DSA
    public-key packet, then we sent it too early (sshd had the time to
    receive our packet in the unprivileged child, parse it, send it to
    the privileged child, parse it there, and send a response all the
    way back to us);

  - if we cannot even send the last byte of our DSA packet, then we
    waited too long (sshd already received the SIGALRM and closed our
    connection);

  - if we can send the last byte of our DSA packet, and receive no
    response before sshd closes our connection, then our timing was
    reasonably accurate.

  This feedback allows us to target what we call the "large" race
  window: hitting it does not guarantee that we win the race condition,
  but inside this large window are the 24 "small" race windows (inside
  the 24 free() calls) that, if hit, guarantee that we do win the race
  condition.

With these improvements, it takes ~10,000 tries on average to win this
race condition; i.e., with 10 connections (MaxStartups) accepted per 600
seconds (LoginGraceTime), it takes ~1 week on average to obtain a remote
root shell.

Theory, take one
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I sleep when the sun starts to rise
        -- The Interrupters, "Alien"

The SIGALRM handler of this OpenSSH version does not call packet_close()
anymore; moreover, this Ubuntu's glibc (2.3.6) always takes a mandatory
lock when entering the functions of the malloc family (even if single-
threaded like sshd), which prevents us from interrupting a call to one
of the malloc functions and later exploiting it during another call to
these functions (they would always deadlock). We must find another
solution.

CVE-2006-5051 mentions a double-free in GSSAPI, but GSSAPI (or Kerberos)
is not enabled by default, so this does not sound very appealing. On the
other hand, PAM is enabled by default, and pam_end() is called by sshd's
SIGALRM handler (and is, of course, not async-signal-safe). We therefore
searched for a PAM function that, if interrupted by SIGALRM at the right
time, would leave PAM's internal structures in an inconsistent state,
exploitable during pam_end() in the SIGALRM handler. We found
pam_set_data():

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 33 int pam_set_data(
 34     pam_handle_t *pamh,
 ..
 37     void (*cleanup)(pam_handle_t *pamh, void *data, int error_status))
 38 {
 39     struct pam_data *data_entry;
 ..
 57     } else if ((data_entry = malloc(sizeof(*data_entry)))) {
 ..
 65         data_entry->next = pamh->data;
 66         pamh->data = data_entry;
 ..
 74     data_entry->cleanup = cleanup;
------------------------------------------------------------------------

If this function is interrupted by SIGALRM *after* line 66 but *before*
line 74, then data_entry is already linked into PAM's structures (pamh),
but its cleanup field (a function pointer) is not yet initialized (since
the malloc() at line 57 does not initialize its memory). If we are able
to control cleanup (through leftovers from previous heap allocations),
then we can execute arbitrary code when pam_end() (inside the SIGALRM
handler) calls _pam_free_data() (at line 118):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
104 void _pam_free_data(pam_handle_t *pamh, int status)
105 {
106     struct pam_data *last;
107     struct pam_data *data;
...
112     data = pamh->data;
113
114     while (data) {
115         last = data;
116         data = data->next;
117         if (last->cleanup) {
118             last->cleanup(pamh, last->data, status);
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This would have been an extremely simple exploit; unfortunately, we
completely overlooked that pam_set_data() can only be called from PAM
modules: if we interrupt it with SIGALRM, then pamh->caller_is is still
_PAM_CALLED_FROM_MODULE, in which case pam_end() returns immediately,
without ever calling _pam_free_data(). Back to the drawing board.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Theory, take two
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Not giving up, it's not what we do
        -- The Interrupters, "Title Holder"

We noticed that, at line 601 below, sshd passes a pointer to its global
sshpam_handle pointer directly to pam_start() (which is called once per
connection):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 202 static pam_handle_t *sshpam_handle = NULL;
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 584 sshpam_init(Authctxt *authctxt)
 585 {
 ...
 600         sshpam_err =
 601             pam_start(SSHD_PAM_SERVICE, user, &store_conv, &sshpam_handle);
------------------------------------------------------------------------

We therefore decided to look into pam_start() itself: if interrupted by
SIGALRM, it might leave the structure pointed to by sshpam_handle in an
inconsistent state, which could then be exploited inside the SIGALRM
handler, when "pam_end(sshpam_handle, sshpam_err)" is called.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 18 int pam_start (
 ..
 22     pam_handle_t **pamh)
 23 {
 ..
 32     if ((*pamh = calloc(1, sizeof(**pamh))) == NULL) {
...
110     if ( _pam_init_handlers(*pamh) != PAM_SUCCESS ) {
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 319 int _pam_init_handlers(pam_handle_t *pamh)
 320 {
 ...
 398                 retval = _pam_parse_conf_file(pamh, f, pamh->service_name, PAM_T_ANY
------------------------------------------------------------------------
  66 static int _pam_parse_conf_file(pam_handle_t *pamh, FILE *f
  ..
  73 {
 ...
 252             res = _pam_add_handler(pamh, must_fail, other
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 581 int _pam_add_handler(pam_handle_t *pamh
 ...
 585 {
 ...
 755     the_handlers = (other) ? &pamh->handlers.other : &pamh->handlers.conf;
 ...
 767         handler_p = &the_handlers->authenticate;
 ...
 874     if ((*handler_p = malloc(sizeof(struct handler))) == NULL) {
 ...
 886     (*handler_p)->next = NULL;
------------------------------------------------------------------------

At line 32, pam_start() immediately sets sshd's sshpam_handle to a
calloc()ated chunk of memory; this is safe, because calloc() initializes
this memory to zero. On the other hand, if _pam_add_handler() (which is
called multiple times by pam_start()) is interrupted by SIGALRM *after*
line 874 but *before* line 886, then a malloc()ated structure is linked
into pamh, but its next field is not yet initialized. If we are able to
control next (through leftovers from previous heap allocations), then we
can pass an arbitrary pointer to free() during the call to pam_end()
(inside the SIGALRM handler), at line 1020 (and line 1017) below:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 11 int pam_end(pam_handle_t *pamh, int pam_status)
 12 {
 ..
 31     if ((ret = _pam_free_handlers(pamh)) != PAM_SUCCESS) {
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 925 int _pam_free_handlers(pam_handle_t *pamh)
 926 {
 ...
 954     _pam_free_handlers_aux(&(pamh->handlers.conf.authenticate));
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1009 void _pam_free_handlers_aux(struct handler **hp)
1010 {
1011     struct handler *h = *hp;
1012     struct handler *last;
....
1015     while (h) {
1016         last = h;
1017         _pam_drop(h->argv);  /* This is all alocated in a single chunk */
1018         h = h->next;
1019         memset(last, 0, sizeof(*last));
1020         free(last);
1021     }
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Because the malloc of this Ubuntu's glibc is already hardened against
the old unlink() technique, we decided to transform our arbitrary free()
into the Malloc Maleficarum's House of Mind (fastbin version): we free()
our own NON_MAIN_ARENA chunk, point our fake arena to sshd's .got.plt
(this Ubuntu's sshd has ASLR but not PIE), and overwrite _exit()'s entry
with the address of our shellcode in the heap (this Ubuntu's heap is
still executable by default). For more information on the Malloc
Maleficarum:

  <https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2005/Oct/118>

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Practice
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I learned everything the hard way
        -- The Interrupters, "The Hard Way"

To mount this attack against sshd, we initially faced three problems:

- The House of Mind requires us to store the pointer to our fake arena
  at address 0x08100000 in the heap; but are we able to store attacker-
  controlled data at such a high address? Because sshd calls pam_start()
  at the very beginning of the user authentication, we do not control
  anything except the user name itself; luckily, a user name of length
  ~128KB (shorter than DEFAULT_MMAP_THRESHOLD) allows us to store our
  own data at address 0x08100000.

- The size field of our fake NON_MAIN_ARENA chunk must not be too large
  (to pass free()'s security checks); i.e., it must contain null bytes.
  But our long user name is a null-terminated string that cannot contain
  null bytes; luckily we remembered that _pam_free_handlers_aux() zeroes
  the structures that it free()s (line 1019 above): we therefore "patch"
  the size field of our fake chunk with such a memset(0), and only then
  free() it.

- We must survive several calls to free() (at lines 1017 and 1020 above)
  before the free() of our fake NON_MAIN_ARENA chunk. We transform these
  free()s into no-ops by pointing them to fake IS_MMAPPED chunks: free()
  calls munmap_chunk(), which calls munmap(), which fails because these
  fake IS_MMAPPED chunks are misaligned; effectively a no-op, because
  assert()ion failures are not enforced in this Ubuntu's glibc.

Finally, our long user name also allows us to control the potentially
uninitialized next field of 20 different structures (through leftovers
from temporary copies of our long user name), because pam_start() calls
_pam_add_handler() multiple times; i.e., our large race window contains
20 small race windows.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timing
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Same tricks they used before
        -- The Interrupters, "Divide Us"

For this attack against Ubuntu 6.06.1, we simply re-used the timing
strategy that we used against Debian 3.0r6: it takes ~10,000 tries on
average to win the race condition, and with 10 connections (MaxStartups)
accepted per 120 seconds (LoginGraceTime), it takes ~1-2 days on average
to obtain a remote root shell.

Note: because this Ubuntu's glibc always takes a mandatory lock when
entering the functions of the malloc family, an unlucky attacker might
deadlock all 10 MaxStartups connections before obtaining a root shell;
we have not tried to work around this problem because our ultimate goal
was to exploit a modern OpenSSH version anyway.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Theory
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Now you're ready, take the demons head on
        -- The Interrupters, "Be Gone"

The SIGALRM handler of this OpenSSH version does not call packet_close()
nor pam_end(); in fact it calls only one interesting function, syslog():

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 358 grace_alarm_handler(int sig)
 359 {
 ...
 370         sigdie("Timeout before authentication for %s port %d",
 371             ssh_remote_ipaddr(the_active_state),
 372             ssh_remote_port(the_active_state));
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 96 #define sigdie(...)             sshsigdie(__FILE__, __func__, __LINE__, 0, SYSLOG_LEVEL_ERROR, NULL, __VA_ARGS__)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
451 sshsigdie(const char *file, const char *func, int line, int showfunc,
452     LogLevel level, const char *suffix, const char *fmt, ...)
453 {
...
457         sshlogv(file, func, line, showfunc, SYSLOG_LEVEL_FATAL,
458             suffix, fmt, args);
------------------------------------------------------------------------
464 sshlogv(const char *file, const char *func, int line, int showfunc,
465     LogLevel level, const char *suffix, const char *fmt, va_list args)
466 {
...
489         do_log(level, forced, suffix, fmt2, args);
------------------------------------------------------------------------
337 do_log(LogLevel level, int force, const char *suffix, const char *fmt,
338     va_list args)
339 {
...
419                 syslog(pri, "%.500s", fmtbuf);
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our two key questions, then, are: Does the syslog() of this Debian's
glibc (2.36) call async-signal-unsafe functions such as malloc() and
free()? And if yes, does this glibc still take a mandatory lock when
entering the functions of the malloc family?

- Luckily for us attackers, the answer to our first question is yes; if,
  and only if, the syslog() inside the SIGALRM handler is the very first
  call to syslog(), then __localtime64_r() (which is called by syslog())
  calls malloc(304) to allocate a FILE structure (at line 166) and calls
  malloc(4096) to allocate an internal read buffer (at line 186):

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Note: because we do not control anything about these malloc()ations
  (not their order, not their sizes, not their contents), we took the
  "rce" at line 166 as a much-needed good omen.

- And luckily for us, the answer to our second question is no; since
  October 2017, the glibc's malloc functions do not take any lock
  anymore, when single-threaded (like sshd):

  <https://sourceware.org/git?p=glibc.git;a=commit;h=a15d53e2de4c7d83bda251469d92a3c7b49a90db>

  <https://sourceware.org/git?p=glibc.git;a=commit;h=905a7725e9157ea522d8ab97b4c8b96aeb23df54>

Moreover, this Debian version suffers from the ASLR weakness described
in the following great blog posts (by Justin Miller and Mathias Krause,
respectively):

  <https://zolutal.github.io/aslrnt/>
  <https://grsecurity.net/toolchain_necromancy_past_mistakes_haunting_aslr>

Concretely, in the case of sshd on i386, every memory mapping is
randomized normally (sshd's PIE, the heap, most libraries, the stack),
but the glibc itself is always mapped either at address 0xb7200000 or at
address 0xb7400000; in other words, we can correctly guess the glibc's
address half of the time (a small price to pay for defeating ASLR). In
our exploit we assume that the glibc is mapped at address 0xb7400000,
because it is slightly more common than 0xb7200000.

Our next question is: which code paths inside the glibc's malloc
functions, if interrupted by SIGALRM at the right time, leave the heap
in an inconsistent state, exploitable during one of the malloc() calls
inside the SIGALRM handler?

We found several interesting (and surprising!) code paths, but the one
we chose involves only relative sizes, not absolute addresses (unlike
various code paths inside unlink_chunk(), for example); this difference
might prove crucial for a future amd64 exploit. This code path, inside
malloc(), splits a large free chunk (victim) into two smaller chunks;
the first chunk is returned to malloc()'s caller (at line 4345) and the
second chunk (remainder) is linked into an unsorted list of free chunks
(at lines 4324-4327):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
1449 #define set_head(p, s)       ((p)->mchunk_size = (s))
------------------------------------------------------------------------
3765 _int_malloc (mstate av, size_t bytes)
3766 {
....
3798   nb = checked_request2size (bytes);
....
4295               size = chunksize (victim);
....
4300               remainder_size = size - nb;
....
4316                   remainder = chunk_at_offset (victim, nb);
....
4320                   bck = unsorted_chunks (av);
4321                   fwd = bck->fd;
....
4324                   remainder->bk = bck;
4325                   remainder->fd = fwd;
4326                   bck->fd = remainder;
4327                   fwd->bk = remainder;
....
4337                   set_head (victim, nb | PREV_INUSE |
4338                             (av != &main_arena ? NON_MAIN_ARENA : 0));
4339                   set_head (remainder, remainder_size | PREV_INUSE);
....
4343               void *p = chunk2mem (victim);
....
4345               return p;
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- If this code path is interrupted by SIGALRM *after* line 4327 but
  *before* line 4339, then the remainder chunk of this split is already
  linked into the unsorted list of free chunks (lines 4324-4327), but
  its size field (mchunk_size) is not yet initialized (line 4339).

- If we are able to control its size field (through leftovers from
  previous heap allocations), then we can make this remainder chunk
  larger and overlap with other heap chunks, and therefore corrupt heap
  memory when this enlarged, overlapping remainder chunk is eventually
  malloc()ated and written to (inside the SIGALRM handler).

Our last question, then, is: given that we do not control anything about
the malloc() calls inside the SIGALRM handler, what can we overwrite in
the heap to achieve arbitrary code execution before sshd calls _exit()
(in sshsigdie())?

Because __tzfile_read() (inside the SIGALRM handler) malloc()ates a FILE
structure in the heap (at line 166 above), and because FILE structures
have a long history of abuse for arbitrary code execution, we decided to
aim our heap corruption at this FILE structure. This is, however, easier
said than done: our heap corruption is very limited, and FILE structures
have been significantly hardened over the years (by IO_validate_vtable()
and PTR_DEMANGLE(), for example).

Eventually, we devised the following technique (which seems to be
specific to the i386 glibc -- the amd64 glibc does not seem to use
_vtable_offset at all):

- with our limited heap corruption, we overwrite the _vtable_offset
  field (a single signed char) of __tzfile_read()'s FILE structure;

- the glibc's libio functions will therefore look for this FILE
  structure's vtable pointer (a pointer to an array of function
  pointers) at a non-zero offset (our overwritten _vtable_offset),
  instead of the default zero offset;

- we (attackers) can easily control this fake vtable pointer (through
  leftovers from previous heap allocations), because the FILE structure
  around this offset is not explicitly initialized by fopen();

- to pass the glibc's security checks, our fake vtable pointer must
  point somewhere into the __libc_IO_vtables section: we decided to
  point it to the vtable for wide-character streams, _IO_wfile_jumps
  (i.e., to 0xb761b740, since we assume that the glibc is mapped at
  address 0xb7400000);

- as a result, __fread_unlocked() (at line 186 above) calls
  _IO_wfile_underflow() (instead of _IO_file_underflow()), which calls a
  function pointer (__fct) that basically comes from a structure whose
  pointer (_codecvt) is yet another field of the FILE structure;

- we (attackers) can easily control this _codecvt pointer (through
  leftovers from previous heap allocations, because this field of the
  FILE structure is not explicitly initialized by fopen()), which also
  allows us to control the __fct function pointer.

In summary, by overwriting a single byte (_vtable_offset) of the FILE
structure malloc()ated by fopen(), we can call our own __fct function
pointer and execute arbitrary code during __fread_unlocked().

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Practice
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I wanted it perfect, no wrinkles in it
        -- The Interrupters, "In the Mirror"

To mount this attack against sshd's privileged child, let us first
imagine the following heap layout (the "XXX"s are "barrier" chunks that
allow us to make holes in the heap; for example, small memory-leaked
chunks):

---|----------------------------------------------|---|------------|---
XXX|                  large hole                  |XXX| small hole |XXX
---|----------------------------------------------|---|------------|---
   |                     ~8KB                     |   |    320B    |

- shortly before sshd receives the SIGALRM, we malloc()ate a ~4KB chunk
  that splits the large ~8KB hole into two smaller chunks:

---|-----------------------|----------------------|---|------------|---
XXX| large allocated chunk | free remainder chunk |XXX| small hole |XXX
---|-----------------------|----------------------|---|------------|---
   |         ~4KB          |         ~4KB         |   |    320B    |

- but if this malloc() is interrupted by SIGALRM *after* line 4327 but
  *before* line 4339, then the remainder chunk of this split is already
  linked into the unsorted list of free chunks, but its size field is
  under our control (through leftovers from previous heap allocations),
  and this artificially enlarged remainder chunk overlaps with the
  following small hole:

---|-----------------------|----------------------|---|------------|---
XXX| large allocated chunk | real remainder chunk |XXX| small hole |XXX
---|-----------------------|----------------------|---|------------|---
   |         ~4KB          |<------------------------------------->|
                             artificially enlarged remainder chunk

- when the SIGALRM handler calls syslog() and hence __tzfile_read(),
  fopen() malloc()ates the small hole for its FILE structure, and
  __fread_unlocked() malloc()ates a 4KB read buffer, thereby splitting
  the enlarged remainder chunk in two (the 4KB read buffer and a small
  remainder chunk):

---|-----------------------|----------------------|---|------------|---
XXX| large allocated chunk |                      |XXX|    FILE    |XXX
---|-----------------------|----------------------|---|--|---------|---
   |         ~4KB          |<--------------------------->|<------->|
                                   4KB read buffer        remainder

- we therefore overwrite parts of the FILE structure with the internal
  header of this small remainder chunk: more precisely, we overwrite the
  FILE's _vtable_offset with the third byte of this header's bk field,
  which is a pointer to the unsorted list of free chunks, 0xb761d7f8
  (i.e., we overwrite _vtable_offset with 0x61);

- then, as explained in the "Theory" subsection, __fread_unlocked()
  calls _IO_wfile_underflow() (instead of _IO_file_underflow()), which
  calls our own __fct function pointer (through our own _codecvt
  pointer) and executes our arbitrary code.

  Note: we have not yet explained how to reliably go from a controlled
  _codecvt pointer to a controlled __fct function pointer; we will do
  so, but we must first solve a more pressing problem.

Indeed, we learned from our work on older OpenSSH versions that we will
never win this signal handler race condition if our large race window
contains only one small race window. Consequently, we implemented the
following strategy, based on the following heap layout:

---|------------|---|------------|---|------------|---|------------|---
XXX|large hole 1|XXX|small hole 1|XXX|large hole 2|XXX|small hole 2|...
---|------------|---|------------|---|------------|---|------------|---
   |    ~8KB    |   |    320B    |   |    ~8KB    |   |    320B    |

The last packet that we send to sshd (shortly before the delivery of
SIGALRM) forces sshd to perform the following sequence of malloc()
calls: malloc(~4KB), malloc(304), malloc(~4KB), malloc(304), etc.

1/ Our first malloc(~4KB) splits the large hole 1 in two:

- if this first split is interrupted by SIGALRM at the right time, then
  the fopen() inside the SIGALRM handler malloc()ates the small hole 1
  for its FILE structure, and we achieve arbitrary code execution as
  explained above;

- if not, then we malloc()ate the small hole 1 ourselves with our first
  malloc(304), and:

2/ Our second malloc(~4KB) splits the large hole 2 in two:

- if this second split is interrupted by SIGALRM at the right time, then
  the fopen() inside the SIGALRM handler malloc()ates the small hole 2
  for its FILE structure, and we achieve arbitrary code execution as
  explained above;

- if not, then we malloc()ate the small hole 2 ourselves with our second
  malloc(304), etc.

We were able to make 27 pairs of such large and small holes in sshd's
heap (28 would exceed PACKET_MAX_SIZE, 256KB): our large race window now
contains 27 small race windows! Achieving this complex heap layout was
extremely painful and time-consuming, but the two highlights are:

- We abuse sshd's public-key parsing code to perform arbitrary sequences
  of malloc() and free() calls (at lines 1805 and 573):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
1754 cert_parse(struct sshbuf *b, struct sshkey *key, struct sshbuf *certbuf)
1755 {
....
1797         while (sshbuf_len(principals) > 0) {
....
1805                 if ((ret = sshbuf_get_cstring(principals, &principal,
....
1820                 key->cert->principals[key->cert->nprincipals++] = principal;
1821         }
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 562 cert_free(struct sshkey_cert *cert)
 563 {
 ...
 572         for (i = 0; i < cert->nprincipals; i++)
 573                 free(cert->principals[i]);
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- We were unable to find a memory leak for our small "barrier" chunks;
  instead, we use tcache chunks (which are never really freed, because
  their inuse bit is never cleared) as makeshift "barrier" chunks.

To reliably achieve this heap layout, we send five different public-key
packets to sshd (packets a/ to d/ can be sent long before SIGALRM; most
of packet e/ can also be sent long before SIGALRM, but its very last
byte must be sent at the very last moment):

a/ We malloc()ate and free() a variety of tcache chunks, to ensure that
the heap allocations that we do not control end up in these tcache
chunks and do not interfere with our careful heap layout.

b/ We malloc()ate and free() chunks of various sizes, to make our 27
pairs of large and small holes (and the corresponding "barrier" chunks).

c/ We malloc()ate and free() ~4KB chunks and 320B chunks, to:

- write the fake header (the large size field) of our potentially
  enlarged remainder chunk, into the middle of our large holes;

- write the fake footer of our potentially enlarged remainder chunk, to
  the end of our small holes (to pass the glibc's security checks);

- write our fake vtable and _codecvt pointers, into our small holes
  (which are potential FILE structures).

d/ We malloc()ate and free() one very large string (nearly 256KB), to
ensure that our large and small holes are removed from the unsorted list
of free chunks and placed into their respective malloc bins.

e/ We force sshd to perform our final sequence of malloc() calls
(malloc(~4KB), malloc(304), malloc(~4KB), malloc(304), etc), to open our
27 small race windows.

Attentive readers may have noticed that we have still not addressed
(literally and figuratively) the problem of _codecvt. In fact, _codecvt
is a pointer to a structure (_IO_codecvt) that contains a pointer to a
structure (__gconv_step) that contains the __fct function pointer that
allows us to execute arbitrary code. To reliably control __fct through
_codecvt, we simply point _codecvt to one of the glibc's malloc bins,
which conveniently contains a pointer to one of our free chunks in the
heap, which contains our own __fct function pointer to arbitrary glibc
code (all of these glibc addresses are known to us, because we assume
that the glibc is mapped at address 0xb7400000).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timing
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We're running out of time
        -- The Interrupters, "As We Live"

As we implemented this third exploit, it became clear that we could not
simply re-use the timing strategy that we had used against the two older
OpenSSH versions: we were never winning this new race condition.
Eventually, we understood why:

- It takes a long time (~10ms) for sshd to parse our fifth and last
  public key (packet e/ above); in other words, our large race window is
  too large (our 27 small race windows are like needles in a haystack).

- The user_specific_delay() that was introduced recently (OpenSSH 7.8p1)
  delays sshd's response to our last public-key packet by up to ~9ms and
  therefore destroys our feedback-based timing strategy.

As a result, we developed a completely different timing strategy:

- from time to time, we send our last public-key packet with a little
  mistake that produces an error response (lines 138-142 below), right
  before the call to sshkey_from_blob() that parses our public key;

- from time to time, we send our last public-key packet with another
  little mistake that produces an error response (lines 151-155 below),
  right after the call to sshkey_from_blob() that parses our public key;

- the difference between these two response times is the time that it
  takes for sshd to parse our last public key, and this allows us to
  precisely time the transmission of our last packets (to ensure that
  sshd has the time to parse our public key in the unprivileged child,
  send it to the privileged child, and start to parse it there, before
  the delivery of SIGALRM).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 88 userauth_pubkey(struct ssh *ssh, const char *method)
 89 {
...
138         if (pktype == KEY_UNSPEC) {
139                 /* this is perfectly legal */
140                 verbose_f("unsupported public key algorithm: %s", pkalg);
141                 goto done;
142         }
143         if ((r = sshkey_from_blob(pkblob, blen, &key)) != 0) {
144                 error_fr(r, "parse key");
145                 goto done;
146         }
...
151         if (key->type != pktype) {
152                 error_f("type mismatch for decoded key "
153                     "(received %d, expected %d)", key->type, pktype);
154                 goto done;
155         }
------------------------------------------------------------------------

With this change in strategy, it takes ~10,000 tries on average to win
the race condition; i.e., with 100 connections (MaxStartups) accepted
per 120 seconds (LoginGraceTime), it takes ~3-4 hours on average to win
the race condition, and ~6-8 hours to obtain a remote root shell
(because of ASLR).

========================================================================
Towards an amd64 exploit
========================================================================

    What's your plan for tomorrow?
        -- The Interrupters, "Take Back the Power"

We decided to target Rocky Linux 9 (a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9
derivative), from "Rocky-9.4-x86_64-minimal.iso", for two reasons:

- its OpenSSH version (8.7p1) is vulnerable to this signal handler race
  condition and its glibc is always mapped at a multiple of 2MB (because
  of the ASLR weakness discussed in the previous "Theory" subsection),
  which makes partial pointer overwrites much more powerful;

- the syslog() function (which is async-signal-unsafe but is called by
  sshd's SIGALRM handler) of this glibc version (2.34) internally calls
  __open_memstream(), which malloc()ates a FILE structure in the heap,
  and also calls calloc(), realloc(), and free() (which gives us some
  much-needed freedom).

With a heap corruption as a primitive, two FILE structures malloc()ated
in the heap, and 21 fixed bits in the glibc's addresses, we believe that
this signal handler race condition is exploitable on amd64 (probably not
in ~6-8 hours, but hopefully in less than a week). Only time will tell.

Side note: we discovered that Ubuntu 24.04 does not re-randomize the
ASLR of its sshd children (it is randomized only once, at boot time); we
tracked this down to the patch below, which turns off sshd's rexec_flag.
This is generally a bad idea, but in the particular case of this signal
handler race condition, it prevents sshd from being exploitable: the
syslog() inside the SIGALRM handler does not call any of the malloc
functions, because it is never the very first call to syslog().

  [https://git.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssh/tree/debian/patches/systemd-socket-activation.patch](https://git.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/openssh/tree/debian/patches/systemd-socket-activation.patch)

========================================================================
Patches and mitigation
========================================================================

    The storm has come and gone
        -- The Interrupters, "Good Things"

On June 6, 2024, this signal handler race condition was fixed by commit
81c1099 ("Add a facility to sshd(8) to penalise particular problematic
client behaviours"), which moved the async-signal-unsafe code from
sshd's SIGALRM handler to sshd's listener process, where it can be
handled synchronously:

  <https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/commit/81c1099d22b81ebfd20a334ce986c4f753b0db29>

Because this fix is part of a large commit (81c1099), on top of an even
larger defense-in-depth commit (03e3de4, "Start the process of splitting
sshd into separate binaries"), it might prove difficult to backport. In
that case, the signal handler race condition itself can be fixed by
removing or commenting out the async-signal-unsafe code from the
sshsigdie() function; for example:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
sshsigdie(const char *file, const char *func, int line, int showfunc,
    LogLevel level, const char *suffix, const char *fmt, ...)
{
#if 0
        va_list args;

        va_start(args, fmt);
        sshlogv(file, func, line, showfunc, SYSLOG_LEVEL_FATAL,
            suffix, fmt, args);
        va_end(args);
#endif
        _exit(1);
}
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Finally, if sshd cannot be updated or recompiled, this signal handler
race condition can be fixed by simply setting LoginGraceTime to 0 in the
configuration file. This makes sshd vulnerable to a denial of service
(the exhaustion of all MaxStartups connections), but it makes it safe
from the remote code execution presented in this advisory.

## SUSE Security

# A Process That Never Ends

### SUSE is committed to delivering best effort security to its customers and to the Open Source community. We believe that trust in Open Source Software security in general, and the user's privacy in particular, are both indispensable and indefeasible.

We treat software security as a process that never ends. This means we:

* Promptly react to security incidents and deliver premium quality security updates
* Continuously improve the security-related functionality in SUSE products
* Continuously contribute to the rapidly growing maturity of Open Source Software
* Respect the Open Source Software security principles of openness, transparency and traceability

Software security is a complex challenge. Software can provide many of its own security features, such as authentication methods, encryption, intrusion prevention and detection, and backup.

At the same time, it can also contain errors (both deliberate and accidental) that can affect the system's security, including design flaws, programming errors, and backdoors.

The SUSE Security Team addresses all of these aspects of software security, on an ongoing basis. Software security cannot be thought of as a state you can achieve at a specific point in time. Instead, it is a process that must be executed with professional expertise and continuous development. This persistent focus is what has given Open Source Software, Linux and SUSE such an excellent reputation for security.

OpenSSH 4.4 has just been released. It will be available from the
mirrors listed at <http://www.openssh.com/> shortly.

OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol version 1.3, 1.5 and 2.0
implementation and includes sftp client and server support.

Once again, we would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their
continued support of the project, especially those who contributed
code or patches, reported bugs, tested snapshots and purchased
T-shirts or posters.

T-shirt, poster and CD sales directly support the project. Pictures
and more information can be found at:
        <http://www.openbsd.org/tshirts.html> and
	<http://www.openbsd.org/orders.html>

For international orders use <http://https.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/order>
and for European orders, use <http://https.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/order.eu>

Changes since OpenSSH 4.3:
============================

Security bugs resolved in this release:

 * Fix a pre-authentication denial of service found by Tavis Ormandy,
   that would cause sshd(8) to spin until the login grace time
   expired.

 * Fix an unsafe signal hander reported by Mark Dowd. The signal
   handler was vulnerable to a race condition that could be exploited
   to perform a pre-authentication denial of service. On portable
   OpenSSH, this vulnerability could theoretically lead to
   pre-authentication remote code execution if GSSAPI authentication
   is enabled, but the likelihood of successful exploitation appears
   remote.

 * On portable OpenSSH, fix a GSSAPI authentication abort that could
   be used to determine the validity of usernames on some platforms.

This release includes the following new functionality and fixes:

 * Implemented conditional configuration in sshd_config(5) using the
   "Match" directive. This allows some configuration options to be
   selectively overridden if specific criteria (based on user, group,
   hostname and/or address) are met. So far a useful subset of post-
   authentication options are supported and more are expected to be
   added in future releases.

 * Add support for Diffie-Hellman group exchange key agreement with a
   final hash of SHA256.

 * Added a "ForceCommand" directive to sshd_config(5). Similar to the
   command="..." option accepted in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys, this forces
   the execution of the specified command regardless of what the user
   requested. This is very useful in conjunction with the new "Match"
   option.

 * Add a "PermitOpen" directive to sshd_config(5). This mirrors the
   permitopen="..." authorized_keys option, allowing fine-grained
   control over the port-forwardings that a user is allowed to
   establish.

 * Add optional logging of transactions to sftp-server(8).

 * ssh(1) will now record port numbers for hosts stored in
   ~/.ssh/authorized_keys when a non-standard port has been requested.

 * Add an "ExitOnForwardFailure" option to cause ssh(1) to exit (with
   a non-zero exit code) when requested port forwardings could not be
   established.

 * Extend sshd_config(5) "SubSystem" declarations to allow the
   specification of command-line arguments.

 * Replacement of all integer overflow susceptible invocations of
   malloc(3) and realloc(3) with overflow-checking equivalents.

 * Many manpage fixes and improvements

 * New portable OpenSSH-specific features:

   - Add optional support for SELinux, controlled using the
     --with-selinux configure option (experimental)

   - Add optional support for Solaris process contracts, enabled
     using the --with-solaris-contracts configure option (experimental)
     This option will also include SMF metadata in Solaris packages
     built using the "make package" target

   - Add optional support for OpenSSL hardware accelerators (engines),
     enabled using the --with-ssl-engine configure option.

 * Bugs from <http://bugzilla.mindrot.org> fixed:
    #482  - readconf doesn't accept paths with spaces in them.
    #906  - syslog messages from sshd [net] lost.
    #975  - Kerberos authentication timing can leak information
            about account validity.
    #981  - Flow stop in SSH2.
    #1102 - C program 'write' with zero length hangs.
    #1129 - sshd hangs for command-only invocations due to
            fork/child signals.
    #1131 - error "buffer_append_space:alloc not supported"
    #1138 - Passphrase asked for (but ignored) if key file permissions
            too liberal..
    #1156 - Closes connection after C-c is pressed on QNX.
    #1157 - ssh-keygen doesn't handle DOS line breaks.
    #1159 - %u and %h not handled in IdentityFile.
    #1161 - scp -r fails.
    #1162 - Inappropriate sequence of syslog messages.
    #1166 - openssh-4.3p1 has some issues compiling.
    #1171 - configure can't always figure out LLONG_MAX..
    #1173 - scp reports lost connection for very large files.
    #1177 - Incorrect sshrc file location in Makefile.in.
    #1179 - sshd incorrectly rejects  connections due to IP options.
    #1181 - configure should detect when openssl-0.9.8x needs -ldl.
    #1186 - ssh tries multiple times to open unprotected keys.
    #1188 - keyboard-interactive should not allow retry after
            pam_acct_mgmt fails.
    #1193 - Open ssh will not allow changing of passwords on usernames
            greater than 8 characters..
    #1201 - Bind address information is not specified in command line
            help messages.
    #1203 - configure.ac is missing an open [.
    #1207 - sshd does not clear unsuccessful login count on
            non-interactive logins.
    #1218 - GSSAPI client code permits SPNEGO usage.
    #1221 - Banner only suppressed at log level = QUIET (used to be
            at log level < INFO).

 * Fixes to memory and file descriptor leaks reported by the Coverity
   static analysis tool

 * Fixes to inconsistent pointer checks reported by the Stanford
   SATURN tool

Thanks to everyone who has contributed patches, reported bugs and
tested releases.

## Details

Tavis Ormandy discovered that the SSH daemon did not properly handle

authentication packets with duplicated blocks. By sending specially

crafted packets, a remote attacker could exploit this to cause the ssh

daemon to drain all available CPU resources until the login grace time

expired. ([CVE-2006-4924](/security/CVE-2006-4924))

Mark Dowd discovered a race condition in the server's signal handling.

A remote attacker could exploit this to crash the server.

FreeBSD-SA-06:22.openssh Security Advisory
The FreeBSD Project
Topic: Multiple vulnerabilities in OpenSSH
Category: contrib
Module: openssh
Announced: 2006-09-30
Credits: Tavis Ormandy, Mark Dowd
Affects: All FreeBSD releases.
Corrected: 2006-09-30 19:50:57 UTC (RELENG\_6, 6.2-PRERELEASE)
2006-09-30 19:51:56 UTC (RELENG\_6\_1, 6.1-RELEASE-p10)

CVE Name: CVE-2006-4924, CVE-2006-5051
For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit .
I. Background
OpenSSH is an implementation of the SSH protocol suite, providing an
encrypted, authenticated transport for a variety of services,
including remote shell access.
II. Problem Description
The CRC compensation attack detector in the sshd(8) daemon, upon receipt
of duplicate blocks, uses CPU time cubic in the number of duplicate
blocks received. [CVE-2006-4924]
A race condition exists in a signal handler used by the sshd(8) daemon
to handle the LoginGraceTime option, which can potentially cause some
cleanup routines to be executed multiple times. [CVE-2006-5051]
III. Impact
An attacker sending specially crafted packets to sshd(8) can cause a
Denial of Service by using 100% of CPU time until a connection timeout
occurs. Since this attack can be performed over multiple connections
simultaneously, it is possible to cause up to MaxStartups (10 by default)
sshd processes to use all the CPU time they can obtain. [CVE-2006-4924]
The OpenSSH project believe that the race condition can lead to a Denial
of Service or potentially remote code execution, but the FreeBSD Security
Team has been unable to verify the exact impact. [CVE-2006-5051]
IV. Workaround
The attack against the CRC compensation attack detector can be avoided
by disabling SSH Protocol version 1 support in sshd\_config(5).
There is no workaround for the second issue.
V. Solution
Perform one of the following:
1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to 4-STABLE, 5-STABLE, or 6-STABLE,
or to the RELENG\_6\_1, RELENG\_6\_0, RELENG\_5\_5, RELENG\_5\_4, RELENG\_5\_3,
or RELENG\_4\_11 security branch dated after the correction date.
2) To patch your present system:
The following patches have been verified to apply to FreeBSD 4.11, 5.3,
5.4, 5.5, 6.0, and 6.1 systems.
a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.

OpenSSH 4.4 was released on 2006-09-27. It is available from the
mirrors listed at https://www.openssh.com/.
OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol version 1.3, 1.5 and 2.0
implementation and includes sftp client and server support.
Once again, we would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their
continued support of the project, especially those who contributed
code or patches, reported bugs, tested snapshots and purchased
T-shirts or posters.
T-shirt, poster and CD sales directly support the project. Pictures
and more information can be found at:
http://www.openbsd.org/tshirts.html and
http://www.openbsd.org/orders.html
For international orders use http://https.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/order
and for European orders, use http://https.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/order.eu
Changes since OpenSSH 4.3:
============================
Security bugs resolved in this release:
\* Fix a pre-authentication denial of service found by Tavis Ormandy,
that would cause sshd(8) to spin until the login grace time
expired.
\* Fix an unsafe signal hander reported by Mark Dowd. The signal
handler was vulnerable to a race condition that could be exploited
to perform a pre-authentication denial of service. On portable
OpenSSH, this vulnerability could theoretically lead to
pre-authentication remote code execution if GSSAPI authentication
is enabled, but the likelihood of successful exploitation appears
remote.
\* On portable OpenSSH, fix a GSSAPI authentication abort that could
be used to determine the validity of usernames on some platforms.
This release includes the following new functionality and fixes:
\* Implemented conditional configuration in sshd\_config(5) using the
"Match" directive. This allows some configuration options to be
selectively overridden if specific criteria (based on user, group,
hostname and/or address) are met. So far a useful subset of post-
authentication options are supported and more are expected to be
added in future releases.
\* Add support for Diffie-Hellman group exchange key agreement with a
final hash of SHA256.
\* Added a "ForceCommand" directive to sshd\_config(5). Similar to the
command="..." option accepted in ~/.ssh/authorized\_keys, this forces
the execution of the specified command regardless of what the user
requested. This is very useful in conjunction with the new "Match"
option.
\* Add a "PermitOpen" directive to sshd\_config(5). This mirrors the
permitopen="..." authorized\_keys option, allowing fine-grained
control over the port-forwardings that a user is allowed to
establish.
\* Add optional logging of transactions to sftp-server(8).
\* ssh(1) will now record port numbers for hosts stored in
~/.ssh/authorized\_keys when a non-standard port has been requested.
\* Add an "ExitOnForwardFailure" option to cause ssh(1) to exit (with
a non-zero exit code) when requested port forwardings could not be
established.
\* Extend sshd\_config(5) "SubSystem" declarations to allow the
specification of command-line arguments.
\* Replacement of all integer overflow susceptible invocations of
malloc(3) and realloc(3) with overflow-checking equivalents.
\* Many manpage fixes and improvements
\* New portable OpenSSH-specific features:
- Add optional support for SELinux, controlled using the
--with-selinux configure option (experimental)
- Add optional support for Solaris process contracts, enabled
using the --with-solaris-contracts configure option (experimental)
This option will also include SMF metadata in Solaris packages
built using the "make package" target
- Add optional support for OpenSSL hardware accelerators (engines),
enabled using the --with-ssl-engine configure option.
\* Bugs from http://bugzilla.mindrot.org fixed:
#482 - readconf doesn't accept paths with spaces in them.
#906 - syslog messages from sshd [net] lost.
#975 - Kerberos authentication timing can leak information
about account validity.
#981 - Flow stop in SSH2.
#1102 - C program 'write' with zero length hangs.
#1129 - sshd hangs for command-only invocations due to
fork/child signals.
#1131 - error "buffer\_append\_space:alloc not supported"
#1138 - Passphrase asked for (but ignored) if key file permissions
too liberal..
#1156 - Closes connection after C-c is pressed on QNX.
#1157 - ssh-keygen doesn't handle DOS line breaks.
#1159 - %u and %h not handled in IdentityFile.
#1161 - scp -r fails.
#1162 - Inappropriate sequence of syslog messages.
#1166 - openssh-4.3p1 has some issues compiling.
#1171 - configure can't always figure out LLONG\_MAX..
#1173 - scp reports lost connection for very large files.
#1177 - Incorrect sshrc file location in Makefile.in.
#1179 - sshd incorrectly rejects connections due to IP options.
#1181 - configure should detect when openssl-0.9.8x needs -ldl.
#1186 - ssh tries multiple times to open unprotected keys.
#1188 - keyboard-interactive should not allow retry after
pam\_acct\_mgmt fails.
#1193 - Open ssh will not allow changing of passwords on usernames
greater than 8 characters..
#1201 - Bind address information is not specified in command line
help messages.
#1203 - configure.ac is missing an open [.
#1207 - sshd does not clear unsuccessful login count on
non-interactive logins.
#1218 - GSSAPI client code permits SPNEGO usage.
#1221 - Banner only suppressed at log level = QUIET (used to be
at log level < INFO).
\* Fixes to memory and file descriptor leaks reported by the Coverity
static analysis tool
\* Fixes to inconsistent pointer checks reported by the Stanford
SATURN tool
Thanks to everyone who has contributed patches, reported bugs and
tested releases.

## OpenSSH contains a race condition vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#851340

Original Release Date: 2006-10-04 | Last Revised: 2007-03-13

---

### Overview

A race condition vulnerability exists in the OpenSSH daemon. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may result in a denial-of-service condition.

### Description

| [OpenSSH](http://www.openssh.com/) is an open source client and server implementation of the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol.  The OpenSSH server includes the ability to authenticate via the Generic Security Services Application Programming Interface ([GSSAPI](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2743)). Versions of OpenSSH prior to 4.4 contain a race condition in a signal handler during a logging operation prior to user authentication.From the OpenSSH 4.4 release [notes](http://openssh.org/txt/release-4.4):*The signal handler was vulnerable to a race condition that could be exploited to perform a pre-authentication denial of service. On portable OpenSSH, this vulnerability could theoretically lead to pre-authentication remote code execution if GSSAPI authentication is enabled, but the likelihood of successful exploitation appears remote.* |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to cause the OpenSSH server to crash, thereby creating a denial-of-service condition |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade**  See the systems affected section of this document for information about specific vendors. Users who compile OpenSSH from source are encouraged to update to the most recent version. |
| --- |

| **Restrict access**Restricting access to the SSH daemon may mitigate the affects of this vulnerability. Administrators can use application-level access controls or firewall rules to restrict access to the SSH server.**Disable the OpenSSH server**If the SSH server functionality is not required, disabling it will limit exposure to this vulnerability. Refer to system-specific documentation on how to disable the OpenSSH server. |

OpenSSH security update (RHSA-2006-0697)

Original Release Date: October 10, 2006

Last Revised: September 6, 2007

Number: ASA-2006-216

Risk Level: Medium

Advisory Version: 2.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

OpenSSH is a suite of tools for interoperating with the SSH protocol developed for OpenBSD.

Two vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenSSH. The first has
to do
with a potential race condition in the signal handler for sshd when
GSSAPI
authentication is used. A remote attacker could potentially exploit this
vulnerability to cause the daemon to crash. The second vulnerability is
a bug in
SSH-1 (version 1) which could be exploited to cause sshd to consume
large
amounts of CPU resources, potentially leading to a denial of service on
the
affected machine. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names
[CVE-2006-5051](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-5051) and
[CVE-2006-4924](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4924) to these issues.

A number of Avaya System Products use OpenSSH, and are affected by
these
vulnerabilities; however, some Avaya System Products which use OpenSSH
do not
utilize SSH-1 and/or GSSAPI, and are therefore not affected by these
issues.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the
security
advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2006-0697.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with OpenSSH installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya S87XX/S8500/S8300 | All | None | The S8xx0 products are not vulnerable as only SSH v2 is utilized, and GSSAPI authentication is not enabled (which is the default for OpenSSH). |
| Avaya Messaging Storage Server | All | Medium | Avaya recommends that customers upgrade to Modular Messaging 3.1 to resolve this issue.. |
| Avaya CCS/SES | All | None | The CCS and SES products are not vulnerable as only SSH v2 is utilized, and GSSAPI authentication is not enabled (which is the default for OpenSSH). |
| Avaya Intuity LX | All | Medium | Avaya recommends that customers upgrade to Intuity LX 2.0 to resolve this issue. |
| Avaya Message Networking | All | Medium | Avaya recommends that customers upgrade to Message Networking 3.1 to resolve this issue. |

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating
systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying
operating
system or applications that come with the operating system. These
vulnerabilities often do not impact the software-only product directly
but may
threaten the integrity of the underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not
affected
by the vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be.
Customers should determine on which Linux operating system the product
was
installed and then follow that vendors guidance:

## 4. Software-Only Products:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CVLAN | All | Low | See recommended actions below. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite(IMS) | All | Medium | See recommended actions below. |

**Recommended Actions:**
Avaya recommends that customers follow recommended actions supplied by RedHat Linux.

## 5. Additional Information:

Additional information may also be available via the Avaya support
[website](http://support.avaya.com) and through your Avaya
account representative. Please contact your Avaya product support
representative, or dial 1-800-242-2121, with any questions.

Subject: Re: Announce: OpenSSH 9.8 released

Some nitpicks:

CVE-2006-5051 found by Mark Dowd, which was the original bug that got
relatively recently reintroduced as CVE-2024-6387, still has in its
description an erroneous reference to GSSAPI:

> Signal handler race condition in OpenSSH before 4.4 allows remote
> attackers to cause a denial of service (crash), and possibly execute
> arbitrary code if GSSAPI authentication is enabled, via unspecified
> vectors that lead to a double-free.

It was understood back in 2006 that this bug's exposure did not in fact
depend on GSSAPI:

I suggest removing " if GSSAPI authentication is enabled" from
CVE-2006-5051 description.  Maybe someone reading this can correct that.

Maybe I pay too much attention to historical detail, but this error in
CVE-2006-5051 did cause the question of GSSAPI (ir)relevance to come up
in CVE-2024-6387 discussions at least twice (that I know of).

Dug Song and I designed the original fake keystroke echo packets
mitigation, and per our advisory/article back then this was "initially
applied to OpenSSH starting with version 2.5.0.  OpenSSH 2.5.2 contains
the more complete versions of the fixes and solves certain
interoperability issues associated with the earlier versions."

<https://www.openwall.com/articles/SSH-Traffic-Analysis>

After the 9.8 release, I've added an update (clearly marked as such) to
the article above to refer to the issue reintroduction and the new fix.
I was also surprised by the reference to 2.9.9 above, so I checked
OpenSSH-portable commits.  To me, our original references to 2.5.x look
correct, and I have no idea where 2.9.9 came from.

Luckily, those old version references are not part of the CVE-2024-39894
description, so nothing to correct there.

Package        : openssh-krb5
Vulnerability  : several
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2006-4924 CVE-2006-5051

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenSSH, a free
implementation of the Secure Shell protocol, which may lead to denial of
service and potentially the execution of arbitrary code. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2006-4924

    Tavis Ormandy of the Google Security Team discovered a denial of
    service vulnerability in the mitigation code against complexity
    attacks, which might lead to increased CPU consumption until a
    timeout is triggered. This is only exploitable if support for
    SSH protocol version 1 is enabled.

CVE-2006-5051

    Mark Dowd discovered that insecure signal handler usage could
    potentially lead to execution of arbitrary code through a double
    free. The Debian Security Team doesn't believe the general openssh
    package without Kerberos support to be exploitable by this issue.
    However, due to the complexity of the underlying code we will
    issue an update to rule out all eventualities.

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 3.8.1p1-7sarge1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 4.3p2-4 of openssh. openssh-krb5 will soon be converted towards
a transitional package against openssh.

We recommend that you upgrade your openssh-krb5 packages.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

More details about these issues may be found in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database:    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4924   http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-5051   http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-5052   Here are the details from the Slackware 10.2 ChangeLog: +--------------------------+ patches/packages/openssh-4.4p1-i486-1_slack10.2.tgz:   Upgraded to openssh-4.4p1.   This fixes a few security related issues.  From the release notes found at   http://www.openssh.com/txt/release-4.4:     * Fix a pre-authentication denial of service found by Tavis Ormandy,       that would cause sshd(8) to spin until the login grace time       expired.     * Fix an unsafe signal hander reported by Mark Dowd. The signal       handler was vulnerable to a race condition that could be exploited       to perform a pre-authentication denial of service. On portable       OpenSSH, this vulnerability could theoretically lead to       pre-authentication remote code execution if GSSAPI authentication       is enabled, but the likelihood of successful exploitation appears       remote.     * On portable OpenSSH, fix a GSSAPI authentication abort that could       be used to determine the validity of usernames on some platforms.   Links to the CVE entries will be found here:     http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4924     http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-5051     http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-5052     After this upgrade, make sure the permissions on /etc/rc.d/rc.sshd are set   the way you want them.  Future upgrades will respect the existing permissions   settings.  Thanks to Manuel Reimer for pointing out that upgrading openssh   would enable a previously disabled sshd daemon.     Do better checking of passwd, shadow, and group to avoid adding     redundant entries to these files.  Thanks to Menno Duursma.
