```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization of the 'key' parameter in the guestbookview.asp script.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
SQL Injection vulnerability exists in the `guestbookview.asp` script. The `key` parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

Impact of exploitation:
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data theft, modification, or deletion of the guestbook database. In the provided example, the attacker attempts to retrieve admin credentials (adminname and password) from the admin table.

Attack vectors:
The attack vector is via a crafted HTTP GET request to the `guestbookview.asp` script, by injecting malicious SQL code into the 'key' parameter.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server hosting the affected application. No specific privileges are required on the server side to exploit this vulnerability.
