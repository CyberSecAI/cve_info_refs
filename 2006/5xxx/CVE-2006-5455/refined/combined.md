This may have been covered before a long time ago, and not been considered an issue, but if I could
get an admin to click on the following URL (which is intentionally broken to avoid any accidents, but
you get the point), this could really mess things up, couldn't it?
<http://bugzilla.mozilla.gorg/editversions.cgi?action=delete&product=Bugzilla&version=2.19>
I'm thinking there should be some sort of token passing going on from the intermediate 'are you sure
you want to delete' page???

although not exactly, and that seems specifically geared towards bugs...
there's a bunch of places we really should be doing this sort of thing though.
Another weapon in this arsenal is to not accept GET requests for actions which
modify things (require POST)

I agree! The topic is the same, even if the summary in [bug 26257](/show_bug.cgi?id=26257 "RESOLVED FIXED - [SECURITY] Bugzilla should prevent malicious webpages from making bugzilla users submit changes to bugs.") mentions bugs
only. justdave, my opinion is that we should morph the summary of [bug 26257](/show_bug.cgi?id=26257 "RESOLVED FIXED - [SECURITY] Bugzilla should prevent malicious webpages from making bugzilla users submit changes to bugs.") and
fix this problem globally.
The idea about using tokens has already been suggested in the other bug and I
used this idea in the patch I submitted there.

While using POST would get around the problem of allowing a simple link to do
the dirty deed, it would not really solve the problem as a whole. Javascript
could still be used to perform this action and because of the nature of
scripting, could do it even more effective (if somebody wanted to be really
fancy, they could retreive product information to determine what they want to
delete instead of just knowing what exists.

Certainly too late for 2.20, but we should take care of this in the near future.
Better safe than sorry.
(13:33:16) LpSolit: these tinyURLs are a bit dangerous... I could set one to
delete all bugs and users and ask an admin to click the link.... there is no
protection :(
(13:34:08) mkanat: LpSolit: Hrm. Maybe we should have tokens from the
deletion-confirmation pages.
(13:34:13) Wurblzap: True... Not good
(13:35:29) LpSolit: mkanat: I think so too...

I'm not particularly convinced this bug needs to be backported to the branches. While this bug has 'security' related implications, it is not a security bug as such; the old behavior was somewhat vulnerable to social engineering attempts, and this patch makes that impossible. I'd be inclined to land this on the trunk as a 'security improvement' and not to do the backports.
Of course, this does mean that someone could happen to learn about this bug after it lands on the trunk and use it to attempt an attack on a branch-running installation, but it's not as though this is a new problem or different from the way in which most web applications work.

It's also possible there's no token, right? In which case we'd still want to display the confirmation page, not an error page.

That won't work in the minimum supported version of mod\_perl, because $0 is broken until mod\_perl 2.0.2.
>+$vars->{'token'} = issue\_session\_token('createbug:');
Let's just name the tokens after the page. So, in this case, it would be called enter\_bug.

> LoadTemplate($action);

Instead of having a different token for every single action that an edit\* page can do, let's just have one token name. For this, for example, it would be edit\_classifications.
It doesn't actually give us any significant additional security to have a different token for every action, since the tokens themselves are unique and unguessable.

> [snip]
I think you'll need to explain this more. Most users will have no idea that a page issues a token, so this error message will have to be more descriptive. Something like, "You are trying to perform this action without having come from the correct previous page."
And yeah, this is huge. I think we should ask justdave for authority to not backport it.

if we plan to land this now instead of waiting for 3.0, we should go ahead and backport this to 2.22. Backporting to anything older would be masochistic. Zach's second paragraph in [comment 9](/show_bug.cgi?id=281181#c9 "RESOLVED FIXED - [SECURITY] It's way too easy to delete versions/components/milestones etc...") worries me though, we probably still shouldn't yank the security flag till it's available for download.

Here is the warning you get when the token passed to the script is invalid, i.e. the token exists in the the DB, but is not expected to be used here.

Now the warning you get when the passed token doesn't exist in the DB or when no token has been passed at all. Now, I let the user submit changes if he really wants to (compared to the previous case where having an invalid token is clearly the result of some external attack).

Per discussion with justdave on IRC, I removed the creation date of the token, which was useless, and now only mismatches between data contained in the token and the expected ones are shown (meaning that you could have only one of the two fields in bold displayed if the other one is fine).

No, I don't think you can. That's because your web browser will reject JS actions on pages which are on a different server. If your browser is crazy enough to let you do it (I know that Fx prevents this, and I'm almost sure IE and Opera prevent it too), then that's a bug in your browser, not in Bugzilla.

Why are tokens recorded in the database? Wouldn't it be better to use some stateless token, such as the one I described in [Bug 354274](/show_bug.cgi?id=354274 "VERIFIED DUPLICATE - Bugzilla vulnerable to multiple XSRF")?

Damien is right. The clever scheme he outlines in [bug 354274](/show_bug.cgi?id=354274 "VERIFIED DUPLICATE - Bugzilla vulnerable to multiple XSRF") doesn't require use of the database. This means we don't have any storage or expiry issues. Frederic: would you care to evaluate his plan and see if we can use it?

All the code in CGIs would stay there. The only difference is that we wouldn't use Token.pm anymore. So the benefit is low from this point of view.
We are too close to 2.23.3 to change these patches now anyway. This could be fixed in a separate bug, assuming that's something we want to do.

The checkin of [bug 87795](/show_bug.cgi?id=87795 "VERIFIED FIXED - Creating an account should send token and wait for confirmation (prevent user account abuse)") happened after the patch of this bug was initially reviewed, and so this patch didn't catch an instance of DeleteToken() which was introduced by [bug 87795](/show_bug.cgi?id=87795 "VERIFIED FIXED - Creating an account should send token and wait for confirmation (prevent user account abuse)"). This updated patch renames this instance of DeleteToken() to delete\_token(). This catch has been made by our Selenium scripts. Carrying forward Max's r+.

This patch fixes editflagtypes.cgi when adding/removing flagtypes from the inclusion/exclusion lists (same as the patch for 2.22), and also implements this token protection for editfields.cgi, which has been checked in meanwhile. I also removed the 2 die() in this CGI as some people don't like the path to their installation to be displayed.

# Bugzilla: Multiple Vulnerabilities — GLSA **200611-04**

Bugzilla is vulnerable to cross-site scripting, script injection, and
request forgery.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-apps/bugzilla** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.18.6** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.18.6** |

### Background

Bugzilla is a bug tracking system used to allow developers to more
easily track outstanding bugs in products.

### Description

The vulnerabilities identified in Bugzilla are as follows:

* Frederic Buclin and Gervase Markham discovered that input passed to
  various fields throughout Bugzilla were not properly sanitized before
  being sent back to users (CVE-2006-5453).
* Frederic Buclin and Josh "timeless" Soref discovered a bug when
  viewing attachments in diff mode that allows users not of the
  "insidergroup" to read attachment descriptions. Additionally, it was
  discovered that the "deadline" field is visible to users who do not
  belong to the "timetrackinggroup" when bugs are exported to XML
  (CVE-2006-5454).
* Gavin Shelley reported that Bugzilla allows certain operations to
  be performed via HTTP GET and HTTP POST requests without verifying
  those requests properly (CVE-2006-5455).
* Max Kanat-Alexander discovered that input passed to
  showdependencygraph.cgi is not properly sanitized before being returned
  to users (CVE-2006-5453).

### Impact

An attacker could inject scripts into the content loaded by a user's
browser in order to have those scripts executed in a user's browser in
the context of the site currently being viewed. This could include
gaining access to privileged session information for the site being
viewed. Additionally, a user could forge an HTTP request in order to
create, modify, or delete bugs within a Bugzilla instance. Lastly, an
unauthorized user could view sensitive information about bugs or bug
attachments.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Bugzilla users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apps/bugzilla-2.18.6"
```

Summary
=======

Bugzilla is a Web-based bug-tracking system used by a large number of
software projects. The following security issues have been discovered
in Bugzilla:

* Sometimes the information put into the <h1> and <h2> tags in Bugzilla
  was not properly escaped, leading to a possible XSS vulnerability.

* Bugzilla administrators were allowed to put raw, unfiltered HTML into
  many fields in Bugzilla, leading to a possible XSS vulnerability.
  Now, the HTML allowed in those fields is limited.

* attachment.cgi could leak the names of private attachments

* The "deadline" field was visible in the XML format of a bug, even to
  users who were not a member of the "timetrackinggroup."

* A malicious user could pass a URL to an admin, and make the admin
  delete or change something that he had not intended to delete or
  change.

* It is possible to inject arbitrary HTML into the showdependencygraph.cgi
  page, allowing for a cross-site scripting attack.

All affected installations are encouraged to upgrade as soon as
possible.

Vulnerability Details
=====================

Class:       Cross-Site Scripting
Affected:    2.15 and above
Description: Bugzilla sometimes displays admin-provided data in page
             headers (meaning the <h1> and <h2> HTML tags of a page).
             Sometimes, this data was not properly escaped, leading to
             the possibility of a Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability.
             For the most part, this was only exploitable by
             administrators, and so is not of critical severity.
References:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=330555

Class:       Cross-Site Scripting
Affected:    2.0 and above
Description: Bugzilla allows administrators to put HTML in the
             descriptions of products, components, and other items. It
             also allows HTML in certain other fields. Before the
             most recent releases of Bugzilla, this HTML was completely
             unfiltered. These fields are only editable by
             certain users, who are specified by the admin. This makes
             this vulnerability less severe. However, these users could
             use this exploit to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks
             on nearly all users of a particular Bugzilla (including
             users with higher permission levels than themselves).

             Bugzilla now allows only certain HTML tags in those fields,
             protecting users from a Cross-Site Scripting attack.
References:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=206037

Class:       Information Leak
Affected:    2.17 and above
Description: When viewing an attachment in "Diff" mode, a user who is
             not in the "insidergroup" (the group required to view
             private attachments) can read the one-line descriptions
             of all attachments, even "private" attachments.
References:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=346086

Class:       Information Leak
Affected:    2.19.2 and above
Description: Bugzilla has a "deadline" field, which is usually only
             visible to people in the "timetrackinggroup" group.
             However, it was exposed in the XML format of a bug to all
             users.
References:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=346564

Class:       Security Enhancement
Affected:    2.0 and above
Description: Bugzilla updates, deletes, and creates data through a
             web interface. Administrators update things like user
             accounts through this interface. All of these pages accept
             URL variables in both GET and POST formats.

             A malicious user could craft a URL that would edit a user
             (or any other admin-protected item), and then using a
             service like TinyURL, could obscure the URL so that an
             administrator couldn't tell what it was. Then, getting the
             administrator to click on that URL, the action would be
             performed, against the administrator's will.

             This is now prevented. Bugzilla will only accept changes
             on administrative pages if they come from Bugzilla's own
             forms. That is, you have to use the form to make changes--
             you now cannot just click a URL and accidentally make an
             administrative change to Bugzilla.

             Although technically this affects all versions of Bugzilla,
             it has only been fixed on our most recent release (2.22.1
             and our latest development snapshot, 2.23.3), because the
             fix was too invasive to backport further. Administrators
             of previous versions of Bugzilla should only click on URLs
             from users that they fully trust.
References:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=281181

Class:       Cross-Site Scripting
Affected:    2.15 and above
Description: showdependencygraph.cgi is a script that allows you to display
             a graph of how bugs are related. There is a cross-site
             scripting vulnerability in this script that allows for arbitrary
             HTML injection. The user would have to follow a malicious URL
             in order to trigger the attack--it is not possible for another
             user to otherwise inject HTML into the page for the current
             user.

Summary
=======
Bugzilla is a Web-based bug-tracking system, used by a large number of
software projects.
This advisory covers six security issues that have recently been
fixed in the Bugzilla code:
+ Sometimes the information put into the <h1> and <h2> tags in Bugzilla
was not properly escaped, leading to a possible XSS vulnerability.
+ Bugzilla administrators were allowed to put raw, unfiltered HTML into
many fields in Bugzilla, leading to a possible XSS vulnerability.
Now, the HTML allowed in those fields is limited.
+ attachment.cgi could leak the names of private attachments
+ The "deadline" field was visible in the XML format of a bug, even to
users who were not a member of the "timetrackinggroup."
+ A malicious user could pass a URL to an admin, and make the admin
delete or change something that he had not intended to delete or
change.
+ It is possible to inject arbitrary HTML into the showdependencygraph.cgi
page, allowing for a cross-site scripting attack.
We strongly advise that 2.18.x users upgrade to 2.18.6. 2.20.x users
should upgrade to 2.20.3. 2.22 users, and users of 2.16.x or below,
should upgrade to 2.22.1.
Development snapshots of 2.23 before 2.23.3 are also vulnerable to all
of these issues. If you are using a development snapshot, you should
upgrade to 2.23.3, use CVS to update, or apply the patches from the
specific bugs listed below.
Vulnerability Details
=====================
Issue 1
-------
Class: Cross-Site Scripting
Versions: 2.15 and above
Description: Bugzilla sometimes displays admin-provided data in page
headers (meaning the <h1> and <h2> HTML tags of a page).
Sometimes, this data was not properly escaped, leading to
the possibility of a Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability.
For the most part, this was only exploitable by
administrators, and so is not of critical severity.
Reference: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=330555
Issue 2
-------
Class: Cross-Site Scripting
Versions: 2.0 and above
Description: Bugzilla allows administrators to put HTML in the
descriptions of products, components, and other items. It
also allows HTML in certain other fields. Before the
most recent releases of Bugzilla, this HTML was completely
unfiltered. These fields are only editable by
certain users, who are specified by the admin. This makes
this vulnerability less severe. However, these users could
use this exploit to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks
on nearly all users of a particular Bugzilla (including
users with higher permission levels than themselves).
Bugzilla now allows only certain HTML tags in those fields,
protecting users from a Cross-Site Scripting attack.
Reference: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=206037
Issue 3
-------
Class: Information Leak
Versions: 2.17 and above
Description: When viewing an attachment in "Diff" mode, a user who is
not in the "insidergroup" (the group required to view
private attachments) can read the one-line descriptions
of all attachments, even "private" attachments.
Reference: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=346086
Issue 4
-------
Class: Information Leak
Versions: 2.19.2 and above
Description: Bugzilla has a "deadline" field, which is usually only
visible to people in the "timetrackinggroup" group.
However, it was exposed in the XML format of a bug to all
users.
Reference: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=346564
Issue 5
-------
Class: Security Enhancement
Versions: 2.0 and above
Description: Bugzilla updates, deletes, and creates data through a
web interface. Administrators update things like user
accounts through this interface. All of these pages accept
URL variables in both GET and POST formats.
A malicious user could craft a URL that would edit a user
(or any other admin-protected item), and then using a
service like TinyURL, could obscure the URL so that an
administrator couldn't tell what it was. Then, getting the
administrator to click on that URL, the action would be
performed, against the administrator's will.
This is now prevented. Bugzilla will only accept changes
on administrative pages if they come from Bugzilla's own
forms. That is, you have to use the form to make changes--
you now cannot just click a URL and accidentally make an
administrative change to Bugzilla.
Although technically this affects all versions of Bugzilla,
it has only been fixed on our most recent release (2.22.1
and our latest development snapshot, 2.23.3), because the
fix was too invasive to backport further. Administrators
of previous versions of Bugzilla should only click on URLs
from users that they fully trust.
Reference: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=281181
Issue 6
-------
Class: Cross-Site Scripting
Versions: 2.15 and above
Description: showdependencygraph.cgi is a script that allows you to display
a graph of how bugs are related. There is a cross-site
scripting vulnerability in this script that allows for arbitrary
HTML injection. The user would have to follow a malicious URL
in order to trigger the attack--it is not possible for another
user to otherwise inject HTML into the page for the current
user.
Reference: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=355728
Vulnerability Solutions
