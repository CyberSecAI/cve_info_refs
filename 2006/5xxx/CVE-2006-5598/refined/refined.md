The provided content discusses a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in GOOP Gallery. The vulnerability is located in the 'image' parameter.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is improper sanitization of the 'image' parameter in GOOP Gallery.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of sanitization of user-supplied input in the 'image' parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the application, potentially leading to:
    * Session hijacking
    * Defacement of the website
    * Redirection to malicious sites
    * Stealing sensitive user data
    * Other client-side attacks

**Attack vectors:**
The attacker crafts a malicious URL that includes JavaScript code within the 'image' parameter. When a user clicks on this malicious link, the injected script is executed within the user's browser in the context of the vulnerable application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL with the payload in the 'image' parameter. The attacker must also be able to get a victim to click the malicious URL.
