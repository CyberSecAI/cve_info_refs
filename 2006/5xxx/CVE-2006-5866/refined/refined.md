    "ID": "CVE-2006-5866",
    "content": "The provided content from exploit-db.com contains detailed information about the vulnerability:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability is a Local File Inclusion (LFI) in the `view-sourcecode.php` file of PHPManta (Mdoc) version 1.0.2 and earlier.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- The `view-sourcecode.php` script does not properly sanitize or validate the input provided via the `file` parameter, which allows an attacker to include arbitrary files from the server.\n- The script includes the file specified in the `file` parameter without sufficient checks, making it vulnerable to LFI.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- An attacker can read any file on the server that the web server user has permission to access.\n- By including a log file where attacker-controlled data is written, the attacker can inject and execute arbitrary PHP code on the server.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- The attacker sends an HTTP GET request to `view-sourcecode.php` with a manipulated `file` parameter.\n- The file parameter can be an absolute path or relative path to the target files\n- The attacker also injects PHP code into web server log files via user agent or other GET parameters.\n- Once the code is in log file the attacker uses the LFI to execute it.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.\n- The attacker needs to know the path to the vulnerable script (`view-sourcecode.php`) and have knowledge of common log file paths, or be able to guess or discover them.\n- The attacker must be able to write to a log file. This is usually achievable through the User-Agent or HTTP request variables.\n",
    "analysis_summary": "The provided content from exploit-db.com describes a local file inclusion vulnerability in PHPManta 1.0.2. The vulnerability exists in the view-sourcecode.php file, which does not properly sanitize the file parameter, allowing attackers to read arbitrary files, including server logs. By injecting PHP code into server logs and then including the log file, attackers can achieve remote code execution. The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests and have knowledge of log file locations. The exploit-db content provides a perl script to exploit this vulnerability."
