[POWERPC] Never panic when taking altivec exceptions from userspaceAt the moment we rely on a cpu feature bit or a firmware property to
detect altivec. If we dont have either of these and the cpu does in fact
support altivec we can cause a panic from userspace.
It seems safer to always send a signal if we manage to get an 0xf20
exception from userspace.

No, the problem only occurs in the case where you have CONFIG_ALTIVEC and you are running on a 64-bit processor that has Altivec, but the kernel doesn't realize that it has Altivec.  Each PowerPC processor has a "processor version register" (PVR) which identifies the particular implementation, and the kernel has a table of all the known PVR values for all the PowerPC implementations that Linux runs on.  This table has a bit that says whether the processor supports Altivec, and that bit is set for all the processors we know of that have Altivec.  So the exposure is only for as-yet-unreleased 64-bit processors.  (The exposure doesn't exist on 32-bit processors because of a slight difference between the 32-bit and 64-bit code.)  Anton found the problem on the unreleased POWER6 processor.  There we don't have the altivec bit in the PVR table, but there won't be an exposure in practice because firmware will either give us a device-tree property telling the kernel that the processor has altivec, or else disable altivec entirely.  The bottom line is that it isn't a local DoS on any existing machine, nor on any I am are aware of being planned for release in the next few years.  It might be a DoS on some future processor some years down the track.

Its a DoS for non-existing machines :)  ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=213229#c4)  Olaf Hering   2006-10-18 08:25:26 UTC  ``` we are a software company. ``` |  |
