Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2006-5600:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the insecure storage of application passwords as plaintext within configuration files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Plaintext storage of sensitive data (passwords and LDAP credentials).
- Configuration files containing sensitive information are readable by all non-privileged users by default.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Exposure of sensitive information (keystore passwords and Active Directory LDAP access credentials).
- Malicious local users can gain knowledge of and manipulate this sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access to the system where Axalto Protiva is installed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have local access to the system.
- The attacker does not need elevated privileges to read the configuration files containing the plaintext passwords.

**Additional details:**
- Affected software: Axalto Protiva 1.1 (and potentially other versions).
- Specifically, the keystore password is found in `(application directory)KeyToolkeytool.config` and the keystore password and Active Directory LDAP access credentials are found in `(Tomcat directory)webappsprotivaWEB-INFclassesauthserver.config`.
- The vendor claims the issue impacts only "non-commercial" versions, which may be misleading.
- The suggested solution is to set proper access control lists (ACLs) on the application directories and to restrict local login rights to privileged users.
