  "vulnerability": {
    "cveID": "CVE-2006-5779",
    "description": "The provided content describes a vulnerability in OpenLDAP related to SASL bind processing, where a specially crafted authcid can cause a denial of service.",
    "root_cause": "The root cause of the vulnerability is improper handling of authcid names during SASL bind operations in OpenLDAP. Specifically, when an authcid longer than 255 characters includes a space as the 255th character, the length of the normalized name is calculated incorrectly. This is because the space character should be escaped.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Incorrect string length calculation",
      "Insufficient handling of escaped characters"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS) by sending a specially crafted BIND request with a malicious authcid parameter. This crash occurs due to an assert failure.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network based attack",
      "Exploiting SASL bind functionality"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to establish a network connection to the vulnerable OpenLDAP service and send a malicious SASL bind request. No authentication is required."
