{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `main.php` script in kawf 1.0 is vulnerable to remote file inclusion due to the use of a user-supplied parameter `config` in an `include` statement without proper sanitization.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include a malicious file from a remote server, leading to arbitrary code execution on the vulnerable server.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker crafts a malicious URL that includes a remote file path as the value of the `config` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable kawf application."
