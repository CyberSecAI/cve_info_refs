```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The `SendAlertEmail.php` script in Cdsagenda 4.2.9 is vulnerable to remote file inclusion due to the lack of proper sanitization of the `AGE` parameter. The script uses `require_once "$AGE/AgeDB.php";` which allows an attacker to specify a remote URL through the `AGE` parameter, which then gets included in the script.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Remote File Inclusion (RFI)
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can include a remote file containing malicious PHP code, allowing them to execute arbitrary code on the server.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability is exploited by sending an HTTP request to `SendAlertEmail.php` with a crafted `AGE` parameter containing a malicious remote URL.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and have a server to host the malicious PHP file.
