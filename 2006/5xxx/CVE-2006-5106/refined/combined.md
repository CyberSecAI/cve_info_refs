### FAQ

[My subscription has expired - Can I still use the component?](#q1)

**Answer:**

**Even if your subscription expires, you will still be able to use the component, the component's functionality is not affected by your subscription's status**.

The only restrictions applied are the fact that you are no longer eligible to extension related downloads( updates, plugins, modules, component downloads) and you will no longer receive customer support for your registered domain(s).

[Can I upgrade my single site subscription to a multi-site type?](#q2)

**Answer:**

Yes. You can upgrade your subscription from **Single Site** to **Multi-site** just by paying the difference. This upgrade is available for subscriptions of the same type, meaning you can only upgrade your 12 months single site subscription to a 12 months multi-site one. **When upgrading, the subscription period will not be extended, you will benefit from the advantages of the multi site subscription for the remainder of your current subscription.**

[Does a single-site subscription allow me to change the live domain?](#q3)

**Answer:**

Yes. The component can be installed on any domains you want, but **support** will be provided for 1 domain of your choice. The domain can be changed up to a maximum of 3 times. Don't forget, once the domain is changed, you will get new licence code.

[Can I modify the source code?](#q4)

**Answer:**

**All our extensions are listed under the GNU/GPL license**, thus once you purchase and download an extension you will have full access to the source code. You are free to edit or modify this according to your needs, but don't forget that all source code changes are lost when an update is performed.

[Do you have any promotions or discounts?](#q5)

**Answer:**

Yes! A **30% discount** when renewing 12 months multi-site subscriptions (this discount is applied automatically).

Discounts are not cumulative. You can't have more than one discount for a subscription.

## What can you do with RSForm! Pro

![Create GDPR ready forms](https://cdn.rsjoomla.com/images/products/rsformpro-gdpr-feature.png)
### Create GDPR ready forms

The component offers all the necessary features to quickly and easily build GDPR compliant forms. You can find a detailed description of the GDPR standard in our blog.

![Built-in Grid System](https://cdn.rsjoomla.com/images/products/rsformpro-grid-feature.png)
### Built-in Grid System

You can control the form layout using a grid system interface without needing to manually write code. A simple drag and drop functionality is all that is needed to move fields in a different order, align multiple fields on the same row or control the width of each field from a specific row. You can also move multiple fields at once with the help of the cut & paste functionality.

![Add professional looking forms to your website](https://cdn.rsjoomla.com/images/products/rsformpro-professional-looking-form.png)
### Add professional looking forms to your website

Your forms can be designed to fit any website! RSForm!Pro includes even 3 predefined themes to get you started. The available layouts offer you the possibility to display the information just the way you want it.

![Create multi-page forms with ease](https://cdn.rsjoomla.com/images/products/rsformpro-create-multi-page-forms.png)
### Create multi-page forms with ease

Break down your form in pages or sections and increase your conversion rate while keeping the same amount of information. Users will be able to go back and forth through the pages allowing them to correct information. You can also validate pages on the fly with AJAX so that your users can't get to the next page unless they fill in the required fields.

![Export information in CSV, Excel, XML and PDF](https://cdn.rsjoomla.com/images/products/rsformpro-export-form-data-csv-excel-xml-pdf.png)
### Export information in CSV, Excel, XML and PDF

The submitted information can be exported into many popular file formats: CSV, XLS and XML. Submissions can also be individually converted into PDF files.

![Protect yourself from spambots](https://cdn.rsjoomla.com/images/products/rsformpro-protect-from-spam-bots.png)
### Protect yourself from spambots

RSForm! Pro features two built-in image CAPTCHA challenges which your visitors will have to fill in in order to prove they are human, as well as an invisible CAPTCHA. This effectively stops spambots from submitting your forms with junk and spam links. The world leading antispam protection software ReCAPTCHA can be integrated as well using the RSForm! Pro - ReCAPTCHA Plugin.

![Build multi-language forms without duplicating information](https://cdn.rsjoomla.com/images/products/rsformpro-build-multi-language-forms.png)
### Build multi-language forms without duplicating information

Creating multi-language forms can sometimes be a burden - duplicating all of the fields and translating them is both time consuming and it also hinders future updates of the form. RSForm! Pro detects your installed languages and offers the option to translate the form on the fly - you just select the language you would like to translate your form in and type in the translations.

![Validate information with the built-in validation rules](https://cdn.rsjoomla.com/images/products/rsformpro-built-in-validation-rules.png)
### Validate information with the built-in validation rules

Guide your users into correctly completing the form fields with the help of validation rules - show a message next to each field explaining why the validation has failed and point them in the right direction. Choose if a field is mandatory or not. You can check for valid email addresses, alphanumeric characters, numeric values or passwords. You can also add custom character sets to these validations so you can check for a correctly formatted number format, such as "4.99".

![Cross-browser compatibility](https://cdn.rsjoomla.com/images/products/rsformpro-cross-browser-compatibility.png)
### Cross-browser compatibility

RSForm!Pro has been fully tested with all of the leading Web Browsers on the market. The XHTML layouts available offer increased flexibility and allow you to override any CSS setting. RSForm!Pro uses as little as JavaScript as possible in order to prevent your users from having difficulties in submitting your forms.

![Responsive](https://cdn.rsjoomla.com/images/products/rsformpro-responsive-forms.png)
### Responsive

RSForm!Pro has been adapted to fit responsive environments. This layout was designed using Bootstrap functionality and you can adapt it for all the devices that might visit your website.
