Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2006-5887:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a SQL Injection flaw in the `CampusNewsDetails.asp` page of NuSchool 1.0. The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input (`NewsID` parameter) before using it in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper input sanitization in the `CampusNewsDetails.asp` page which allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code through the `NewsID` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker can use SQL injection to extract sensitive information, such as usernames and passwords, from the database. The provided exploit specifically targets the `students` table to retrieve user credentials.
- **Potential for Further Compromise:** Depending on the database user's privileges, an attacker could potentially modify or delete data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through an HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `CampusNewsDetails.asp` page. The malicious SQL code is injected into the `NewsID` parameter of the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target server.
- **Knowledge of Application Structure:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable page (`CampusNewsDetails.asp`) and parameter (`NewsID`) to exploit the flaw.
- **Basic SQL Knowledge:** The attacker needs to know how to craft malicious SQL queries. The provided exploit provides a sample SQL injection query, which could be adapted.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided exploit targets the `students` table and attempts to extract `UserName` and `Password` fields by using a `UNION SELECT` statement.
- The exploit code is written in Perl, highlighting the remote nature of the vulnerability.
- The exploit also checks for specific error messages such as "Ad removed or not yet approved" and "Internal Server Error" to determine if the exploit was successful.
