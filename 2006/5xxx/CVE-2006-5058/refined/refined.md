- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A buffer overflow occurs when the server processes the `callvote map` command. The server copies the map name provided by the client into a fixed-size buffer without proper bounds checking.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary vulnerability is a buffer overflow due to the use of `memcpy` to copy the map name into a 64-byte buffer without verifying the length of the input.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Exploitation of this vulnerability allows a remote attacker (client) to potentially execute arbitrary code on the server. The overflow can overwrite parts of the stack or static memory, leading to control of the server's execution flow.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is remote, through a client sending a crafted `callvote map` command to the game server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be a client connected to a vulnerable game server. They need to be able to send commands to the server through the game's console.
