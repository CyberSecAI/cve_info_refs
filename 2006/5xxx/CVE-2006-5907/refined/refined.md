- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The code directly includes user-supplied input `$id` within SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL injection vulnerability exists due to the lack of input validation before using the `$id` variable in SQL queries.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious user could inject arbitrary SQL code through the `$id` parameter, leading to potential data breaches, modifications, or unauthorized access to the database.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by manipulating the `$id` parameter in the application, typically through a web request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to send web requests to the vulnerable application and modify the `id` parameter.
