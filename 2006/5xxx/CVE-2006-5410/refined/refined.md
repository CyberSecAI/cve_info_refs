**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) in Boonex Dolphin 5.2.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The application is vulnerable to RFI due to a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `dir[inc]` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to include and execute arbitrary remote files on the server.
- This can lead to complete compromise of the web application and the server.
- The impact includes potential confidentiality, integrity, and availability issues.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is remote and involves sending a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable application.
- The vulnerable parameter is `dir[inc]` located within the `index.php` script under the `templates/tmpl_dfl/scripts` directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
