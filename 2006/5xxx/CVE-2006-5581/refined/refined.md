Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2006-5581:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a memory corruption issue in Microsoft Internet Explorer's handling of DHTML script function calls when these calls are made to incorrectly created elements.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Corruption:** Improper processing of specific DHTML script function calls to malformed elements leads to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system. This can give the attacker complete control over the user's system.
- **System Crash:** An attacker could also cause Internet Explorer to crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Specially Crafted Web Page:** An attacker can create a malicious web page containing the specially crafted script designed to trigger the vulnerability.
- **HTML Email:** Attackers may also embed the malicious script in an HTML email or attachment.
- **Compromised Websites:** Legitimate websites that have been compromised may host malicious code that exploits this vulnerability.
- **Websites Hosting User-Provided Content:** Websites that allow users to upload content or ads may be abused to host malicious content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to have any prior access or authentication to the victim's machine.
- **User Interaction Required:** The attacker needs to trick the user into viewing the malicious content (visiting a web page or opening an HTML email).

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered by how Internet Explorer interprets certain DHTML script function calls. The specific function involved is not clearly indicated, however, the advisory from Zero Day Initiative mentions that it is the `normalize()` function.
*   The exploit can be delivered through various means such as visiting a malicious website or opening a specially crafted HTML email.
*   Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to take control of the user's system, install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.
*   Users with administrative privileges are at higher risk, though users with less privilege can still be impacted.
*   The vulnerability is addressed in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS06-072.
