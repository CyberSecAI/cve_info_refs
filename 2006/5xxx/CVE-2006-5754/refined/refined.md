{
  "CVE-2006-5754": {
    "Description": "a flaw in the AIO handling that allowed a local user to cause a denial of service (panic).",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Incorrect initialization of info->nr_pages in the aio_setup_ring() function, which can lead to a kernel panic when freeing resources in the error path. Specifically, a user can trigger a null pointer dereference in the `put_page` function, causing a crash.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Incorrect resource initialization",
      "Null pointer dereference"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service (kernel panic).",
    "Attack vectors": "Local exploitation using a crafted program to exhaust memory mappings and then trigger the asynchronous I/O setup.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local user with the ability to execute code and create memory mappings."
