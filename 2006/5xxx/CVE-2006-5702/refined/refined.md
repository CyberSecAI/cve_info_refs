Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2006-5702:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** TikiWiki provides an empty `sort_mode` parameter in various files. This leads to the display of additional information, including database authentication credentials, in certain error messages.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** TikiWiki fails to properly sanitize the `url` request variable sent to `tiki-featured_link.php`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:**  Exposure of sensitive database credentials through error messages.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  Vulnerable to XSS via a crafted URL parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could gain unauthorized access to the MySQL database credentials used by TikiWiki, potentially allowing full control over the database.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting:** An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser by enticing them to click a specially crafted link, which could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Information Disclosure:**  Providing an empty `sort_mode` parameter in HTTP requests to various TikiWiki pages.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting:** Enticing a user to browse a specially crafted URL containing malicious code in the `url` parameter of the `tiki-featured_link.php` script.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to a vulnerable TikiWiki instance. No prior authentication is required to trigger the error and obtain credentials.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL and convince a user of the vulnerable TikiWiki instance to click on it. No prior authentication is required to exploit the XSS vulnerability.
