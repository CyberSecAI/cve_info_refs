{
  "CVE-2006-5202": {
    "Description": "Linksys WRT54G routers do not properly validate user credentials before allowing configuration changes.",
    "Root cause": "The Linksys WRT54G router's web interface does not require authentication when making changes to configuration files.",
     "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper authentication",
      "Lack of authorization checks for configuration changes"
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker can change the configuration of the affected router. This may lead to complete compromise of the router and the local network. The attacker could change DNS settings, enable DMZ, disable firewall or wireless security, and other actions.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Specially crafted web pages",
      "Direct requests to configuration scripts",
      "HTML forms with embedded JavaScript",
	  "Malicious iframes",
      "User registration forms on compromised websites"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to trick the victim into accessing a malicious webpage or trigger a form submission that targets the router's web interface. This can be achieved by hosting a malicious page on a website, via email or instant messages. If remote administration is enabled, the attacker may exploit the vulnerability from the internet.",
	"Additional Information": "The vulnerability exists because the router does not authenticate users before executing configuration changes via the web interface. Configuration changes are triggered by HTTP POST requests to specific scripts on the router, such as WBasic.tri, Security.tri, dmz.tri, factdefa.tri and Basic.tri, among others. The attacker only needs to know the correct URL, the needed parameters and issue the POST request to alter the configuration of the vulnerable router. This can be done using simple HTML forms and JavaScript."
