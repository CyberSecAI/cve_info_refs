# Advisory Details

November 10th, 2006
## Marshal MailMarshal ARJ Extraction Directory Traversal Vulnerability

### ZDI-06-039ZDI-CAN-003

| CVE ID | [CVE-2006-5487](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2006-5487) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE |  |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [NetIQ](http://www.marshal.com/) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | [MailMarshal](http://www.marshal.com/) |
| TREND MICRO CUSTOMER PROTECTION | Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID ['3877', '3878']. For further product information on the TippingPoint IPS: <http://www.tippingpoint.com> |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Marshal MailMarshal (formerly of NetIQ). Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within the extraction and scanning of ARJ compressed attachments. Due to incorrect sandboxing of extracted filenames that contain directory traversal modifiers such as "../", an attacker can cause an executable to be created in an arbitrary location.  While currently existing files can not be over written, an attacker may leverage this vulnerability in a number of ways. For example, by placing a malicious binary in the "all users" startup folder. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | NetIQ has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at:  <http://www.marshal.com/kb/article.aspx?id=11450> |
| DISCLOSURE TIMELINE | * 2006-07-17 - Vulnerability reported to vendor * 2006-11-10 - Coordinated public release of advisory |

## FIX: MailMarshal Vulnerability to ARJ Directory Traversal Attacks

![Expand / Collapse](https://support.trustwave.com/kb/Skins/TWM24/Images/Misc_Collapse.gif "Expand / Collapse")

| Show/Hide Article Tools     This article applies to:  * Trustwave MailMarshal (SEG) * Trustwave ECM/MailMarshal Exchange  Symptoms:  * MailMarshal vulnerable to Directory Traversal attacks when unpacking .ARJ archives * ZDI-CAN-003 * CVE-2006-5487 * ADV-2006-4457 * Marshal Issue MM-151  Causes: A vulnerability exists in the unpacking routines used in certain older versions of MailMarshal to un-compress .ARJ archive files.  Due to incorrect sandboxing of extracted filenames that contain directory traversal modifiers such as "../", an attacker could potentially cause an executable to be created in an arbitrary location.  While existing files cannot be overwritten, an attacker could leverage this vulnerability in a number of ways. For example, a malicious binary could be written in the "all users" startup folder. Resolution: **To eliminate this vulnerability,** u**pgrade to the latest version of MailMarshal SMTP or MailMarshal Exchange.** This vulnerability was eliminated with a code change in the following versions:   * Trustwave MailMarshal (SEG) 2006, release 6.1.8. * Trustwave ECM/MailMarshal Exchange, release 5.1.1.  Workarounds: Although Trustwave believes few if any customers are still using the affected versions, the following workarounds apply:   1. Create a separate **disk partition** (drive letter) used only for the MailMarshal unpacking folders. This solution will prevent unpacking applications from creating any files in a location outside the unpacking folders. This solution has the added benefit of improving MailMarshal performance. 2. Run the **MailMarshal Engine service** using a Microsoft Windows account that has **no rights to create files or folders** outside of the MailMarshal unpacking folders. This solution requires folder security to be set correctly on all other folders on the server.  Notes: **Threat Assessment** This vulnerability represents a serious potential threat to the security of MailMarshal servers and the networks they protect.  **Note:** Marshal is not aware of any active attempts against MailMarshal servers, or any customer impacts from this vulnerability.  **Credit**Marshal appreciates the cooperation of an Anonymous Security Researcher working with TippingPoint and the Zero Day Initiative in identifying this issue.  **Marshal Product Security Contact Information** Marshal takes the security and proper functionality of its products very seriously. Please contact Trustwave Technical Support if you feel you have discovered a potential or actual security issue with a Marshal product.
