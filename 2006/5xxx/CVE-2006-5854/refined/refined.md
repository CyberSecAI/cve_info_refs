      "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on systems with vulnerable installations of the Novell Netware Client.

The nwspool.dll library does not properly handle long arguments to the Win32 EnumPrinters() and OpenPrinter() functions. Exceeding 458 bytes in the first argument to OpenPrinter() or 524 bytes in the second argument to EnumPrinters() results in an exploitable buffer overflow within the Spooler service.",
