  {
    "CVE ID": "CVE-2006-5174",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The copy_from_user() function on s390 and s390x platforms did not properly pad the kernel buffer with zeroes when a fault occurred on the user address.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Information leak vulnerability due to insufficient padding of kernel buffer during copy_from_user() operations on s390 and s390x architectures.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "A local user could read uninitialized kernel memory, potentially exposing sensitive data.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local access is required to trigger the vulnerability by exploiting copy_from_user operations with faulty user-space addresses.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker must have local access to the system and be able to execute code that can trigger the vulnerable copy_from_user function."
