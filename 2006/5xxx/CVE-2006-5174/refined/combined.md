| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=212144#c0)  Vasily Averin    2006-10-25 10:53:59 UTC  ``` Kostantin Khorenko from OpenVZ/Virtuozzo linux kernel team has noticed the following issue on RHEL4 (2.6.9-42.0.3 and 2.6.9-42.19) kernels.  dev_queue_xmit() have wrong error path: this function can fail before local_bh_disable() call. In this case it jumps to out_kfree_skb label where it calls local_bh_enable(). As a result it can lead to the data corruptions and the node lockups.  This issue was fixed in linux mainstream by the following patches: [http://linux.bkbits.net:8080/linux-2.6/gnupatch@4186e5bfgUOMBbA6xFaY0_z84kaURw](http://linux.bkbits.net:8080/linux-2.6/gnupatch%404186e5bfgUOMBbA6xFaY0_z84kaURw) [http://linux.bkbits.net:8080/linux-2.6/gnupatch@418941b8x3BdnonauMI-deDf7S3plw](http://linux.bkbits.net:8080/linux-2.6/gnupatch%40418941b8x3BdnonauMI-deDf7S3plw)  We are not sure that it can be user-exploitable, however from our point of view it can happen on some hardware and software setups.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=212144#c1)  Vasily Averin    2006-10-25 10:54:00 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 139333](attachment.cgi?id=139333&action=diff "this patch fixes unbalanced local_bh_enable() in dev_queue_xmit()") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=139333&action=edit "this patch fixes unbalanced local_bh_enable() in dev_queue_xmit()") this patch fixes unbalanced local_bh_enable() in dev_queue_xmit()   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=212144#c2)  Neil Horman    2006-11-07 21:07:29 UTC  ``` looks reasonable.  I'll review it further in the AM.  thanks!   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=212144#c3)  Jason Baron    2006-11-21 21:22:19 UTC  ``` committed in stream U5 build 42.26. A test kernel with this patch is available from <http://people.redhat.com/~jbaron/rhel4/>    ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=212144#c4)  Jason Baron    2006-12-18 21:43:58 UTC  ``` committed in stream E5 build 42.0.4   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=212144#c6)  Mike Gahagan    2007-01-17 20:48:02 UTC  ``` I can confirm that the fix is in the 42.0.6 kernel.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=212144#c8)  Red Hat Bugzilla    2007-01-30 14:28:55 UTC  ```  An advisory has been issued which should help the problem described in this bug report. This report is therefore being closed with a resolution of ERRATA. For more information on the solution and/or where to find the updated files, please follow the link below. You may reopen this bug report if the solution does not work for you.  <http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2007-0014.html>    ``` |  |

The problem is that it does not pad the kernel buffer with zeroes in case of a fault on the user address. That allows a malicious user to read uninitialized kernel memory. The bug is already fixed upstream:  <http://www.kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=52149ba6b0ddf3e9d965257cc0513193650b3ea8>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=209435#c3)  Jason Baron    2006-10-23 19:22:23 UTC  ``` committed in stream U5 build 42.20.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=220971#c0)  Vasily Averin    2006-12-29 19:43:42 UTC  ``` Kostantin Khorenko from OpenVZ/Virtuozzo linux kernel team has noticed the following issue on RHEL4 2.6.9-42.0.3 kernel.  aio_setup_ring() function initializes info->nr_pages variable incorrectly, then this variable can be used in error path to free the allocated resources. By this way an unprivileged user can crash the node.  This issue was fixed in 2.6.10 kernel by the following patch: [http://linux.bkbits.net:8080/linux-2.6/gnupatch@418e67e3jfC3msWLXzcdTkI10dwtEg](http://linux.bkbits.net:8080/linux-2.6/gnupatch%40418e67e3jfC3msWLXzcdTkI10dwtEg)  [finist@svconsole tmp]$ id uid=500(finist) gid=501(finist) groups=501(finist) [finist@svconsole tmp]$ uname -a Linux svconsole.sw.ru 2.6.9-42.0.3.ELsmp #1 SMP Mon Sep 25 17:28:02 EDT 2006 i686 i686 i386 GNU/Linux  [finist@svconsole tmp]$ cat map_count.c #include <stdio.h> #include <sys/syscall.h> #include <unistd.h> #include <sys/mman.h>  int main(void) {         long res;         unsigned long ctx = 0;         int i = 0;         void* map;          while (1 == 1) {                 map = mmap(NULL, 100, PROT_READ, MAP_ANONYMOUS|MAP_PRIVATE,                         0, 0);                 if (map == MAP_FAILED)                         break;                 i++;                 map = mmap(NULL, 100, PROT_WRITE, MAP_ANONYMOUS|MAP_PRIVATE,                          0, 0);                 if (map == MAP_FAILED)                         break;                 i++;         }         printf("Done %d mmaps.\n", i);          res = syscall(__NR_io_setup, 10000, &ctx);         if (res != 0) {                 printf("Error in io_setup():%ld\n", res);         }         return 0; } [finist@svconsole tmp]$ cat /proc/sys/vm/max_map_count 65536 [finist@svconsole tmp]$ ./map_count Done 65526 mmaps. ---- crash here.  mmap err: 12 Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000000  printing eip: c01489de *pde = 0eb55001 Oops: 0000 [#1] SMP Modules linked in: ip_nat_irc ip_nat_ftp iptable_nat ipt_helper ipt_state ipt_conntrack ip_conntrack_irc ip_conntrack_ftp ip_conntrack ipt_length ipt_LOG ipt_ttl ipt_tcpmss ipt_REJECT ipt_TOS ipt_tos ipt_multiport ipt_limit iptable_mangle md5 ipv6 8021q bridge atm iptable_filter ip_tables dm_mirror dm_mod uhci_hcd 3c59x mii floppy ext3 jbd CPU:    0 EIP:    0060:[<c01489de>]    Not tainted VLI EFLAGS: 00010203   (2.6.9-42.0.3.ELsmp) EIP is at put_page+0x2/0x6d eax: 00000000   ebx: 00000001   ecx: cf679f7c   edx: 00000000 esi: cfb9c610   edi: cc4dbbc4   ebp: cc4dbb80   esp: cf679f60 ds: 007b   es: 007b   ss: 0068 Process map_count (pid: 3130, threadinfo=cf679000 task=cf3fed10) Stack: c017a158 cfb9c5e0 cfb9c610 cff0073c cc4dbbc4 c017a30c c02e9bda 0000000c        0000004f 0000277f cc4dbb80 00002710 cc4dbb80 cfb9c5e0 cf679000 c017a4d3        bffffa80 ffffffea 00000000 c017b628 00002710 00000000 00000000 cf679000 Call Trace:  [<c017a158>] aio_free_ring+0x1c/0x9f  [<c017a30c>] aio_setup_ring+0x131/0x203  [<c017a4d3>] ioctx_alloc+0xf5/0x17f  [<c017b628>] sys_io_setup+0x39/0xa5  [<c02d47cb>] syscall_call+0x7/0xb  [<c02d007b>] packet_rcv+0x17e/0x307 Code: 35 94 18 00 e9 da fa ff ff e8 4f 94 18 00 e9 6f fb ff ff e8 21 94 18 00 e9 57 fe ff ff e8 3b 94 18 00 e9 d6 fe ff ff 90 90 89 c2 <8b> 00 f6 c4 80 74 2f 8b 52 0c 8b 02 89 d1 f6 c4 80 74 03 8b 4a  <0>Fatal exception: panic in 5 seconds Kernel panic - not syncing: Fatal exception   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=220971#c3)  Jason Baron    2007-01-10 19:24:17 UTC  ``` committed in stream U5 build 42.40.

kernel security update (RHSA-2007-0014)

Original Release Date: February 16, 2007

Last Revised: February 13, 2009

Number: ASA-2007-063

Risk Level: Medium

Advisory Version: 6.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

The Linux kernel manages the communication between software and
hardware as
well as the hardware resources of a computer running the Linux operating
system.

Red Hat has issued an updated version of the kernel packages for
Enterprise
Linux 4. Below is a list of the security issues fixed in the update as
reported
by Red Hat:

* a flaw in the get\_fdb\_entries function of the network bridging
  support
  that allowed a local user to cause a denial of service (crash) or allow
  a
  potential privilege escalation.
* an information leak in the \_block\_prepare\_write function that
  allowed
  a local user to read kernel memory.
* an information leak in the copy\_from\_user() implementation on s390
  and
  s390x platforms that allowed a local user to read kernel memory.
* a flaw in the handling of /proc/net/ip6\_flowlabel that allowed a
  local
  user to cause a denial of service (infinite loop).
* a flaw in the AIO handling that allowed a local user to cause a
  denial
  of service (panic).
* a race condition in the mincore system core that allowed a local
  user to
  cause a denial of service (system hang).
* a flaw in the ELF handling on ia64 and sparc architectures which
  triggered a cross-region memory mapping and allowed a local user to
  cause a
  denial of service.
* a flaw in the dev\_queue\_xmit function of the network subsystem that
  allowed a local user to cause a denial of service (data
  corruption).
* a flaw in the handling of CAPI messages over Bluetooth that allowed
  a
  remote system to cause a denial of service or potential code execution.
  This flaw is only exploitable if a privileged user establishes a
  connection
  to a malicious remote device.
* a flaw in the listxattr system call that allowed a local user to
  cause a
  denial of service (data corruption) or potential privilege escalation.
  To
  successfully exploit this flaw the existence of a bad inode is required
  first.
* a flaw in the \_\_find\_get\_block\_slow function that allowed a local
  privileged user to cause a denial of service.
* various flaws in the supported filesystems that allowed a local
  privileged user to cause a denial of service.

While this advisory deals with the kernel package from RedHat
Enterprise
Linux 4, the vulnerabilities in this advisory have been assessed against
currently supported versions of Avaya Communications Manager (CM). As
such,
some of the responses may include versions of Avaya Communications
Manager that
do not run on RedHat Enterprise Linux 4 or on a 2.6 series kernel.

CM 2.x and CM 3.0, which use a 2.4 series Linux kernel, are only
vulnerable
to the mincore race condition
([CVE-2006-4814](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4814))
listed above. As there is no known exploit for this issue and it would
require
someone with access to a user account on CM, Avaya has chosen to rate
the impact
of this ASA to CM 2.x and CM 3.0 as a Low Risk Level.

CM 3.1.x, which uses a 2.6 series Linux kernel, is vulnerable to all
of the
issues in this advisory including the potential privilege escalations in
the
get\_fdb\_entries issue
([CVE-2006-5751](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-5751))
and the listxattr-system-call issue
([CVE-2006-5753](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-5753))
listed above.

Avaya Messaging Storage Server has been marked as having a Low Risk
Level
as shell access is not available in an Avaya recommended default
configuration.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the
security
advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2007-0014.html>

**Recommended Actions:**
For all system products which use
vulnerable
versions of the kernel, Avaya recommends that customers restrict local
and
network access to the server. This restriction should be enforced
through the
use of physical security, firewalls, ACLs, VPNs, and other
generally-accepted
networking practices until such time as an update becomes available and
can
be installed.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating
systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying
operating
system or applications that come with the operating system. These
vulnerabilities often do not impact the software-only product directly
but
may threaten the integrity of the underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not
affected by
the vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be.
Customers should determine on which Linux operating system the product
was
installed and then follow that vendors guidance.

## 4. Software-Only Products:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CVLAN | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. The CVLAN application does not require the software described in this advisory. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite(IMS) | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. The IMS application does not require the software described in this advisory. |

**Recommended Actions:**
Avaya recommends that customers follow
recommended actions supplied by RedHat Linux.

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2007%3A0014)

## Topic

Updated kernel packages that fix several security issues in the Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 4 kernel are now available.

This security advisory has been rated as having important security impact
by the Red Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

The Linux kernel handles the basic functions of the operating system.

These new kernel packages contain fixes for the security issues described
below:

* a flaw in the get\_fdb\_entries function of the network bridging support

that allowed a local user to cause a denial of service (crash) or allow a
potential privilege escalation (CVE-2006-5751, Important)

* an information leak in the \_block\_prepare\_write function that allowed a

local user to read kernel memory (CVE-2006-4813, Important)

* an information leak in the copy\_from\_user() implementation on s390 and

s390x platforms that allowed a local user to read kernel memory
(CVE-2006-5174, Important)

* a flaw in the handling of /proc/net/ip6\_flowlabel that allowed a local

user to cause a denial of service (infinite loop) (CVE-2006-5619, Important)

* a flaw in the AIO handling that allowed a local user to cause a denial of

service (panic) (CVE-2006-5754, Important)

* a race condition in the mincore system core that allowed a local user to

cause a denial of service (system hang) (CVE-2006-4814, Moderate)

* a flaw in the ELF handling on ia64 and sparc architectures which

triggered a cross-region memory mapping and allowed a local user to cause a
denial of service (CVE-2006-4538, Moderate)

* a flaw in the dev\_queue\_xmit function of the network subsystem that

allowed a local user to cause a denial of service (data corruption)
(CVE-2006-6535, Moderate)

* a flaw in the handling of CAPI messages over Bluetooth that allowed a

remote system to cause a denial of service or potential code execution.
This flaw is only exploitable if a privileged user establishes a connection
to a malicious remote device (CVE-2006-6106, Moderate)

* a flaw in the listxattr system call that allowed a local user to cause a

denial of service (data corruption) or potential privilege escalation. To
successfully exploit this flaw the existence of a bad inode is required
first (CVE-2006-5753, Moderate)

* a flaw in the \_\_find\_get\_block\_slow function that allowed a local

privileged user to cause a denial of service (CVE-2006-5757, Low)

* various flaws in the supported filesystems that allowed a local

privileged user to cause a denial of service (CVE-2006-5823, CVE-2006-6053,
CVE-2006-6054, CVE-2006-6056, Low)

In addition to the security issues described above, fixes for the following
bugs were included:

* initialization error of the tg3 driver with some BCM5703x network card
* a memory leak in the audit subsystem
* x86\_64 nmi watchdog timeout is too short
* ext2/3 directory reads fail intermittently

Red Hat would like to thank Dmitriy Monakhov and Kostantin Khorenko for
reporting issues fixed in this erratum.

All Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 users are advised to upgrade their kernels
to the packages associated with their machine architecture and
configurations as listed in this erratum.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

kernel security update (RHSA-2006-0710)

Original Release Date: November 22, 2006

Last Revised: November 22, 2006

Number: ASA-2006-254

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 1.0

Advisory Status: Interim

---

## 1. Overview:

The Linux kernel manages the communication between software and
hardware as
well as the hardware resources of a computer running the Linux
operating
system.

Red Hat has issued an updated version of the kernel packages for
Enterprise
Linux 3. Below is a list of the security issues fixed in the update
as
reported by Red Hat:

* a flaw in the IPC shared-memory implementation that allowed a
  local user
  to cause a denial of service (deadlock) that resulted in freezing
  the
  system.
* an information leak in the copy\_from\_user() implementation
  on s390 and
  s390x platforms that allowed a local user to read arbitrary
  kernel
  memory
* a flaw in the ATM subsystem affecting systems with installed
  ATM
  hardware and configured ATM support that allowed a remote user
  to cause a
  denial of service (panic) by accessing socket buffer memory
  after it has
  been freed
* a directory traversal vulnerability in smbfs that allowed a
  local user
  to escape chroot restrictions for an SMB-mounted filesystem via
  "..\\"
  sequences
* a flaw in the mprotect system call that allowed enabling
  write
  permission for a read-only attachment of shared memory
* a flaw in the DVD handling of the CDROM driver that could be
  used
  together with a custom built USB device to gain root
  privileges

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned
the names
[CVE-2006-4342](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4342),
[CVE-2006-5174](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-5174),
[CVE-2006-4997](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4997),
[CVE-2006-1864](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-1864),
[CVE-2006-2071](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-2071), and
[CVE-2006-2935](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-2935) to these issues.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the
security
advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2006-0710.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with kernel installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya S87XX/S8500/S8300 | CM 2.x | Low | See recommended actions below.  This issue will be addressed in accordance with [Avaya's Product Security Vulnerability Response Policy](http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/security_vulnerability_response.pdf) |
| Avaya Intuity LX | All | Low | See recommended actions below.  This issue will be addressed in accordance with [Avaya's Product Security Vulnerability Response Policy](http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/security_vulnerability_response.pdf) |
| Avaya CCS/SES | All | Low | See recommended actions below.  This issue will be addressed in accordance with [Avaya's Product Security Vulnerability Response Policy](http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/security_vulnerability_response.pdf) |

**Recommended Actions:**
For all system products which use
vulnerable
versions of the kernel, Avaya recommends that customers restrict
local and
network access to the server. This restriction should be enforced
through the
use of physical security, firewalls, ACLs, VPNs, and other
generally-accepted
networking practices until such time as an update becomes available
and can
be installed.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating
systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying
operating
system or applications that come with the operating system. These
vulnerabilities often do not impact the software-only product
directly but
may threaten the integrity of the underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not
affected by
the vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be.
Customers should determine on which Linux operating system the
product was
installed and then follow that vendors guidance.

## 4. Software-Only Products:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CVLAN | All | None | See recommended actions below. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite(IMS) | All | Low | See recommended actions below. |

**Recommended Actions:**
Avaya recommends that customers follow
recommended actions supplied by RedHat Linux.

## 5. Additional Information:

Additional information may also be available via the Avaya support
[website](http://support.avaya.com) and through your Avaya
account
representative. Please contact your Avaya product support
representative, or

## SUSE Security

# A Process That Never Ends

### SUSE is committed to delivering best effort security to its customers and to the Open Source community. We believe that trust in Open Source Software security in general, and the user's privacy in particular, are both indispensable and indefeasible.

We treat software security as a process that never ends. This means we:

* Promptly react to security incidents and deliver premium quality security updates
* Continuously improve the security-related functionality in SUSE products
* Continuously contribute to the rapidly growing maturity of Open Source Software
* Respect the Open Source Software security principles of openness, transparency and traceability

Software security is a complex challenge. Software can provide many of its own security features, such as authentication methods, encryption, intrusion prevention and detection, and backup.

At the same time, it can also contain errors (both deliberate and accidental) that can affect the system's security, including design flaws, programming errors, and backdoors.

The SUSE Security Team addresses all of these aspects of software security, on an ongoing basis. Software security cannot be thought of as a state you can achieve at a specific point in time. Instead, it is a process that must be executed with professional expertise and continuous development. This persistent focus is what has given Open Source Software, Linux and SUSE such an excellent reputation for security.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
