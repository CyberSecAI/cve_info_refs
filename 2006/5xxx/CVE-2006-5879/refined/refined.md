{
  "CVE-2006-5879": {
    "description": "A SQL injection vulnerability exists in ASPPortal 4.0.0, specifically in the 'default1.asp' file. By manipulating the Poll_ID parameter, an attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code into the database query, potentially gaining access to sensitive data such as usernames and passwords.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from improper sanitization of user-supplied input passed to the Poll_ID parameter in the default1.asp file. The application does not validate or sanitize the user-controlled data before using it in a SQL query, leading to SQL injection.",
       "weaknesses": [
        "SQL Injection"
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can allow an attacker to extract sensitive information from the database, such as usernames and passwords. This could lead to unauthorized access to the application and potential compromise of the entire system.",
      "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through HTTP requests to the vulnerable 'default1.asp' file. The attacker crafts a malicious URL with a manipulated Poll_ID parameter containing SQL injection payload.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target server hosting the vulnerable ASPPortal application. The attacker does not require any prior authentication to exploit the SQL injection vulnerability."
