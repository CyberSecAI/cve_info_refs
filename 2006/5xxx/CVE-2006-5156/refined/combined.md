## McAfee HTTP Server vulnerable to buffer overflow

#### Vulnerability Note VU#842452

Original Release Date: 2006-10-05 | Last Revised: 2006-10-05

---

### Overview

A stack-based buffer overflow exists in the McAfee HTTP server that may allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code.

### Description

| The McAfee HTTP server (NAISERV.exe) is used in McAfee products, such as McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator and Protection Pilot. The McAfee HTTP Server is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow that can be triggered by sending the server a malformed HTTP packet.  More information is available in McAfee Security Bulletin [8611438](http://knowledge.mcafee.com/SupportSite/dynamickc.do?externalId=8611438&sliceId=SAL_Public&command=show&forward=nonthreadedKC&kcId=8611438).Note that exploit code for this vulnerability is publicly available. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply a patch**McAfee addresses this vulnerability with the patches listed in McAfee Security Bulletin [8611438](http://knowledge.mcafee.com/SupportSite/dynamickc.do?externalId=8611438&sliceId=SAL_Public&command=show&forward=nonthreadedKC&kcId=8611438). |
| --- |

| **Limit Access to the** **McAfee HTTP Server**You may wish to block access to the vulnerable software from outside your network perimeter, specifically by blocking access to the ports used by the McAfee HTTP Server. This will limit your exposure to attacks. However, blocking at the network perimeter would still allow attackers within the perimeter of your network to exploit the vulnerability. The use of host-based firewalls in addition to network-based firewalls can help restrict access to specific hosts within the network. It is important to understand your network's configuration and service requirements before deciding what changes are appropriate. |

each other in the ePolicy Orchestrator database.
This can occur if the systems are connecting to
the ePolicy Orchestrator server using network
load balancing or through a virtual private
network.
RESOLUTION:
MAC address included in the search algorithm for
finding a match in the ePolicy Orchestrator
Directory can now be disabled by a registry
setting. This registry key needs to be manually
created on the ePolicy Orchestrator server.
Registry key:
HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Network
Associates\ePolicy Orchestrator\Options
String Value:
DisableMACSearch
Set "DisableMACSearch" to "1" to disable the MAC
search.
The following services must be restarted in
order to begin using the new value set by this
registry key:
- McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator 3.5.0 Event
Parser
- McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator 3.5.0 Server
If this "DisableMACSearch" setting is not
present, the default value is "0" which means
that the MAC search will be activated.
7. ISSUE:
When trying to send the ePolicy Orchestrator
agent to a rogue system, the following error is
displayed: "java.io.IOException: Failed to
authenticate with ePO server!"
RESOLUTION:
A change was made so that the agent push is no
longer looking for a hard-coded user name that
might not exist, therefore allowing the push to
occur successfully.
8. ISSUE:
Older versions of ePolicy Orchestrator did not
uniformly set stored procedure permissions.
RESOLUTION:
The permissions of the stored procedures have
been reset to match those of a fresh
installation of the current version of ePolicy
Orchestrator.
9. ISSUE:
The report "Content Filter Report by Rule" shows
the count for a content filter as ##### because
the number of events is greater than 99999.
RESOLUTION:
The display field within the WebShield RPT files
is now large enough to display a number that is
larger than five digits.
10. ISSUE:
Policies are not compiled properly if a site or
group named "Directory" exists in the ePolicy
Orchestrator Directory.
RESOLUTION:
Policies are compiled successfully even when a
site or group within the ePolicy Orchestrator
Directory is named "Directory."
11. ISSUE:
Notifications including any substitution
variable that contains special characters, such
as $, ., {, }, [, ], ^, \ are not sent.
RESOLUTION:
Notifications are now sent properly when the
event includes a special character.
12. ISSUE:
Login to reporting on a remote console fails
when the ePolicy Orchestrator database is
configured to use NT authentication with a user
who does not have administrator rights on the
remote console system.
RESOLUTION:
Impersonation issue is resolved so that the
database user is not used for all remote console
operations, but just for database access, and
login is now successful.
13. ISSUE:
When making changes to an ePolicy Orchestrator
Directory containing over 1000 groups, response
is slow.
RESOLUTION:
The speed of adding and deleting sites or groups
in a Directory that contains more than 1000
groups has been significantly increased.
14. ISSUE:
The ePolicy Orchestrator console closes
unexpectedly when trying to check in an
extra.dat file that contains a very large number
of virus definitions.
RESOLUTION:
Extra.dat files containing a large number of
virus definitions can now be checked in
successfully.
15. ISSUE:
Notifications are not sent if XML events contain
any white space or trailing null characters at
the end of the file, resulting in the error:
"JDOMParseException: Content is not allowed in
trailing section."
RESOLUTION:
Notifications are sent properly even if XML
events contain white space or trailing null
characters at the end of the file.
16. ISSUE:
Under certain circumstances, Rogue System
Detection appears to stop working because the
mail client was blocking due to waiting for a
response from the mail server. Restarting the
McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator 3.5.0 Discovery &
Notification services temporarily resolves the
issue.
RESOLUTION:
A socket timeout was added to the mail client so
that the blocked state is avoided.
17. ISSUE:
When GroupShield Exchange sends an event where
the action was "Allow Through," ePolicy
Orchestrator reports the action as "Cleaned."
RESOLUTION:
The events reported by GroupShield Exchange
should now display the action as "Warning"
instead of "Cleaned" when the action was "Allow
Through."
18. ISSUE:
When running the "DAT/Definition Deployment
Summary" report, there might be a delay before
the "Current Protection Standards" dialog box is
displayed.
RESOLUTION:
Changes were made to the stored procedure used
by the DAT/Definition Deployment Summary report
that dramatically improves the performance of
this report.
19. ISSUE:
A debug log statement indicating the number of
computers found in an Active Directory Import
was malformed, causing an exception error when
the log level is set to 8.
RESOLUTION:
The debug log statement has been fixed, so the
number of computers found in an Active Directory
Import now appears in the log when the log level
is set to 8.
20. ISSUE:
When the "DAT/Definition Deployment Summary" or
"DAT Engine Coverage" reports are run, the
"Current Protection Standards" dialog box
displays no DAT or engine information.
RESOLUTION:
The "Current Protection Standards" dialog box
displays the appropriate DAT and engine
information.
21. ISSUE:
When running the "Action Summary" report, event
IDs such as 1036 and 1037, appear as the
"Action."
RESOLUTION:
The appropriate action name appears in place of
the event IDs when the "Action Summary" report
is run.
PREVIOUSLY RESOLVED ISSUES
(ePolicy Orchestrator 3.5 Patch 2)
1. ISSUE:
Replication tasks fail intermittently, often
hanging or ending with an exception error such
as the following: "Stack Exception c0000005
address 77f5d61b."
RESOLUTION:
The code involved in replication now has
improved error handling.
2. ISSUE:
The following error appears in the Application
Event Log: "Event ID 1004- faulting application
NaRepl32.Exe, version 1.5.0.467, faulting module
ntdll.dll, version 5.2.3790.0, fault address
0x0001d61b."
RESOLUTION:
Several changes were made to the code involved
in replication. This error no longer appears in
the Application Event Log.
3. ISSUE:
In rare circumstances, a -1207 error is
displayed in the agent log when enforcing
policies. This error is due to an incomplete
removal of the product .NAP file.
RESOLUTION:
A software table insert trigger removes any
ghost product entries when a new product .NAP
file is installed.
4. ISSUE:
When Regional settings are set to French
(Canada), the text in several reports does not
display correctly.
RESOLUTION:
Reports now display properly when Regional
settings are set to any sublanguage, including
French (Canada).
5. ISSUE:
Certain events are not processed if the default
language of the account used to access SQL is
not English; the date/time format causes a
conversion error. The following error appears
in the eventparser.log: "Error converting data
type varchar to datetime."
RESOLUTION:
Using an international date/time format allows
the events to be processed without error.
6. ISSUE:
When performing a directory search for inactive
agents, four-digit numbers are returned as the
location.
RESOLUTION:
Directory search queries now look up the
location information directly from a table,
instead of calling a separate stored procedure
for each computer. This is much faster and
avoids the contention problems that caused the
numbers to appear.
7. ISSUE:
The VirusScan 8.0i Top 10 Access Protection
Report does not allow you to select the Rule
Name when choosing the option to set a data
filter.
RESOLUTION:
The Access Protection Report now allows the Rule
Name filter to be selected.
8. ISSUE:
Exporting to certain report formats does not
export all data from subreports.
RESOLUTION:
All data from subreports are now exported
properly.
9. ISSUE:
The Event Parser log shows repeated error codes,
for example: "AlertER - Failed to read the log
level information from the registry."
RESOLUTION:
These messages provide information about the
startup configuration and are not actual errors.
The wording has been changed to more appropriate
messages.
10. ISSUE:
Default "Virus detected and not removed"
notification contains incorrect value for
"Actual Threat or Rule names" when triggered by
an on-demand scan.
RESOLUTION:
The event that triggers this notification has
been reclassified so that the appropriate
information is sent.
11. ISSUE:
When you run the ePolicy Orchestrator remote
console and you are logged in as a
non-administrative user on a Terminal Server,
the console stops responding after 15 minutes of
inactivity.
RESOLUTION:
Site Manager no longer requires the logged-on
user to have local administrator rights;
therefore, the restriction of access is not
enforced and the timeout is avoided.
12. ISSUE:
Message: "Failed to get MAC address from SPIPE
package" appears in the server.log.
RESOLUTION:
This message is only an informational message
and not an actual error. The wording of the
message is now changed to "Optional MAC address
not found in SPIPE" to clarify that this is not
an error when it does occur.
13. ISSUE:
High CPU utilization by NAIMSERV.EXE ended in
crashes due to a malfunction in the task-policy
caching mechanism that caused multiple threads
to continually refresh the cache.
RESOLUTION:
The code involved in the caching of tasks has
been changed so that NAIMSERV.EXE does not
crash.
14. ISSUE:
Only one PDA device is allowed to exist in the
ePolicy Orchestrator Directory tree.
RESOLUTION:
Multiple PDA devices are now allowed to exist in
the Directory.
15. ISSUE:
After performing a database merge using
AVIDB\_MERGE\_TOOL.EXE, the Action Summary Report
shows incorrect data because unicode sql script
files are not loading properly; this is due to
invalid characters that are read into the
buffer.
RESOLUTION:
The invalid characters are now removed, allowing
the unicode script files to load properly.
16. ISSUE:
A machine name in a double-byte language, such
as Japanese, does not display properly in Rogue

RESOLUTION:
Most systems with double-byte characters in the
machine name now display correctly in Rogue
System Detection.
17. ISSUE:
The Rogue System Sensor Deployment Task allows
you to select both "Force install" and "Force
uninstall" at the same time.
RESOLUTION:
The checkboxes for these options now behave like
radio buttons; only one option can be selected
at any one time.
18. ISSUE:
Rogue System Detection allows a machine that is
already managed to be re-added to the ePolicy
Orchestrator Directory, causing the following
error message:
"manualactionbean\_missing\_selection\_add\_to\_epo."
RESOLUTION:
The option to add a machine that is already
managed is no longer available in Rogue System
Detection.
19. ISSUE:
Machines that have the Rogue System Sensor
deployed periodically receive the following
error in the System Event log: "RSSensor.exe-
Application error: The instruction at
"0x004d4d7b" referenced memory at "0x00000004."
RESOLUTION:
Modifications have been made to the code in
RSSensor.exe so that this crash no longer
occurs.
20. ISSUE:
If the ePolicy Orchestrator database name
contains a space, the following error is
displayed when clicking on Rogue System
Detection or Notifications: "HTTP error 500-
Server error: Initialization error details-
Failed to initialize the alerting database."
RESOLUTION:
Rogue System Detection and Notifications now
display correctly, even if the ePolicy
Orchestrator database contains a space in the
name.
21. ISSUE:
Rogue System Detection and Notifications fail to
load with "HTTP error 500- Server error:
Initialization error details- Failed to
initialize the alerting database" if the user
account specified in CfgNaiMs.exe contains a
space. This account is used by ePolicy
Orchestrator to administer the ePolicy
Orchestrator database.
RESOLUTION:
Rogue System Detection and Notifications now
display correctly, even if the account used to
access the database contains a space.
22. ISSUE:
The "Push ePO Agent" Automatic Response in Rogue
System Detection does not activate the OK button
when non-US English characters, such as
Å,Ä,Ö,å,ä,or ö, are used in the username or
password.
RESOLUTION:
Non-US English characters now activate the OK
button when used in the username and password of
the "Push ePO Agent" Automatic Response in Rogue
System Detection.
23. ISSUE:
Inactive agents show up multiple times in Rogue
System Detection reports.
RESOLUTION:
Inactive agents no longer show up multiple times
in these reports.
24. ISSUE:
When running the "Rogues Detected by Subnet"
report, the same machines are reported multiple
times, based on the number of sensors installed
on the subnet.
RESOLUTION:
The report has been redesigned to no longer show
duplicate computer entries that are due to more
than one sensor on a subnet.
25. ISSUE:
Machines marked as Rogue System Exceptions still
show as rogue machines in the reports.
RESOLUTION:
Rogue System Detection reports now exclude
machines that are marked as Exceptions.
26. ISSUE:
When accessing Rogue System Detection, the
message "Reconnecting" is displayed. This is
caused when the ePolicy Orchestrator console
login contains any of the following characters:
&, +, or %.
RESOLUTION:
The characters &, +, or % are now allowed, and
the Rogue System Detection page loads properly.
27. ISSUE:
When the Rogue System Sensor policy is set to
inherit at the Directory level, the
sensor-to-server communication port changes to
8445.
RESOLUTION:
The sensor-to-server communication port no
longer changes to 8445 when the policy is set to
inherit at the Directory level.
PREVIOUSLY RESOLVED ISSUES
(ePolicy Orchestrator 3.5 Patch 1)
1. ISSUE:
E-mail notifications sent by Rogue System
Detection are missing the UTF-8 identifiers in
the e-mail headers, which causes problems when
viewing e-mail messages that contain high-order
characters, such as Japanese characters.
RESOLUTION:
The proper identifiers have been added; now
e-mail messages from Rogue System Detection that
contain high-order characters are properly
displayed.
2. ISSUE:
Replication to distributed repositories residing
on Novell NetWare FTP servers completes with
partial failure due to files being locked at the
time of download.

RESOLUTION:
A change in how the task log is handled allows
the "Server Task" tab to be displayed without
causing the console to hang.
7. ISSUE:
Information on tasks associated with client
computers may not be accurate in reports.
RESOLUTION:
Reports list the correct tasks associated with
each client computer.
8. ISSUE:
Running the Compliance Issues Report fails with
the error: "Error detected by database DLL" due
to the columns of the temp tables not being able
to handle the size of the data.
RESOLUTION:
The size of the columns in the temp tables is
adjusted to match the size of the source data so
that the Compliance Issues Report now runs
successfully.
9. ISSUE:
The Rogue System Detection window displays an

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

The SMBSP\_UpdateCompliance stored procedure
included in the recently released
ProtectionPilot 1.1.x Patch 2 is not installed
if the ProtectionPilot database collation is not
the same as the Microsoft SQL server collation.
This causes the Engine and DAT Compliance
reports to show as not up-to-date.
RESOLUTION:
The SMBSP\_UpdateCompliance stored procedure now
installs properly.
5. ISSUE:
When managed systems are upgraded to the 5100
engine from the 4400 engine, the ProtectionPilot
console would temporarily show systems as
non-compliant. Systems became compliant after a
full property collection.
RESOLUTION:
Managed systems now show as compliant
immediately after the 5100 Engine update.
PREVIOUSLY RESOLVED ISSUES
(ProtectionPilot 1.1.x Patch 2)
1. ISSUE:
After updating to the 4825 DAT or later, the
ProtectionPilot dashboard shows that systems are
not up-to-date, although they are running the
latest DATs.
RESOLUTION:
Application of this Patch normalizes the DAT and
Engine versions to a common format. When
calculating the compliance, versions are either
truncated, or used as is if they are the same
length, which will address the dashboard issue.
KNOWN ISSUE:
DAT and Engine versions in "Detailed Product
Properties" are not normalized.
PREVIOUSLY RESOLVED ISSUES
(ProtectionPilot 1.1.x Patch 1)
1. ISSUE:
Error 7031 appears in the System Event log
during scheduled replications: "The McAfee
ProtectionPilot Server service terminated
unexpectedly."
RESOLUTION:
SrvEventInf.dll was revised to allow concurrent
access from multiple threads simultaneously so
that this error no longer occurs.
2. ISSUE:
Replication tasks fail intermittently, often
hanging or ending with an exception error such
as the following: "Stack Exception c0000005
address 77fccc2c."
RESOLUTION:
The code involved in replication now has
improved error handling.
3. ISSUE:
The repository AutoUpdate downloads extra.dat
files but they do not work correctly in
GroupShield Exchange.
RESOLUTION:
The extra.dat file now is used correctly by
GroupShield.
4. ISSUE:
Replication can sometimes fail and stack traces
are visible in the server log.
RESOLUTION:
Replications in this circumstance now succeed
and the stack traces no longer appear.
5. ISSUE:
System properties report that systems that have
more than 2 GB of RAM have 0 GB of RAM.
RESOLUTION:
System properties now report the correct amount
of RAM.
6. ISSUE:
Pushing the ProtectionPilot agent to systems
running Windows 2000 sometimes can fail.
RESOLUTION:
ProtectionPilot agents can now successfully be
deployed to this platform.
7. ISSUE:
From a remote console, after a manual download
of updates to the ProtectionPilot server, agents
sometimes did not see that the server had been
updated.
RESOLUTION:
An error on the server side has been corrected
so that the latest updates are always available
to agents.
8. ISSUE:
NAIREPL32.EXE can create an excessive CPU load.
RESOLUTION:
This has been corrected and NAIREPL32.EXE now
uses resources in line with its current
demands.
9. ISSUE:
Server tasks can enter a state where they no
longer execute and cannot be rescheduled. Next
run times show as "Unknown."
RESOLUTION:
This no longer occurs.
10. ISSUE:
The Inherit box in VirusScan tasks loses state
and doesn't reflect the currently set policy.
RESOLUTION:
The Inherit box now correctly matches the
current state of the task settings.
PREVIOUSLY RESOLVED ISSUES
(ProtectionPilot 1.1.1)
1. ISSUE:
The ProtectionPilot console shows latest
components as not up-to-date. This affects DATs
and managed products.
RESOLUTION:
If a system has the latest DATs and managed
products, it now shows as up-to-date.
2. ISSUE:
AvertLog.xml can grow without limits.
RESOLUTION:
This log is now properly "bounds checked" to
prevent it from using all available disk space.

INSTALLATION
INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS
To use this release, you must have ProtectionPilot
1.1 software installed on the computer you intend to
update with this release.
NOTES:
This release does not work with earlier versions
of ProtectionPilot software.
IMPORTANT:
In addition to applying this Patch to the
ProtectionPilot server, be sure to apply this
Patch to all remote console systems. Using a
remote console with a version different than the
ProtectionPilot server will produce unknown
results.
INSTALLATION STEPS
WARNING:
Close the Windows Services dialog box to avoid
installation issues.
1. Create a temporary folder on the hard drive of
the ProtectionPilot server.
2. Extract the PRP1113.ZIP file to the temporary
folder that you created in Step 1.
NOTE:
On systems running Microsoft Windows XP SP2 or
Windows 2003 SP1 (or later), using the
built-in Microsoft Windows Zip extractor or
WinZip 10 on NTFS partitions can result in
script errors being displayed in the
ProtectionPilot console. McAfee recommends
using a different Zip extractor, such as
7-Zip, or previous versions of WinZip.
3. Log on to the desired computer using an account
with local administrator permissions.
4. Close all ProtectionPilot consoles.
5. On the taskbar, click the "Start" button, then
select "Run." The "Run" dialog box appears.
6. In "Open," type the path where the Setup program
(SETUP.EXE) is located, then click "OK." The
"ProtectionPilot 1.1 Patch 3 Setup" wizard
appears.
7. Click "Next" to begin the installation.
8. Click "Finish" to complete the installation.
9. For all remote consoles, repeat Steps 3  8.
REMOVING THIS RELEASE
To remove this Patch from your computer, uninstall,
then reinstall ProtectionPilot.
NOTE:
We recommend that you do NOT remove the Patch
files once you install them. If you reinstall
the ProtectionPilot software, we recommend
