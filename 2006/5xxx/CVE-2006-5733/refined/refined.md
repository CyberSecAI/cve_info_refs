{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a local file inclusion flaw. The application uses a session variable ('lang') from a cookie to construct a file path without proper sanitization. Specifically, the application retrieves the language setting from a cookie named 'PNSVlang' through the pnSessionGetVar function. This value is then used to include a language file in error.php. By crafting a malicious cookie with 'PNSVlang' pointing to a local file like /etc/passwd or to a log file containing attacker-controlled code, an attacker can achieve remote code execution.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Local File Inclusion (LFI)",
      "Improper Input Validation",
       "Remote Code Execution"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution on the server by including a file with malicious PHP code, such as a log file containing the injected code.",
    "attack_vectors": "By sending a crafted HTTP request with a malicious 'PNSVlang' cookie value, an attacker can exploit the LFI vulnerability. The attacker can specify a path to a local file containing malicious code or a log file where malicious PHP code was previously injected by the attacker. The application will include this file and execute the code.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable PostNuke server and inject a cookie. The attacker also needs to know or discover a writable location on the target system where malicious PHP code can be placed or injected, such as the web server's log files."
