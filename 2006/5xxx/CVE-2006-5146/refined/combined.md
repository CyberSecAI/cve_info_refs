Ref:

  Yblog => Cross Site Scripting
  <http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/archive/1/447427/100/0/threaded>

found some source here:

  <http://sourceforge.net/projects/y-blog/>

With only a quick glance through the code, I was not able to verify
the researcher's claims.  For example, "action" is only referenced a
few times in uss.php, apparently safely.  However, I did not look
extensively for things like variable overwrite or dynamic variable
evaluation issues.
