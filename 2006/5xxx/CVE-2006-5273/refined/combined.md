#### Synopsis

A security management service running on the remote host is affected by multiple vulnerabilities.
#### Description

The McAfee Common Management Agent (CMA) running on the remote host is prior to version 3.6.0 Patch 1 (3.6.0.546). It is, therefore, affected by multiple vulnerabilities :

 - An integer underflow condition exists that allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code via a specially crafted UDP packet. (CVE-2006-5271)

 - A stack-based buffer overflow condition exists due to improper checking of boundary limits when receiving ping packets. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this, via a specially crafted packet, to cause a denial of service condition or the execution of arbitrary code.
 (CVE-2006-5272)

 - A heap buffer overflow condition exists due to improper checking of bounds when receiving certain packets. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this, via a specially crafted packet, to cause a denial of service condition or the execution of arbitrary code.
 (CVE-2006-5273)

 - An integer overflow condition exists in the CMA Framework service that allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service condition or the execution of arbitrary code. (CVE-2006-5274)
#### Solution

Upgrade to McAfee Common Management Agent version 3.6.0 Patch 1 (3.6.0.546) or later.
