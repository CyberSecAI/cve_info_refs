Details
=======
Product: admin.tool CMS
Affected Version: <= 3
Immune Version: none
Security-Risk: moderated
Remote-Exploit: yes
Vendor-URL: <http://www.toolinfo.net>

Original Advisory:
============
<http://www.majorsecurity.de/index_2.php?major_rls=major_rls30>

Introduction
============
admin.tool CMS is a content management system.

More Details
============
XSS:
Input passed directly to the "fSid" and "fSrcBegriffe" parameter is not properly \
sanitised before being returned to the user. This can be exploited to execute \
arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected \
site.

Fix
===
None known

Solution
=============
Edit the source code to ensure that input is properly sanitised.
You should work with "htmlspecialchars()" or "htmlentities()" php-function to ensure \
that html tags are not going to be executed. Further it is recommend to set off the \
"register globals" option in the "php.ini" on your webserver.

Example:
$pass = htmlentities($_POST['pass']);
$test = htmlspecialchars($_GET('test'));
?>

History/Timeline
================
27.10.2006 discovery of the vulnerability
28.10.2006 additional tests with other versions
28.10.2006 contacted the vendor
03.11.2006 advisory is written

MajorSecurity
=======
MajorSecurity is a German penetration testing and hacking security project
which consists of only one person at the present time.
I am looking for a partnership.
