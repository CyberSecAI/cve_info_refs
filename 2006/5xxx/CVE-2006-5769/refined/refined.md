- **Root cause of vulnerability:**  The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input. Specifically, the `fSid` and `fSrcBegriffe` parameters are not sanitized before being included in the output.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML and script code, which will be executed in the context of the victim's browser session when they visit the affected site. This allows for actions like session hijacking, defacement, or redirecting users to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploitable through HTTP requests by injecting malicious code into the `fSid` and `fSrcBegriffe` parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and lure the victim to click it, or inject the malicious code into a link on a website. No special access is required on the target server.
