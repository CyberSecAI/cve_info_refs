## CA Multiple Product Message Engine RPC Server Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-06-031ZDI-CAN-046

| CVE ID | [CVE-2006-5143](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2006-5143) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE |  |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [Computer Associates](http://www.ca.com/worldwide/) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | [BrightStor ARCserve Server](http://ca.com/us/products/product.aspx?ID=4536) |
| TREND MICRO CUSTOMER PROTECTION | Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID ['4295', '4348']. For further product information on the TippingPoint IPS: <http://www.tippingpoint.com> |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Computer Associates BrightStor ARCserve Backup, Enterprise Backup, Server Protection Suite and Business Protection Suite. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.  The problem specifically exists within ASCORE.dll, a DLL used by the Message Engine RPC server.

## CA BrightStor ARCserve Discovery Service Remote Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

### ZDI-06-030ZDI-CAN-041

| CVE ID | [CVE-2006-5143](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2006-5143) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE |  |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [Computer Associates](http://www.ca.com/worldwide/) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | [BrightStor ARCserve Server](http://ca.com/us/products/product.aspx?ID=4536) |
| TREND MICRO CUSTOMER PROTECTION | Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID ['4289']. For further product information on the TippingPoint IPS: <http://www.tippingpoint.com> |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Computer Associates BrightStor ARCserve Backup, Enterprise Backup, Server Protection Suite and Business Protection Suite. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability and both client and servers are affected.  The problem specifically exists within the discovery service which communicates initially over UDP port 41524 and then over TCP port 41523. Due to invalid bounds checking during TCP communications, a stack based buffer overflow may occur in ASBRDCST.DLL during a call to vsprintf(). |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | Computer Associates has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at:  <http://supportconnectw.ca.com/public/storage/infodocs/basbr-secnotice.asp> |

## Computer Associates BrightStor ARCserv and Protection Suite products RPC buffer overflow vulnerabilities

#### Vulnerability Note VU#860048

Original Release Date: 2006-11-02 | Last Revised: 2007-02-06

---

### Overview

Multiple vulnerabilities exist in Computer Associates backup products. If successfully exploited, these vulnerabilities may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

### Description

| [BrightStor ARCserve Backup](http://www3.ca.com/solutions/ProductFamily.aspx?ID=115) is a backup and data retention tool that integrates with other BrightStor Data Availability and BrightStor Storage Management solutions. [Computer Associates Protection Suites](http://www3.ca.com/smb/solution.aspx?id=5312) offer multiple Computer Associates security and data recovery products in a single package.  BrightStor and CA (Computer Associates) Protection Suite products contain multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities due to incorrect handling of RPC requests. These overflows may be exploited by sending a malformed RPC request with Opnum 43 (port 6503/tcp) or Opnum 45 (port 6503/tcp) to a vulnerable system.Note that only the Microsoft Windows versions of Computer Associates products are affected by this vulnerability.For more information, including a list of affected products, refer to the Computer Associates [Security Advisory](http://supportconnectw.ca.com/public/storage/infodocs/basbr-secnotice.asp). |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade**According to [Computer Associates](http://supportconnectw.ca.com/public/storage/infodocs/basbr-secnotice.asp): *Customers with vulnerable versions of the BrightStor ARCserve Backup products should upgrade to the latest versions which will be available for download from* [*http://supportconnect.ca.com*](http://supportconnect.ca.com) *on or before October 5.* |
| --- |

| **Restrict Access**Restricting access to port 6503/tcp at the network perimeter may mitigate the impact of this vulnerability. |

## Computer Associates Discovery Service buffer overflow

#### Vulnerability Note VU#361792

Original Release Date: 2006-11-01 | Last Revised: 2007-01-12

---

### Overview

Multiple Computer Associates products contain a buffer overflow in the code that handles the Discovery Service protocol. This vulnerability may allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code.

### Description

| Computer Associates BrightStor ARCserve Backup, BrightStor Enterprise Backup, CA Server Protection Suite, and CA Business Protection Suite software use a protocol known as the Discovery Service to find other BrightStor and Protection Suite installations. A lack of validation on Discovery Service packets may allow a buffer overflow to occur.  This vulnerability only affects Computer Associates BrightStor ARCserve and Protection Suite products for the Microsoft Windows platform. For more information, including a list of affected products, refer to the Computer Associates BrightStor ARCserve Backup [Security Notice](http://supportconnectw.ca.com/public/storage/infodocs/basbr-secnotice.asp). |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade**According to Computer Associates:*Customers with vulnerable versions of the BrightStor ARCserve Backup products should upgrade to the latest versions which will be available for download from* [*http://supportconnect.ca.com*](http://supportconnect.ca.com/) *on or before October 5.* |
| --- |

| **Restrict Access**You may wish to block access to the vulnerable software from outside your network perimeter, specifically by blocking access to the ports used by the Discovery Service protocol (typically ports 41524/udp and 41523/tcp). This will limit your exposure to attacks. However, blocking at the network perimeter would still allow attackers within the perimeter of your network to exploit the vulnerability. The use of host-based firewalls in addition to network-based firewalls can help restrict access to specific hosts within the network. It is important to understand your network's configuration and service requirements before deciding what changes are appropriate. |
