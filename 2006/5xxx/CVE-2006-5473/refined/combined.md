I took a closer look at this since it was so weird.

The "Description" file is basically a bunch of documentation for various
functions within the library.  It is free-form text and there are no
"<?php>" specifiers (or "<?"), so renaming it to a .php extension still
wouldn't have any effect.

The surrounding text within "Description" says:

  2. MySQL DB support. HOW TO USE

  If you decide to use this library and write a piece of code.... First of
  all you need set $cfg_dir and $lib_dir variables, edit the
  database.cfg.php file (DB server, user name, password) and add the
  following lines in your script:

        include ($cfg_dir . "database.cfg.php");
        include ($lib_dir . "sqlstorage.class.php");

So, if Anaconda was actually looking at a real site, the site had been
butchered in ways that were not standard to the product, so it's probably
site-specific instead of an inherent product issue.  Even the above sample
code says "you need [to] set $cfg_dir and $lib_dir variables" so it's not
giving insecure configuration guidance.

# [VIM] PHP file inclusions in PHP Developer Library 1.5.3 (some disputed)

```
In the past 2 weeks there have been 3 separate issues
involving the Softerra PHP Developer Library 1.5.3:

(1) <http://www.milw0rm.com/exploits/2511>
(2) <http://www.milw0rm.com/exploits/2520>
(3) BUGTRAQ:20061020 PHPLibrary-1.5.3(Description.php) Remote File
Include

<http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/archive/1/449355/100/0/threaded>

Upon brief source code inspection, the first two appear to be
legitimate.

DISPUTED
The third issue, appears to be a lack of research on
the part of the reporter (due to grep or Google Code Search).
The distribution as of 20061023 does not contain a file called
Description.php. It does, however, contain a Description file
(no file extension) which does contain the reported line (line 253):
>     include ($lib_dir . "sqlstorage.class.php");

However there is no clear way to get this file to be handled by the
PHP interpreter (mod_php or similar).
