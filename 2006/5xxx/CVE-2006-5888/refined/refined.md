Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2006-5888:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a SQL injection flaw in the `viewarticle.asp` page of UPublisher 1.0.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The `ID` parameter in the `viewarticle.asp` is vulnerable to SQL injection. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the query executed by the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach/Exposure:** Attackers can bypass authentication, read sensitive data from the database.
- **Complete database access:** Depending on the database and the privileges of the database user, the attacker may be able to modify data, or potentially take over the database server, as the exploit examples demonstrate reading username/password combinations from the 'tblusers' table.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through crafted HTTP GET requests to the `viewarticle.asp` page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- **Basic SQL Knowledge:** The attacker needs to have knowledge of SQL syntax to craft the injection payload.

**Technical Details:**
- The exploit examples demonstrate how to inject SQL code using the `UNION SELECT` statement with the `ID` parameter:
    - `//viewarticle.asp?ID=-1%20union%20select%200,password,username,0,0,0,0%20from%20tblusers`
    - `//viewarticle.asp?ID=-1%20union%20select%200,0,username,password,0,0,0,0,0%20from%20tblusers`
