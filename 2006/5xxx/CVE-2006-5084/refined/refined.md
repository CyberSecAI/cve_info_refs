Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2006-5084:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a format string error in the `NSRunAlertPanel` function within the routines that handle Skype-specific URIs (e.g., `skype://`).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Format string vulnerability: The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input when handling URIs, leading to format string vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: A remote, unauthenticated attacker can execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system with the privileges of the user running Skype.
- Denial of service: An attacker could cause Skype to crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network: The attacker sends a specially crafted URI to Skype.
- Social engineering: The attacker needs to convince the user to view a specially crafted HTML document (e.g., a web page, an HTML email message, or attachment) that triggers the crafted URI.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker can be remote and unauthenticated.
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious URI.
- The attacker must trick the user into opening the crafted URI through a web page or other means that can cause Skype to process the URI.
