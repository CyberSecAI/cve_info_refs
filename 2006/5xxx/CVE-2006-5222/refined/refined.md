      "source": "www.exploit-db.com_f8455c35_20250125_215139.html",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a failure to properly sanitize user-supplied input passed to the `phpbb_root_path` variable, leading to a Remote File Inclusion vulnerability.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)",
        "Lack of input sanitization"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can inject arbitrary code by including a malicious remote file. This can lead to complete system compromise, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "HTTP GET request"
      ],
       "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker can be remote and needs to control a malicious script on an accessible server. The attacker needs to know the vulnerable path to the phpBB installation.",
      "details": "The vulnerability exists in `themen_portal_mitte.php` and `logger_engine.php` files of phpBB Dimension version 0.2.6 (also affects versions 0.2.5), where the `phpbb_root_path` parameter is not properly sanitized. An attacker can exploit this by crafting a URL with a malicious URL in the `phpbb_root_path` parameter."
