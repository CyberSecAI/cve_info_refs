{
  "vulnerability": {
    "cveID": "CVE-2006-5793",
    "description": "A vulnerability exists in the sPLT chunk handling code of libpng. A large sPLT chunk may cause an application to attempt to read out of bounds.",
    "rootCause": "A typo in the `png_set_sPLT()` function within the libpng library leads to incorrect memory access when handling sPLT chunks in PNG images.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could craft a malicious PNG image. When processed or viewed by an application using a vulnerable libpng library, it could cause the application to terminate abnormally (crash) due to an out-of-bounds read. This constitutes a denial-of-service (DoS).",
    "attackVectors": [
      "A remote attacker crafts a malicious PNG image."
    ],
   "requiredCapabilities": [
      "The attacker needs the ability to create and deliver a specially crafted PNG file to a target application that uses libpng."
    ],
    "additionalInformation": "The vulnerability resides in the sPLT chunk handling logic, specifically in how libpng calculates the size of the sPLT structure. A large sPLT chunk in a crafted PNG image can trigger the out-of-bounds read."
