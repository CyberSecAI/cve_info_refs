Coppermine 1.4.10 - Security release.

The development team is releasing a security update for Coppermine in order to counter a recently announced vulnerability that can lead to disclosure of sensitive information. It is important that all users update to this latest version as soon as possible.

To correct the security issue manually, you can apply a fix to picmgr.php. Please note that applying the manual fix will keep you secure, but it is not a substitute for updating your gallery fully.

Find

Code Select Expand`$aid = isset($_GET['aid']) ? ($_GET['aid']) : 0;`

Change to

Code Select Expand`$aid = isset($_GET['aid']) ? (int) $_GET['aid'] : 0;`

This issue does not affect versions of Coppermine prior to 1.4, however we encourage all users to update to this latest version.

The following issues have been addressed in this release:

* Removal of SQL injection vulnerability (as mentioned above)
* Removal of unused file include/exifReader.inc.php
* Addition of missing checks for email address validity and duplicate email addresses in profile page.
* Some minor MySQL5 issues
* Pictures awaiting approval are no longer found using the search feature.
* Corrected some issues with html entities appearing in emails
* Corrected flaw in search logic
* Added Indonesian language file (user contribution)
* Updated Brazilian language file (user contribution)
* Pagination issues corrrected
* Fix for video playback in IE

To update any version of Coppermine to version 1.4.10, [download](http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/coppermine/cpg1.4.10.zip?download) the latest version from the download page and follow the [upgrade](http://coppermine-gallery.net/demo/cpg14x/docs/index.htm#upgrade) steps in the documentation.

If you have problems with this update, please use the [Update support board](http://forum.coppermine-gallery.net/index.php?board=59.0). Do not post your issues to this announcement thread - they will be deleted without notice.

Nibbler.
Coppermine Dev Team.

hi guys
You have a terrific tool
Why not replace only the picmgr.php file from one version to the other ?

I am using ver 1.3 and cannot see the picmgr.php file.

The gallery keeps getting hacked and the web host keeps shutting it down. What should I do? If I upgrade to the newer version, does it remove all the existing images and settings etc?

This has been one big headache!

Upgrading does not affect images, and it shouldn't adversely affect core settings. It definitely does not reset the settings to default. You should still do a backup of files and database before the upgrade as a precaution.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
