[MajorSecurity Advisory #28]ConPresso CMS - Multiple XSS and SQL Injection Issues
Details
=======
Product: ConPresso CMS
Affected Version: <=4.0.4a
Immune Version: 4.0.5a
Security-Risk: moderated
Remote-Exploit: yes
Vendor-URL: http://www.conpresso.com/
Vendor-Status: informed
Advisory-Status: published
Credits
============
Discovered by: David Vieira-Kurz
http://www.majorsecurity.de
Original Advisory:
============
http://www.majorsecurity.de/index\_2.php?major\_rls=major\_rls28
Introduction
============
ConPresso CMS is a well known content management system.
More Details
============
XSS:
Input passed directly to the "nr" parameter in "detail.php", the "msg" parameter in "db\_mysql.inc.php" and the "pos" parameter in "index.php" is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user.
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site.
SQL injection:
Input passed directly to the "nr" parameter in "index.php" is not properly sanitised before being used in a SQL query.
This can be exploited to manipulate SQL queries by injecting arbitrary SQL code.
Fix
===
Upgrade to newest version(4.0.5a)
Solution
=============
Edit the source code to ensure that input is properly sanitised.
You should work with "htmlspecialchars()" or "htmlentities()" php-function to ensure that html tags
are not going to be executed. You should also work with the "mysql\_real\_escape\_string()" or "addslashes()" php-function to ensure that sql statements
can't be delivered over the "get" variables. Further it is recommend to set off the "register globals" option in the
"php.ini" on your webserver.
Example:
<?php
$pass = htmlentities($\_POST['pass']);
$test = htmlspecialchars($\_GET('test'));
$id = intval($\_POST['id']);
?>
History/Timeline
================
30.07.2006 discovery of the vulnerability
02.08.2006 additional tests with other versions
03.08.2006 contacted the vendor
04.08.2006 the vendor contacted me(response)

MajorSecurity
=======
MajorSecurity is a German penetration testing and hacking security project
which consists of only one person at the present time.
I am looking for a partnership.
