{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The AOL SuperBuddy ActiveX control does not properly validate arguments passed to the LinkSBIcons() method before dereferencing them.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Improper input validation of the address argument in the LinkSBIcons() method.",
    "Dereferencing a user-controlled address without validation.",
    "ActiveX control marked as 'safe for scripting', allowing the vulnerability to be triggered via a crafted HTML document."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote, unauthenticated attackers can execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system with the privileges of the user viewing the crafted HTML document. It may also cause Internet Explorer (or the program using the WebBrowser control) to crash.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Viewing a specially crafted HTML document (e.g., a web page, HTML email message or attachment)."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to get a user to view a specially crafted HTML document. No authentication is required."
