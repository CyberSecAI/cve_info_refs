How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# ClamAV: Multiple Vulnerabilities — GLSA **200610-10**

ClamAV is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow potentially allowing
remote execution of arbitrary code and a Denial of Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-antivirus/clamav** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.88.5** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.88.5** |

### Background

ClamAV is a GPL virus scanner.

### Description

Damian Put and an anonymous researcher reported a potential heap-based
buffer overflow vulnerability in rebuildpe.c responsible for the
rebuilding of an unpacked PE file, and a possible crash in chmunpack.c
in the CHM unpacker.

### Impact

By sending a malicious attachment to a mail server running ClamAV, or
providing a malicious file to ClamAV through any other method, a remote
attacker could cause a Denial of Service and potentially the execution
of arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running ClamAV.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All ClamAV users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-antivirus/clamav-0.88.5"
```

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : clamav
Vulnerability  : several
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2006-4182 CVE-2006-5295

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the ClamAV malware
scan engine, which may lead to the execution of arbitrary code. The
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:

CVE-2006-4182

    Damian Put discovered a heap overflow error in the script to rebuild
    PE files, which could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2006-5295

    Damian Put discovered that missing input sanitising in the CHM
    handling code might lead to denial of service.

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.84-2.sarge.11. Due to technical problems with the build host
this update lacks a build for the Sparc architecture. It will be
provided soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.88.5-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your clamav packages.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.
