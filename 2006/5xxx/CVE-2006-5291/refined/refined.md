{
  "cveId": "CVE-2006-5291",
  "description": "The 'spaw_root' parameter in Download-Engine 1.4.2 allows remote attackers to include arbitrary files via a URL in the admin/includes/spaw/spaw_control.class.php script.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input to the 'spaw_root' parameter in the spaw_control.class.php script. This allows the inclusion of a remote file.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can include and execute arbitrary code from a remote server on the vulnerable web server. This could lead to a complete compromise of the server and any data it handles, including sensitive information.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "HTTP GET request to a vulnerable script with a malicious URL in the 'spaw_root' parameter."
    ],
    "requiredCapabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application and have access to a server to host the malicious code."
  },
  "affectedProducts": [
    {
      "name": "Download-Engine",
      "version": "1.4.2"
    }
  ],
  "additionalNotes": "The provided exploit details a specific vulnerable file path (admin/includes/spaw/spaw_control.class.php) within the Download-Engine application. It specifies that only version 1.4.2 is vulnerable. The exploit URL example shows how to set the `spaw_root` parameter to include a remote file. This exploit could lead to code execution on the server."
