  "cveId": "CVE-2006-5757",
  "date": "2006-11-06",
  "description": "The ISO9660 filesystem handling code of the Linux 2.6.x kernel fails to properly handle corrupted data structures, leading to an exploitable denial of service condition. This particular vulnerability seems to be caused by a race condition and a signedness issue. When performing a read operation on a corrupted ISO9660 fs stream, the isofs_get_blocks() function will enter an infinite loop when __find_get_block_slow() callback from sb_getblk() fails (\u201cdue to various races between file io on the block device and getblk\u201d).",
  "affectedSoftware": [
    {
      "name": "Linux Kernel",
      "version": "2.6.x"
    }
  ],
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "The vulnerability stems from the `__getblk_slow` function within the Linux kernel's block device handling. This function contains an infinite loop that can be triggered when a block device requests a block that is not mapped to any buffer pages, particularly in conjunction with a malformed ISO9660 filesystem image.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Infinite loop vulnerability in `__getblk_slow` function",
      "Improper block mapping in the `grow_buffers` function.",
      "Use of a 32 bit index to represent a 64 bit block value leading to truncation.",
        "Lack of proper input validation/sanitization while mounting a malformed ISO9660 image."
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker can mount a specially crafted ISO9660 or NTFS file system, leading to an infinite loop in the kernel, which renders the machine unusable, resulting in a denial of service.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Mounting a specially crafted ISO9660 or NTFS file system"
    ],
     "requiredCapabilities": [
      "Local access to the system with the ability to mount file systems"
     ]
  },
    "additionalDetails": [
    "The race condition occurs in function __getblk() when processing a block with a block number more than 4G and not to be mapped to buffer pages (__find_get_block will return NULL).",
    "The grow_buffers() function is responsible for construct the relationships among page, buffer_head and block. On the 32-bit platform, the length of block and index are 64-bit and 32-bit respectively. After the operations at line 1201 and 1202, the high 32 bits of block will lost. Consequently, when the block number is beyond 4G, new block number would be differently with the original.",
    "The vulnerability can be triggered by mounting a malformed Reiser filesystem image.",
      "The endless for loop only has an exit point (at line 1213) which terminates when __find_get_block return a non-NULL value. If the block is not mapped to buffer pages, the first __find_get_block calling will return a NULL bh and the function grow_buffers() will be called subsequently."
