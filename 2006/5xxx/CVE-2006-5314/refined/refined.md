Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2006-5314:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) issue. The `ftag.php` script in TribunaLibre v3.12 Beta directly includes a file specified in the `$_GET['mostrar']` parameter without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unsanitized Input:** The script directly includes the file path provided in the `mostrar` GET parameter. This allows attackers to include files from remote locations.
*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The ability to include files from a remote source opens up the possibility of injecting malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious PHP file from a remote server, an attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the vulnerable server.
*   **Data compromise:** An attacker can potentially gain access to sensitive data or compromise the server hosting the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is carried out by crafting a malicious HTTP GET request that targets the vulnerable `ftag.php` script with a malicious URL as the `mostrar` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable server.
*   **Basic HTTP Request knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to craft an HTTP GET request.
