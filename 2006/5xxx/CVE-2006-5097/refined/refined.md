Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from a potential Remote File Inclusion (RFI) issue in older versions of net2ftp (specifically versions before 0.7). The issue revolves around how the `$application_rootdir` variable was used in `index.php` to include other files, particularly `browse.inc.php`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** In older versions, `index.php` uses code similar to `require_once($application_rootdir . "/includes/browse.inc.php");`. If an attacker could control the `$application_rootdir` variable, they could include arbitrary remote files, potentially executing malicious code on the server.

- **Variable Manipulation (Hypothesized):** While the `$application_rootdir` variable was defined in `settings.inc.php` (which is included before the vulnerable line in `index.php`), there is an unconfirmed possibility that an attacker might have been able to manipulate or overwrite the variable using a yet-unidentified PHP behavior, a bug in PHP itself, or by a vulnerability in the net2ftp code that is not obvious from the provided excerpts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation would allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server by including a malicious remote file, leading to full system compromise.
- **Data Breach:** An attacker could gain access to sensitive information stored on the server, potentially including database credentials or user data.
- **Website Defacement:** Attackers might manipulate the website contents by including malicious files that modifies pages on the website

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Direct File Inclusion:** The primary attack vector involves manipulating the `$application_rootdir` variable to include a file hosted on an attacker-controlled server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable net2ftp server.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Versions:** The attacker needs to target older versions of net2ftp prior to 0.7 (0.62 and below specifically mentioned).
- **Ability to Manipulate `application_rootdir` (Hypothesized):** The main challenge, and the core of the dispute, is whether an attacker can manipulate the `$application_rootdir` variable despite it being defined in `settings.inc.php`. This is not demonstrated explicitly but is suspected by the researchers. The method or techniques to achieve this is not disclosed.

**Additional Notes:**

- **Vendor Acknowledgment:** The vendor appears to have acknowledged that older versions of net2ftp were vulnerable to RFI by indicating that they don't use the $application_rootdir anymore. This was mentioned in a forum post, linking to discussion in the mailing list messages, although a clear confirmation that the issue was due to the RFI is not provided.
- **Mitigation:** Newer versions of net2ftp (0.7 and later) no longer use the `$application_rootdir` variable for file inclusion, thus addressing the vulnerability.

The provided information highlights a potential remote file inclusion vulnerability in older versions of net2ftp, although a clear understanding of how attackers could successfully manipulate `$application_rootdir` is not fully explained.
