CVE dispute, but with a little more detail than "there's no issue."

File this under the growing collection of "really bad research or really
obscure PHP bug".

You are probably looking at recent versions, which don't have the
affected code at all.

The statements as quoted by the original researcher *do* appear in
versions of net2ftp before 0.7:

./net2ftp_v0.1/index.php:require_once($application_rootdir . "/includes/browse.inc.php");
./net2ftp_v0.2/index.php:require_once($application_rootdir . "/includes/browse.inc.php");
./net2ftp_v0.3/index.php:require_once($application_rootdir . "/includes/browse.inc.php");
./net2ftp_v0.4/index.php:require_once($application_rootdir . "/includes/browse.inc.php");
./net2ftp_v0.6/index.php:require_once($application_rootdir . "/includes/browse.inc.php");
./net2ftp_v0.62/index.php:require_once($application_rootdir . "/includes/browse.inc.php");
./net2ftp_v0.61/index.php:require_once($application_rootdir . "/includes/browse.inc.php");
./net2ftp_v0.7/index.php:require_once("./includes/browse.inc.php");

Notice how 0.7 doesn't use $application_rootdir.

For these older versions, we need to figure out where
$application_rootdir came from and if it's controlled by the attacker
at all.

In net2ftp_v0.62, settings.inc.php is included by index.php before
$application_rootdir, and settings.inc.php has:

  $application_rootdir = dirname(__FILE__);

So, $application_rootdir should already be defined.

In 0.1, settings.inc.php has:

  $server_rootdir = "/var/www/php/net2ftp";   // <-- The directory in which the net2ftp application files reside
  ...
  $application_extension = "";                // (Do not use this, it is only for development purposes)
  ...
  $application_rootdir = $server_rootdir . $application_extension;

So, $application_rootdir is defined in 0.1, too.

Given the large number of reports like this, it's not clear whether a
bunch of researchers are making erroneous grep-and-gripe claims
without checking their work, or if there's some obscure PHP scoping
bug that somehow allows variables to be overwritten in weird ways.  I
haven't completely ruled out the latter but don't have any hard proof,
either.

Just to make the plot thicker:

  <http://www.net2ftp.org/forums/viewtopic.php?pid=6687>

The vendor says "These reports are based on net2ftp versions 0.60 to 0.62,
which were released more than 3 years ago, in May-July 2003.
The newer versions of net2ftp are not vulnerable to a remote file
inclusion."

Then the code for admin/index.php (not the original index.php) is
apparently listed.

It's not clear whether the vendor is actually acknowledging the issue, or
just saying "the newer versions don't have it."

I sucked it up, registered, and posted the following inquiry:

  Hello, I am the lead for the CVE vulnerability project.  We assigned
  CVE-2006-5097 to this issue.

  Isn't $application_rootdir already defined in "settings.inc.php", which
  is included by index.php?  So how could an attacker actually modify
  $application_rootdir ?  It's not clear to me where the vulnerability is.
