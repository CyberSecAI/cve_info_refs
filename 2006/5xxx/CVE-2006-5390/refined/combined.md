##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

Which means I am doing a bad job of explaining it.

It started with the fact that in the line of the screen asking a questions I see:

: (and then a long blank space to ) Yes No

There is no question to answer "Yes No" to.

In addition everything I see on the screen is as follows all in the proper box of course and spaced correctly:

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Registration Information

Items marked with a \* are required unless stated otherwise.

Username: \* (BOX)

E-mail address: \* (BOX)

Password: \* (BOX)

Confirm password: \* (BOX)

: Yes No

Submit Reset

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Should there be additional things I am missing - Advanced for example.

Sorry to be such a bother - but this is all new to me although I am a very experienced computer user - but not coding (which I have always hated).

All I see is the Registration Box, four boxes to fill in "Username", "Email address", "Passord", "Confirm password" There is nothing on Utilities, Bannings, etc. . Nothing more than the Yes no above.

He said that looked correct but it didn't work right for me until I removed 1 of the 2 "empty" spaces.

Now I'm lost too I just know where it said the 2 empty spaces had to be there , it didn't work right until I removed one of them. I don't know about adding all those spaces. I just remember following the exact instructions left 2 empty spaces and it didn't work right until I removed 1 of them with current version of MOD and current version of phpBB. Maybe there is something else wrong.

Maybe if you put everything back to original and started over you will find what went wrong as you apply it again. Maybe its a whole differnet thing. I don't have the MOD in front of me so I'm not sure.

Got it - very dumb me.

Where the directions under add said be sure the two spaces were there - well I did that

BUT

I forgot to add the rest of the MOD language.

Now up and running and feel really bad about taking every ones time.

I love it!!! Now id I could only add multiple users here at once.

Also, is it possible to make email an optional field in this mod? The ACP is the only place where registrations are made, so it wouldn't have to me changed elsewhere.

I have just installed this MOD and it works a treat. However, I would like to modify the wording of the automated email it sends out to the new user...

I which file do I find this text?

Cheers,

Phil.

Okay, turns out that Graham's insert\_user class (which is built into this MOD) has had some security issues. He just posted an update about an hour and a half ago, and now the MOD Team is hitting up on me to fix this MOD because of the security blegh.

Therefore, just to get everyone to stop sending me private messages, I will be generating a release of ACP User Registration 1.0.1, which will be submitted to the MOD Database. The only change will be this fix, because I've abandoned this MOD, however I'm making a **one-time** exception for this fix.

If you want, you can fix this by [downloading this MOD](http://www.phpbb.com/phpBB/viewtopic.php?t=456634). Unzip it, and then copy functions\_mod\_user.php to includes/functions\_mod\_user.php, overwriting the previous one.

**As stated above, this vuln only affects you if you are on a server with register\_globals enabled. If register\_globals is on, this vulnerability IS serious and you should do this step immediately! If register\_globals for you is off, then this update is OPTIONAL, and there is no security risk on your board.**

So, there you go, straight out of the exhausted cat's mouth. Next time there's a Saturday the 14th, I'm going to turn off my computer for the day and go mini-golfing. ![:D](./images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif "Very Happy")

Being remotely familiar with the MOD Team's policies, this MOD was only validated this quickly because of the big security thing (and also because I didn't change anything else).

Thank you, thank you, thank you for this MOD. Makes my business soooo much easier. Actually, this MOD should be part of the vanilla phpBB install - it makes too much sense.

I am also curious which file I must access to edit the text sent out in emails.
