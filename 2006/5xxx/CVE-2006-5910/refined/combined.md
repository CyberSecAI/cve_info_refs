## [Run Your Internet Radio Station With Campcaster](https://www.campware.org/en/camp/campcaster_news/818/)

Campcaster can be an excellent system for managing your internet radio broadcasts, but it doesn’t handle Internet streams itself. You will need a couple of other tools as well to make everything work as you wish. Those streaming tools can be a bit technical, but the good news is that once they’re up and running, they’re quite stable, so it makes it well worth the effort. Read on for more information.

### Testimonials

“Campsite is our first choice for publishing magazines on the web. Our youth magazine fluter.de has been running on Campsite since 2001. Ever since, we could rely on it`s stability and have been impressed with the ongoing development of new features over the years. Most noticably, the automated publishing scheduler – which buys us a lot of spare time while pre-produced material is automatically going online.” [casino en español](https://es.twin.com/)
