      Advisory: XeoPort <= 0.81 SQL Injection Vulnerability
  Release Date: 10/12/2006
 Last Modified: 10/12/2006
        Author: Tamriel [tamriel at gmx dot net]
   Application: XeoPort <= 0.81
          Risk: Moderate
 Vendor Status: not contacted
   Vendor Site: [www.xeoman.com](http://www.xeoman.com) | [www.xeoman.de](http://www.xeoman.de)

 Overview:

   Quote from [www.xeoman.de:](http://www.xeoman.de:)

  "XeoPort imports emails from an IMAP or POP3 server into
   your MySQL database. The text part and/ or the entire message
   will be imported. An elegant way for Outlook Express users
   (like me) to extract messages from Microsofts proprietary
   binary format. I tried Access via Outlook but it turned out
   to be buggy all the way. The additional script show.php
   (folder goodie) uses Outlook Express to display the entire
   message if you want to get your hands on attached files. It
   can be used to dump the entire MySQL database back into Outlook
   Express messages providing kind of a backup."

      There are is a SQL injection vulnerability which can be
      exploited by malicious people to conduct SQL injection attacks.

      The vulnerability has been discovered in the latest version,
      0.81. Other versions may also be affected.

 Details:

      SQL Injection in index.php

      The Input `$xp_body_text` parameter isn't properly sanitised
      before being used in a SQL query.

      An attacker must send an Email with 7bit encoding to perform
      this attack.

      Some other variables may also be affected.

 Proof of Concept:

      Not needed

 Solution/Fix:

      You must have register_globals enabled to run this script,
      disable it and edit the source code to ensure that input is
      properly sanitised and change all input variables.

      Use functions like PHP's htmlentities() and
      mysql_real_escape_string() functions.
