Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause of the vulnerability is a lack of proper input sanitization in the `giris_yap.asp` file of the Emek Portal v2.1 script.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, specifically a login bypass vulnerability. The application does not properly sanitize user input before using it in an SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** By injecting SQL code into the username and password fields, an attacker can bypass the authentication mechanism and gain unauthorized access to the admin panel.
*   **Partial Confidentiality Impact:** The attacker can potentially access sensitive information stored in the database.
*   **Partial Integrity Impact:** The attacker could potentially modify data within the database.
*  **Partial Availability Impact:** A successful SQL injection could lead to the application becoming unavailable if the database is disrupted.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via HTTP requests to the login page (`uyegiris.asp`).
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker submits a crafted HTTP POST request to the login form with malicious SQL code in the username and password fields.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application's web server.
*   **No Special Privileges Required:**  No prior authentication is needed to exploit the SQL injection vulnerability on the login page.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerable file:** Attacker needs to know the location of the vulnerable file and it's login form, ie. `uyegiris.asp`
*   **Basic SQL Injection knowledge:** Attacker needs to know basic SQL injection syntax to craft the payload.

**Technical Details:**

*   The provided manual and remote attack vectors demonstrate how to exploit the vulnerability using the SQL injection payload `'or'` in both the username and password fields. This payload bypasses the authentication check by creating a condition that is always true.
*   The vulnerable file is `giris_yap.asp`.
*   The exploit uses a simple `'or'` SQL injection to bypass authentication.
