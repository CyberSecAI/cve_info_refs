```
- Root cause of vulnerability: A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the der_get_oid() function of the mod_auth_kerb module. The component array allocated within the function is not large enough to handle all possible encodings, leading to a write past the end of the allocated array. Specifically, the code allocates `len * sizeof(*data->components)` bytes but `len` is the number of bytes, not the number of components which can be > len due to multiple components being encoded in a single byte.

- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Heap-based buffer overflow due to insufficient memory allocation, triggered by an improperly formed Kerberos message.

- Impact of exploitation: An attacker could trigger an application crash, leading to a denial of service. Although the provided text indicates no known code execution, the possibility of arbitrary code execution should not be excluded.

- Attack vectors: Sending a specially crafted Kerberos message to an Apache server protected by Kerberos authentication, specifically with an incorrect service principal.

- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to initiate a Kerberos authentication request to a vulnerable server. This could be from a client machine trying to access a resource behind an Apache server using the affected module, or through a manipulated or malicious Kerberos ticket.
