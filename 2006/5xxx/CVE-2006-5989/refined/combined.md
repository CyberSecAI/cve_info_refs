| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=206736#c0)  Kevin Unthank    2006-09-15 22:49:48 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  I successfully got krb5-libs-1.5-7.pal.0.0.4.i386.rpm libs authenticating to a windows 2003 active directory kerberos server with certificates read from a smartcard  I was then trying to setup kerberos auth with apache on a system running fc6test2.  Using mod_auth_kerb-5.0-10 for the server and  krb5-libs-1.5-7.pal.0.0.4.i386.rpm for the client  Intially when I tried the access the kerberos protected page apache displayed an error page complaining that I didn't have the  correct servie principal so I fix that by using samba  net ads keytab add HTTP/fqdn@REALM  The webserver now shows a blank page. /var/log/httpd/errors reports exit signal Segmentation fault (11)   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=206736#c1)  Nalin Dahyabhai    2006-09-19 15:36:04 UTC  ``` This looks like a buffer overrun in der_get_oid().  There are two components encoded in the first byte, but the length of the component array allocated is only the same as the number of bytes.  If there are no components which require more than one byte for encoding, then we'll write past the end of the allocated array every time.  Attaching a patch.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=206736#c2)  Nalin Dahyabhai    2006-09-19 15:36:36 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 136650](attachment.cgi?id=136650&action=diff "patch to allocate enough memory") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=136650&action=edit "patch to allocate enough memory") patch to allocate enough memory   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=206736#c3)  Joe Orton    2006-09-19 16:45:08 UTC  ``` Can you test with mod_auth_kerb-5.1-2 from fc6-HEAD?  This completely removes the SPNEGO-parsing code if built against krb5-1.4.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=206736#c4)  Nalin Dahyabhai    2006-09-19 20:31:50 UTC  ``` 5.1-2 also looks to work correctly.  Thanks!   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=206736#c5)  Joe Orton    2006-09-20 15:40:00 UTC  ``` Thanks a lot Nalin.  5.1-2 is moved to dist-fc6 so should get pulled in to -5E.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=206736#c6)  Jay Turner    2006-09-22 05:57:43 UTC  ``` That version of mod_auth_kerb isn't built into a RHEL5 tree as of yet so reopening (closed/rawhide isn't a valid state for RHEL bugs in the first place.)   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=206736#c7)  Jay Turner    2006-10-02 18:36:44 UTC  ``` [jkt@cobalt 4.91]$ find . -name "mod_auth_kerb*" -print ./i386/os/Server/mod_auth_kerb-5.1-2.i386.rpm ./i386/debug/mod_auth_kerb-debuginfo-5.1-2.i386.rpm ./ppc/os/Server/mod_auth_kerb-5.1-2.ppc.rpm ./ppc/debug/mod_auth_kerb-debuginfo-5.1-2.ppc.rpm ./x86_64/os/Server/mod_auth_kerb-5.1-2.x86_64.rpm ./x86_64/debug/mod_auth_kerb-debuginfo-5.1-2.x86_64.rpm ./s390x/os/Server/mod_auth_kerb-5.1-2.s390x.rpm ./s390x/debug/mod_auth_kerb-debuginfo-5.1-2.s390x.rpm ./ia64/os/Server/mod_auth_kerb-5.1-2.ia64.rpm ./ia64/debug/mod_auth_kerb-debuginfo-5.1-2.ia64.rpm ./source/SRPMS/mod_auth_kerb-5.1-2.src.rpm [jkt@cobalt 4.91]$ pwd /mnt/redhat/rel-eng/RHEL5-Server-20060927.0/4.91    ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : libapache-mod-auth-kerb
Vulnerability  : heap overflow
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2006-5989
BugTraq ID     : 21214
Debian Bug     : 400589

An off-by-one error leading to a heap-based buffer overflow has been
identified in libapache-mod-auth-kerb, an Apache module for Kerberos
authentication.  The error could allow an attacker to trigger an
application crash or potentially execute arbitrary code by sending a
specially crafted kerberos message.

For the stable distribution (sarge), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.996-5.0-rc6-1sarge1.

For the unstable version (sid) and the forthcoming stable version
(etch), this problem has been fixed in version 5.3-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your libapache-mod-auth-kerb package.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Mod\_auth\_kerb: Denial of service — GLSA **200701-14**

Mod\_auth\_kerb is vulnerable to a buffer overflow possibly allowing a Denial
of Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-apache/mod\_auth\_kerb** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **5.0\_rc7-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **5.0\_rc7-r1** |

### Background

Mod\_auth\_kerb is an Apache authentication module using Kerberos.

### Description

Mod\_auth\_kerb improperly handles component byte encoding in the
der\_get\_oid() function, allowing for a buffer overflow to occur if
there are no components which require more than one byte for encoding.

### Impact

An attacker could try to access a Kerberos protected resource on an
Apache server with an incorrectly configured service principal and
crash the server process. It is important to note that this buffer
overflow is not known to allow for the execution of code.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All mod\_auth\_kerb users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apache/mod_auth_kerb-5.0_rc7-r1"
```
