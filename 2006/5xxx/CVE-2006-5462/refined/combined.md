## Topic

Updated firefox packages that fix several security bugs are now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

Mozilla Firefox is an open source Web browser.

Several flaws were found in the way Firefox processes certain malformed
Javascript code. A malicious web page could cause the execution of
Javascript code in such a way that could cause Firefox to crash or execute
arbitrary code as the user running Firefox. (CVE-2006-5463, CVE-2006-5747,
CVE-2006-5748)

Several flaws were found in the way Firefox renders web pages. A malicious
web page could cause the browser to crash or possibly execute arbitrary
code as the user running Firefox. (CVE-2006-5464)

A flaw was found in the way Firefox verifies RSA signatures. For RSA keys
with exponent 3 it is possible for an attacker to forge a signature that
would be incorrectly verified by the NSS library. Firefox as shipped trusts
several root Certificate Authorities that use exponent 3. An attacker could
have created a carefully crafted SSL certificate which be incorrectly
trusted when their site was visited by a victim. This flaw was previously
thought to be fixed in Firefox 1.5.0.7, however Ulrich Kuehn discovered the
fix was incomplete (CVE-2006-5462)

Users of Firefox are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages, which
contain Firefox version 1.5.0.8 that corrects these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

Several security related problems have been discovered in Mozilla and
derived products such as Mozilla Thunderbird.  The Common Vulnerabilities
and Exposures project identifies the following vulnerabilities:

CVE-2006-4310

    Tomas Kempinsky discovered that malformed FTP server responses
    could lead to denial of service.

CVE-2006-5462

    Ulrich Kühn discovered that the correction for a cryptographic
    flaw in the handling of PKCS-1 certificates was incomplete, which
    allows the forgery of certificates.

CVE-2006-5463

    "shutdown" discovered that modification of JavaScript objects
    during execution could lead to the execution of arbitrary
    JavaScript bytecode.

CVE-2006-5464

    Jesse Ruderman and Martijn Wargers discovered several crashes in
    the layout engine, which might also allow execution of arbitrary
    code.

CVE-2006-5748

    Igor Bukanov and Jesse Ruderman discovered several crashes in the
    JavaScript engine, which might allow execution of arbitrary code.

This update also adresses several crashes, which could be triggered by
malicious websites and fixes a regression introduced in the previous
Mozilla update.

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.4-2sarge13.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
the current icedove package 1.5.0.8.

We recommend that you upgrade your mozilla-thunderbird package.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Topic

Updated seamonkey packages that fix several security bugs are now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1, 3, and 4.

This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

SeaMonkey is an open source Web browser, advanced email and newsgroup
client, IRC chat client, and HTML editor.

Several flaws were found in the way SeaMonkey processes certain malformed
Javascript code. A malicious web page could cause the execution of
Javascript code in such a way that could cause SeaMonkey to crash or
execute arbitrary code as the user running SeaMonkey. (CVE-2006-5463,
CVE-2006-5747, CVE-2006-5748)

Several flaws were found in the way SeaMonkey renders web pages. A
malicious web page could cause the browser to crash or possibly execute
arbitrary code as the user running SeaMonkey. (CVE-2006-5464)

A flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey verifies RSA signatures. For RSA keys
with exponent 3 it is possible for an attacker to forge a signature that
would be incorrectly verified by the NSS library. SeaMonkey as shipped
trusts several root Certificate Authorities that use exponent 3. An
attacker could have created a carefully crafted SSL certificate which be
incorrectly trusted when their site was visited by a victim. This flaw was
previously thought to be fixed in SeaMonkey 1.0.5, however Ulrich Kuehn
discovered the fix was incomplete (CVE-2006-5462)

Users of SeaMonkey are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages, which
contains SeaMonkey version 1.0.6 that corrects these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## The Mozilla Network Security Services library fails to properly verify RSA signatures

#### Vulnerability Note VU#335392

Original Release Date: 2006-11-08 | Last Revised: 2007-01-23

---

### Overview

The Mozilla Network Security Services library fails to properly verify RSA signatures. This vulnerability may allow an attacker to forge RSA signatures.

### Description

| RSA signatures are used to authenticate the source of a message. To prevent RSA signatures from being forged, messages are padded with data to ensure message hashes are adequately sized. The Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS) library fails to properly verify the padding in RSA signatures, ignoring data at the end of a signature. If this data is ignored and an RSA key with a public exponent of three is used, it may be possible to forge the signing key's signature.  For more information refer to Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory [2006-66](http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2006/mfsa2006-66.html).This vulnerability may affect any application that uses the Mozilla NSS librbary, including SSL/TLS and email certificates. |
| --- |

### Impact

| This vulnerability may allow an attacker to forge an RSA signature. |

| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=356215#c0)• 18 years ago |

security@mozilla.org received the following from Ulrich Kuehn:
Dear Security Group,
I've found an implementation bug in handling a certain RSA signature
padding format that allows a man-in-the-middle attack on SSL and TLS
connections under certain circumstances. I'll go into details below.
The bug seems to be present in versions 1.5.0.7 and earlier of firefox
and potentially of other mozilla software that uses the nss subsystem.
I noticed that the problem is resolved in the firefox 2.0 since beta 1
(on the ftp server marked as of Aug 29, 2006).
However, I ask you to backport a patch to the current version 1.5.0.7 as
I believe that users should not be forced to do a major version upgrade
due to a security bug that could easily be fixed. And the fix is really
easy, see attached diff. Maybe the maintainer updating the code did not
notice that this seemingly small bug has some severe consequences?
Now for the technical details. This bug is somewhat related on a
mathematical level to the recent bug that Daniel Bleichenbacher found
for PKCS#1 signature verification. Nevertheless, it does not involve any
ASN.1 parsing.
The problem is in security/nss/lib/softoken/rsawrapr.c, function
RSA\_CheckSign():
/\*
\* check the padding that was used
\*/
if (buffer[0] != 0 || buffer[1] != 1)
goto loser;
for (i = 2; i < modulus\_len - hash\_len - 1; i++) {
if (buffer[i] == 0)
break;
if (buffer[i] != 0xff)
goto loser;
}
/\*
\* make sure we get the same results
\*/
if (PORT\_Memcmp(buffer + modulus\_len - hash\_len, hash, hash\_len) != 0)
goto loser;
This code runs over the PKCS#1 padding, but would accept an early 0
byte, so that a padding of
00 || 01 || 00 || g || hash
with any garbage in g, provided g is long enough to put the hash into
the correct place for the following memcmp. A word of acknowledgement is
due here, this code was independently found by Hal Finney, however, the
consequences seem not be known to him (see
[http://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography@metzdowd.com/msg06693.html](http://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography%40metzdowd.com/msg06693.html))
Producing a fake signature, i.e. a non-signature that is nevertheless
accepted by this code, is rather easy when an RSA exponent 3 is used for
usual key lengths (potentially also some larger exponents with longer
keys), as the unchecked part provides enough play ground for an
adversary. If you are interested I could provide some more detail here
on the mathematics. The key point is that with exponent 3 you can use
computing 3rd roots over the real numbers, not modulo N, the RSA
modulus. The former is easy, while the hardness of the latter is the
usual security assumption for RSA.
So basically, when a certificate uses exponent 3, we can produce a fake
signature that is accepted by this code.
Here is how to exploit that. The function RSA\_CheckSign() is called
during SSL/TLS connection setup when the server sends a
serverkeyexchange message. This message contains new keys to be used by
the client for exchange of the premaster secret. The keys are signed by
the key in the server certificate. For validation the firefox client
computes the md5||sha1 combined hash of the key parameters (plus the
public random bytes) and checks that against the signature of the
server, using the RSA\_CheckSign() function.
So a man-in-the-middle attack is easy when a site uses a certificate
containing an RSA key with exponent 3: the adversary sends the
certificate (he does not have the private key!) and then also sends a
serverkeyexchange message, containing the fake signature. This can
easily be produced only, the computation is quick.
So basically the certificate chain can be exploited to make the client
believe it is connected to the original server, while it is not.
Phishing etc. is easy now.
If you have any further questions please do not hesitate to contact me.
Attached you will find my gpg key, and a diff of the relevant portion of
1.5.0.7 against 2.0b1 which fixes the problem. Please seriously consider
providing a patch for 1.5.0.7.
With best regards,
Ulrich Kuehn

This appears to be due to [bug 330114](/show_bug.cgi?id=330114 "RESOLVED FIXED - RSA_CheckSign does not check the length of padding string PS") not landing on the 1.8.0 branch (the patch here is the same as [attachment 214758](/attachment.cgi?id=214758 "Proposed patch") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=214758&action=edit "Proposed patch") [[diff]](/attachment.cgi?id=214758&action=diff "Proposed patch") [[review]](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=330114&attachment=214758)). Anyone supporting the aviary/1.7 branches will also want this fix.
Any other similar NSS 3.11 fixes we need to pull back to the 1.8.0 branch?Flags: blocking1.8.0.8+Flags: blocking1.7.14+Flags: blocking-aviary1.0.9+Summary: Firefox 1.5.0.7 RSA signature forgery bug (still) → Firefox 1.5.0.7 RSA signature forgery -- unchecked padding lengthWhiteboard: [sg:critical] dupe bug 330114

Yeah, when [bug 330114](/show_bug.cgi?id=330114 "RESOLVED FIXED - RSA_CheckSign does not check the length of padding string PS") was written, the problem appeared to be a correctness issue, not a security issue. We should pick up the complete patch [attachment 214932](/attachment.cgi?id=214932 "Correct hash length check") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=214932&action=edit "Correct hash length check") [[diff]](/attachment.cgi?id=214932&action=diff "Correct hash length check") [[review]](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=330114&attachment=214932). It has additional correctness fixes (so we aren't blind-sided when correctness again equals security;). Both patches are for version 1.8 of rsawrapper.c, so there should be no problem picking either of them up for the mozilla 1.8.0.x branch.
The code in question is used in ssl signature checks, (not certificate or s/mime signature checks). In a normal RSA ssl handshake there are no signatures checks, but it's possible to force the client to use a new key by sending a server key exchange message [this is used in the old 'stepdown' protocol].
Nelson, would the ssl/tls protocol allow us to reject server key exchange messages when we are doing RSA and not expecting to step down? or do we already do this? (in which case turning export ciphers off will completely defeat this attack).
One final note: This attack is only possible if the server is using an exponent of '3'. This is already considered weak as the RSA server key is used for key exchange and there are known weaknesses in small exponents and key exchange.

I think it's time for the NSS team to get "tough" again, regarding the
subject of whether or not it supports branches that other groups create.
Our message to other groups in the past has been: "Use the tags we create
for you, or else support your own NSS branch all by yourself."
Others have created branches, and have made their own choices about the
contents of those branches, resulting in the present situation and this bug.
The NSS group is now forced to maintain those other branches in addition to
the NSS group's own official supported ones. This needs correction.
One more thing: there are 2 patches attached to [bug 330114](/show_bug.cgi?id=330114 "RESOLVED FIXED - RSA_CheckSign does not check the length of padding string PS").
Don't take just one. Take both.

Comment on [attachment 242309](/attachment.cgi?id=242309 "Proposed patch for the NSS 3.10.3 release") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=242309&action=edit "Proposed patch for the NSS 3.10.3 release") [[diff]](/attachment.cgi?id=242309&action=diff "Proposed patch for the NSS 3.10.3 release") [[review]](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=356215&attachment=242309)
Proposed patch for the NSS 3.10.3 release
Wan-Teh, Here is my understanding of my team's position on this request.
NSS 3.11.3 is backwards binary compatible with NSS 3.9.x and 3.10.x.
Users of those older NSS releases (and older products that use NSS) who
desire to avail themselves of the latest vulnerability fixes must use
the latest NSS release to replace their older ones, rather than expecting
(Sun's) NSS team to cherry pick fixes to older branches. Sun itself has
made NSS 3.11.3 available for numerous older products that use NSS.
If other "down stream" products refuse to take NSS 3.11.3, and want to
cherry pick fixes for their own branches, they are at liberty to do so
but they incur all support costs from that decision.

## Synopsis

Critical: firefox security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Critical

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2006%3A0733)

## Topic

Updated firefox packages that fix several security bugs are now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

Mozilla Firefox is an open source Web browser.

Several flaws were found in the way Firefox processes certain malformed
Javascript code. A malicious web page could cause the execution of
Javascript code in such a way that could cause Firefox to crash or execute
arbitrary code as the user running Firefox. (CVE-2006-5463, CVE-2006-5747,
CVE-2006-5748)

Several flaws were found in the way Firefox renders web pages. A malicious
web page could cause the browser to crash or possibly execute arbitrary
code as the user running Firefox. (CVE-2006-5464)

A flaw was found in the way Firefox verifies RSA signatures. For RSA keys
with exponent 3 it is possible for an attacker to forge a signature that
would be incorrectly verified by the NSS library. Firefox as shipped trusts
several root Certificate Authorities that use exponent 3. An attacker could
have created a carefully crafted SSL certificate which be incorrectly
trusted when their site was visited by a victim. This flaw was previously
thought to be fixed in Firefox 1.5.0.7, however Ulrich Kuehn discovered the
fix was incomplete (CVE-2006-5462)

Users of Firefox are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages, which
contain Firefox version 1.5.0.8 that corrects these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

Ulrich Kuehn reported that Firefox 1.5.0.7, which incorporated NSS version      3.10.2, was incompletely patched and remained vulnerable to a variant of      this attack.  mfsa2006-67 [CVE-2006-5463](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-5463)  impact=moderate,reported=20061107,public=20061107,source=mozilla      shutdown demonstrated that it was possible to modify a Script object while      it was executing, potentially leading to the execution of arbitrary      JavaScript bytecode.  mfsa2006-65      As part of the Firefox 1.5.0.8 release we fixed several bugs to improve the      stability of the product.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2006-66

## RSA Signature Forgery (variant)

Announced
November 7, 2006
Reporter
Ulrich Kuehn
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox 1.5.0.8
* SeaMonkey 1.0.6
* Thunderbird 1.5.0.8

### Description

MFSA 2006-60 reported that RSA digital signatures with a low exponent
(typically 3) could be forged. This flaw was corrected in the
Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS) library version 3.11.3 used
by Firefox 2.0 and current development versions of Mozilla clients.

**Ulrich Kuehn** reported that Firefox 1.5.0.7, which incorporated
NSS version 3.10.2, was incompletely patched and remained vulnerable
to a variant of this attack.

### Workaround

None, upgrade to a fixed version.

# SeaMonkey: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200612-08**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been identified in the SeaMonkey project.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-client/seamonkey** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.0.6** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.0.6** |

### Background

The SeaMonkey project is a community effort to deliver
production-quality releases of code derived from the application
formerly known as 'Mozilla Application Suite'.

### Description

The SeaMonkey project is vulnerable to arbitrary JavaScript bytecode
execution and arbitrary code execution.

### Impact

An attacker could entice a user to load malicious JavaScript or a
malicious web page with a SeaMonkey application and execute arbitrary
code with the rights of the user running those products. It is
important to note that in the SeaMonkey email client, JavaScript is
disabled by default.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All SeaMonkey users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/seamonkey-1.0.6"
```

## 1. Overview:

Firefox is a popular open source Web browser.

Firefox was found to contain vulnerabilities in how it processed
select types
of malformed Javascript code. An attacker could possibly take
advantage of
this when Firefox viewed a malicious web page, possibly causing
Firefox to
crash or execute arbitrary code as the user running Firefox. The
Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned
the names
[CVE-2006-5463](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-5463),
[CVE-2006-5747](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-5747), and
[CVE-2006-5748](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-5748) to these issues.

The parsing engine for Firefox was discovered to contain numerous
parsing
flaws when processing web pages, which could lead to Firefox crashing
or
executing arbitrary code as the user running Firefox. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned
the name
[CVE-2006-5464](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-5464) to this issue.

The previous fix put into Firefox for verifying RSA signatures when
the RSA
key had an exponent of 3 was found to be incomplete. This allowed
for
Firefox to potentially believe that a website's SSL certificate was
signed
by a Certificate Authority that it wasn't. The Common
Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2006-5462](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-5462) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the
security

**Recommended Actions:**
For all system products which use
vulnerable
versions of Firefox, Avaya recommends that customers restrict local
and
network access to the server. This restriction should be enforced
through the
use of physical security, firewalls, ACLs, VPNs, and other
generally-accepted
networking practices until such time as an update becomes available
and can
be installed.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating
systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying
operating
system or applications that come with the operating system. These
vulnerabilities often do not impact the software-only product
directly but
may threaten the integrity of the underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not
affected by
the vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be.
Customers should determine on which Linux operating system the
product was
installed and then follow that vendors guidance.

| --- | --- | --- | --- |

| Avaya Integrated Management Suite(IMS) | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. The IMS application does not require the software described in this advisory. |

**Recommended Actions:**
Avaya recommends that customers follow
recommended actions supplied by RedHat Linux or remove the affected
package.

## Topic

Updated thunderbird packages that fix several security bugs are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

Mozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client.

Several flaws were found in the way Thunderbird processes certain malformed
Javascript code. A malicious HTML mail message could cause the execution of
Javascript code in such a way that could cause Thunderbird to crash or
execute arbitrary code as the user running Thunderbird. (CVE-2006-5463,
CVE-2006-5747, CVE-2006-5748)

Several flaws were found in the way Thunderbird renders HTML mail messages.
A malicious HTML mail message could cause the mail client to crash or
possibly execute arbitrary code as the user running Thunderbird.
(CVE-2006-5464)

A flaw was found in the way Thunderbird verifies RSA signatures. For RSA
keys with exponent 3 it is possible for an attacker to forge a signature
that would be incorrectly verified by the NSS library. Thunderbird as
shipped trusts several root Certificate Authorities that use exponent 3. An
attacker could have created a carefully crafted SSL certificate which would
be incorrectly trusted when their site was visited by a victim. This flaw
was previously thought to be fixed in Thunderbird 1.5.0.7, however Ulrich
Kuehn discovered the fix was incomplete (CVE-2006-5462)

Users of Thunderbird are advised to upgrade to this update, which contains
Thunderbird version 1.5.0.8 that corrects these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2006-60

## RSA Signature Forgery

Announced
September 14, 2006
Reporter
Philip Mackenzie, Marius Schilder
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox, NSS, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox 1.5.0.7
* NSS 3.11.3
* SeaMonkey 1.0.5
* Thunderbird 1.5.0.7

### Description

Philip Mackenzie and Marius Schilder of Google informed us of Daniel Bleichenbacher's
recent presentation of a common implementation error in RSA signature verification,
a failure to account for extra data in the signature. For signatures with a small
exponent such as 3 it is possible for an attacker to calculate a value for this extra data to make an altered message appear to be correctly signed, allowing the signature to be forged.
Mozilla's Network Security Services (NSS) library was vulnerable to this flaw.

Because the set of root Certificate Authorities that ship with Mozilla clients
contain some with an exponent of 3 it was possible to make up certificates,
such as SSL/TLS and email certificates, that were not detected as invalid.
This raised the possibility of the sort of Man-in-the-Middle attacks
SSL/TLS was invented to prevent.

We thank Philip Mackenzie and Marius Schilder for bringing
this result to our attention and working with us to ensure the NSS library was
safe from variations on this basic attack.

### Workaround

None, upgrade to a fixed version.

# Mozilla Firefox: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200612-07**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in Mozilla Firefox.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-client/mozilla-firefox** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.5.0.8** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.5.0.8** |

| Package | **www-client/mozilla-firefox-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.5.0.8** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.5.0.8** |

### Background

Mozilla Firefox is a popular open-source web browser from the Mozilla
Project.

### Description

Mozilla Firefox improperly handles Script objects while they are being
executed. Mozilla Firefox has also been found to be vulnerable to
various possible buffer overflows. Lastly, the binary release of
Mozilla Firefox is vulnerable to a low exponent RSA signature forgery
issue because it is bundled with a vulnerable version of NSS.

### Impact

An attacker could entice a user to view specially crafted JavaScript
and execute arbitrary code with the rights of the user running Mozilla
Firefox. An attacker could also entice a user to view a specially
crafted web page that causes a buffer overflow and again executes
arbitrary code. It is also possible for an attacker to make up SSL/TLS
certificates that would not be detected as invalid by the binary
release of Mozilla Firefox, raising the possibility for
Man-in-the-Middle attacks.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Mozilla Firefox users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-1.5.0.8"
```

All Mozilla Firefox binary release users should upgrade to the latest
version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-bin-1.5.0.8"
```

| [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=214445#c2)  Josh Bressers    2006-11-07 22:08:09 UTC  ``` The Mozilla project is releasing Firefox 1.5.0.8 to fix a number of security flaws (Text taken from the upstream advisories):  mfsa2006-66 [CVE-2006-5462](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-5462) impact=important,reported=20061107,public=20061107,source=mozilla      MFSA 2006-60 reported that RSA digital signatures with a low exponent     (typically 3) could be forged, and that this flaw was corrected in the      Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS) library version 3.11.3 used by      Firefox 2.0 and current development versions of Mozilla clients.      Ulrich Kuehn reported that Firefox 1.5.0.7, which incorporated NSS version      3.10.2, was incompletely patched and remained vulnerable to a variant of      this attack.  mfsa2006-67 [CVE-2006-5463](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-5463)  impact=critical,reported=20061107,public=20061107,source=mozilla      shutdown demonstrated that it was possible to modify a Script object while      it was executing, potentially leading to the execution of arbitrary      JavaScript bytecode.  mfsa2006-65 impact=critical,reported=20061107,public=20061107,source=mozilla      As part of the Firefox 1.5.0.8 release we fixed several bugs to improve the      stability of the product. Some of these were crashes that showed evidence of      memory corruption and we presume that at least some of these could be      exploited to run arbitrary code with enough effort.      [CVE-2006-5464](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-5464)         Jesse Ruderman and Martijn Wargers reported crashes in the layout engine      [CVE-2006-5747](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-5747)         shutdown demonstrated that a crash in XML.prototype.hasOwnProperty was          exploitable      [CVE-2006-5748](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-5748)         Igor Bukanov and Jesse Ruderman reported potential memory corruption in          the JavaScript engine   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=214445#c3)  Mark J. Cox    2006-11-08 07:57:34 UTC  ``` removing embargo, now public at <http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=214445#c4)  Red Hat Bugzilla    2006-11-08 08:31:05 UTC  ```  An advisory has been issued which should help the problem described in this bug report. This report is therefore being closed with a resolution of ERRATA. For more information on the solution and/or where to find the updated files, please follow the link below. You may reopen this bug report if the solution does not work for you.  <http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2006-0733.html>    ``` |  |

Several security related problems have been discovered in Mozilla and
derived products.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following vulnerabilities:

CVE-2006-4310

    Tomas Kempinsky discovered that malformed FTP server responses
    could lead to denial of service.

CVE-2006-5462

    Ulrich Kühn discovered that the correction for a cryptographic
    flaw in the handling of PKCS-1 certificates was incomplete, which
    allows the forgery of certificates.

CVE-2006-5463

    "shutdown" discovered that modification of JavaScript objects
    during execution could lead to the execution of arbitrary
    JavaScript bytecode.

CVE-2006-5464

    Jesse Ruderman and Martijn Wargers discovered several crashes in
    the layout engine, which might also allow execution of arbitrary
    code.

CVE-2006-5748

    Igor Bukanov and Jesse Ruderman discovered several crashes in the
    JavaScript engine, which might allow execution of arbitrary code.

This update also adresses several crashes, which could be triggered by
malicious websites and fixes a regression introduced in the previous
Mozilla update.

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.7.8-1sarge8.

We recommend that you upgrade your mozilla package.

# Mozilla Thunderbird: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200612-06**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been identified in Mozilla Thunderbird.

### Affected packages

| Package | **mail-client/mozilla-thunderbird** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.5.0.8** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.5.0.8** |

| Package | **mail-client/mozilla-thunderbird-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.5.0.8** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.5.0.8** |

### Background

Mozilla Thunderbird is a popular open-source email client from the
Mozilla Project.

### Description

It has been identified that Mozilla Thunderbird improperly handles
Script objects while they are being executed, allowing them to be
modified during execution. JavaScript is disabled in Mozilla
Thunderbird by default. Mozilla Thunderbird has also been found to be
vulnerable to various potential buffer overflows. Lastly, the binary
release of Mozilla Thunderbird is vulnerable to a low exponent RSA
signature forgery issue because it is bundled with a vulnerable version
of NSS.

### Impact

An attacker could entice a user to view a specially crafted email that
causes a buffer overflow and again executes arbitrary code or causes a
Denial of Service. An attacker could also entice a user to view an
email containing specially crafted JavaScript and execute arbitrary
code with the rights of the user running Mozilla Thunderbird. It is
important to note that JavaScript is off by default in Mozilla
Thunderbird, and enabling it is strongly discouraged. It is also
possible for an attacker to create SSL/TLS or email certificates that
would not be detected as invalid by the binary release of Mozilla
Thunderbird, raising the possibility for Man-in-the-Middle attacks.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

Users upgrading to the following releases of Mozilla Thunderbird should
note that this version of Mozilla Thunderbird has been found to not
display certain messages in some cases.

 All Mozilla Thunderbird users should upgrade to the
latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-client/mozilla-thunderbird-1.5.0.8"
```

All Mozilla Thunderbird binary release users should upgrade to the
latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-client/mozilla-thunderbird-bin-1.5.0.8"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE IDs        : CVE-2006-4310 CVE-2006-5462 CVE-2006-5463 CVE-2006-5464
                 CVE-2006-5748
CERT advisories: VU#335392 VU#390480 VU#495288 VU#714496
BugTraq IDs    : 19678 20957

Several security related problems have been discovered in Mozilla and
derived products such as Mozilla Firefox.  The Common Vulnerabilities
and Exposures project identifies the following vulnerabilities:

CVE-2006-4310

    Tomas Kempinsky discovered that malformed FTP server responses
    could lead to denial of service.

CVE-2006-5462

    Ulrich Kühn discovered that the correction for a cryptographic
    flaw in the handling of PKCS-1 certificates was incomplete, which
    allows the forgery of certificates.

CVE-2006-5463

    "shutdown" discovered that modification of JavaScript objects
    during execution could lead to the execution of arbitrary
    JavaScript bytecode.

CVE-2006-5464

    Jesse Ruderman and Martijn Wargers discovered several crashes in
    the layout engine, which might also allow execution of arbitrary
    code.

CVE-2006-5748

    Igor Bukanov and Jesse Ruderman discovered several crashes in the
    JavaScript engine, which might allow execution of arbitrary code.

This update also adresses several crashes, which could be triggered by
malicious websites and fixes a regression introduced in the previous
Mozilla update.

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.4-2sarge13.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
the current iceweasel package 2.0+dfsg-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your mozilla-firefox package.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)
* [Ubuntu 5.10](/security/notices?release=breezy)

## Details

USN-351-1 fixed a flaw in the verification of PKCS certificate

signatures. Ulrich Kuehn discovered a variant of the original attack

which the original fix did not cover. ([CVE-2006-5462](/security/CVE-2006-5462))

Various flaws have been reported that allow an attacker to execute

arbitrary code with user privileges by tricking the user into opening

a malicious web page containing JavaScript. ([CVE-2006-5463](/security/CVE-2006-5463),

[CVE-2006-5464](/security/CVE-2006-5464), [CVE-2006-5747](/security/CVE-2006-5747), [CVE-2006-5748](/security/CVE-2006-5748))

## Details

USN-352-1 fixed a flaw in the verification of PKCS certificate

signatures. Ulrich Kuehn discovered a variant of the original attack

which the original fix did not cover. ([CVE-2006-5462](/security/CVE-2006-5462))

Various flaws have been reported that allow an attacker to execute

arbitrary code with user privileges by tricking the user into opening a

malicious email containing JavaScript. Please note that JavaScript is

disabled by default for emails, and it is not recommended to enable it.
