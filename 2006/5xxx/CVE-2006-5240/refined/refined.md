{
  "CVE-2006-5240": {
    "Description": "docmint <= 2.0 is vulnerable to remote file inclusion due to insufficient sanitization of the MY_ENV[BASE_ENGINE_LOC] variable in the engine/require.php script. This allows a remote attacker to include arbitrary files from a remote server.",
    "Root cause": "Insufficient sanitization of the `MY_ENV[BASE_ENGINE_LOC]` variable in `engine/require.php` allows for inclusion of arbitrary remote files.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the vulnerable server by including a malicious file from a remote location. This could lead to complete system compromise.",
    "Attack vectors": "A remote attacker can inject a malicious URL into the `MY_ENV[BASE_ENGINE_LOC]` parameter of the `engine/require.php` script.",
     "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious PHP file on a web server and have the ability to send a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable server."
