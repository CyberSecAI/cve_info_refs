{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper input sanitization of the `$srcdir` parameter in multiple PHP files of OpenEMR. This parameter is used in include_once statements, making the application vulnerable to Remote File Inclusion (RFI).",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)",
      "Lack of input sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise, data theft, or defacement.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through HTTP requests to vulnerable PHP files, where the attacker can specify a malicious URL for the `$srcdir` parameter.",
     "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and have a location to host a malicious php file."
