{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of the $AD_BODY_TEMP variable in multiple PHP files.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability due to the use of the include() function with a user-controlled variable ($AD_BODY_TEMP).",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include a remote file, potentially executing arbitrary PHP code on the server.",
  "Attack vectors": "By manipulating the $AD_BODY_TEMP parameter, an attacker can specify a URL to a malicious PHP file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application and control the $AD_BODY_TEMP parameter, typically through a GET or POST request. The attacker does not need any prior access to the server."
