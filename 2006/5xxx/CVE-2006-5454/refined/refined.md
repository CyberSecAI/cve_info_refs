  "CVE-2006-5454": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "The 'deadline' field was visible in the XML format of a bug, even to users who were not a member of the 'timetrackinggroup'.",
    "root_cause": "Bugzilla's XML export functionality incorrectly included the 'deadline' field in bug exports, even for users not belonging to the 'timetrackinggroup'.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Information Leak"
    ],
    "impact": "Unauthorized users could view the deadline information of bugs, which was intended to be visible only to members of the 'timetrackinggroup'.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Accessing the XML export of a bug"
    ],
     "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker only needs to be a user of the Bugzilla instance; no special privileges are required to access the XML export.",
     "additional_details": "The vulnerability was present in Bugzilla versions 2.19.2 and above. The fix was implemented by filtering out time-tracking fields, including 'deadline', if the user does not belong to the 'timetrackinggroup'. The issue was resolved by modifying the show_bug.cgi script to correctly exclude the 'deadline' field from XML exports when accessed by unauthorized users. "
