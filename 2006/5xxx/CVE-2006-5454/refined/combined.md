# Bugzilla: Multiple Vulnerabilities — GLSA **200611-04**

Bugzilla is vulnerable to cross-site scripting, script injection, and
request forgery.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-apps/bugzilla** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.18.6** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.18.6** |

### Background

Bugzilla is a bug tracking system used to allow developers to more
easily track outstanding bugs in products.

### Description

The vulnerabilities identified in Bugzilla are as follows:

* Frederic Buclin and Gervase Markham discovered that input passed to
  various fields throughout Bugzilla were not properly sanitized before
  being sent back to users (CVE-2006-5453).
* Frederic Buclin and Josh "timeless" Soref discovered a bug when
  viewing attachments in diff mode that allows users not of the
  "insidergroup" to read attachment descriptions. Additionally, it was
  discovered that the "deadline" field is visible to users who do not
  belong to the "timetrackinggroup" when bugs are exported to XML
  (CVE-2006-5454).
* Gavin Shelley reported that Bugzilla allows certain operations to
  be performed via HTTP GET and HTTP POST requests without verifying
  those requests properly (CVE-2006-5455).
* Max Kanat-Alexander discovered that input passed to
  showdependencygraph.cgi is not properly sanitized before being returned
  to users (CVE-2006-5453).

### Impact

An attacker could inject scripts into the content loaded by a user's
browser in order to have those scripts executed in a user's browser in
the context of the site currently being viewed. This could include
gaining access to privileged session information for the site being
viewed. Additionally, a user could forge an HTTP request in order to
create, modify, or delete bugs within a Bugzilla instance. Lastly, an
unauthorized user could view sensitive information about bugs or bug
attachments.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Bugzilla users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apps/bugzilla-2.18.6"
```

Summary
=======

Bugzilla is a Web-based bug-tracking system used by a large number of
software projects. The following security issues have been discovered
in Bugzilla:

* Sometimes the information put into the <h1> and <h2> tags in Bugzilla
  was not properly escaped, leading to a possible XSS vulnerability.

* Bugzilla administrators were allowed to put raw, unfiltered HTML into
  many fields in Bugzilla, leading to a possible XSS vulnerability.
  Now, the HTML allowed in those fields is limited.

* attachment.cgi could leak the names of private attachments

* The "deadline" field was visible in the XML format of a bug, even to
  users who were not a member of the "timetrackinggroup."

* A malicious user could pass a URL to an admin, and make the admin
  delete or change something that he had not intended to delete or
  change.

* It is possible to inject arbitrary HTML into the showdependencygraph.cgi
  page, allowing for a cross-site scripting attack.

All affected installations are encouraged to upgrade as soon as
possible.

Vulnerability Details
=====================

Class:       Cross-Site Scripting
Affected:    2.15 and above
Description: Bugzilla sometimes displays admin-provided data in page
             headers (meaning the <h1> and <h2> HTML tags of a page).
             Sometimes, this data was not properly escaped, leading to
             the possibility of a Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability.
             For the most part, this was only exploitable by
             administrators, and so is not of critical severity.
References:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=330555

Class:       Cross-Site Scripting
Affected:    2.0 and above
Description: Bugzilla allows administrators to put HTML in the
             descriptions of products, components, and other items. It
             also allows HTML in certain other fields. Before the
             most recent releases of Bugzilla, this HTML was completely
             unfiltered. These fields are only editable by
             certain users, who are specified by the admin. This makes
             this vulnerability less severe. However, these users could
             use this exploit to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks
             on nearly all users of a particular Bugzilla (including
             users with higher permission levels than themselves).

             Bugzilla now allows only certain HTML tags in those fields,
             protecting users from a Cross-Site Scripting attack.
References:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=206037

Class:       Information Leak
Affected:    2.17 and above
Description: When viewing an attachment in "Diff" mode, a user who is
             not in the "insidergroup" (the group required to view
             private attachments) can read the one-line descriptions
             of all attachments, even "private" attachments.
References:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=346086

Class:       Information Leak
Affected:    2.19.2 and above
Description: Bugzilla has a "deadline" field, which is usually only
             visible to people in the "timetrackinggroup" group.
             However, it was exposed in the XML format of a bug to all
             users.
References:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=346564

Class:       Security Enhancement
Affected:    2.0 and above
Description: Bugzilla updates, deletes, and creates data through a
             web interface. Administrators update things like user
             accounts through this interface. All of these pages accept
             URL variables in both GET and POST formats.

             A malicious user could craft a URL that would edit a user
             (or any other admin-protected item), and then using a
             service like TinyURL, could obscure the URL so that an
             administrator couldn't tell what it was. Then, getting the
             administrator to click on that URL, the action would be
             performed, against the administrator's will.

             This is now prevented. Bugzilla will only accept changes
             on administrative pages if they come from Bugzilla's own
             forms. That is, you have to use the form to make changes--
             you now cannot just click a URL and accidentally make an
             administrative change to Bugzilla.

             Although technically this affects all versions of Bugzilla,
             it has only been fixed on our most recent release (2.22.1
             and our latest development snapshot, 2.23.3), because the
             fix was too invasive to backport further. Administrators
             of previous versions of Bugzilla should only click on URLs
             from users that they fully trust.
References:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=281181

Class:       Cross-Site Scripting
Affected:    2.15 and above
Description: showdependencygraph.cgi is a script that allows you to display
             a graph of how bugs are related. There is a cross-site
             scripting vulnerability in this script that allows for arbitrary
             HTML injection. The user would have to follow a malicious URL
             in order to trigger the attack--it is not possible for another
             user to otherwise inject HTML into the page for the current
             user.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research).

| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=346086#c0)• 18 years ago |
|  | |

When viewing a public attachment in the "diff" mode, i.e. an attachment not marked as "private", a user who is not in the insidergroup (the group required to view private attachments) can read \*all\* descriptions of attachments, including those being "private". Note that the attachment itself is correctly protected, only its description is visible.
My descriptions are rather unexploitable, because they are always of the form "patch v2 for tip", but timeless told me today that sometimes people put more useful descriptions than me. :) In this case, there is a risk (probably a low one) that someone could try to use this information to exploit the security bug (we know it's a security bug, else why would this attachment be protected?).
dveditz asked justdave in [bug 330892](/show_bug.cgi?id=330892 "RESOLVED FIXED - Turn on insider/private comment/private attachments at BMO") to set the 'insidergroup' parameter to 'security', so I think this hole should be addressed before [bug 330892](/show_bug.cgi?id=330892 "RESOLVED FIXED - Turn on insider/private comment/private attachments at BMO") is fixed, else anyone knowing this "trick" could try to use it.
I can reproduce this bug on both 2.18.5+ and tip, so all supported versions of Bugzilla are affected. Note that the fix is trivial and non-invasive. I mark the severity of this bug as "minor" as reading the description is probably much less critical than reading the patch itself.

LpSolit: do you have a patch for this bug? Your original description implies that you might.
You are right - it would be good to apply this to b.m.o. before turning on insidergroup.

Oops, while scanning attachment.cgi to make sure there are no other security holes, I found a bigger one as I reached to get \*all\* attachment descriptions of \*all\* bugs, including security bugs. Note that you cannot do that using the UI. You have to write the URL yourself and pass well choosen parameters, but at least I have them all.

About my previous comment, you need editbugs privs to exploit it, but that's pretty common, at least on b.m.o. And I think several installations use the default regexp used for the canconfirm and editbugs groups, i.e. .\*, meaning that on some installations, everybody can exploit it by default.

Now I found a 3rd way to get descriptions of private attachments, including flags set on them: use the "Format for printing" (aka "Show multiple bugs at once"). Note that you need to have access to the bug to exploit it. This 3rd way doesn't require any privilege though. More important: this only affects Bugzilla 2.24. 2.22 and older are not affected. Yay!Severity: minor → major

Attached patch

[patch for tip, v1](attachment.cgi?id=231012&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=231012&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=346086&attachment=231012)

This patch fixes all 3 ways I found to get descriptions of private attachments without having the required privs.
We are currently pretty inconsistent about what to do with private attachments when the insidergroup parameter is reset. Some templates display private attachments, some other still hide/exclude them. For comparison, private comments are still hidden. I think this is the right way to go.

It seems to me that the insider functionality needs a data leak audit. How many of the Bugzilla developers regularly use installations where it's enabled, when the developer themselves is outside the group? Not many, I'll bet.

Attached patch

— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=346086&attachment=231037)

Two small improvements over v1:
- Now attachments the user tries to mark as obsolete are checked before inserting a new attachment into the DB. Else you can get an error when a first insertion has already been made, meaning that you only have partial data in the DB;
- I now hide the ID of attachments the user cannot access when editing another attachment of the same bug. Now the UI is fully consistent with what you are really allowed to do/view.

Nit: it seems like you repeat this logic several times (albeit in slightly modified forms), so it might make sense to factor it out into a separate method, f.e. $user->is\_insider, which returns true if there's an insider group and the user is in it, false otherwise. Then you could write this code more simply as:
my $and\_restriction = $user->is\_insider ? "" : "AND isprivate = 0";
And later in validateID you could say simply:
if ($isprivate && !$user->is\_insider) {
ThrowUserError("auth\_failure", {action => "access",
object => "attachment"});
}
And in validateCanEdit something like:
if ($attachment->isprivate && !Bugzilla->user->is\_insider) {
ThrowUserError('illegal\_attachment\_edit', {attach\_id => $attachment->id});
}

So if $isprivate is set, but there's no insider group, then no one can access the attachment? Seems like $isprivate should only apply when there is an insider group defined, no? Perhaps I misunderstand.

Shouldn't submitters be able to edit their attachments, even if those attachments get moved to the insider group? That would be consistent with how we treat bug reporters, i.e. by default they have access to their bugs, even if the bugs get restricted to some group, unless someone explicitly removes their access by unchecking the "Reporter can always view this bug" checkbox.
Otherwise this looks fine, and assuming the answers to my two questions above do not necessitate any code changes, then r=myk. But those questions should be explicitly addressed (and probably documented somewhere) before this goes in.

Ok, I see now that you address this in [comment 6](/show_bug.cgi?id=346086#c6 "RESOLVED FIXED - [SECURITY] attachment.cgi lets you view descriptions of private attachments even when you are not in the insidergroup"). Seems like we should be consistent with the way comments work, and if we want to change the way they work, we should do so in a separate bug, so this is fine.

I now let the submitter view his own attachments, even if they have been added to the insider group. I also refactored the code a bit as suggested by myk, and I implemented $user->is\_insider.
There are many places all over the code where the way to consider private attachments when no insider group is set is not consistent. This is definitely a edge case which I don't want to fix in this security bug. In other words, all other places do not care if you are the submitter of the private attachment. Also, some places will let you view some data about attachments if the insidergroup is empty, some other places won't. I don't consider this as part of the security bug.

This looks fine. But we should get confirmation that allowing submitters to see and modify their own attachments, even when those attachments have been moved to the insider group, is what we want. Gerv, dveditz, Dave, what think you?

(In reply to [comment #20](/show_bug.cgi?id=346086#c20 "RESOLVED FIXED - [SECURITY] attachment.cgi lets you view descriptions of private attachments even when you are not in the insidergroup"))
It makes sense to me to allow the submitter to see their own attachments regardless... it's consistent with how we deal with reporters vs bugs, and what people would expect I think.

By "submitter" you mean the person who added the attachment, not the bug reporter, right? If so it should be fine. For bugs we have the option of hiding them from the reporter if we add comments we don't want to share (though now with insider-comments that should be even less likely), but we can't really add anything to an attachment the submitter doesn't already know.

The UI doesn't let you turn on/off the private bit on attachments if you are not in the insidergroup. Consequently, attachment.cgi won't see the 'isprivate' form and will assume that you want it to be off, which is wrong in this case. So I force attachment.cgi to ignore isprivate unless you have enough privs to change it. This rule applies to the submitter too.

Note only have we to make sure a user not being in the insidergroup cannot change the private bit, but we have to make this check at the right time, i.e. \*before\* calling Flag\*::validate() which look at the private bit to determine whether the requestee is allowed to view the attachment or not. I did an ugly hack, but this is the less risky change for branches.

I added UserIsInsider() in globals.pl which is a nice shortcut to avoid checking all the time whether the user is logged in or not. Indeed, Bugzilla->user->foo() fails if the user is logged out on 2.18 (2.18 doesn't allow empty user object).

I'm assuming this bug dates back to the original introduction of insidergroup, which was in 2.17 (according to bonsai).Version: 2.18.5 → 2.17

The reason is that Bug.pm shows these fields by default:
if (Param('timetrackinggroup')) {
push @fields, qw(estimated\_time remaining\_time actual\_time deadline);
}
But show\_bug.cgi incorrectly excludes them when the user is not in the timetracking group:
unless (UserInGroup(Param("timetrackinggroup"))) {
@fieldlist = grep($\_ !~ /\_time$/, @fieldlist);
}
The first 3 fields are excluded, but deadline doesn't match the regexp.

Found no other unfiled code that leaked the timetracking fields (in any of the Bugzilla versions). Did wonder a bit about percentage\_complete and show\_bug.cgi, but that field seems to be buglist.cgi only.

Summary
=======
Bugzilla is a Web-based bug-tracking system, used by a large number of
software projects.
This advisory covers six security issues that have recently been
fixed in the Bugzilla code:
+ Sometimes the information put into the <h1> and <h2> tags in Bugzilla
was not properly escaped, leading to a possible XSS vulnerability.
+ Bugzilla administrators were allowed to put raw, unfiltered HTML into
many fields in Bugzilla, leading to a possible XSS vulnerability.
Now, the HTML allowed in those fields is limited.
+ attachment.cgi could leak the names of private attachments
+ The "deadline" field was visible in the XML format of a bug, even to
users who were not a member of the "timetrackinggroup."
+ A malicious user could pass a URL to an admin, and make the admin
delete or change something that he had not intended to delete or
change.
+ It is possible to inject arbitrary HTML into the showdependencygraph.cgi
page, allowing for a cross-site scripting attack.
We strongly advise that 2.18.x users upgrade to 2.18.6. 2.20.x users
should upgrade to 2.20.3. 2.22 users, and users of 2.16.x or below,
should upgrade to 2.22.1.
Development snapshots of 2.23 before 2.23.3 are also vulnerable to all
of these issues. If you are using a development snapshot, you should
upgrade to 2.23.3, use CVS to update, or apply the patches from the
specific bugs listed below.
Vulnerability Details
=====================
Issue 1
-------
Class: Cross-Site Scripting
Versions: 2.15 and above
Description: Bugzilla sometimes displays admin-provided data in page
headers (meaning the <h1> and <h2> HTML tags of a page).
Sometimes, this data was not properly escaped, leading to
the possibility of a Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability.
For the most part, this was only exploitable by
administrators, and so is not of critical severity.
Reference: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=330555
Issue 2
-------
Class: Cross-Site Scripting
Versions: 2.0 and above
Description: Bugzilla allows administrators to put HTML in the
descriptions of products, components, and other items. It
also allows HTML in certain other fields. Before the
most recent releases of Bugzilla, this HTML was completely
unfiltered. These fields are only editable by
certain users, who are specified by the admin. This makes
this vulnerability less severe. However, these users could
use this exploit to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks
on nearly all users of a particular Bugzilla (including
users with higher permission levels than themselves).
Bugzilla now allows only certain HTML tags in those fields,
protecting users from a Cross-Site Scripting attack.
Reference: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=206037
Issue 3
-------
Class: Information Leak
Versions: 2.17 and above
Description: When viewing an attachment in "Diff" mode, a user who is
not in the "insidergroup" (the group required to view
private attachments) can read the one-line descriptions
of all attachments, even "private" attachments.
Reference: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=346086
Issue 4
-------
Class: Information Leak
Versions: 2.19.2 and above
Description: Bugzilla has a "deadline" field, which is usually only
visible to people in the "timetrackinggroup" group.
However, it was exposed in the XML format of a bug to all
users.
Reference: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=346564
Issue 5
-------
Class: Security Enhancement
Versions: 2.0 and above
Description: Bugzilla updates, deletes, and creates data through a
web interface. Administrators update things like user
accounts through this interface. All of these pages accept
URL variables in both GET and POST formats.
A malicious user could craft a URL that would edit a user
(or any other admin-protected item), and then using a
service like TinyURL, could obscure the URL so that an
administrator couldn't tell what it was. Then, getting the
administrator to click on that URL, the action would be
performed, against the administrator's will.
This is now prevented. Bugzilla will only accept changes
on administrative pages if they come from Bugzilla's own
forms. That is, you have to use the form to make changes--
you now cannot just click a URL and accidentally make an
administrative change to Bugzilla.
Although technically this affects all versions of Bugzilla,
it has only been fixed on our most recent release (2.22.1
and our latest development snapshot, 2.23.3), because the
fix was too invasive to backport further. Administrators
of previous versions of Bugzilla should only click on URLs
from users that they fully trust.
Reference: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=281181
Issue 6
-------
Class: Cross-Site Scripting
Versions: 2.15 and above
Description: showdependencygraph.cgi is a script that allows you to display
a graph of how bugs are related. There is a cross-site
scripting vulnerability in this script that allows for arbitrary
HTML injection. The user would have to follow a malicious URL
in order to trigger the attack--it is not possible for another
user to otherwise inject HTML into the page for the current
user.
Reference: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=355728
