openssh security update (RHSA-2006-0738)

Original Release Date: February 1, 2007

Last Revised: February 12, 2009

Number: ASA-2007-048

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 3.0

Advisory Status: Interim

---

## 1. Overview:

OpenSSH is a suite of tools developed by the OpenBSD team for
interoperating
with the SSH protocol.

The privilege separation monitor in OpenSSH was found to contain a
possible
authentication flaw. The unprivileged process of OpenSSH's daemon
(when
configured for privilege separation) could possibly allow a login
without
presenting correct authentication. However taking advantage of this
issue
would require an attacker to be able to influence the behavior of the
unprivileged process. There is no known way to do so today. The
Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned
the name
[CVE-2006-5794](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-5794) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the
security
advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2006-0738.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with openssh installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya S87XX/S8500/S8300 | CM 2.x and CM 3.x | Low | Upgrade to CM 4.0 or later. |
| Avaya Intuity LX | IALX 1.1 | Low | Upgrade to IALX 2.0 or later. |
| Avaya Messaging Storage Server | MSS 3.0 | Low | Upgrade to MSS 3.1 or later. |
| Avaya Message Networking | All | Low | See recommended actions below.  This issue will be addressed in accordance with [Avaya's Product Security Vulnerability Response Policy](http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/security_vulnerability_response.pdf) |
| Avaya CCS/SES | SES 4.0 and earlier | Low | Upgrade to SES 5.0 or later |

**Recommended Actions:**
For all system products which use
vulnerable
versions of OpenSSH, Avaya recommends that customers restrict local
and
network access to the server. This restriction should be enforced
through the
use of physical security, firewalls, ACLs, VPNs, and other
generally-accepted networking practices until such time as an
update becomes
available and can be installed.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating
systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying
operating
system or applications that come with the operating system. These
vulnerabilities often do not impact the software-only product
directly but
may threaten the integrity of the underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not
affected by
the vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be.
Customers should determine on which Linux operating system the
product was
installed and then follow that vendors guidance.

## 4. Software-Only Products:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CVLAN | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. The CVLAN application does not require the software described in this advisory. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite(IMS) | All | Low | See recommended actions below. |

**Recommended Actions:**
Avaya recommends that customers follow
recommended actions supplied by RedHat Linux.

## 5. Additional Information:

Additional information may also be available via the Avaya support
[website](http://support.avaya.com) and through your Avaya
account
representative. Please contact your Avaya product support
representative, or
dial 1-800-242-2121, with any questions.

## SUSE Security

# A Process That Never Ends

### SUSE is committed to delivering best effort security to its customers and to the Open Source community. We believe that trust in Open Source Software security in general, and the user's privacy in particular, are both indispensable and indefeasible.

We treat software security as a process that never ends. This means we:

* Promptly react to security incidents and deliver premium quality security updates
* Continuously improve the security-related functionality in SUSE products
* Continuously contribute to the rapidly growing maturity of Open Source Software
* Respect the Open Source Software security principles of openness, transparency and traceability

Software security is a complex challenge. Software can provide many of its own security features, such as authentication methods, encryption, intrusion prevention and detection, and backup.

At the same time, it can also contain errors (both deliberate and accidental) that can affect the system's security, including design flaws, programming errors, and backdoors.

The SUSE Security Team addresses all of these aspects of software security, on an ongoing basis. Software security cannot be thought of as a state you can achieve at a specific point in time. Instead, it is a process that must be executed with professional expertise and continuous development. This persistent focus is what has given Open Source Software, Linux and SUSE such an excellent reputation for security.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=214640#c0)  Josh Bressers    2006-11-08 18:54:22 UTC  ``` OpenSSH has fixed a minor flaw that could allow a remote attacker to bypass normal authentication mechanisms if a flaw is ever found that allows an attacker to control the unprivileged process when privilege separation is enabled.  This flaw is not exploitable by itself.  It requires a flaw which allows the attacker to control the unprivileged process while privilege seperation is enabled.  This issue also affects RHEL3   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=214640#c1)  Tomas Mraz    2006-11-10 13:51:07 UTC  ``` Fixed packages for RHEL3: openssh-3.6.1p2-33.30.13 in dist-3.0E-errata-candidate  Fixed packages for RHEL4: openssh-3.9p1-8.RHEL4.17.1 in dist-4E-errata-candidate    ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=214640#c4)  Red Hat Bugzilla    2006-11-15 14:19:07 UTC  ```  An advisory has been issued which should help the problem described in this bug report. This report is therefore being closed with a resolution of ERRATA. For more information on the solution and/or where to find the updated files, please follow the link below. You may reopen this bug report if the solution does not work for you.  <http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2006-0738.html>    ``` |  |

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Low

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2006%3A0738)

## Topic

Updated openssh packages that fix an authentication flaw are now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and 4.

This update has been rated as having low security impact by the Red Hat
Security Response Team.

## Description

OpenSSH is OpenBSD's SSH (Secure SHell) protocol implementation. This
package includes the core files necessary for both the OpenSSH client and
server.

An authentication flaw was found in OpenSSH's privilege separation monitor.
If it ever becomes possible to alter the behavior of the unprivileged
process when OpenSSH is using privilege separation, an attacker may then be
able to login without possessing proper credentials. (CVE-2006-5794)

Please note that this flaw by itself poses no direct threat to OpenSSH
users. Without another security flaw that could allow an attacker to alter
the behavior of OpenSSH's unprivileged process, this flaw cannot be
exploited. There are currently no known flaws to exploit this behavior.
However, we have decided to issue this erratum to fix this flaw to reduce
the security impact if an unprivileged process flaw is ever found.

Users of openssh should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a
backported patch to resolve this issue.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

OpenSSH 4.5 was released on 2006-11-07. It is available from the
mirrors listed at https://www.openssh.com/.
OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol version 1.3, 1.5 and 2.0
implementation and includes sftp client and server support.
Once again, we would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their
continued support of the project, especially those who contributed
code or patches, reported bugs, tested snapshots and purchased
T-shirts or posters.
T-shirt, poster and CD sales directly support the project. Pictures
and more information can be found at:
http://www.openbsd.org/tshirts.html and
http://www.openbsd.org/orders.html
For international orders use http://https.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/order
and for European orders, use http://https.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/order.eu
Changes since OpenSSH 4.4:
============================
This is a bugfix only release. No new features have been added.
Security bugs resolved in this release:
\* Fix a bug in the sshd privilege separation monitor that weakened its
verification of successful authentication. This bug is not known to
be exploitable in the absence of additional vulnerabilities.
This release includes the following non-security fixes:
\* Several compilation fixes for portable OpenSSH
\* Fixes to Solaris SMF/process contract support (bugzilla #1255)
Thanks to everyone who has contributed patches, reported bugs and
tested releases.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Synopsis

Low: openssh security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Low

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2006%3A0738)

## Topic

Updated openssh packages that fix an authentication flaw are now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and 4.

This update has been rated as having low security impact by the Red Hat
Security Response Team.

## Description

OpenSSH is OpenBSD's SSH (Secure SHell) protocol implementation. This
package includes the core files necessary for both the OpenSSH client and
server.

An authentication flaw was found in OpenSSH's privilege separation monitor.
If it ever becomes possible to alter the behavior of the unprivileged
process when OpenSSH is using privilege separation, an attacker may then be
able to login without possessing proper credentials. (CVE-2006-5794)

Please note that this flaw by itself poses no direct threat to OpenSSH
users. Without another security flaw that could allow an attacker to alter
the behavior of OpenSSH's unprivileged process, this flaw cannot be
exploited. There are currently no known flaws to exploit this behavior.
However, we have decided to issue this erratum to fix this flaw to reduce
the security impact if an unprivileged process flaw is ever found.

Users of openssh should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a
backported patch to resolve this issue.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
