- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application includes files using a variable `$nbs` without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject a remote file URL.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Remote File Inclusion (RFI)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can include a malicious PHP file from a remote server, leading to arbitrary code execution on the vulnerable server.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited through a crafted URL by modifying the `nbs` parameter in the `includes/global.php` file's request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have a web server running with a malicious PHP script and the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
