{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from an insecure inclusion of a remote file in `core/pdf.php`. The script defines the path to an FPDF library using a configuration variable `$config['pdf_module']`, but fails to ensure it's properly set or validated before including related files.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability. The `pdf.php` script uses a user-controlled variable `config[pdf_module]` to define the path to an external file, leading to the inclusion of arbitrary remote files.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include a malicious remote file, allowing for arbitrary code execution on the server. This can result in complete system compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exploited by crafting a request that sets the `config[pdf_module]` parameter to a URL pointing to a malicious PHP file. The vulnerable `pdf.php` script then includes and executes the remote malicious file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must have the ability to send HTTP POST requests to the server where VideoDB is hosted. They also need to host a malicious PHP file accessible via URL. No prior authentication is needed."
