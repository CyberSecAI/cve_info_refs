{
  "CVE-2006-5072": {
    "Description": "The System.CodeDom.Compiler classes of Mono create temporary files with insecure permissions, potentially allowing a local user to overwrite arbitrary files. Under some circumstances, a local attacker could also exploit this to inject arbitrary code into running Mono processes.",
    "Root cause": "Insecure temporary file creation",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insecure permissions on temporary files"
    ],
    "Impact": "A local attacker can create symbolic links in the temporary file directory pointing to a valid file on the file system. When the affected class is called, the file could be overwritten with the privileges of the user running the script, potentially injecting arbitrary code.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local access",
    "Required capabilities": "The attacker needs local access to the system to create symbolic links in the temporary file directory."
  }
