# [Kernel Wars](http://kernelwars.blogspot.com/)

Kernel Exploitation Demystified

## Monday, January 29, 2007

### Kernel Wars in Amsterdam!

This post is about our talk at BlackHat Europe 2007 in Amsterdam.

Kernel vulnerabilities are often deemed unexploitable or at least unlikely to be exploited reliably. Although it's true that kernel-mode exploitation often presents some new challenges for exploit developers, it still all boils down to "creative debugging" and knowledge about the target in question.

During our talk we intend to demystify kernel-mode exploitation by demonstrating the analysis and reliable exploitation of three different kernel vulnerabilities without public exploits. From a defenders point of view this could hopefully serve as an eye-opener, as it demonstrates the ineffectiveness of HIDS, NX, ASLR and other protective measures when the kernel itself is being exploited.

The vulnerabilities that will be discussed are:

- FreeBSD 802.11 Management Frame Integer Overflow (Patched)
 Found and exploited by Karl Janmar. [Advisory](http://www.signedness.org/advisories/sps-0x1.txt)

- NetBSD Local Kernel Heap Overflow (Unpatched, 0-day)
 Found by Christer Öberg, exploited by Christer and Joel Eriksson.

- Windows (2000 & XP) Local GDI Memory Overwrite (Unpatched)
 Found by Cesar Cerrudo, exploited by Joel Eriksson. [Advisory](http://projects.info-pull.com/mokb/MOKB-06-11-2006.html)

Unlike most of the 802.11-related bugs that have been found lately the FreeBSD 802.11 vulnerability did not only affect a particular driver, but the 802.11 subsystem itself. Besides being discovered quite a while before the other WLAN-related bugs (summer 2005) it uses a pretty interesting payload, which injects a pure kernel-mode backdoor that communicates through spoofed management frames. The full exploit will be released after the talk.

The GDI bug for Windows 2000 and XP that results in a local privilege escalation when successfully exploited was found by Cesar Cerrudo from Argeniss and reported to Microsoft as early as 2004-10-22. It was made public during MoKB (Month of Kernel Bugs) on 2006-11-06, more than two years later.

Amazingly it has still not been patched, perhaps due to Microsoft not taking the threat seriously until they've seen that it can be exploited reliably in practice. Reliable exploitation for Windows 2000 and XP with any and all servicepacks and patches applied will be demonstrated during the talk.

Since we intend to release the NetBSD bug during the talk we will not disclose any details yet, but.. The particularly interesting thing about this bug is that it has been around for almost two decades. It was present in both OpenBSD and FreeBSD until they got rid of the code in question altogether and it most likely still exists in some of the other commercial Unix-systems derived from BSD.

( Joel Eriksson | Karl Janmar | Christer Öberg @ Bitsec )

What level of account were you running the W2K/XP GDI exploit from.

I am assuming that this can only be done from and admin account or perhaps a PowerUser account.

Hopefully, by now, the AV amd AS people have enough info to detect this exploit.

You thoughts?

If u look closer at this picture u can see that the exploit is ran from a normal user account, so its not needed to have any special Power User/Admin rights to execute it

I had a look at the NetBSD CVS changes to netiso. An interesting kernel heap overflow.

Kernel Wars is back, this time at BlackHat USA and DefCon in Las Vegas.[sportsbook](http://www.enterbet.com) Looking forward to seeing you there!
The GDI bug and the FreeBSD 802.11 vulnerability that was discussed in the original BlackHat Europe presentation [bet nfl](http://www.enterbet.com) in Amsterdam will be included this time too. The NetBSD bug have been replaced with. A new NetBSD 0-day.
We have also brought a new co-speaker this time, Claes Nyberg. Claes is also the developer of our in-house <http://www.enterbet.com> fuzzer Itchy, that our main bug hunter Christer Öberg is constantly discovering new vulnerabilities with. :) Claes will talk about his exploit for the OpenBSD ICMPv6 bug, found by Alfredo Ortega from CORE SDI.

became involved in World War II on May 10, 1940, when German forces invaded the country and quickly overran it. [Sportsbook](http://www.canadacasino.com) On December 7, 1941, after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Netherlands government in exile also declared war on Japan. The country was not fully liberated until the surrender of Germany on May 5, 1945 (though the southern and eastern parts had already been liberated during and after Operation Market Garden which started in 1944). [online betting](http://www.canadacasino.com) the Netherlands had been neutral, and when World War II broke out in August 1939, most people believed that the country would be able to stay out of this war as well. The Dutch army did immediately mobilize their army, in 1939. But it wasn't on its full strength until April 1940.
The months of 'Phoney War' that followed the situation seemed to justify this
[march madness](http://www.canadacasino.com) attitude - though there were some incidents, most notably the Venlo incident, where two members of the British SIS were abducted and one Dutch intelligence officer killed by members of the German Abwehr. Also the army led by General Winkelman, thought they would come over the borders with tanks. This wasn't true. In 1940 the Germans landed throughout all of the Netherlands.

I've read several different things regarding Ubuntu and Solaris. I'm asking for [dominical costa rica tours](http://www.dominicalcostaricatours.com)
 help here as I'm trying to sort things out:1. What is in a kernel? Is the Ubuntu kernel as small as the Amiga kickstart.rom or as big as the Windows\system32 directory? What does the kernel do?
2. Solaris' kernel is reported to be better than Ubuntu's. Why don't we use the better one then? What would that change to the way the computer runs? What would Nexenta change about that? 3. Repos and programs: can you do the same in Solaris as you do in Ubuntu? Can software be tranferred? Can programs from one OS be launched into the other?

[Costa Rica Fishing](http://costa-ricafishing.com/)
Military history of the Netherlands during World War II

The Netherlands entered World War II on May 10, 1940, when invading German forces quickly overran it. On December 7, 1941, after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Netherlands government in exile also declared war on Japan. Operation Market Garden, which started in 1944, liberated the southern and eastern parts of the country, but full liberation did not come until the surrender of Germany on May 5, 1945
[Costa Rica Fishing and Tours](http://costa-ricafishing.com/)

Prelude

When World War II erupted in August 1939, most in the Netherlands believed that the country could remain neutral, as it had in World War I. The months of "Phoney War" following the German invasion of Poland seemed to justify this attitude. The Dutch army did immediately mobilize in 1939, but not in full strength until April 1940.

<http://costa-ricafishing.com/>
Signs to the contrary went unheeded. Among them were some incidents, most notably the Venlo incident in which members of the German Abwehr operating in the Netherlands abducted two members of the British SIS and killed one Dutch intelligence officer. More direct were worrying signals from Berlin received by the government beginning in the first months of 1940. [Costa Rica Fishing](http://costa-ricafishing.com/)
 The Dutch military attaché there, Major Bert Sas, had established good relations with Colonel Hans Oster, who occupied a high position in the Abwehr. [Costa Rica Fishing and Tours](http://costa-ricafishing.com/)
 Oster warned Sas about German plans for an offensive against the Netherlands, Belgium and France, and Sas passed the warnings on. The government in the Netherlands, however, did not take them seriously, as the offensive was postponed several times, even though Oster did eventually offer the correct date of May 10, 1940.

#### WMF Denial of Service Vulnerability - CVE-2007-1211:

A denial of service vulnerability exists in Windows when rendering Windows Metafile (WMF) image format files. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause the affected system to stop responding and possibly restart.

#### Mitigating Factors for WMF Denial of Service Vulnerability - CVE-2007-1211:

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to convince them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's Web site. After they click the link, they would be prompted to perform several actions. An attack could only occur after they performed these actions.
* The vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker who convinced a user to open a specially crafted file or to view a folder that contains the specially crafted image. There is no way for an attacker to force a user to open a specially crafted file, except potentially through previewing an e-mail message.

#### Workarounds for WMF Denial of Service Vulnerability - CVE-2007-1211:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section\*\*.\*\*

* **Read e-mail messages in plain text format if you are using Outlook 2002 Service Pack 3 or a later version, or Outlook Express 6 SP1 or a later version, to help protect yourself from the HTML e-mail attack vector.**

  Customers using Microsoft Outlook 2002 Service Pack 3 and Microsoft Outlook Express 6 Service Pack 1 or later versions can enable this setting and view e-mail messages that are not digitally signed or e-mail messages that are not encrypted in plain text only.

  Digitally signed e-mail messages or encrypted e-mail messages are not affected by the setting and may be read in their original formats. For more information about how to enable this setting in Outlook 2002, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 307594](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/307594).

  For more information about how to enable this setting in Outlook Express 6, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 291387](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/291387).

  **Impact of Workaround:** E-mail messages that are viewed in plain text format will not contain pictures, specialized fonts, animations, or other rich content. Additionally:

  + The changes are applied to the preview pane and to open messages.
  + Pictures become attachments so that they are not lost.
  + Because the message is still in Rich Text or HTML format in the store, the object model (custom code solutions) may behave unexpectedly.

#### FAQ for WMF Denial of Service Vulnerability - CVE-2007-1211:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a denial of service vulnerability. An attacker who exploited this vulnerability could cause the affected system to stop responding and automatically restart. Note that the denial of service vulnerability would not allow attackers to execute code or elevate their privileges, but it could cause the affected program to stop accepting requests.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused by an attempt to read a data value that contains an invalid memory reference.

**What is the Windows Metafile (WMF) image formats?**

The WMF image format is a 16-bit metafile format that can contain both vector information and bitmap information. It is optimized for the Windows operating system.

For more information about image types and formats, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 320314](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/320314). Additional information about these file formats is also available at the [MSDN Library Web Site](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/gdicpp/gdiplus/aboutgdiplus/imagesbitmapsandmetafiles/metafiles.asp).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause the affected system to stop responding and possibly restart.

**Who could exploit the vulnerability?**

In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to convince them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site. It could also be possible to display specially crafted Web content by using banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver Web content to affected systems.

**How could an attacker exploit this vulnerability?**

The vulnerability could be exploited on the affected systems by an attacker who persuaded a user to open a specially crafted file or to view a folder that contains the specially crafted image. There is no way for an attacker to force a user to open a specially crafted file, except potentially through previewing an email message.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if users who do not have sufficient administrative permissions are given the ability to log on to servers and run programs or browse the Internet. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**I am running Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003. Does this mitigate this vulnerability?**

Yes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 runs in a restricted mode that is known as Enhanced Security Configuration. This mode sets the security level for the Internet zone to High. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that have not been added to Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone.

**What is the Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration?**

Internet Explorer [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/workshop/security/szone/overview/esc_changes.asp) is a group of preconfigured Internet Explorer settings that reduce the likelihood of a user or of an administrator downloading and running specially crafted Web content on a server. Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration reduces this risk by modifying many security-related settings. This includes the settings on the **Security** tab and the **Advanced** tab in the **Internet Options** dialog box. Some of the important modifications include the following:

* Security level for the Internet zone is set to **High**. This setting disables scripts, ActiveX controls, Microsoft Java Virtual Machine (MSJVM), and file downloads.
* Automatic detection of intranet sites is disabled. This setting assigns all intranet Web sites and all Universal Naming Convention (UNC) paths that are not explicitly listed in the Local intranet zone to the Internet zone.
* Install On Demand and non-Microsoft browser extensions are disabled. This setting prevents Web pages from automatically installing components and prevents non-Microsoft extensions from running.
* Multimedia content is disabled. This setting prevents music, animations, and video clips from running.

For more information regarding Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration, see the guide, Managing Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration, at the following [Web site](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=d41b036c-e2e1-4960-99bb-9757f7e9e31b).

#### Mitigating Factors for Windows Animated Cursor Remote Code Execution Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0038:

* Customers who are using Windows Internet Explorer 7 on Windows Vista are protected from currently known web based attacks due to Internet Explorer Protected Mode. For more information on Internet Explorer Protected Mode see the following [Windows Web site](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/windowsvista/features/details/ie7protectedmode.mspx).
* By default, Microsoft Office Outlook 2007 uses Microsoft Word to display e-mail messages which protects customers from the HTML e-mail preview and attack vector.
* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker could also attempt to compromise a Web site to have it serve up a Web page with malicious content attempting to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site or a site compromised by the attacker.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

#### Workarounds for Windows Animated Cursor Remote Code Execution Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0038:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. Although these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

* **Read e-mail messages in plain text format if you are using Outlook 2002 Service Pack 3 or a later version to help protect yourself from the HTML e-mail attack vector.**

  Customers using Microsoft Outlook 2002 Service Pack 3 and Microsoft Outlook Express 6 Service Pack 1 or later versions can enable this setting and view e-mail messages that are not digitally signed or e-mail messages that are not encrypted in plain text only.

  **Note** Reading e-mail in plain text on Outlook Express does **not** mitigate attempts to exploit this vulnerability.

  **Note** While reading e-mail in plain text on Windows Mail in Windows Vista does mitigate attempts to exploit the vulnerability it does **not** provide mitigation if forwarding or replying to e-mail messages sent by an attacker.

  **Impact of Workaround:** E-mail messages that are viewed in plain text format will not contain pictures, specialized fonts, animations, or other rich content. Additionally

  + The changes are applied to the preview pane and to open messages.
  + Pictures become attachments so that they are not lost.
  + Because the message is still in Rich Text or HTML format in the store, the object model (custom code solutions) may behave unexpectedly.

#### FAQ for Windows Animated Cursor Remote Code Execution Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0038:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This isa remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full privileges. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer privileges on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative privileges.

**Notes** When you install these security updates, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the Update.exe installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the frequently asked question, âCan I use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) to determine whether this update is required?â in the section, Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update, earlier in this bulletin.
* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry keys.

  For Windows XP Home Edition Service Pack 2, Windows XP Professional Service Pack 2, Windows XP Tablet PC Edition 2005, and Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005:

  HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows XP\SP3\KB925902\Filelist

  For Windows XP Professional x64 Edition and Windows XP Professional x64 Edition Service Pack 2:

  HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows XP Version 2003\SP3\KB925902\Filelist

  **Note** These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly if an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams the security update into the Windows installation source files.

#### Windows Server 2003 (all versions)

**Prerequisites**

This security update requires Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1, Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 2, Windows Server 2003 for Itanium-based Systems, Windows Server 2003 with SP1 for Itanium-based Systems, Windows Server 2003 with SP2 for Itanium-based Systems, Windows Server 2003 x64 Edition, or Windows Server 2003 x64 Edition Service Pack 2.

**Inclusion in Future Service Packs**

The update for this issue will be included in future service pack or update rollup.

**Installation Information**

This security update supports the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/help** | Displays the command-line options. |
| Setup Modes |  |
| **/passive** | Unattended Setup mode. No user interaction is required, but installation status is displayed. If a restart is required at the end of setup, a dialog box will be presented to the user with a timer warning that the computer will restart in 30 seconds. |
| **/quiet** | Quiet mode. This is the same as unattended mode, but no status or error messages are displayed. |
| Restart Options |  |
| **/norestart** | Does not restart when installation has completed. |
| **/forcerestart** | Restarts the computer after installation and forces other applications to close at shutdown without saving open files first. |
| **/warnrestart[:x]** | Displays a dialog box with a timer warning the user that the computer will restart in *x* seconds. (The default setting is 30 seconds.) Intended for use with the **/quiet** switch or the **/passive** switch. |
| **/promptrestart** | Display a dialog box prompting the local user to allow a restart. |
| Special Options |  |
| **/overwriteoem** | Overwrites OEM files without prompting. |
| **/nobackup** | Does not back up files needed for uninstallation. |
| **/forceappsclose** | Forces other programs to close when the computer shuts down. |
| **/log: path** | Allows the redirection of installation log files. |
| **/integrate:path** | Integrates the update into the Windows source files. These files are located at the path that is specified in the switch. |
| **/extract[:path]** | Extracts files without starting the Setup program. |
| **/ER** | Enables extended error reporting. |
| **/verbose** | Enables verbose logging. During installation, creates %Windir%\CabBuild.log. This log details the files that are copied. Using this switch may cause the installation to proceed more slowly. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports many of the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841). For more information about the Update.exe installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

**Deployment Information**

To install the security update without any user intervention, use the following command at a command prompt for Windows Server 2003:

**Windowsserver2003-kb925902-x86-enu /quiet**

**Note** Use of the **/quiet** switch will suppress all messages. This includes suppressing failure messages. Administrators should use one of the supported methods to verify the installation was successful when they use the **/quiet** switch. Administrators should also review the KB925902.log file for any failure messages when they use this switch.

To install the security update without forcing the system to restart, use the following command at a command prompt for Windows Server 2003:

**Windowsserver2003-kb925902-x86-enu /norestart**

For information about how to deploy this security update by using Software Update Services, visit the [Software Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21125). For more information about how to deploy this security update using Windows Server Update Services, visit the [Windows Server Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=50120).

**Restart Requirement**

You must restart your system after you apply this security update.

This security update does not support HotPatching. For more information about HotPatching, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 897341](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/897341).

**Note** Not all security updates support HotPatching, and some security updates that support HotPatching might require that you restart the server after you install the security update. HotPatching is only supported if the files being replaced by the security update are General Distribution Release (GDR) files. HotPatching is not supported if you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of the files included in the security update. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 897341](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/897341)and [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

**Notes** When you install these security updates, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the frequently asked question, âCan I use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) to determine whether this update is required?â in the section, Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update, earlier in this bulletin.
* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

False positives are a universal problem as they affect both signature-based and anomaly-based IDSs. Finally, attackers can overload IT personnel by forging ad-hoc packets to produce false alerts, thereby lowering the defences of the IT infrastructure.  Our thesis is that one of the main reasons why NIDSs show a high false positive rate is that they do not correlate input with output traffic: by observing the output determined by the alert-raising input traffic, one is capable of reducing the number of false positives in an effective manner. To demonstrate this, we have developed APHRODITE (Architecture for false Positives Reduction): an innovative architecture for reducing the false positive rate of any NIDS (be it signature-based or anomaly-based). APHRODITE consists of an Output Anomaly Detector (OAD) and a correlation engine; in addition, APHRODITE assumes the presence of a NIDS on the input of the system. For the OAD we developed POSEIDON (Payl Over Som for Intrusion DetectiON): a two-tier network intrusion detection architecture.  Benchmarks performed on POSEIDON and APHRODITE with DARPA 1999 dataset and with traffic dumped from a real-world public network show the effectiveness of the two systems. APHRODITE is able to reduce the rate of false alarms from 50% to 100% (improving accuracy) without reducing the NIDS ability to detect attacks (completeness). | | Damiano Bolzoni received a MSc degree from the University of Venice, Italy, in Computer Science with a thesis about anomaly-based Network Intrusion Detection Systems.

The implementation of virtual machine could be divided into two categories by the virtualization extent employed, those are full virtualization and para-virtualization, the latter has come up and been used in most recent years; the “para” means making some assumptions about or doing some modifications on the Target OS. In addition, according to the difference of virtual machine monitor(VMM)’s structure, there are type I and type II VMM, and the type II could be referred to as the hosted VMM as well. As the virtualization technology continues developing and becomes more prevalent, the two biggest processor manufacturers in the world both have developed their new CPU technologies which support virtualization, the Intel VT-x and AMD Pacifica. However, all of the following discussion will still aim at the traditional x86 platform as that is by far the most widely used. The virtualizable processor architecture requires that all the sensitive instructions could be trapped when running with the degraded privilege level. Unfortunately there exists a few non-virtualizable instructions that make x86 a non-strictly virtualizable architecture. In order to achieve the full virtualization of x86, some extremely complicated software techniques should be used to overcome these architectural limitations.  Being an excellent virtual machine software product, VMware has implemented the full virtualization of x86. We take the VMware Workstation version as an example to give a brief introduction about the architecture, basic working principle and some core technologies used of the type II VMM. As a hosted structure, there are two OS contexts, the host and the guest, so VMware must use the total context switch method to ensure necessary execution environment isolation. VMware uses privilege compression and dual execution modes (direct execution and binary translation) to virtualize the instruction execution part of x86 CPU. Direct execution with ring degradation would let a majority of common instructions run natively, and trap most of the sensitive ones at the same time. However, the binary translator would be used to deal with the non-virtualizable instructions. The execution mode selection will be made by the appropriate decision-making module which depends on the CPU’s current mode, privilege level and segment state. It is worthy to point out that binary translation is a very complicated but useful software technique which is also referred to as dynamic recompilation. Besides the fact that the code generation is highly difficult and complex, it will also handle the translation cache’s synchronization and coherency. However, another technique, used by Plex86, that solves the same problem seems much simpler, which should be a good choice for implementing a light weight VMM. In addition to virtualizing the instruction execution part, VMware also applies some other techniques to virtualize the CPU’s segmentation, paging and interrupt/exception system components, such as deferred shadow segmentation, shadow paging and interrupt/exception forwarding. As to device virtualization, VMware chooses the method of full emulation which provides a complete set of virtual devices that are totally different from the true hardware devices. Since the device emulation depends completely on how each given hardware device works, the implementation method varies.  At present, the virtualization technology has been widely used in many computer related fields, but the research and application of virtualization on the security area is still in an elementary state. Virtualization technology could be applied to developing a non-intrusive debugger, a honey pot that traps malicious programs, and VM Based Rootkits. The Microsoft research team working together with Michigan University has developed a VM Based Rootkit prototype named SubVirt. SubVirt could gain system control after the Target OS was infected and rebooted. SubVirt then made the Target OS run within the context of a VM, while SubVirt itself would run directly on the true hardware. SubVirt could control the behavior of the target system via a VMM and provide some malicious services externally. However some inherent and obvious defects of SubVirt greatly reduced its practicality. Finally, as the most key part of the presentation, we will discuss the complete technical scheme of a novel VM Based Rootkit. The VMBR itself is sort of light weight VMM. After the VMBR is loaded, the VMBR will ensure the target system is still running by placing it into a rootkit created virtual execution environment. It then becomes very difficult for the victim to perceive the rootkits’ presence or to find any virtualization footprint. Although this novel VMBR is just a proof of concept, it has at least achieved the coexisting transparently and perfectly with the target system.

Although it's true that kernel-mode exploitation often presents some new challenges for exploit developers, it still all boils down to "creative debugging" and knowledge about the target in question.  This talk intends to demystify kernel-mode exploitation by demonstrating the analysis and reliable exploitation of three different kernel vulnerabilities without public exploits. From a defenders point of view this could hopefully serve as an eye-opener, as it demonstrates the ineffectiveness of HIDS, NX, ASLR and other protective measures when the kernel itself is being exploited.  The entire process will be discussed, including how the vulnerabilities were found, how they were analyzed to determine if and how they can be reliably exploited and of course the exploits will be demonstrated in practice.

As this model is dominating in the industry and the community, we show that our novel embedded architecture is more adapted when debuggee systems are hostile and protected at the operating system level.  This alternative modelization is also more performant as the debugger executes from inside the debuggee program and can read the memory of the host process directly. We give detailed information about how to keep memory unintrusiveness using a new technique called allocation proxying.  We reveal how we developed the organization of our multi-architecture framework and its multiple modules so that they allow for graph-based binary code analysis, compositional fingerprinting, program instrumentation, real-time tracing, multithread debugging and general hooking of systems.

But is it? How do you know that the scanner exercised all the vital areas of your application? How accurate and complete are the results? Is relying on HTTP response the best way to find all vulnerabilities in an application? What if there was a way to look at what’s happening inside the application while these web scanners were hitting the application?  In this talk, we’ll explore that “looking inside the application as the security test runs” possibility—through byte-code instrumentation. We will see how we can use aspect oriented technologies such as AspectJ to inject security monitors directly inside a pre-compiled Java / .NET web application. We will also go through a proof of concept and demo—turning a typical blackbox test into a ‘whitebox’ test using the techniques discussed in this talk, gaining a more complete picture: gaining coverage insight, finding more vulnerabilities, weeding out false positives reported by the scanners, and gaining root cause source information. | | Toshinari Kureha is the technical lead and principal member of technical staff at Fortify Software.

Due to deregulation and a push toward all-IP architecture, SS7 is opening up, notably with SIGTRAN (SS7 over IP) and NGN (Next Gen Networks) initiatives.  SCTP is the protocol used to carry all telecom signalling information on IP according to the SIGTRAN protocol suite. It's the foundation, as TCP is the foundation for the web and email. SCTP is also used for high-performance clusters, resources pooling and very high-speed file transfer.  When you discover open SCTP ports, you discover a secret door to this walled garden. As a walled garden, the internal security of the SS7 network is not as good as one might expect. SCTPscan is a tool to do exactly just that, and is released as open source.  This presentation will explain how SCTPscan manages to scan without being detected by remote application, how discrepancies between RFC and implementation enable us to scan more efficiently and how we manage to scan without even being detect by systems like SANS - Dshield.org. Here we will have a look at INIT packet construction, stealth scanning and a beginning of SCTP fingerprinting.  Then, we go on to detail upper layer protocols that use SCTP and the potentials of the SIGTRAN protcol suite in term of security. We'll see the M2UA, M3UA, M2PA, IUA which are SIGTRAN-specific protocols, and also the more generic SS7 protocols such as ISUP, BICC, BSSAP, TCAP, SCCP and MTP. | | Philippe Langlois is a founder and Senior Security Consultant for Telecom Security Task Force, a research and consultancy outfit.

He started in the computer industry in the late Seventies, working as a computer programmer on PDP-8 and other mini computers, and then on various Unix, Dos and CP/M based micro computers as they emerged in the Eighties. He quickly became interested in the underlying network and data protocols, and moved his attention to those areas and away from programming, starting a data conversion company which rapidly grew to become Europe's largest specialist in that field (A.L. downloading Services). During this period, he successfully disproved the industry lie that music CDs could not be read by computers, and, with help from his brother Ben, wrote the world's first CD ripper, 'CDGRAB'.

Detailed analysis of SMTP headers can be used to map the networks traversed by messages, including information on the messaging software of clients and gateways. Furthermore, analysis of messages over time can reveal organization patching policies and trends in user location and movements—making headers a very valuable resource during the target selection phase of targeted attacks. | | Lluis Mora is a researcher at Neutralbit, a research and development provider for information security vendors, where he specializes in vulnerability assessments and penetration testing of products, applications and products.

Very little information can be found on the Net and almost every question related to security assessment of these applications keeps being unanswered. Besides, very few public presentations on the subject are available.  At CYBSEC, we had been researching SAP security casually, mostly because we came across some of its components while performing penetration tests in our customers. During that superficial research, we discovered more than 20 vulnerabilities (not all of them has been published yet), some of them highly critical.  Several months ago, we decided to perform a deep research over SAP security. We went really deep, down to SAP 's heart: the SAP RFC (Remote Function Call) Interface.  SAP RFC is the heart of communications between SAP systems, and between SAP and external software. Almost every system that wants to interact with SAP does so using the RFC interface. As stated by SAP: "The RFC library is the most commonly used and installed component of existing SAP software".  Our presentation will describe, after a short description of RFC interface purpose and internals, new vulnerabilities discovered in our research, both in the RFC protocol implementation and in the RFC Library itself.  Beyond new vulnerabilities discovered, our presentation will include description of some new advanced attacks we have developed, abusing default mis-configurations and design vulnerabilities. These are mainly RFC connection hi-jacking and MITM attacks, targeting connections between SAP R/3 and external programs working as RFC servers.  To make knowledge practical and publicly available, we will be presenting and releasing a new open-source tool, which will enable penetration testers and researchers to perform security assessments of SAP systems' RFC interface, allowing them to mine information and exploit the vulnerabilities and attacks described during our presentation.  As we are still researching on this subject, more attacks and vulnerabilities may be discovered before the conference day, which would be included in our presentation. | | Mariano Nuñez Di Croce has been working as a security consultant for CYBSEC for the last 3 years, focused on Penetration Testing and Vulnerability Research.

Despite the massive impact of XSRF, the attack remains extremely difficult to complete, as it requires an attacker to blindly strike against external domains, praying their attacks were successful. Now, imagine a new scenario... a scenario where an attacker can instantly see the results of their cross domain attacks. Imagine that an attacker can now steal cookies from a site you haven't been to in a week, brute force username/password combinations for internal network devices, or use your browser to run a Nikto scan against a website you've never visited!  The complexity of XSRF and Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attacks have grown by bounds over the last few years... but the two exploits are rarely used to complement each other. During this presentation, you will see the impact of an XSRF/XSS one-two combination as we demonstrate a variety of cutting-edge web application attacks, including techniques to break through the cross domain boundary. The specific demonstrations you will see are:   * Using a victim’s browser as a proxy to surf the Internet/intranet* Stealing a victim’s cookies (and other information) from external domains* Using a victim's browser to attack internal network devices* Using the victim's browser to run Nikto against an external domain (and getting back the results) | | Billy Rios is a Senior researcher for Ernst and Young's Advanced Security Center.

As the market is still evolving and one framework has been quite successful on the market: "Cisco Network Admission Control". NAC is a pivotal part of Cisco’s "Self Defending Network" strategy and supported on the complete range of Cisco network- and security-products. From a security point of view “NAC” is a very interesting emerging technology which deservers some scrutiny. We are able to hack the Cisco NAC-solution by exploiting a fundamental design flaw.  Part II: NAC Technology – How it works: The basic idea behind Cisco NAC is quite simple: Before allowing a client admittance to the network the client is tested against a predefined set of “policies”. These tests are performed by a backend system (a Cisco ACS) which processes .credentials supplied by the client against one or more administrator-defined policies. Based on the result of these tests a client is categorized and a well-defined access-level to the network is granted. While the client is connected to the network it is repeatedly rechecked and the state of the client is reassessed. On a somewhat more technical layer the communication takes place using EAP over UDP with undisclosed Cisco-proprietary EAP messages and the UDP connection itself is secured using SSL. The connection-point to the network (e.g. the switch, wireless AP, Firewall, Router, etc.) acts sort of as a "translating proxy" between the client talking EAPoU and the Cisco Secure ACS server talking RADIUS [Client <-EAPoU-> Switch <-RADIUS-> ACS). Besides this "proxy"-functionality the connection-point also acts as an enforcing element of the security policy. Three somewhat different deployment flavours of Cisco NAC exist but the underlying concept “admittance-level based on the result of a test” is always the same.  For every .NAC-enabled application on the client a client-side agent provides so called “credentials” to the ACS server where they are compared against the defined tests to derive a “posture token” per application. From all application posture tokens an overall “system posture token” is inferred which determines the access-level granted to the client. The client-side agent of the framework responsible for the communication is the “Cisco Trust Agent” (CTA) which also includes the capability to report a few basic credentials (e.g. OS Version, Hostname, etc) without an additional NAC-enabled application. The CTA contains an API enabling third-party vendors to hook their applications into the NAC framework. Anti-Virus Vendors have been among the first to join the NAC-Alliance formed by Cisco.  Part III: The Problem – NAC is not “secure by design”: The Cisco NAC solution contains at least one major design-flaw which enables us to hack (at least) two of the three different variants: The server authenticates itself to the client using a server-certificate and client and server establish a secure tunnel (something like “SSL over UDP”), but the client does not authenticate itself to the server, so we have a situation in which a component (the client) is authorized without prior authentication. After realizing this fundamental design-error, the idea of a “posture spoofing attack” was born and research started with evaluating different attack-vectors for their feasibility. In the end we decided to analyse the protocols used within the framework and code our own “NAC-client” which provides the ACS with attacker-supplied-credentials in order to get illegitimate access to NAC-secured networks.  Part IV: The Hack – how we did it NAC is a complex system involving different protocols which are used in an odd combination. Especially the usage of SSL over UDP/EAP-FAST over UDP made the usage of SSL-Proxies for man-in-the-middle attacks or clear-text-traffic-analysis with standard methods impossible. So instead of focusing on the network-traffic (which was our first approach – “stare at the packets until you understand them”), we decided to focus on the client first. Analysing the CTA client in different versions and on different operating systems revealed some of the inner workings of the protocols. Besides “Client analysis” we built a NAC test-lab and developed a “NAC-test-suite” to implement different “admission-scenarios”. While running theses tests we hooked into the interesting functions of the client in order to understand the functions used and their (inter)dependencies. As a next step we started coding our own NAC client to get a better insight into the communication process. The first goal was to get a clear text dump of the communication by establishing the secure tunnel. The next goal was to provide our own credentials to the ACS in order to get access to the NAC protected network. We will release our "NAC-Credential-Spoofing"-tool at the conference alongside with our insight into the operating of NAC.  Part V: Our proposed talk We do not wish to simply release a tool; we want the audience to understand how Cisco NAC works, why it is not as secure as Cisco wants us to believe and which mitigations exist, if NAC is implemented (there actually exist mitigations and secure setup-approaches). We will present our approach, disclose technical details yet unpublished and release our tool. As an “add-on”-benefit we will explain how to tackle a complex system like NAC when doing security research. | | Dror has enjoyed working with Cisco stuff for more than eight years and is usually busy assessing the security of enterprise networks and data-centers.

The heap protection features in the latest versions of Windows have been effective at stopping the basic exploitation techniques. In most cases bypassing the protection requires a great degree of control over the allocation patterns of the vulnerable application.  This presentation introduces a new technique for precise manipulation of the browser heap layout using specific sequences of JavaScript allocations. This allows an attacker to set up the heap in any desired state and exploit difficult heap corruption vulnerabilities with great reliability and precision.  This talk will begin with an overview of the current state of browser heap exploitation and the unreliability of many heap exploits. It will continue with a discussion of Internet Explorer heap internals and the techniques for JavaScript heap manipulation. I will present a JavaScript heap exploitation library that exposes an abstract heap manipulation API. Its use will be demonstrated by exploit code for two complex heap corruption vulnerabilities.  The talk will focus on Internet Explorer exploitation, but the general technique presented is applicable to other browsers as well. | | Alexander Sotirov has been involved in computer security since 1998, when he started contributing to Phreedom Magazine, a Bulgarian underground technical publication.

The second is a complementary section dealing with ASLR in Windows Vista, its implementation and some surprising results...  Part I Synopsis: GS is a Visual Studio compiler option that was introduced in Visual Studio 2002 to mitigate the local stack variable overflows that resulted in arbitrary code execution. The following paper details the methods Symantec used to assess which binaries within Windows Vista 32bit leveraged GS as a defensive mechanism. This paper presents the results of this analysis, the techniques that have been developed, and supporting material. The results in this paper are from the 32bit RTM release of Microsoft Windows Vista  Part II Synopsis: Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) is a mitigation technique designed to hinder the ability of an attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution when exploiting software vulnerabilities. As the name implies, ASLR involves placing a computer program and its associated memory at random locations, either between reboots or executions, to hinder the attacker's ability to reliably locate either their shell code or other required data. This paper is the result of a brief analysis of the implementation of ASLR within Microsoft Windows Vista 32bit RTM, conducted by Symantec's Advanced Threat Research. | | Ollie Whitehouse has worked in information security both as a consultant and researcher.

It makes the process of finding many common webapp flaws much easier. The user simply navigates the target site while using the WebScarab proxy and ScarabMon constantly updates the user with information on discovered flaws.  ScarabMon is written in Python and all code and modules will be released at the conference.  ScarabMon is also easily extensible, with useful checks often only requiring 5-10 lines of Python code.  I wrote ScarabMon because I couldn't find anything like it.  Historically the standard web proxies have been @Stake's WebProxy (which is totally unavailable anymore as Symantec killed it after the acquisition), SpikeProxy and WebScarab. Those have have recently been joined by two other apps, WebScarab-NG and Pantera.  The latter are not ready for serious usage yet. Pantera development seems to have stalled and WebScarab-NG is missing major features, though it shows the most promise. The latest date on any of the SPIKEProxy files is from 2003.  So basically everyone uses WebScarab for web application pen tests.  WebScarab is obnoxious to program for, as you have to write dozens of lines of Java code (BeanShell) for the simplest tasks. BeanShell is also often unstable.  ScarabMon is currently designed to work with WebScarab, but could be ported to work with any of the above should the need arise. Instead of acting as a proxy, it just monitors the output of the proxy and opportunistically performs tests. Some tests are things people have seen before in other tools (like finding directories that support PUT) and others aren't anything I've seen in any other tool such as finding values that were set as cookies over SSL that later wind up as a query string parameter.  The best thing is that you get all of this for free. You don't have to change \*anything\* about your current testing methodology. You just run ScarabMon in the background and it sees the servers and files you're accessing and generates findings.  Module findings include:   * Insecure Web server SSL configuration* Secure cookie values that later get sent clear or as query string values* Listable webserver directories* Webserver directories that allow upload (via PUT)* Values that cross domain boundaries* Offsite redirects* Values set over SSL that also go cleartext* Fuzzing                 and many more |   [Return to the top of the page](#Top "Return to the top of the page")   | 360° Anomaly Based Unsupervised Intrusion Detection Stefano Zanero, Partner and CTO, Secure Network | | --- | | In this talk, after briefly reviewing why we should build a good anomaly-based intrusion detection system, we will briefly present two IDS prototypes developed at the Politecnico di Milano for network and host based intrusion detection through unsupervised algorithms.
