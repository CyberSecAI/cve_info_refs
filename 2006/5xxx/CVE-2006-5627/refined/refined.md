    {
      "cve": "CVE-2006-5627",
      "source": "www.exploit-db.com_fcdc4e9a_20250124_160946.html",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a failure to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the 'adminfolderpath' parameter within multiple PHP files of QnECMS. This allows an attacker to include a remote file.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server by including a malicious remote file, typically a command shell.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "HTTP GET requests to vulnerable PHP files with the 'adminfolderpath' parameter.",
           "The exploit script targets several PHP files, including:\n        - `admin/include/headerscripts.php`\n        - `admin/include/footerhome.php`\n        - `admin/include/footermain.php`\n        - `photogallery/headerscripts.php`\n        - `templates/footerhome.php`\n        - `templates/footermain.php`\n        - `templates/headermain.php`\n        - `templates/sitemapfooter.php`\n        - `templates/sitemapheader.php`"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the target server and must have access to a web server to host a malicious PHP file (a command shell).",
        "additional_information":"The provided exploit code is a Perl script that demonstrates how to exploit this vulnerability, allowing an attacker to specify a target URL, a remote command shell URL, and a command variable. The script allows interactive command execution on the victim server."
