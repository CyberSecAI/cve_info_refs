{
  "CVE-2006-5100": {
    "Description": "The webapps/Web//News 1.4 application contains a remote file inclusion vulnerability due to a missing sanitization of the WN_BASEDIR variable when parsing the parse/parser.php script.",
    "Root cause": "The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input (specifically the `WN_BASEDIR` variable) in the `parse/parser.php` file. This allows an attacker to include arbitrary remote files.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)",
      "Lack of input sanitization"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can include and execute arbitrary code from a remote server. This could lead to a full compromise of the vulnerable web server, allowing for data theft, malware installation, or complete server takeover.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exploited by sending a crafted HTTP request to `parse/parser.php` with a malicious URL set in the `WN_BASEDIR` parameter.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server and have access to a web server containing the malicious code to be included."
