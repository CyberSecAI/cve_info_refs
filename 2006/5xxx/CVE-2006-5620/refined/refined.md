```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The application includes a file based on a user-controlled parameter, `config[page_dir]`, without proper sanitization.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can include a malicious file from a remote server, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server hosting the vulnerable application.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability can be exploited via a specially crafted HTTP GET request.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application and have a web server to host the malicious code.
