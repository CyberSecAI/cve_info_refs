How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

 [8 Comments](https://www.osnews.com/story/141600/snowdrop-os-a-homebrew-operating-system-from-scratch-in-x86-assembly-language/#comments)

> Snowdrop OS was born of my childhood curiosity around what happens when a PC is turned on, the mysteries of bootable disks, and the hidden aspects of operating systems. It is a 16-bit real mode operating system for the IBM PC architecture. I designed and developed this homebrew OS from scratch, using only x86 assembly language.
>
> I have created and included a number of utilities, including a file manager, text editor, graphical applications, BASIC interpreter, x86 assembler and debugger. I also ported one of my DOS games to it. After all, what kind of an operating system doesn’t have games?
>
> [↫ Snowdrop OS’ website](http://sebastianmihai.com/snowdrop/)

It seems like every talented programmer will, at some point, think to themselves: I should write my own operating system. Most of these efforts strand pretty quickly – and that’s fine! – but Sebastian Mihai’s effort did not, and it has grown into a very capable operating system, especially given the constraints stemming from the chosen architecture – 16bit realmode x86 – and programming language – x86 assembly. Snowdrop OS is an incredibly impressive labour of love, and comes with a unique extra I haven’t seen before: a daily development log covering over 600 days of development.

No, this won’t take over the world, but I love that is exists. More of this, please.

> NixBSD is an attempt to make a reproducible and declarable BSD, based on [NixOS](https://nixos.org/). Although theoretically much of this work could be copied to build other BSDs, all work thus far has been focused on building a FreeBSD distribution.

Look, it’s my job to make sure I use and am familiar with as many operating systems and related tools as possible. As much as you guys support OSNews on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/osnews) or [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/thomholwerda/), it’s going to take a lot of you to push me to dive into Nix and [NixOS](https://nixos.org/), because every time I hear anything about it, people seem entirely in over their heads and spending way, way too much time trying to properly use it. I have a wife and two little children, and as much as Nix intrigues and fascinates, I’m not going to [lose my sanity to it](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2Fsida52tgy9kb1.png).

Anyway, combining NixOS with FreeBSD seems like a fun project and a great idea, and also kind of an inevitability – any cool technology eventually makes its way to BSD in one way or another, after all. The project is in flux, and they’re not at the stage where you can just download an ISO and get going, but if you’re already knee-deep in Nix and want a new challenge, this might be right up your alley. Me, I’m not learning a programing language just to manage my packages.

Or should I? For the memes?

SDL, the Simple DirectMedia Layer, has released version 3.2.0 of its development library. In case you don’t know what SDL is:

> Simple DirectMedia Layer is a cross-platform development library designed to provide low level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, and graphics hardware via OpenGL and Direct3D. It is used by video playback software, emulators, and popular games including [Valve](https://www.valvesoftware.com/)‘s award winning catalog and many [Humble Bundle](https://www.humblebundle.com/) games.
>
> [↫ SDL website](https://libsdl.org/)

This new release has a lot of improvements and changes, and [going through the changelog](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases/tag/release-3.2.0), you’ll notice that they’ve massively improved the documentation, made the API naming conventions more consistent, added a ton of features for better platform integration, added camera and pen APIs, improved HiDPI support, and a ton more.

 [7 Comments](https://www.osnews.com/story/141590/9front-this-time-definitely-released/#comments)

The operating system I’m not cool enough to run has pushed out a new release: [9front “THIS TIME DEFINITELY” is now available](http://9front.org/releases/2025/01/19/0/). 9front is a fork of plan9, created after plan9 languished at Bell Labs. This release enables [gefs](https://shithub.us/ori/gefs/HEAD/info.html), the [new file system](https://orib.dev/gefs.html), in the installer, “ip/ipconfig now support dhcpv6 dynamic allocations and handles prefix expirations”, and it comes with some smaller changes, too, of course.

Despite every piece of evidence to the contrary, I am simply not cool enough to run 9front. Maybe one day they’ll notice me, and I get invited to the cool table where the Puffs eat lunch. Who doesn’t want to ring a bell in the headmaster’s office at midnight?

> This should apply regardless of the computer’s form factor. In addition to traditional computing devices like PCs and laptops, this right should apply to devices like mobile phones, “smart home” appliances, and even industrial equipment like tractors.
>
> In 2025, we’re ultra-connected via a network of devices we do not have full control over.

It should be illegal for any manufacturer of computing devices – with a possible exception for, say, things like medical implants, certain aspects of car control units, and so on – to lock down and/or restrict owners’ ability to install whatever software they want, run whatever code they want, and install whatever operating system they want on the devices that they own. Computers are interwoven into the very fabric of every aspect of our society, and having them under the sole control of the biggest megacorporations in the world is utterly dystopian, and wildly dangerous.

Personally, I would take it a step further: any and all code that runs on products sold must be open. Not necessarily open source, but at the very least open, so that it can be inspected when malice is suspected. This way, society can make sure that the tech billionaire oligarchs [giving nazi salutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VfYjPzj1Xw) aren’t in full, black-box control over our devices. Secrecy as a means of corporate control is incredibly dangerous, and forcing all code to be open is the perfect way to combat this. Copyright is more than enough intellectual property protection for code.

The odds of this happening are, of course, slim, especially with the aforementioned tech billionaire oligarchs [giving nazi salutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VfYjPzj1Xw) effectively running the most powerful military in human history. [Reason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment) is in short supply these days, and I doubt that’s going to change any time soon.

They still managed to do it, but had to employ some incredibly clever tricks to make it work, and make it work fast. Such skillful engineers interested in optimising and eeking the most possible performance out of underpowered hardware still exist today, but they’re not in any position to make lasting changes at any of the companies defining our technology today. Why spend money on skilled engineers, when you can just throw cheap hardware at the problem?

I wonder just how many resources the spellchecking feature in Word or LibreOffice Writer takes up.

> GrapheneOS (written GOS from now on) is an Android based operating system that focuses security. It is only compatible with Google Pixel devices for multiple reasons: availability of hardware security components, long term support (series 8 and 9 are supported at least 7 years after release) and the hardware has a good quality / price ratio.
>
> The goal of GOS is to provide users a lot more control about what their smartphone is doing. A main profile is used by default (the owner profile), but users are encouraged to do all their activities in a separate profile (or multiples profiles). This may remind you about Qubes OS workflow, although it does not translate entirely here. Profiles can not communicate between each others, encryption is done per profile, and some permissions can be assigned per profile (installing apps, running applications in background when a profile is not used, using the SIM…). This is really effective for privacy or security reasons (or both), you can have a different VPN per profile if you want, or use a different Google Play login, different applications sets, whatever! The best feature here in my opinion is the ability to completely stop a profile so you are sure it does not run anything in the background once you exit it.

I switched to GrapheneOS on my Pixel 8 Pro as part of my process to cleanse myself of as much Big Tech as possible, and I’ve been incredibly happy with it. The additional security and privacy control GrapheneOS brings is amazing, and the fact it opted for a sandboxed Google Play Services basically means there’s no compatibility issues, unlike when using microG, where compatibility problems are a fact of life. GrapheneOS’ security and other updates are on par or even faster than the stock Google Pixel’s Android, and the overall user experience is virtually identical to stock Android.

The only downside is the reliance on Pixel devices – it’s an understandable choice, but does mean giving money to Google if you don’t already own a Pixel. A workaround, if you will, is to buy a used or refurbished Pixel, but that may not always be an option either. For me personally, I’ll be sticking with my Pixel 8 Pro for a long time, but if it were to break, I’d most likely go the used Pixel route to avoid enriching Google. For pretty much anyone reading OSNews, GrapheneOS would be a great choice, and if you already have a Pixel, I strongly urge you consider switching.

It’s been about 18 months, [but we’ve got a new release for MorphOS](https://www.morphos-team.net/releasenotes/3.19), the Amiga-like operating system for PowerPC Macs and some other PowerPC-based machines. Going through the list of changes, it seems MorphOS 3.19 focuses heavily on fixing bugs and addressing issues, rather than major new features or earth-shattering changes. Of note are several small but important updates, like updated versions of OpenSSL and OpenSSH, as well as a ton of new filetype definitions – and so much more.

Having a release focused on fixing bugs and addressing smaller issues isn’t exactly a bad thing though – I’ve used MorphOS on my 17″ 1.25Ghz PowerBook G4 often enough to know MorphOS is quite complete, stable, and a ton of fun to use, and much more capable than it has any right to be considering what must be its relatively small developer team and user base. That being said, I do wish MorphOS was available on hardware newer than 20 year old PowerPC Macs, because as much as I like me some classic hardware, the world’s moving on and even basic web browsing requires much more performant hardware now.

Maybe I should try and buy one of the supported Apple PowerPC G5 machines to see just how much better MorphOS runs on that than on my G4.

One of the strangely odd compliments you could give Google Search is that it would load even on the weirdest or oldest browsers, simply because it didn’t require JavaScript. Whether I loaded Google Search in the JS-less Dillo, Blazer on PalmOS, or the latest Firefox, I’d end up with a search box I could type something into and search. Sure, beyond that the web would be, shall we say, problematic, but at least Google Search worked. With this move, Google will end such compatibility, which was most likely a side effect more than policy.

I know a lot of people lament the widespread reliance on and requirement to have JavaScript, and it surely can be and is abused, but it’s also the reality of people asking more and more of their tools on the web. I would love it websites gracefully degraded on browsers without JavaScript, but that’s simply not a realistic thing to expect, sadly. JavaScript is part of the web now – and has been for a long time – and every website using or requiring JavaScript makes the web no more or less “open” than the web requiring any of the other myriad of technologies, [like more recent versions of TLS](https://oldvcr.blogspot.com/2020/11/fun-with-crypto-ancienne-tls-for.html). Nobody is stopping anyone from implementing support for JS.

I’m not a proponent of JavaScript or anything like that – in fact, I’m annoyed I can’t load our WordPress backend in browsers that don’t have it, but I’m just as annoyed that I can’t load websites on older machines just because they don’t have later versions of TLS. Technology “progresses”, and as long as the technologies being regarded as “progress” are not closed or encumbered by patents, I can be *annoyed* by it, but I can’t exactly be *against* it.

The [idea](https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/18/google-search-javascript) that it’s JavaScript making the web bad and not shit web developers and shit managers and shit corporations sure is one hell of a take.

This opens up a lot of interesting use cases and fun hacks for developers to implement in their CLI applications. All the code in the article is – as usual – way over my head, but will be trivial for quite a few of you.

The mentioned [EndBASIC project](https://www.endbasic.dev/), created by the author, Julio Merino, is fascinating too:

> EndBASIC is an interpreter for a BASIC-like language and is inspired by Amstrad’s Locomotive BASIC 1.1 and Microsoft’s QuickBASIC 4.5. Like the former, EndBASIC intends to provide an interactive environment that seamlessly merges coding with immediate visual feedback. Like the latter, EndBASIC offers higher-level programming constructs and strong typing.
>
> EndBASIC’s primary goal is to offer a simplified and restricted DOS-like environment to learn the foundations of programming and computing, and focuses on features that quickly reward the learner. These include a built-in text editor, commands to manipulate the screen, commands to interact with shared files, and even commands to interact with the hardware of a Raspberry Pi.

Being able to run this on a machine without having to load either X or Wayland is a huge boon, and makes it accessible fast on quite a lot of hardware on which a full X or Wayland setup would be cumbersome or slow.

Up until now, if you were subscribed to Office 365 – I think it’s called Microsoft 365 now – and you wanted the various “AI” Copilot features, you needed to pay $20 extra. Well, that’s changing, as Microsoft is now adding these features to Microsoft 365 by default, while raising the prices for every subscriber by $3 per month. It seems not enough people were interested in paying $20 per month extra for “AI” features in Office, so Microsoft has to force everyone to pay up. It’s important to note, though, that your usage of the features is limited by how many “[AI credits](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/understanding-ai-credits-68530f1a-4459-4d02-9818-8233c1f673b8)” you have, to really nail that slot machine user experience, and you’re only getting a limited number of those per month.

Luckily, existing Microsoft 365 subscribers can opt out of these new features and thus avoid the price increase, which is a genuinely welcome move by Microsoft. New subscribers, however, will not be able to opt out.

> Finally, we understand that our customers have a variety of needs and budgets, so we’re committed to providing options. Existing subscribers with recurring billing enabled with Microsoft can switch to plans without Copilot or AI credits like our [Basic plan](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/p/microsoft-365-basic/cfq7ttc0ktxs), or, for a limited time, to new [Personal Classic or Family Classic plans](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/58342e83-38e7-4cda-b63b-88604a8fb7ef). These plans will continue to be maintained as they exist today, but for certain new innovations and features you’ll need a Microsoft 365 Personal and Family subscription.

Microsoft wants to spread the immense cost of running datacentres for “AI” to everyone, whether you want to use these features or not. When not enough people want to opt into “AI” and pay extra, the only other option is to just make everyone pay, whether they want to or not. Still, the opt-out for existing subscribers is nice, and if you are one and don’t want to pay $35 per year extra, don’t forget to opt out.

We’re not going to follow traffic laws and regulations because doing so “simply isn’t appropriate or effective for our services”. We’re not going to respect property laws because doing so “simply isn’t appropriate or effective for our services”. We’d be in trouble within a heartbeat. We’d be buried in fines, court cases, and eventually, crippling debt, bankruptcy, and most likely end up in prison.

The arrogance with which these American tech giants willfully declare themselves to be above EU laws and regulations is appalling, and really should have far more consequences than it does right now. Executives should be charged and arrested, products and services banned and taken off the shelves, and eventually, the companies themselves should be banned from operating within the EU altogether. Especially with the incoming regime in the US, which will most likely grant the tech giants even more freedom to do as they please, the EU needs to start standing up against this sort of gross disrespect.

The consequences for a corporation knowingly breaking the law should be just as grave as for an individual citizen knowingly breaking the law.

Of course, the applications won’t stop working on Windows 10 right away after that date, but Microsoft won’t be fixing any security issues, bugs, or other issues that might (will) come up. It reads like a threat to Windows users – upgrade by buying a new PC you probably can’t afford, or not only use an insecure version of Windows, but also insecure Office applications. I doubt it’ll have much of an impact on the staggering number of people still using Windows 10 – more than 60% of Windows users – so I’m sure Microsoft has more draconian plans up its sleeve to push people to upgrade.

If you don’t want OpenAI’s, Apple’s, Google’s, or other companies’ crawlers sucking up the content on your website, there isn’t much you can do. They generally don’t care about the venerable robots.txt, and while people like Aaron Schwartz were legally bullied into suicide for downloading scientific articles using a guest account, corporations are free to take whatever they want, permission or no. If corporations don’t respect us, why should we respect them?

There are ways to fight back against these scrapers, and the latest is especially nasty in all the right ways.

Pages are randomly generated, but in a deterministic way, causing them to appear to be flat files that never change. Intentional delay is added to prevent crawlers from bogging down your server, in addition to wasting their time. Lastly, optional Markov-babble can be added to the pages, to give the crawlers something to scrape up and train their LLMs on, hopefully accelerating model collapse.

You really have to know what you’re doing when you set up this tool. It is intentionally designed to cause harm to LLM web crawlers, but it makes no distinction between LLM crawlers and, say, search engine crawlers, so it will definitely get you removed from search results. On top of that, because Nepenthes is designed to feed LLM crawlers what they’re looking for, they’re going to love your servers and thus spike your CPU load constantly. I can’t reiterate enough that you should not be using this if you don’t know what you’re doing.

Setting it all up is fairly straightforward, but of note is that if you want to use the Markov generation feature, you’ll need to provide your own corpus for it to feed from. None is included to make sure every installation of Nepenthes will be different and unique because users will choose their own corpus to set up. You can use whatever texts you want, like Wikipedia articles, royalty-free books, open research corpuses, and so on. Nepenthes will also provide you with statistics to see what cats you’ve dragged in.

You can use Nepenthes defensively to prevent LLM crawlers from reaching your real content, while also collecting the IP ranges of the crawlers so you can start blocking them. If you’ve got enough bandwith and horsepower, you can also opt to use Nepenthes offensively, and you can have some real fun with this.

Train a big Markov corpus and leave the Markov module enabled, set the maximum babble size to something big. In short, let them suck down as much bullshit as they have diskspace for and choke on it.

In a world where we can’t fight back against LLM crawlers in a sensible and respectful way, tools like these are exactly what we need. After all, the imbalance of power between us normal people and corporations is growing so insanely out of any and all proportions, that we don’t have much choice but to attempt to burn it all down with more… Destructive methods. I doubt this will do much to stop LLM crawlers from taking whatever they want without consent – as I’ve repeatedly said, Silicon Valley does not understand consent – but at least it’s joyfully cathartic.

[Speaking of](https://www.osnews.com/story/141540/a-microsoft-change-to-the-linux-kernel-caused-major-breakagem-but-was-caught-in-time/) Microsoft shipping bad code, how about an absolutely humongous ‘patch Tuesday’?

> Microsoft today unleashed updates to plug a whopping 161 security vulnerabilities in Windows and related software, including three “zero-day” weaknesses that are already under active attack. Redmond’s inaugural Patch Tuesday of 2025 bundles more fixes than the company has shipped in one go since 2017.

> A change to the Linux 6.13 kernel contributed by a Microsoft engineer ended up changing Linux x86\_64 code without proper authorization and in turn causing troubles for users and now set to be disabled ahead of the Linux 6.13 stable release expected next Sunday.

What I like about this story is that it seems to underline that the processes, checks, and balances in place in Linux kernel development seem to be working – at least, this time. A breaking change was caught during the prerelease phase, and a fix has been merged to make sure this issue will be fixed before the stable version of Linux 6.13 is released to the wider public. This all sounds great, but there is an element of this story that raises some serious questions.

The change itself was related to EXECMEM\_ROX, and was intended to improve performance of 64bit AMD and Intel processors, but in turn, this new code broke Control Flow Integrity on some setups, causing some devices not to wake from hibernation while also breaking other features. What makes this spicy is that the code was merged [without acknowledgement from any of the x86 kernel maintainers](https://www.neowin.net/news/microsoft-pulls-a-windows-as-it-breaks-linux-on-intel-cpus-and-angers-amd-in-the-process/), which made a lot of people very unhappy – and understandably so.

So while the processes and checks and balances worked here, something still went horribly wrong, as such changes should not be able to be merged without acknowledgement from maintainers. This now makes me wonder how many more times this has happened without causing any instantly discoverable issues. For now, some code has been added to revert the offending changes, and Linux 6.13 will ship with Microsoft’s bad code disabled.
