{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `themesdir` variable in `themes/program/themesettings.inc.php` is not initialized before being used in an include statement, which allows an attacker to inject a remote file path.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary remote file execution, leading to a full compromise of the affected system.",
  "Attack vectors": "By manipulating the `themesdir` parameter in a GET request to `themes/program/themesettings.inc.php`.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. `register_globals` must be enabled on the server (this PHP feature is deprecated and is not enabled by default in modern versions of PHP)."
