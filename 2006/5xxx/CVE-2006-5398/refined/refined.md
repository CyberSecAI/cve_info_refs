Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the `comments.php` script of Simplog 0.9.3.1. Specifically, the `cid` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `cid` parameter when processing the edit comment operation. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** An attacker can use this vulnerability to bypass authentication and extract sensitive information from the database. The provided exploit specifically targets the `blog_users` table to retrieve usernames and their corresponding MD5 password hashes.
*   **Potential for Further Compromise:** If the database user has sufficient privileges, the attacker could potentially modify or delete data, or even execute arbitrary commands on the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `comments.php` script.
*   **`cid` Parameter:** The malicious SQL payload is injected through the `cid` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the target server running the vulnerable Simplog application.
*   **Basic Understanding of SQL Injection:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a valid SQL injection query.
*   **Knowledge of Target System:** The attacker requires some knowledge of the database structure (e.g. table and column names). In this exploit, the attacker targets the `blog_users` table. The exploit also requires a valid `user id`. The provided script takes `user id` as a parameter.

**Additional Details:**

*   The exploit requires at least one blog entry to be made prior to the injection.
*   The exploit script provided extracts the username and password hash via a union select statement.
