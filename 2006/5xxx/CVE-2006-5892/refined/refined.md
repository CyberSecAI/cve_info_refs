  "CVE-2006-5892": {
    "description": "AspPired2Poll 1.0 is vulnerable to SQL injection via the 'MoreInfo.asp' page. By manipulating the 'id' parameter in the URL, an attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries. This allows retrieval of sensitive information, such as usernames and passwords, from the database. The exploit code provided demonstrates how to extract the username and password using a UNION SELECT statement.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the 'id' parameter of 'MoreInfo.asp' before using it in an SQL query.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "SQL Injection"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, including usernames and passwords.",
       "attack_vectors": "By crafting a malicious URL with a specially crafted 'id' parameter, an attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application."
