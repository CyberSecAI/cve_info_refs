Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is the direct inclusion of a user-supplied filename via the `$_GET['filename']` parameter in the `savebackup.php` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to include remote files. The application uses the `include()` function with a filename derived directly from user input without sanitization or validation. This allows the attacker to control the included file's location.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **System Access:** The impact of successful exploitation is described as "highly critical," potentially leading to system access. An attacker can inject arbitrary code into the server and execute it by including a malicious file.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a file containing PHP code, an attacker can execute commands on the server by injecting malicious php code.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through an HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `savebackup.php` script.
*   **`filename` Parameter:** The attacker manipulates the `filename` parameter to point to a remote file containing malicious code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   **Ability to Host Malicious File:** The attacker must have a location where they can host a malicious file accessible via HTTP(s).
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs basic knowledge to craft the malicious HTTP GET request.

**Additional Information:**

*   The provided exploit example demonstrates how to use the `filename` parameter to include a remote file, along with another parameter `cmd`, allowing arbitrary command execution.
*   The vulnerability exists in version 1.4.0 of the GEPI application.
*   Version 1.4.4 of GEPI attempts to mitigate the issue by implementing session checks and whitelisting of file names.
