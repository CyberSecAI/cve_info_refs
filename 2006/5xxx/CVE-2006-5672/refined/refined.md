```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper input sanitization in the `init_mysource.php` file. Specifically, the `INCLUDE_PATH` parameter is used to include an external file, without validation, making it vulnerable to Remote File Inclusion.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server by including a malicious file from a remote location. This can lead to complete system compromise, including data theft, modification, or denial of service.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests by providing a URL to a malicious file via the `INCLUDE_PATH` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and control a server hosting the malicious file they want to include."
