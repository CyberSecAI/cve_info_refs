How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

#### Administrative Installation Information

If you installed your application from a server location, the server administrator must update the server location with the administrative update and deploy that update to your computer.

**Installation Information**

The following setup switches are relevant to administrative installations as they allow an administrator to customize how the files are extracted from within the security update.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/?** | Displays the command-line options. |
| **/q** | Specifies quiet mode, or suppresses prompts, when files are being extracted. |
| **/t:path** | Specifies the target folder for extracting files. |
| **/c** | Extracts the files without installing them. If **/t:path** is not specified, you are prompted for a target folder. |
| **/c:path** | Overrides the install command that is defined by author. Specifies the path and name of the Setup.inf or .exe file. |

For more information about the supported setup switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 197147](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/197147).

**Administrative Deployment Information**

To update your administrative installation, follow these steps:

1. [Download the security update for Office 2003](https://download.microsoft.com/download/9/4/7/9478c2fc-6535-4b7f-9c26-6b8eeb001174/office2003-kb921585-fullfile-enu.exe) and/or [Microsoft Office Multilingual User Interface 2003](https://download.microsoft.com/download/9/7/5/975e50db-23b0-4946-b8bc-4d801c802479/office2003mui-kb921585-fullfile-ptb.exe) and/or [Microsoft Project Multilingual User Interface 2003](https://download.microsoft.com/download/3/e/3/3e33c490-e567-4a79-ba65-0447f30941eb/project2003mui-kb921585-fullfile-ptb.exe) and/or [Visio Multilingual User Interface 2003](https://download.microsoft.com/download/b/1/a/b1a9ea5b-0157-4d0d-b417-dce7ac158d2d/visio2003mui-kb921585-fullfile-ptb.exe) and/or [Microsoft Office Proofing Tools 2003](https://download.microsoft.com/download/4/2/6/4266dca8-b7c2-47d7-bab3-e66f8a7a4d48/office2003ptk-kb921585-fullfile-enu.exe).
2. Click **Save this program to disk**, and then click **OK**.
3. Click **Save**.
4. Using Windows Explorer, locate the folder that contains the saved file. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type the following command, and then click **OK** to extract the .msp file:
   **[path\name of EXE file] /c /t:C:\AdminUpdate**

   **Note** Double-clicking the .exe file does not extract the .msp file; it applies the update to the local computer. In order to update an administrative image, you must first extract the .msp file.
5. Click **Yes** to accept the License Agreement.
6. Click **Yes** if you are prompted to create the folder.
7. If you are familiar with the procedure for updating **your** administrative installation\*\*,\*\* click **Start**, click **Run**, type the following command, and then click **OK**:
   **msiexec /a** *Admin Path*\*\*\\*\*MSI File \*\*/p C:\adminUpdate\\*\**MSP File* **SHORTFILENAMES=TRUE**

   **Note** *Admin Path* is the path of your administrative installation point for your application (for example, C:\Office2003), *MSI File* is the .msi database package for the application (for example, Data1.msi), and *MSP File* is the name of the administrative update (for example, SHAREDff.msp).

   **Note** You can append /**qb+** to the command line so that the **Administrative Installation** dialog box and the **End User License Agreement** dialog box do not appear.
8. Click **Next** in the provided dialog box. Do not change your CD key, installation location, or company name in the provided dialog box.
9. Click **I accept the terms in the License Agreement**, and then click **Install**.

At this point, your administrative installation point is updated. Next, you must update the workstations configurations that were originally installed from this administrative installation. To do this, please review the âWorkstation Deployment Informationâ section. Any new installations that you run from this administrative installation point will include the update.

**Warning** Any workstation configuration that was originally installed from this administrative installation before you installed the update cannot use this administrative installation for actions such as repairing Office or adding new features until you complete the steps in the âWorkstation Deployment Informationâ section.

**Workstation Deployment Information**

To deploy the update to the client workstations, click **Start**, click **Run**, type the following command, and then click **OK**:

**Msiexec /I** *Admin Path*\*\*\\*\*MSI File \*\*/qb REINSTALL=\*\*Feature List **REINSTALLMODE=vomu**

**Note** *Admin Path* is the path of your administrative installation point for your application (for example, C:\Office2003), *MSI File* is the .msi database package for the application (for example, Data1.msi), and *Feature List* is the list of feature names (case sensitive) that must be reinstalled for the update.

To install all features, you can use **REINSTALL=ALL** or you can install the following features.

| Product | Feature |
| --- | --- |
| VISVEA, ACC11, BASIC11, FP11, ONOTE11, OUTLS11, OUTL11, PPT11, PROI11, PRO11, PUB11, STDP11, STD11, WORD11, INF11, EXCEL11, PRJPROE, PRJPRO, PRJSTDE, PRJSTD, VISPRO, VISPROR, VISSTD, VISSTDR | SpellingAndGrammarFiles\_1046 |

**Note** Administrators working in managed environments can find complete resources for deploying Office updates in an organization on the [Office Admin Update Center](https://office.microsoft.com/fx011511561033.aspx). On the home page of that site, look under the **Update Strategies** section for the software version you are updating. The [Windows Installer Documentation](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21685) also provides more information about the parameters supported by the Windows Installer.

**Administrative Installation File Information**

The English version of this update has the file attributes that are listed in the following table. The dates and times for these files are listed in coordinated universal time (UTC). When you view the file information, it is converted to local time. To find the difference between UTC and local time, use the **Time Zone** tab in the Date and Time tool in Control Panel.

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

**Note** To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. MBSA allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for commonly misconfigured security parameters. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).

* **File Version Verification**

**Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

   **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

   **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.

### Other Information

**Obtaining Other Security Updates:**

Updates for other security issues are available at the following locations:

* Security updates are available at the [Microsoft Download Center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21129). You can find them most easily by doing a keyword search for "security\_patch."
* Updates for consumer platforms are available at the [Microsoft Update Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747).

**Support:**

* Customers in the U.S. and Canada can receive technical support from [Microsoft Product Support Services](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21131) at 1-866-PCSAFETY. There is no charge for support calls that are associated with security updates.

**Software Update Services:**

By using Microsoft Software Update Services (SUS), administrators can quickly and reliably deploy the latest critical updates and security updates to Windows 2000 and Windows Server 2003-based servers, and to desktop systems that are running Windows 2000 Professional or Windows XP Professional.

For more information about how to deploy security updates by using Software Update Services, visit the [Software Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21133).

**Windows Server Update Services:**

By using Windows Server Update Services (WSUS), administrators can quickly and reliably deploy the latest critical updates and security updates for Windows 2000 operating systems and later, Office XP and later, Exchange Server 2003, and SQL Server 2000 onto Windows 2000 and later operating systems.

For more information about how to deploy security updates using Windows Server Update Services, visit the [Windows Server Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=50120).

**Systems Management Server:**

Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) delivers a highly configurable enterprise solution for managing updates. By using SMS, administrators can identify Windows-based systems that require security updates and can perform controlled deployment of these updates throughout the enterprise with minimal disruption to end users. For more information about how administrators can use SMS 2003 to deploy security updates, visit the [SMS 2003 Security Patch Management Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=22939). SMS 2.0 users can also use [Software Updates Service Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33340) to help deploy security updates. For information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

**Note** SMS uses the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer, the Microsoft Office Detection Tool, and the Enterprise Update Scan Tool to provide broad support for security bulletin update detection and deployment. Some software updates may not be detected by these tools. Administrators can use the inventory capabilities of the SMS in these cases to target updates to specific systems. For more information about this procedure, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33341). Some security updates require administrative rights following a restart of the system. Administrators can use the Elevated Rights Deployment Tool (available in the [SMS 2003 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33387) and in the [SMS 2.0 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21161)) to install these updates.

# Security Update Severity Rating System

Attacks that impact customers' systems rarely result from attackers' exploitation of previously unknown vulnerabilities. Rather, they exploit vulnerabilities for which patches are available but not applied. For this reason, Microsoft recommends that customers make patching a priority. Currently available updates are listed in the [Security Update Guide](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/).

However, not all vulnerabilities are equally severe. To help customers understand the risk associated with each vulnerability we patch, we have published a severity rating system that rates each vulnerability according to the worst theoretical outcome were that vulnerability to be exploited.

| Rating | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Critical | A vulnerability whose exploitation could allow code execution ***without*** user interaction. These scenarios include self-propagating malware (e.g. network worms), or unavoidable common use scenarios where code execution occurs without warnings or prompts. This could mean browsing to a web page or opening email.  Microsoft recommends that customers apply Critical updates immediately. |
| Important | A vulnerability whose exploitation could result in compromise of the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of user data, or of the integrity or availability of processing resources. These scenarios include common use scenarios where client is compromised ***with***warnings or prompts regardless of the prompt's provenance, quality, or usability. Sequences of user actions that do not generate prompts or warnings are also covered.  Microsoft recommends that customers apply Important updates at the earliest opportunity. |
| Moderate | Impact of the vulnerability is mitigated to a significant degree by factors such as authentication requirements or applicability only to non-default configurations.  Microsoft recommends that customers consider applying the security update. |
| Low | Impact of the vulnerability is comprehensively mitigated by the characteristics of the affected component. Microsoft recommends that customers evaluate whether to apply the security update to the affected systems. |

The measure of a vulnerability’s severity is distinct from the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited. To assess that likelihood, the [Microsoft Exploitability Index](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/cc998259) provides additional information to help customers better prioritize the deployment of Microsoft security updates. This index provides customers with guidance on the likelihood of functioning exploit code being developed for vulnerabilities addressed by Microsoft security updates, within the first thirty days of that update's release.

While this severity rating system is intended to provide a broadly objective assessment of each issue, we strongly encourage customers to evaluate their own environments and make decisions about which updates are required to protect their systems.
