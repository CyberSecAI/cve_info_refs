Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2006-5954

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw in the `page.asp` script of NetVIOS version 2.0 and possibly earlier.
- The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `NewsID` parameter before using it in an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, where an attacker can inject malicious SQL code into the `NewsID` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Disclosure:** Attackers can bypass normal authentication and access sensitive data, including usernames and passwords from the `users` table.
- **Potential Data Manipulation:** With SQL injection, an attacker can potentially modify or delete data within the database.
- **Full Database Control:** If the database user has sufficient privileges, the attacker might gain complete control over the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is a specially crafted HTTP GET request to `page.asp`.
- **`NewsID` Parameter:** The vulnerable parameter is `NewsID`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
- They need to identify the vulnerable `page.asp` script and the `NewsID` parameter.
- The attacker needs to have a basic understanding of SQL syntax to craft the malicious payload.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided exploit example shows how to use a union-based SQL injection to extract usernames and passwords from the database: `//page.asp?NewsID=-1%20union%20select%200,0,0,logins,password,0,0,0%20from%20users%20where%20userid%20like%201`.
    - `-1` is used to make the original query return no results to show data from UNION statement.
    - `union select` combines results of two SELECT statements.
    - `0,0,0,logins,password,0,0,0` selects null values, login names, and passwords, other values as null.
    - `from users` specifies to take from `users` table.
    - `where userid like 1` filters query to match an existing `userid`.

**Additional Notes:**
- The Exploit-DB entry mentions a related CVE (CVE-2007-1566), suggesting a potentially similar vulnerability in a different version or part of the same application.

**Summary:**
The content clearly describes a SQL injection vulnerability in NetVIOS 2.0's `page.asp` script. An attacker can exploit this by injecting SQL code via the `NewsID` parameter, potentially leading to data disclosure, manipulation, or even full database control. The provided exploit demonstrates how to retrieve sensitive user information.
