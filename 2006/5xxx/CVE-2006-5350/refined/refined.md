CVE-2006-5351
The provided content contains information about CVE-2006-5351. Specifically, it details cross-site scripting vulnerabilities within Oracle APEX/HTML DB which are associated with CVE-2006-5351. There is also a SQL Injection vulnerability associated with the same CVE.

Root cause of vulnerability:
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities exist in the NOTIFICATION_MSG and WWV_FLOW_ITEM_HELP components of Oracle APEX/HTML DB.
- A SQL Injection vulnerability exists in the WWV_FLOW_UTILITIES component of Oracle APEX/HTML DB.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- SQL Injection

Impact of exploitation:
- Successful exploitation of XSS vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. This can lead to actions performed under the user's context, such as data theft, session hijacking, or defacement of the website.
- Successful exploitation of the SQL Injection vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches or manipulation.

Attack vectors:
- XSS: By crafting malicious links or embedding scripts in user-controlled content within the vulnerable applications.
- SQL Injection: By crafting malicious SQL statements through user input fields.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Attackers would need to be able to supply malicious input to the affected components of Oracle APEX/HTML DB. This likely means they need to be able to interact with the web application interface.
