### General Information

## Executive Summary

**Executive Summary:**

This update resolves several newly discovered, publicly and privately reported vulnerabilities. Each vulnerability is documented in its own âVulnerability Detailsâ section of this bulletin.

If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited the most severe of these vulnerabilities could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

We recommend that customers apply the update immediately.

Yes. Besides the changes that are listed in the âVulnerability Detailsâ section of this bulletin, there are also changes not related to security that were introduced in previous Internet Explorer bulletins.

Like the security update included with MS06-042 this security update also replaces the compatibility patch released on April 11, 2006. That compatibility patch temporarily returned Internet Explorer to the previous functionality for handling ActiveX controls, to help enterprise customers who needed more time to prepare for the ActiveX update changes discussed in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 912945](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/912945). This security update replaces that compatibility patch, and makes the changes in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 912945](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/912945) permanent. For more information about these changes, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 912945](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/912945) and the [product documentation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/ieupdate/).

The changes were first introduced in updates for Windows XP Service Pack 2, Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1, Windows XP Professional x64 Edition, Windows Server 2003 x64 Edition family, and Windows Server 2003 with Service Pack 1 for Itanium-based Systems on February 28, 2006. For more information about this update, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 912945](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/912945).

The changes are also included in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS06-013 and subsequent security bulletins for Internet Explorer for the same versions of Windows.

**What is the Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration?**

Internet Explorer [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ms537183.aspx) is a group of preconfigured Internet Explorer settings that reduce the likelihood of a user or an administrator downloading and running specially crafted Web content on a server. Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration reduces this risk by modifying many security-related settings. This includes the settings on the **Security** tab and the **Advanced** tab in the **Internet Options** dialog box. Some of the important modifications include the following:

* Security level for the Internet zone is set to **High**. This setting disables scripts, ActiveX controls, Microsoft Java Virtual Machine (MSJVM), and file downloads.
* Automatic detection of intranet sites is disabled. This setting assigns all intranet Web sites and all Universal Naming Convention (UNC) paths that are not explicitly listed in the Local intranet zone to the Internet zone.
* Install On Demand and non-Microsoft browser extensions are disabled. This setting prevents Web pages from automatically installing components and prevents non-Microsoft extensions from running.
* Multimedia content is disabled. This setting prevents music, animations, and video clips from running.

**Extended security update support for Microsoft Windows XP Home Edition Service Pack 1 or Service Pack 1a, Windows XP Media Center Edition 2002 Service Pack 1, Windows XP Media Center Edition 2004 Service Pack 1, Windows XP Professional Service Pack 1 or Service Pack 1a, and Windows XP Tablet PC Edition Service Pack 1 ended on October 10, 2006.

## Vulnerability Details

#### DirectAnimation ActiveX Controls Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities - CVE-2006-4446 and CVE-2006-4777:

Remote code execution vulnerabilities exist in DirectAnimation ActiveX controls that could be exploited if the ActiveX controls are passed unexpected data. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by constructing a specially crafted Web page that could potentially allow remote code execution if a user visited the specially crafted Web page. An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could take complete control of an affected system.

#### Mitigating Factors for DirectAnimation ActiveX Controls Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities - CVE-2006-4446 and CVE-2006-4777:

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit these vulnerabilities. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit these vulnerabilities. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or instant messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.
* An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* The Restricted sites zone helps reduce attacks that could try to exploit these vulnerabilities by preventing Active Scripting and ActiveX controls from being used when reading HTML e-mail. However, if a user clicks on a link within an e-mail they could still be vulnerable to this issue through the Web-based attack scenario.
  By default, Outlook Express 6, Outlook 2002, and Outlook 2003 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. Additionally Outlook 2000 opens HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if the [Outlook E-mail Security Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33334) has been installed. Outlook Express 5.5 Service Pack 2 opens HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS04-018](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=19527) has been installed.
* By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ms537183.aspx). This mode sets the security level for the Internet zone to High. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that have not been added to Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. See the FAQ section of this security update for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration

#### Workarounds for DirectAnimation ActiveX Controls Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2006-4446 and CVE-2006-4777:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. Although these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

* **Prevent the Microsoft DirectAnimation Path ActiveX control from running in Internet Explorer**

  You can help prevent attempts to instantiate this ActiveX control in Internet Explorer by setting the kill bit for the control in the registry.

  **Warning** If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

  For detailed steps that you can use to prevent a control from running in Internet Explorer, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 240797](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797). Follow these steps in this article to create a Compatibility Flags value in the registry to prevent a COM object from being instantiated in Internet Explorer.

  To set the kill bit for a CLSID with a value of {D7A7D7C3-D47F-11D0-89D3-00A0C90833E6}, paste the following text in a text editor such as Notepad. Then, save the file by using the .reg file name extension.

  Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
  [HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{D7A7D7C3-D47F-11D0-89D3-00A0C90833E6}]
  "Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400

  You can apply this .reg file to individual systems by double-clicking it. You can also apply it across domains by using Group Policy. For more information about Group Policy, visit the following Microsoft Web sites:

  [Group Policy collection](https://technet.microsoft.com/windowsserver/en/library/6d7cb788-b31d-4d17-9f1e-b5ddaa6deecd)

  [What is Group Policy Object Editor?](https://technet.microsoft.com/windowsserver/en/library/47ba1311-6cca-414f-98c9-2d7f99fca8a3)

  [Core Group Policy tools and settings](https://technet.microsoft.com/windowsserver/en/library/e926577a-5619-4912-b5d9-e73d4bdc9491)

  **Note** You must restart Internet Explorer for your changes to take effect.

  **Impact of Workaround:** Web sites that use the DirectAnimation Path ActiveX Controls may no longer display or function correctly.

  This workaround can also be used for all other CLSIDs for which kill bits are being set in this security update.
* **Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running ActiveX Controls or disable ActiveX Controls in the Internet and Local intranet security zone**

  You can help protect against these vulnerabilities by changing your Internet Explorer settings to prompt before running ActiveX controls. To do this, follow these steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Internet Options** on the **Tools** menu.
  2. Click the **Security** tab.
  3. Click **Internet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  4. Under **Settings**, in the **ActiveX controls and plug-ins** section, under **Run ActiveX controls and plug-ins**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  5. Click **Local intranet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  6. Under **Settings**, in the **ActiveX controls and plug-ins** section, under **Run ActiveX controls and plug-ins**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK.**
  7. Click **OK** two times to return to Internet Explorer.

  **Impact of Workaround:** There are side effects to prompting before running ActiveX controls. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running ActiveX controls is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click **Yes** to run ActiveX controls. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zoneâ.

  **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**

  After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, follow these steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this Web site to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your computer. Two in particular that you may want to add are "\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com" and â\*.update.microsoft.comâ (without the quotation marks). These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.
* **Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to âHighâ to prompt before running ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting in these zones**

  You can help protect against these vulnerabilities by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to prompt before running ActiveX controls. You can do this by setting your browser security to **High**.

  To raise the browsing security level in Microsoft Internet Explorer, follow these steps:

  1. On the Internet Explorer **Tools** menu, click **Internet Options**.
  2. In the **Internet Options** dialog box, click the **Security** tab, and then click the **Internet** icon.
  3. Under **Security level for this zone**, move the slider to **High**. This sets the security level for all Web sites you visit to High.

  **Note** If no slider is visible, click **Default Level**, and then move the slider to **High**.

  **Note** Setting the level to **High** may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the security setting set to **High**.

  **Impact of Workaround:** There are side effects to prompting before running ActiveX controls. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running ActiveX controls is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click **Yes** to run ActiveX controls. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zoneâ.

  **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**

  After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, follow these steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this Web site to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your computer. Two in particular that you may want to add are "\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com" and â\*.update.microsoft.comâ (without the quotation marks). These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.

#### FAQ for DirectAnimation ActiveX Controls Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities - CVE-2006-4446 and CVE-2006-4777:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

These are remote code execution vulnerabilities. An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could remotely take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

Remote code execution vulnerabilities exist in DirectAnimation ActiveX controls that could be exploited if the ActiveX controls are passed unexpected data. This could cause Internet Explorer to fail in a way that could allow code execution.

**What is DirectAnimation?**

DirectAnimation as a whole is a deprecated suite of development functionality. Microsoft recommends using more recent functions in [Microsoft DirectX](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/directx/) when developing Web applications and other software that needs advanced animation. After this security update is installed, Web applications and software that use DirectAnimation will not function as expected. One way of accessing the functionality that was exposed in the DirectAnimation suite was by using HTML+TIME 1.0.

**What is HTML+TIME?**

HTML+TIME (Timed Interactive Multimedia Extensions) adds timing and media synchronization support to HTML pages. HTML+TIME 1.0, which is a wrapper for DirectAnimation, is deprecated functionality and has been replaced by HTML+TIME 2.0. Customers who use [HTML+TIME 1.0](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ms533109.aspx) are encouraged to use the Microsoft implementation of [HTML+TIME 2.0](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ms533102.aspx) instead. After this security update is installed, Web applications and software that use HTML+TIME 1.0 will not function as expected.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could host a specially crafted Web site that is designed to exploit these vulnerabilities through Internet Explorer and then persuade a user to view the Web site. This can also include Web sites that accept user-provided content or advertisements, Web sites that host user-provided content or advertisements, and compromised Web sites. These Web sites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit these vulnerabilities. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or in an Instant Messenger request that takes users to the attacker's Web site. It could also be possible to display specially crafted Web content by using banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver Web content to affected systems.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability requires that a user is logged on and visits a Web site for any malicious action to occur. Therefore, any systems where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from these vulnerabilities.

**I am running Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003. Does this mitigate these vulnerabilities?**

Yes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 runs in a restricted mode that is known as Enhanced Security Configuration. This mode sets the security level for the Internet zone to High. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that have not been added to Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone.

**What is the Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration?**

Internet Explorer [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ms537183.aspx) is a group of preconfigured Internet Explorer settings that reduce the likelihood of a user or of an administrator downloading and running specially crafted Web content on a server. Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration reduces this risk by modifying many security-related settings. This includes the settings on the **Security** tab and the **Advanced** tab in the **Internet Options** dialog box. Some of the important modifications include the following:

* Security level for the Internet zone is set to **High**. This setting disables scripts, ActiveX controls, Microsoft Java Virtual Machine (MSJVM), and file downloads.
* Automatic detection of intranet sites is disabled. This setting assigns all intranet Web sites and all Universal Naming Convention (UNC) paths that are not explicitly listed in the Local intranet zone to the Internet zone.
* Install On Demand and non-Microsoft browser extensions are disabled. This setting prevents Web pages from automatically installing components and prevents non-Microsoft extensions from running.
* Multimedia content is disabled. This setting prevents music, animations, and video clips from running.

For more information regarding Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration, see the guide, Managing Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration, at the following [Web site](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=d41b036c-e2e1-4960-99bb-9757f7e9e31b&displaylang;=en%20https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=d41b036c-e2e1-4960-99bb-9757f7e9e31b&displaylang;=en).

**What does the update do?**

The update removes support for the DirectAnimation Path ActiveX control in Internet Explorer by setting the kill bit for control. In addition, as a defense in depth measure, this update sets kill bits for DirectAnimation as a whole as it is a deprecated suite of development functionality. Microsoft recommends using [Microsoft DirectX](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/directx/) and [HTML+TIME 2.0](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ms533102.aspx) when developing Web applications and other software.

The Class Identifiers and corresponding files where the DirectAnimation functionality is contained are as follows.

#### HTML Rendering Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2006-4687:

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way Internet Explorer interprets HTML with certain layout combinations. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Web page that could potentially allow remote code execution if a user viewed the Web page. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system.

#### Mitigating Factors for HTML Rendering Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2006-4687:

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or instant messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* The Restricted sites zone helps reduce attacks that could try to exploit this vulnerability by preventing Active Scripting from being used when reading HTML e-mail messages. However, if a user clicks a link in an e-mail message, the user could still be vulnerable to this issue through the Web-based attack scenario.
  By default, Outlook Express 6, Outlook 2002, and Outlook 2003 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. Additionally Outlook 2000 opens HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if the [Outlook E-mail Security Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33334) has been installed. Outlook Express 5.5 Service Pack 2 opens HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if [Microsoft Security Bulletin MS04-018](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=19527) has been installed.
  **Note** It cannot be ruled out that this vulnerability could be used in an exploit without Active Scripting. However, using Active Scripting significantly increases the chances of a successful exploit. As a result, this vulnerability has been given a severity rating of Critical on Windows Server 2003.
* By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ms537183.aspx). This mode mitigates this vulnerability in the e-mail vector because reading e-mail messages in plain text is the default configuration for Outlook Express. See the FAQ section of this security update for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.

#### Workarounds for HTML Rendering Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2006-4687:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. Although these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

**Note** It cannot be ruled out that this vulnerability could be used in an exploit without Active Scripting. However, using Active Scripting significantly increases the chances of a successful exploit. As a result, this vulnerability has been given a severity rating of Critical on Windows Server 2003.

* **Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone**

  You can help protect against this vulnerability by changing your settings to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone. To do this, follow these steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Internet Options** on the **Tools** menu.
  2. Click the **Security** tab.
  3. Click **Internet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  4. Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  5. Click **Local intranet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  6. Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  7. Click **OK** two times to return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Disabling Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zones may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly.

  **Impact of Workaround:** There are side effects to prompting before running Active Scripting. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use Active Scripting to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click **Yes** to run Active Scripting. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zoneâ.

  **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone.**

  After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, follow these steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this Web site to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your computer. Two in particular that you may want to add are "\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com" and â\*.update.microsoft.comâ (without the quotation marks). These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.
* **Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to âHighâ to prompt before running ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting in these zones**

  You can help protect against this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to prompt before running ActiveX controls and Active Scripting. You can do this by setting your browser security to **High**.

  To raise the browsing security level in Microsoft Internet Explorer, follow these steps:

  1. On the Internet Explorer **Tools** menu, click **Internet Options**.
  2. In the **Internet Options** dialog box, click the **Security** tab, and then click the **Internet** icon.
  3. Under **Security level for this zone**, move the slider to **High**. This sets the security level for all Web sites you visit to High.

  **Note** If no slider is visible, click **Default Level**, and then move the slider to **High**.

  **Note** Setting the level to **High** may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the security setting set to **High**.

  **Impact of Workaround:** There are side effects to prompting before running ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX or Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX Controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround.

These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.
* **Read e-mail messages in plain text format if you are using Outlook 2002 or a later version, or Outlook Express 6 SP1 or a later version, to help protect yourself from the HTML e-mail attack vector.**

  Microsoft Outlook 2002 users who have applied Office XP Service Pack 1 or a later version and Microsoft Outlook Express 6 users who have applied Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 or a later version can enable this setting and view e-mail messages that are not digitally signed or e-mail messages that are not encrypted in plain text only.

  Digitally signed e-mail messages or encrypted e-mail messages are not affected by the setting and may be read in their original formats. For more information about how to enable this setting in Outlook 2002, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 307594](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/307594).

  For information about this setting in Outlook Express 6, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 291387](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/291387).

  **Impact of Workaround:** E-mail messages that are viewed in plain text format will not contain pictures, specialized fonts, animations, or other rich content. Additionally:

  + The changes are applied to the preview pane and to open messages.
  + Pictures become attachments so that they are not lost.
  + Because the message is still in Rich Text or HTML format in the store, the object model (custom code solutions) may behave unexpectedly.

**Notes** When you install these security updates, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the Update.exe installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you can use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. MBSA allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).
* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.
   **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.
   **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.

* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry key.

Windows Server 2003, Web Edition; Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition; Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition; Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition; Windows Small Business Server 2003; Windows Server 2003, Web Edition with SP1; Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition with SP1; Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition with SP1; Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition with SP1; Windows Server 2003 R2, Web Edition; Windows Server 2003 R2, Standard Edition; Windows Server 2003 R2, Datacenter Edition; Windows Server 2003 R2, Enterprise Edition; Windows Small Business Server 2003 R2; Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition for Itanium-based Systems; Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition for Itanium-based Systems; Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition with SP1 for Itanium-based Systems; Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition with SP1 for Itanium-based Systems; Windows Server 2003, Standard x64 Edition; Windows Server 2003, Enterprise x64 Edition; and Windows Server 2003, Datacenter x64 Edition; Windows Server 2003 R2, Standard x64 Edition; Windows Server 2003 R2, Enterprise x64 Edition; and Windows Server 2003 R2, Datacenter x64 Edition:

HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows Server 2003\SP2\KB922760\Filelist

**Note** This registry key may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, this registry key may not be created correctly if an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams the 922760 security update into the Windows installation source files.

#### Windows XP Service Pack 2 (all versions) and Windows XP Professional x64 Edition

This security update requires Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 2. For more information, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 322389](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/322389).

**Note** For Windows XP Professional x64 Edition, this security update is the same as the Windows Server 2003 x64 Edition security update.

**Inclusion in Future Service Packs:**
The update for this issue will be included in a future Service Pack or Update Rollup.

**Installation Information**

This security update supports the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/help** | Displays the command-line options |
| Setup Modes |  |
| **/passive** | Unattended Setup mode. No user interaction is required, but installation status is displayed. If a restart is required at the end of Setup, a dialog box will be presented to the user with a timer warning that the computer will restart in 30 seconds. |
| **/quiet** | Quiet mode. This is the same as unattended mode, but no status or error messages are displayed. |
| Restart Options |  |
| **/norestart** | Does not restart when installation has completed |
| **/forcerestart** | Restarts the computer after installation and force other applications to close at shutdown without saving open files first. |
| **/warnrestart[:x]** | Presents a dialog box with a timer warning the user that the computer will restart in *x* seconds. (The default setting is 30 seconds.) Intended for use with the **/quiet** switch or the **/passive** switch. |
| **/promptrestart** | Display a dialog box prompting the local user to allow a restart |
| Special Options |  |
| **/overwriteoem** | Overwrites OEM files without prompting |
| **/nobackup** | Does not back up files needed for uninstall |
| **/forceappsclose** | Forces other programs to close when the computer shuts down |
| **/log:path** | Allows the redirection of installation log files |
| **/integrate:path** | Integrates the update into the Windows source files. These files are located at the path that is specified in the switch. |
| **/extract[:path]** | Extracts files without starting the Setup program |
| **/ER** | Enables extended error reporting |
| **/verbose** | Enables verbose logging. During installation, creates %Windir%\CabBuild.log. This log details the files that are copied. Using this switch may cause the installation to proceed more slowly. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841). For more information about the Update.exe installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

**Deployment Information**

To install the security update without any user intervention, use the following command at a command prompt for Microsoft Windows XP:

**Notes** When you install these security updates, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the Update.exe installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you can use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. MBSA allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).
* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.
   **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.
   **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.

* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry keys.

Windows XP Home Edition Service Pack 2, Windows XP Professional Service Pack 2, Windows XP Tablet PC Edition 2005, and Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005:

HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows XP\SP3\KB922760\Filelist

Windows XP Professional x64 Edition:

HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows XP Version 2003\SP2\KB922760\Filelist

**Note** These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly if an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams the 922760 security update into the Windows installation source files.

#### Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 for Windows 2000 (all versions)

**Prerequisites**
To install the Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 (SP1) version of this update, you must be running Internet Explorer 6 SP1 (version 6.00.2800.1106) on one of the following versions of Windows:

**Note** This security update contains the same files as the security update included with [Microsoft Security Bulletin MS06-042](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=69562). In addition, this security update sets kill bits for the vulnerabilities that affect these Windows versions.

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you can use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. MBSA allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).
* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.
   **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.
   **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.

* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry key:

HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Internet Explorer 5.01\SP4\KB922760-IE501SP4-20060918.104713\Filelist

**Note** This registry key may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, this registry key may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams the 922760 security update into the Windows installation source files.

**Software Update Services:**

By using Microsoft Software Update Services (SUS), administrators can quickly and reliably deploy the latest critical updates and security updates to Windows 2000 and Windows Server 2003-based servers, and to desktop systems that are running Windows 2000 Professional or Windows XP Professional.

For more information about how to deploy security updates by using Software Update Services, visit the [Software Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21133).

**Windows Server Update Services:**

By using Windows Server Update Services (WSUS), administrators can quickly and reliably deploy the latest critical updates and security updates for Windows 2000 operating systems and later, Office XP and later, Exchange Server 2003, and SQL Server 2000 onto Windows 2000 and later operating systems.

For more information about how to deploy security updates using Windows Server Update Services, visit the [Windows Server Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=50120).

**Systems Management Server:**

Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) delivers a highly configurable enterprise solution for managing updates. By using SMS, administrators can identify Windows-based systems that require security updates and can perform controlled deployment of these updates throughout the enterprise with minimal disruption to end users. For more information about how administrators can use SMS 2003 to deploy security updates, visit the [SMS 2003 Security Patch Management Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=22939). SMS 2.0 users can also use [Software Updates Service Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33340) to help deploy security updates. For information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

**Note** SMS uses the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer, the Microsoft Office Detection Tool, and the Enterprise Update Scan Tool to provide broad support for security bulletin update detection and deployment. Some software updates may not be detected by these tools. Administrators can use the inventory capabilities of the SMS in these cases to target updates to specific systems. For more information about this procedure, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33341). Some security updates require administrative rights following a restart of the system. Administrators can use the Elevated Rights Deployment Tool (available in the [SMS 2003 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33387) and in the [SMS 2.0 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21161)) to install these updates.
