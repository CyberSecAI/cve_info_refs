flaw could be exploited to execute arbitrary code with the user's

privileges.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Valgrind output attached.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=212833#c5)  Vladimir Mosgalin    2006-10-29 22:22:05 UTC  ``` New information: this doesn't happen under C or English locale. It happens at least under Russian UTF-8 locale, though.

The data scribbled onto the heap is random text from the RPM file.  I'm not able to reproduce this issue with any language other than LANG=ru_RU.UTF-8.  This fact mitigates the potential damage this bug could cause, therefore I'm assigning it low severity.  This issue should also affect FC5.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=212833#c9)  Peter    2006-11-06 14:03:21 UTC  ``` But does this affects <=rpm-4.4.7?

As well,  setitng LANG= here doesn't cause the segfault, but setting LC_ALL="ru_RU.UTF-8" does (provided locales- ru is installed, if the locale files are not installed, rpm doesn't crash).   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=212833#c13)  Dmitry V. Levin    2006-11-18 22:41:10 UTC  ``` Actually showQueryPackage() in 4.0.4 is also vulnerable. UTF-8 and specspo translations are not strictly required - they just make reproducer simpler.  One can construct an rpm package with e.g. sufficiently large %description which will overflow malloc'ed buffer in C locale.    ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=212833#c14)  Dmitry V. Levin    2006-11-18 23:09:37 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 141570](attachment.cgi?id=141570 "sufficiently-long-file-name-to-cause-heap-buffer-overflow.spec") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=141570&action=edit "sufficiently-long-file-name-to-cause-heap-buffer-overflow.spec") sufficiently-long-file-name-to-cause-heap-buffer-overflow.spec  Sample spec file to reproduce a heap buffer overflow in 8bit locale.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=212833#c15)  Jeff Johnson    2006-11-19 14:29:14 UTC  ``` FWIW, the example in #14 does not segfault with rpm-4.4.8. My comment does not mean "fixed", only avoided, by other recent changes in rpm.  (aside) Here's another easy segfault that was fixed/avoided in the last couple of weeks      rpm -E '%(cat foo.spec)" for sufficiently large foo.spec. I believe that the changes in rpmExpand() are what happened to avoid the reproducer in #14.  Again, note "avoided", not "fixed".        ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=212833#c16)  Jeff Johnson    2006-11-19 18:20:53 UTC  ``` Note that creating a header with a dirname or basename longer than BUFSIZ is not "fixed" by my patch in #7. I'll have a patch to truncate the path to the getconf runtime limit for lib/rpmfi.c today. That's a better fix than mucking about with the stpcpy's in lib/query.c IMHO.   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=212833#c17)  Michael Schröder    2006-11-24 14:04:10 UTC  ``` How about the following patch?    ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=212833#c18)  Michael Schröder    2006-11-24 14:06:13 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 142065](attachment.cgi?id=142065&action=diff "Patch to fix buffer overflow") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=142065&action=edit "Patch to fix buffer overflow") Patch to fix buffer overflow   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=212833#c19)  Jeff Johnson    2006-11-24 14:19:17 UTC  ``` That looks workable.  There are many places that rpm assumes that file paths fit into a BUFSIZ buffer which can lead to buffer  overflows with crafted packages.  Guaranteeing that paths are within getconf(1) limits should also be done imho.   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=212833#c20)  Jeff Johnson    2006-11-26 21:42:37 UTC  ``` Workable for file paths. Howver, there is other data, not just file paths, from a header that can be maliciously crafted for an overflow.  A complete (afaik) patch for rpm-4.4.8 is at     <https://lists.dulug.duke.edu/pipermail/rpm-devel/2006-November/001889.html>  The patch includes changes to handle variable length file digests in headers which are irrelevant for rpm-4.4.5 and earlier.  UPSTREAM   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=212833#c21)  Lubomir Kundrak    2007-08-02 10:29:19 UTC  ``` Paul: Is rpm-4.4.2-33.fc6 still affected?

Fixing by updating to 4.4.2.1 to fix several other issues too but means it'll need to go through updates-testing despite being a security fix (built and push initiated already).   ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=212833#c23)  Panu Matilainen    2007-08-27 17:51:04 UTC  ``` This has been fixed in rpm-4.4.2.1-1.fc6 which has now been pushed to updates.   ```  [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=212833#c24)  Lubomir Kundrak    2007-08-30 16:46:56 UTC  ``` Great work, Panu!   ``` |  |

# RPM: Buffer overflow — GLSA **200611-08**

RPM is vulnerable to a buffer overflow and possibly the execution of
arbitrary code when opening specially crafted packages.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-arch/rpm** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.4.6-r3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.4.6-r3** |

### Background

The Red Hat Package Manager (RPM) is a command line driven package
management system capable of installing, uninstalling, verifying,
querying, and updating computer software packages.

### Description

Vladimir Mosgalin has reported that when processing certain packages,
RPM incorrectly allocates memory for the packages, possibly causing a
heap-based buffer overflow.

### Impact

An attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted RPM package
and execute code with the privileges of that user if certain locales
are set.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All RPM users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-arch/rpm-4.4.6-r3"
```
