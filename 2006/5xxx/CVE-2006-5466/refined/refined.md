  "cve": "CVE-2006-5466",
  "affected_packages": [
    "librpm4 (Ubuntu)",
    "app-arch/rpm (Gentoo)",
     "rpm (Fedora)"
  ],
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "An error was found in the RPM library's handling of query reports. Specifically, a heap-based buffer overflow occurs due to incorrect memory allocation when processing certain packages.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap-based buffer overflow",
       "Insufficient input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the RPM command by tricking them into querying a specially crafted RPM package.",
    "attack_vector": "The vulnerability is triggered when a user attempts to query a maliciously crafted RPM package using the rpm command. This could involve commands like `rpm -qipvl --changelog` or `less`. The attacker needs to provide the malicious RPM package to the target user.",
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a specially crafted RPM package with a large description, file name, or other header data that causes the buffer overflow. The user needs to then use the rpm command to inspect this package (e.g. `rpm -qipvl --changelog <malicious_package.rpm>`). The locale must be one that causes the crash (e.g. `LANG=ru_RU.UTF-8`) or other means of triggering the vulnerability described in the bugzilla report. "
  },
  "additional_details": "The vulnerability is related to how the RPM library processes query reports, leading to a crash in certain locales (e.g. Russian UTF-8). This is because the memory allocated for the package data is insufficient, causing a heap buffer overflow. This can be triggered by large package descriptions or long file names. The issue is not always triggered under the C locale. The issue can occur in earlier version of rpm than 4.4.8 and as far back as 4.2.2 in Mandriva."
