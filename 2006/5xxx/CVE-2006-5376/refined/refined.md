  "impact": "Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion, denial of service, cross-site scripting attacks, and potentially arbitrary code execution depending on the specific vulnerability.",
  "attack_vector": "The attack vectors vary depending on the vulnerability. They may include crafted SQL queries, specially crafted requests to the HTTP server, and manipulation of input fields within Oracle Reports and APEX applications.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need the ability to interact with the vulnerable Oracle components, potentially requiring network access, database credentials, or the ability to manipulate web requests. For SQL injection, some level of access to the database or its interfaces would be necessary. For cross-site scripting, user interaction with crafted links may be required. Code execution may require exploiting a vulnerable service or application.",
    "additional_notes": "The document highlights that some of the APEX/HTMLDB vulnerabilities were already addressed in earlier versions. Upgrading to the latest version is recommended. It also mentions that Oracle is now fixing older bugs."
