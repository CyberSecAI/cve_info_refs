```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The KGB 1.8+ script is vulnerable to local file inclusion due to a flaw in `kgcall.php`. The script includes files from the `kgengine` directory based on the value of the `engine` parameter without proper sanitization.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Local File Inclusion (LFI)",
    "Remote Code Execution (RCE)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary code by uploading a malicious script as an image (due to lack of validation in `uploadzdj.php`) and including it via the vulnerable `kgcall.php` script. This allows for complete control of the server.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker uploads a PHP script disguised as a JPG file to `uploadzdj.php`. Then, the attacker uses a crafted URL to `kgcall.php` including the path of the uploaded script in the `engine` parameter and adding a `cmd` parameter to execute arbitrary shell commands.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server and requires knowledge of the vulnerable script's location and parameters. An attacker can be a remote user."
