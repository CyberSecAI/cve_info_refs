>Description:
	Xsession tries to create a log file; among the possiblities are
	/tmp/xses-$USER.  But an attacker could create a symlink of
	that name pointing somewhere else.  Normally, this would be
	a very serious error; however, most of the time it will succeed
	in creating $HOME/.xsession-errors and not try /tmp.

	The problem is in both xsrc and xorg.
>How-To-Repeat:
	See above.
>Fix:
	Use mktemp instead.

 I am curious: why use the ".XXXXXX" template and then mv into place? (Why
 not just mktemp "$errfile"?)

 I don't want just to open the "known" filename with exclusive
 permissions.  I want to get a new file, point the error stream to
 that, and then if possible move it to the "known" filename. I am
 trying to avoid the overwrite a random file through symlink attack;
 the mv will overwrite the symlink with my newly created file if
 successful.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Workarounds

Two workarounds for Sun Alert ID 102652 are provided below (as provided by
the Sun Alert). Select one of the two to implement.

A) Use an alternate login mechanism such as dtlogin(1) or if using Solaris
10, gdm(1).

or:

B) Modify the xdm(1) configuration file, xdm-config, and create a new
Xsession file using the following commands as the root user:

**# cd /usr/openwin/lib/X11/xdm

# mv xdm-config xdm-config.orig

# sed -e 's/cp \/dev\/null "$errfile"/umask 077 \&\& cp \/dev\/null
"$errfile"/' Xsession > /etc/X11/Xsession

# sed -e 's/\/usr\/openwin\/lib\/X11\/xdm\/Xsession/\/etc\/X11\/Xsession/'
xdm-config.orig > xdm-config**

then restore executable permissions to the file by running the following
command:

**# chmod 755 Xsession**

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=5898#c0)  Jeremy C. Reed    2006-02-16 03:37:27 UTC  ``` This is from NetBSD PR xsrc/32805 <http://www.netbsd.org/cgi-bin/query-pr-single.pl?number=32805>  In Xsession: if for some reason $HOME/.xsession-errors is not used, there is a race condition in the way the  "${TMPDIR-/tmp}/xses-$USER" or "/tmp/xses-$USER" is created.  I emaield about this to xorg_security a couple days ago, but no response.  One idea is to create a subdirectory in /tmp (or $TMPDIR) (using umask 077 && mkdir) and then create file in it and then force a symlink from xses-$USER to that file.  Or maybe use mktemp or similar if available. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=5898#c1)  Alan Coopersmith    2006-03-17 06:45:44 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 4969](attachment.cgi?id=4969 "Proposed fix to xdm modular tree") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=4969&action=edit "Proposed fix to xdm modular tree") [[review]](page.cgi?id=splinter.html&bug=5898&attachment=4969) Proposed fix to xdm modular tree  A proposed fix based on the NetBSD fix - uses mktemp if available, but leaves insecure code for systems without mktemp.   Assumes $HOME is safe to write to without mktemp. ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=5898#c2)  Jeremy C. Reed    2006-03-17 07:04:02 UTC  ``` I didn't test this new patch, but I assume that all implementations of mktemp create a file only readable by the user. Looks okay. I'd probably get rid of that bad code anyways -- is it needed? If it reaches that part just fail with some error message.  Or use umask && mkdir to make a temp directory, if that is successful create a file in it and then move into place (and remove that temp directory). ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=5898#c3)  Alan Coopersmith    2006-03-18 14:44:54 UTC  ``` This feature (fallback to tmpdir when your home directory is unwritable) is  little used enough and enough systems have a mktemp command that for now I'm  just going to use mktemp and disable the alternate log paths on those without it. Should someone care enough about making this work on a system without mktemp,  a patch to do something like the mkdir solution suggested above will be happily accepted in the future.
